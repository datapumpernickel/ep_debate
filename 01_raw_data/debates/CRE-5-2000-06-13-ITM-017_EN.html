In future our support will be specifically targeted on these structural objectives. Since independence the European Community has provided aid and assistance to Georgia of more than EUR 300 million in grants alone. The Commission's strategy is set out in detail in the communication on relations with the south Caucasian states of 6 June 1999 which was endorsed by the General Affairs Council in June 1999.

Now these refugees have been joined by more refugees from the crisis in Chechnya. Have you, the Commission, done anything? What you say about structural sectors and encouragement to improve the rule of law in Georgia is all well and good, but what is being done about the refugees?

We are one of the main contributors to the work concerning refugees in the whole region. When I visited the area neighbouring Chechnya a few months ago the issue of the total number of people moving around was exactly one of the problems we brought up afterwards with UNHCR, and we are in constant contact with UNHCR on this.

Furthermore, on 20 April 2000 Cuba also unilaterally cancelled a European Union troika to Cuba that was to take place at the end of April and could have provided a useful opportunity for dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">As is clearly stated in the common position of the European Union on Cuba, Europe's policy towards Cuba gives priority to a constructive dialogue. Cuba's decision to withdraw arrived at a time when discussions within the Commission and at Council level on its application had not yet been concluded. Therefore, neither the Commission nor the Council took a decision on the desirability of Cuba signing the new ACP/EU Partnership Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union's future relations with Cuba will continue to be guided, as in the past, by the common position. The European Union aims at promoting pluralist democracy and respect for human rights, as well as assisting Cuba's integration into the world economy and contributing to the improvement of the living standards of the Cuban people. Regarding Cuba's future status relating to the new ACP/EU Agreement, the Commission would like to mention that Cuba's application for observer status referred to and was granted only with respect to the negotiations for a post-Lomé Agreement which have now been completed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can relate to the question concerning the money and the kind of activity we foresee taking place in Cuba. Generally speaking, we are expecting the level of funding to continue more or less as it is, which means that the actual annual spending is expected to be around EUR 20 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now, about half of that has been ECHO-funded activities in the form of budget support in kind for the health sector in Cuba. There is no humanitarian crisis in Cuba as a basis for carrying out ongoing ECHO activity, which is the reason why we are planning to phase out the humanitarian assistance as such and at the same time enlarge the activities that relate more directly to transformation processes in Cuban society. This we have announced and we are in the process of identifying more relevant activities than those that have been carried out so far by ECHO. However, this year we are taking care to create some bridging financing in order to facilitate a gradual shift from one activity to another.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of Cuba becoming an observer to the convention in general, this is not foreseen, and in any case, Cuba has to make up its own mind what kind of relations it would like to try to establish. It is not our decision, and we have not been involved in any decision-making concerning what Cuba wants to do. This decision has been entirely their own.

<p class="contents">Globalisation of the economy is accelerating the structural transformation of European industry which is necessary to cope with the changes in competitive conditions. In some cases, however – e.g. Renault's actions in Belgium and, most recently, the conduct of ABB Alstoms Powers – it is clear that restructuring takes place with no regard for workers' fundamental right to influence decisions. This indicates not only that there are shortcomings with the common rules on information and consultation of workers but also that the European Union has a poor strategy for forestalling and handling the consequences of industrial restructuring.</p>

<p class="contents">As far as the first proposal is concerned, we are already in contact with the Federation of European Employers, so that we can promote this plan within the framework of the social agenda in all companies at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Observatory is concerned, the Commission has understood and stresses the importance of the Observatory, especially at a time of constant mergers and structural change in whole sectors of the economy. This issue has already been included in the social dialogue and we are awaiting the common position of the social partners on 15 June. I must point out that the Commission’s approach is not to proceed with yet another new structure, yet another new centre or institute, but to set up a section within the framework of existing structures, such as Dublin, Bilbao or Seville, which will deal with industrial restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards mergers and acquisitions, which generally create problems and huge job losses, we have already been in written and verbal contact with Mr Monti, the Commissioner responsible, and the Directorate-General responsible, so that the Commission can monitor application of the legislation for the Workers’ Committee to the maximum and can check if all the provisions of the law have been complied with before mergers take place and major decisions are taken.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, competition legislation in particular does not take account of these repercussions, which are unquantifiable, but we are making an effort and the Commission has been at the disposal of employees and employers alike, so that the best possible preparations can be made and we do not have thousands of people on the streets with no provision made for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me to say first of all, in connection with one of the basic aspects of the report concerning companies operating with over one thousand employees, that it is not easy for the Commission to communicate directly with industries and companies throughout Europe. These are matters governed by subsidiarity, matters for national federations of employers, which is why the dialogue is taking such a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we will be able to use some of the more important aspects of the Gyllenhammer report within the framework of the social agenda. However, I must stress, Mrs Andersson, that these measures mainly concern preparing workers or companies for major structural changes so that we can avoid job losses and major social problems. The Commission’s main task is to complete and apply the strategy for employment, the aim of which is to channel all these human resources into new jobs. In other words, how we intend to address structural unemployment and how the people hit by the impact of industrial restructuring can find new jobs in the new sectors being created which, as you know, are mainly services and the information society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, having been given a specific remit at Lisbon, the Commission is drawing up a social agenda which endeavours to take an overall approach to the problem. Social exclusion is a particularly complicated problem which cannot be addressed through education, health or social security policy or through employment strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should point out that, in the housing policy sector, any endeavour on the part of the European Commission comes, it must be said, as added value to action taken by national governments. Thus, in view of forthcoming preparations for the social exclusion programme and the social agenda, the Commission has already funded pre-preparatory action, especially in the sectors which interest you, the homeless living in railway stations, homes for the elderly, a new social housing policy and social housing. Each of these plans has been drafted by non-governmental organisations and cover all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim with the new social exclusion programme, which is orientated towards political collaboration between non-governmental organisations or between local governments, is to implement joint innovative programmes and joint studies and draw up statistics, analyses and proposals for policies which will help the Member States to learn from one another and apply more integrated policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with you, with regard to the proposals laid down in the Lisbon Summit, that maybe now is the time for you and us in Parliament to be innovative ourselves to catch the Member States on the back foot and to present them with an imaginative and innovative plan to tackle social exclusion, because we have achieved the big picture. We have achieved huge growth in employment and economic terms; we have looked at new innovative ways of creating jobs, of educating people and so on and yet still 20% of our population in Europe are lagging way behind and do not have the opportunity of benefiting from that growing economy or of having any quality of life.

Obviously, and I repeat, the housing problem is a complicated issue, it differs from one Member State to another and it depends on numerous parameters, from the employment rate to the land development policy in individual Member States and from the organised social system to social benefits; it is not therefore an issue which can be addressed by national polices.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission can play an important role here, as you said, by making innovative efforts, by supporting innovative polices and by helping the Member States to learn from each other’s experience. And that is what we intend to do in the exclusion programme, which we hope will be implemented mainly by non-governmental organisations which already have a great deal of experience in this sector and have a decisive contribution to make. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously, therefore, competitiveness alone or development alone cannot solve social problems, which are particularly complicated, given that the weakest in society cannot always reap the rewards of economic development. This is why we need a social policy in order to redistribute wealth and allow the weakest sections of society to integrate.

We have had the decisions for Agenda 2000 since Berlin 1999. It has meant tighter constraints and ceilings for budgetary spending and for that reason an adaptation has been necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">On 20 March, the Agriculture Council endorsed the Commission's approach on specific measures for savings in export funds for foodstuffs. These specific measures are designed to replace the across-the-board cuts currently in place. The Council asked the Commission to take into consideration the observations made by Member States during the debate on this approach. These observations also covered the question of spirits. As far as spirits are concerned, no withdrawal from the list of goods eligible for refunds is foreseen. The Commission's proposal provides for adaptations of the current method used to calculate the price differences between the EU and the world market in cereals used in processing spirits. The intention is to continue to promote the consumption of EU cereals as laid down in Protocol 19 to the UK Accession Act.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the procedure decided by the Council, the detailed proposal and the best way of adapting this calculation method will now be discussed in the management committees with the Member States.</p>

As far as informing the industry is concerned, details of the new calculations have already been forwarded to them.

<p class="contents">I should like to underline, however, that although this is an issue about the spirits industry in the Community as a whole, the fact is, as we all know, that by far the major exporter is the Scotch whisky industry. Commissioner Liikanen will be well aware that production, particularly of malt whisky, for export is concentrated in the peripheral parts of Scotland: in the islands and in the glens of Strathspey and in other remote parts. These parts are suffering very heavily for a variety of reasons, agriculturally and in other ways at the moment. I do not suppose that it is the intention of the Commission to make life impossible in these places but a combination of measures might well have that effect by accident.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Prospects for creating incentives for developing gas-fuelled cars</span></p>
<p class="contents">The new rules on motor vehicle exhaust gases come into force in 2006, covering hydrocarbons including methane. Gas-fuelled cars emit lower levels of most hydrocarbons, but more methane. Methane emissions from gas-fuelled cars are negligible compared with the reduction in CO2 emissions achieved by replacing petrol with natural gas (or biogas), but gas-fuelled cars will not meet the new requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission consider it appropriate to grant derogations from the rules already adopted on exhaust gases so that gas-fuelled light vehicles may continue to be sold after 2006, or does it take the view that new rules should be introduced that are adapted so that gas-fuelled cars have no greater difficulty than petrol-fuelled cars in satisfying the exhaust gas requirements (whilst of course not emitting greater quantities of the regulated substances than petrol-fuelled cars, e.g. along the lines of a principle similar to the EEV levels for heavy vehicles)?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, gas vehicles emit high levels of methane. Emissions of methane cannot be ignored in the context of the EU's climate change policy. Because of their methane emissions, gas fuelled passenger cars or light commercial vehicles seem today to have difficulty achieving 2006 emission limits for total hydrocarbons – that is methane plus non-methane hydrocarbons. Further technical developments in catalytic reduction of methane may be possible but the efficiency and cost of such catalysts are not fully known.</p>
<p class="contents">Derogations are not provided for in the European system for type approval. So in this respect the Commission would agree that further technical evaluation should be carried out to determine if an amendment to the 2006 total hydrocarbons limit is necessary, to split it into methane and non-methane components for gas vehicles. The Commission is presently studying the possible enhanced environmentally-friendly vehicle requirement for light duty vehicles to address traditional pollutants and perhaps also global warming potential. Like heavy duty vehicles the EEV concept aims at being both technology- and fuel-neutral to encourage best available technology wherever possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have today been able to witness a discussion about <span class="italic">e</span>Europe which is really one of the top initiatives of the Commission at the moment. The question of how much Community funding we can channel into this programme was discussed in preparing the draft action plan which was presented to the Council and Parliament two weeks ago. So far we have decided that the Commission will try to reallocate existing funds as far as possible to e-Europe priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, that includes particularly the Fifth Framework Programme for Research and Development, especially information science and technology programmes and TED/Telecom. They are particular actions which specifically try to strengthen the networks between research centres and regions in Europe which we want to finance from the research budget. On the other hand, with the Commissioner responsible for structural funds we have drawn the attention of the Member Countries and the regions to the fact that information projects should be given high priority in those areas. I wrote a letter with Mr Barnier to all regions of Europe on that issue. We emphasised that in the knowledge-based society, investments in the infrastructure of <span class="italic">e</span>Europe are totally essential to guarantee the growth of jobs and also to have more efficient policies of cohesion because the digital economy information society means the death of distance. So if the infrastructure is there, the importance of distance will be less.</p>
<p class="contents">Outside this issue, it is very much a question of the Member States. What we want to do there is to agree at the European level on the objectives, in particular how to connect schools, how to increase the literacy of young people because the Internet comes to homes through children. There the question is how to make this essential issue a priority for the Member States. We are trying to combine efforts at the European level and the national level so that they will reinforce each other and so that Europe can really become a fully competitive information society and, at the same time, an information society which includes everyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are a number of areas I should like to draw attention to, in addition to those of regional, research and development policy, etc that the Commissioner himself mentioned. One important area is that of educational initiatives, and it is perhaps especially important to prepare for the enlargement of the Union towards the East. This is an incredibly important question when it comes to creating solidarity in Europe, not only among the present Member States but also among the candidate States, which are otherwise at great risk of falling behind in this context. There is also, of course, the risk of rifts of this kind opening up within the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">Where Parliament is concerned, we have used our Budget guidelines in order very clearly to designate this area as being one of high priority. For this reason, I should like quite simply to put this question to the Commissioner: could we set up a very specific dialogue between the Commission and Parliament so as to try to come up with these resources no later than in next year’s budget? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission’s view was a three-stage plan of operation. Firstly, we made a recommendation regarding a procedure to be followed in order to differentiate between subscriber lines. Secondly, using the tools of competition policy, we shall investigate abuse of a dominant position in local networks. Thirdly, we said that subscriber line differentiation will be a part of the new legislation. At present, we are putting together a package on the new legislation. The issue currently being considered is whether subscriber line differentiation could be introduced separately alongside the package and a prompt reading requested for it. It always takes time to debate a whole package of measures of this size. We could perhaps adopt a faster procedure when debating special matters. The Commission has not yet taken a decision, but serious consideration is being given to such a procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We recognise that the competitiveness of the European defence industry is vital to our political and economic interests and also an additional element in the credibility of the European security and defence policy. In addition, we must remember that the defence industry acts as a catalyst for growth and innovation in other industries, ranging from the high-tech, such as aerospace and information technology, to the more traditional industries, such as steel and shipbuilding. The Commission's task is to promote the defence industry's competitiveness through exercising its competencies for policies such as the single market and external trade.</p>
<p class="contents">In December 1997, the Commission launched its work in this field by adopting a communication entitled "Implementing European strategy in the field of defence-related industries". This document presented a 14-point action plan and at the same time encouraged the Council to adopt a common position on a European armaments policy. However, we have not so far been able to make as much progress in implementing this strategy as we had hoped. That is why at the moment the Commission is reflecting on how to revitalise this process in order to identify the immediate priorities for the Commission action to match the recent political and industrial progress. This will allow us to assess the merits of a follow-up communication, refining and updating the earlier plan in order to take account of new subjects in the light of the recent changes and at the same time to accelerate some key measures presented in the 1997 paper. I went through this 14-point action plan and I can really say that many of them are as typical today as they were in 1997. Moreover, a number of important topics that were addressed only partially or not at all in the early action plan now deserve more attention. These include security of supply, the offset practices in defence sales and also the treatment of intellectual property rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the last Commission this was a priority, it was an agenda being driven forward by Commissioner Bangemann, supported by Commissioner van den Broek. Do I get the impression that this Commission has really lost interest in pursuing this initiative and that the Commission as a whole would prefer not to take this forward? It seems to me ironic, at a time when we are reconsidering our defence capacity, that we seem to have lost impetus on the restructuring of the defence industry.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, is the Commission, despite its role as guardian of the Treaty, afraid to take on Member State governments over Article 296 in order to enforce the fact that many defence items should be subject to the single market?

These are the parties with legal competence to do so, pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wishes to inform the honourable Member that, on the occasion of an informal meeting of Ministers for Sport, on 10 May in Lisbon, a number of delegations indicated that they were in favour of including sport in the Treaties establishing the European Community, while others were opposed to the idea. There is a lack of agreement between Member States, even among Sports Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would nonetheless like to inform you of the comments made by Mr Lionel Jospin, the French Prime Minister, when making a governmental statement on the objectives of the forthcoming French Presidency. Before the French National Assembly, he mentioned a statement which might be adopted at the European Council in Nice in order to assert the special nature and social role of sport within Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission has taken note of the declarations by sports organisations requesting some reference to sport in the Treaty. The Commission has also noted that these requests differ as to the nature of the precise reference, in the sports world too, and we have acknowledged the autonomy of sports federations. There is a lack of agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Lacking a legal basis, it is clearly not possible to assign a specific budget line for sport. On the other hand, the Commission is aware of the role played by sports organisations on the European social scene. This is why many Community programmes are open for such organisations to take part. In my own area of activity, for example, I can tell you that the relationship between Youth and Sport will be one of the areas focussed on in the forthcoming national and European youth conferences which are being held now in Member States and which, during the French Presidency, will be held in Paris.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, next year, sport will be a priority objective in the Youth Programme. I know that one of the themes adopted in the new Community Action Programme against discrimination is the elimination of obstacles due to discrimination impeding access to sport. Even without a legal basis, then, we have continued to concern ourselves with sport and to invest in sport, which is an element of society with a very important social role. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have a tradition with the Treaty of Amsterdam of using protocols to protect specific characteristics. We could perhaps look at the potential of a protocol to protect the specific characteristic of sport in Europe. There are many areas now where we have legal challenges, as you rightly know, in the sport domain, particularly in the commercial sector. We could have a protocol that would allow us to give a political direction to authorities to take proper account of the specific nature and structure of sport in Europe. Would you be prepared to back such a protocol and do you see a way for us to try and protect the specific nature of sport without, as Mrs Zabell asked, having a particular legal competence? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall ensure that answers to written questions are more complete in future.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the legal basis is concerned, obviously, since sport is not included as such in the Treaty, the Treaty must be interpreted rather broadly in order to find some legal basis. Let me give you a concrete example. In order to initiate a Community action in the context of the anti-doping campaign, we used <span class="italic">inter alia</span> the basis of texts relating to health, but there, too, the Member states, on the initiative of Sports Ministers, formed a committee to look into the best legal basis for the Commission’s anti-doping campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards sport as a social activity, the Sports Ministers also set up a working party to investigate how they could reach agreement among themselves, because they do not necessarily always agree: there are some Member States that wish to promote sport, and others that do not wish to get involved, for reasons of subsidiarity. We set up the working party among Sports Ministers in order to reconcile these conflicting points of view, because what we all want, in the end, is to restore the credibility of sport, to prioritise the idea of fair play, to allow young people to receive training in sport and, above all, to prevent abuses such as the sale of children, and damaging their health and bodies in sport, not to mention the economic abuses. This, then, is a problem which, as you can see, we are tackling unremittingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, you have to be aware that the Member States must agree unanimously in order to introduce even a protocol, and that this is even truer in the case of an amendment to the Treaty. If you wish to achieve something, then you must lobby your own governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is obvious that an assessment can only be made once some progress has been made in the projects. So please allow me a little time, until autumn, before making an initial assessment of the progress made in the projects.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socrates, Leonardo and Youth for Europe programmes have taken account of the objectives of the Connect initiative, i.e. stepping up liaison and synergy between the fields of education, training, culture and innovation, with the involvement of new technologies, through their joint actions. As part of these three programmes, the Commission has provided for the possibility of financing projects in the above fields in order to encourage and strengthen synergy. The Commission therefore considers it too early in the day to plan the renewal of the Connect initiative for 2002 before we have checked the results.</p>
<p class="contents">So, let us give it some time and let the projects develop. At the opportune moment, during autumn, we shall then consider the best plan of action in view of the experience gained. Furthermore, the implementation of joint actions in 2001 will demonstrate promoters’ interest in submitting projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission intends to make the most of the results and to disseminate them within the Member States. In March 2000, the Commission therefore held an initial meeting with the project coordinators, which provided practical information on the projects as well as establishing contact between the coordinators in their respective areas of operation, since this too is extremely significant for future developments. </p>
<p class="contents">We do not want people working individually in their own exclusive areas, we want networks to be set up between coordinators, so that there will be follow-up. We have already taken part in several European meetings organised by the coordinators to provide better guidelines for the projects. The fact is, it is all well and good to draw up the initial plan for a project but, once it is underway, it often becomes clear that it must be redirected. At that point, we redirect it if necessary, follow it up and assist in disseminating the contents of the project.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission envisaged holding two other meetings in the near future in order to be able to monitor that the projects were being conducted properly, and to promote the implementation of the projects in national educational and cultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, thanks to the scheduled interim reports which have been requested from the coordinators, we shall then be able to carry out an overall assessment in the autumn and to inform Parliament of the results of these initiatives and of any follow-up which may be required. You may rest assured that Parliament will be consulted in deciding the nature of this follow-up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question was: does the Commission intend to redefine the audiovisual sector in Community policies so as to include radio? Does it propose to carry out a detailed study of the radio-broadcasting sector in Europe and, if so, when? Does it consider it expedient to create an appropriate statutory framework and how does digital technology fit into the picture? The honourable Member knows very well that the Commission welcomes the discussions held on 24 May 2000 because they confirmed the public support that radio enjoys. We all know how popular local radio stations are in our Member States and so it is important to consolidate radio.</p>
<p class="contents">The meeting also helped to demonstrate that there is no confusion about the definition of the audiovisual sector and that radio has always been an integral and important part of the audiovisual scene, both culturally and financially. But at the same conference, expert opinion indicated that a possible market failure may manifest itself in the period 2010 to 2015; and it is precisely this timescale which makes the approach of technological neutrality, which I have proposed to the Commission, the most appropriate one. Given the rate at which technologies develop, we foresee that TV will enter the digital age first, followed only afterwards by radio. The MEDIA PLUS programme is not intended to reduce commercial risk related to the introduction of digital technology in any sector, including the TV sector, and that is why MEDIA PLUS is totally unadapted to radio broadcasting.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whether or not MEDIA PLUS also covers commercial risks is indeed an issue. Of course, its justification is that it is supporting television so that it can introduce the new, digital technology. The question is: why have you not found a way to support radio? I tabled a question on a previous occasion to which you replied that radio probably has no problem. However, at the public hearing which we held, all the interested parties stated that there is a problem. And it is precisely the problem which you mentioned, i.e. that it is difficult for radio to introduce digital technology when it has no specific audience to address. So there is a problem here. It is not a question of commercial risk, it is a question of helping the whole sector to convert to the new technology. Consequently, the question remains. Do you intend to do anything, if not under MEDIA PLUS, then somewhere else, under some other programme, or are you leaving it until later, until you have seen how television does? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is aid for the distribution of European films beyond national frontiers.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a problem that arises for radio which, generally speaking, is not transnational and therefore has no European dimension. The problem which radio is probably going to face by 2010-2015, if you listen to the experts, is to do with the technological transition and infrastructure. Many details in connection with this have not yet been clarified, for example, the reallocation of radio frequencies. Would it be possible to reduce prices? Member States have not yet agreed what course to adopt, whether it be one involving terrestrial or satellite systems.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, there are still a great many problems to be solved at Member State level. I do not rule out the possibility that one day we may realise the need for a technological directive and for industrial aid in the transition to digital. For the moment, however, we have not yet decided on this together with the Member States because we are still a very long way off and there are still preliminary matters to be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me reiterate, however, Mr Papayannakis, that even for the transition to digital in the television sector, the only aid allocated is for training workers in the sector in digital technology, but this is very marginal: of the EUR 400 million allocated, only 50 million, and then only a small part of this 50 million. Otherwise, MEDIA PLUS focuses on the promotion and distribution of European films, particularly in cinemas. In this way, even then, the television aspect is not greatly affected.</p>
<p class="contents">If you have firm convictions and you want to make further arrangements for television and radio, then we should have to discuss this among ourselves and I should also have to discuss it with the Member States in order to determine whether there is a need for legislation on the subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
