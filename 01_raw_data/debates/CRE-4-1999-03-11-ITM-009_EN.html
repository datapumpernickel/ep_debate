<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" width="16"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="buttondocwin"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><a href="#top" title="Top"><img src="/doceo/data/img/navi_top.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0" alt="" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></table>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Añoveros Trias de Bes </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr President, legislation has been adopted in all areas of industrial property in the European Union except in the case of utility models. The fact that utility models exist allows small technical advances that aid the human race to also benefit their creators, even though the level of invention does not warrant as much protection as under a patent. The utility model is especially useful for both individual inventors and for small undertakings. What is more, the existence of an instrument providing an alternative for minor inventions means that the level of invention required can be interpreted more strictly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has opted for harmonisation and has put forward a proposal for a directive that valiantly tackles the delicate task of approximating twelve laws with many different points and introducing legislation in three countries that do not have this system. This proposal adopts three of the classic requirements in the protection of inventions: novelty, level of invention and industrial advantage. However, the requirement that utility models must include a practical or technical advantage has been overlooked, despite this being an essential and inevitable part of their nature. This requirement clarifies the distinction between the utility model and the design or trademark with a view to preventing those who might infringe the utility model from sidestepping protection by means of superficial alterations to the designs that would enable them to copy technical innovations from its component parts.</p>
<p class="contents">We propose defining the utility model by reference to a structure, a mechanism or a configuration. This means that the inventor only has to put forward a structure which has an industrial advantage, using a quick and simple procedure with minimum legal certainty. This would also mean excluding substances and processes from protection, as the Economic and Social Committee has also proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">The lower level of legal certainty offered by the utility model compared to the patent is the price that has to be paid for the speed and lower cost of the utility model. In our report, we suggest a series of measures to add to the Commission"s proposal in order to improve the degree of legal certainty of the model without harming the speed and lower cost of obtaining this instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures I propose are mainly contained in the amendments. And naturally, they go along the lines that, although the level of invention or the creative input is not the same as for a patent, a mere declaration of the level of invention from the applicant will not suffice. Therefore, as a first step, we propose that the definition from the European Patents Convention be adopted but in a less strict form than required by the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Another measure is to introduce the opposition procedure to swiftly settle disputes concerning utility models. We should also promote those involved to draw up a search report, which is compulsory in the event of legal proceedings being undertaken. We must improve protection conditions and use them for reference. Further, as a last step, we believe that there should be an additional ground for revocation where the proprietor of the utility model was not entitled to obtain it. This new ground revokes the registration and not the invention itself, which is valid and can be protected if the inventor or his successor submits the applications.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Commissioner, in spite of my aim to add these measures, I agree with the Commission on many fundamental aspects. We believe that a lower level of invention should be required in comparison to patents and that no formal verification of the substantive requirements should be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">We have readily accepted the amendments by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs but I must also say – as I see my colleague Mrs Oddy is here – that I rejected her amendments, Amendments Nos 34 and 35, in committee. However, they have now also been tabled by another colleague, Mrs Thors, and having studied them in detail, I intend to accept them.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to point out that the duration of a utility model is shorter than that of a patent. We agree with a maximum protection period of ten years, which is the same as most countries. As a result, we propose that no renewal should be granted – if requested by the search report – as a deterrent against an excessive duration and, at the same time, as a way of strengthening legal certainty and improving information.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Medina Ortega </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, at this time of night we are not here to debate complex issues but I should like to begin at the end. And I am doing so because the rapporteur has now generously accepted the amendments that were tabled by Mrs Oddy, who is one of my colleagues in the Socialist Group and a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights and that are now tabled by the Liberal Members, Mrs Thors and Mrs Riis‐Jørgensen. These two amendments refer to games and toys and it is a shame that the visitors who were here earlier have left because this affects them directly.</p>
<p class="contents">I say this as I believe that perhaps one of the innovations Parliament could introduce is to also allow games to be utility models and to be protected. And I am disappointed that our visitors left – I think the President frightened them somewhat – as they would probably be able to help us and submit a utility model. Perhaps, in doing so, they could use the method the rapporteur is now proposing, although we will naturally have to find out what the Commission intends to do in this respect. We have to find out what one‐stop shopping is; it is a term we are used to in Spain but for different reasons. Here, we are talking about a different sort of one‐stop shopping, but the idea is that if someone submits a utility model in an EU country, then this model should be recognised throughout the entire Community. In this respect, the rapporteur is attempting to go slightly further than normal legislative work, because the Commission"s Green Paper only talked of three stages: firstly, harmonisation; then mutual recognition by the Member States; and lastly, regulations. We still have not reached the stage of a uniform Community regulation but we could take another small step towards this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be very interesting to know what the Commission thinks of this. I should like to ask Commissioner Monti if he believes that, in the short term and on the basis of the proposals Parliament is making here, the Commission could establish this one‐stop shopping procedure in such a way so as to ensure that if an inventive young person discovers an interesting toy, he can go to one EU country alone and, using this one‐stop shopping procedure, be assured that his game will be recognised throughout the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague, Mr Añoveros Trias de Bes, is a colleague in two senses of the word: both as a Member of this House and as a professor of international law. And it is clear that he has done some extraordinary work and that this is an excellent analytical and well researched report. At an academic symposium, I would probably argue with him over a few points, because there will always be reasons for disagreement, but I believe that he has done some exceptional analytical work. For example, he has paid great attention to the definition of invention, and what invention involves. This is an issue that could lead to a lengthy discussion, as could the definition of the utility model based on a structure or configuration but not on a substance or specific procedure. However, at this time of night, these issues are probably of little interest to the Members and I only wish to say that the Socialist Group supports the amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights as well as the two amendments tabled by the Liberal Group.</p>

Given that these various certificates exist, it was indeed right to try to harmonise them. We are therefore entirely in favour of the harmonisation of the legal provisions involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur"s proposal is of a very high standard, as is always the case with Mr Ańoveros. Nevertheless, I have certain questions surrounding what seem to be inaccuracies. One example of this is Amendment No 10, which proposes a definition of invention that we believe to be somewhat broad and imprecise. Also, the procedures for the one‐stop shop should perhaps be clarified. Is it a solely declarative procedure? On what elements is mutual recognition based? What linguistic rules will be applied?</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur envisages a 50 % reduction in taxes for SMEs, individuals and universities. This is a very good measure, as the utility model must be economical, especially for SMEs. I think that it would be particularly beneficial if all the taxes were so low that there was no need to reduce them.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oddy </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteur on his work. This proposed directive introduces the right to register a utility model. This is a less‐developed right than that which would qualify for a patent. This right does not currently exist in all Member States. For example, in the United Kingdom – my own country – this concept does not exist and consequently inventors can only register patents. To register a patent, more research is needed, and higher standards of development.</p>
<p class="contents">The advantage of registering a utility model, as opposed to a patent, is that it is a quicker, cheaper and more simple procedure. It is therefore to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the rapporteur for accepting my amendment, tabled in committee, and now taken up by Mrs Thors, as this will assist the European toy industry and will be of great interest for Europe's younger citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I have received some letters of concern from interested parties that the Commission proposal, as drafted, is a little too lax. The rapporteur has addressed these concerns by introducing requirements for searches before litigation and before the life of the utility model can be extended beyond six years. I support these proposals and again thank the rapporteur for his diligent work.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (IT)</span> I must congratulate Mr Añoveros Trias de Bes on the quality of his report. I welcome the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizen's Rights has not queried the Commission approach to this dossier and that the features of utility models, as set out in the proposal for a directive, have been retained. These are: an inventive step lesser than required for trade marks, no preliminary examination of the conditions of merit, and a period of protection limited to ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Legal Affairs has adopted 33 amendments, and the Commission is able to accept 24 of them, but five of that number in part only. We in fact think that these amendments clarify and better define some aspects of the proposal. I am referring more particularly here to Amendments Nos 4 and 33, which provide for the directive to be monitored by the Commission. That will allow us to assess the practical operation of the directive and to fill in any gaps three years after the directive has been incorporated by the Member States. The Commission cannot, however, accept nine amendments, including Amendments Nos 1, 6 in part and 13 concerning the introduction of a one‐stop shopping procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I well understand what motivates these amendments, but introducing a procedure of that nature goes beyond the objective of this proposal for a directive, which is to align the national provisions on utility models which have a more direct impact on the operation of the single market. Moreover, that sort of procedure would raise a number of problems at a legal and a practical level without resolving the problems of transfer, but would not appear to respond to any of the needs voiced by the relevant economic groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 18, which provides for the introduction of an opposition procedure, also goes beyond the limits of the kind of harmonisation the directive is meant to achieve. This is a procedural issue that must be left to the assessment of the Member States, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. Moreover, no such proposal has ever been tabled in the discussions of the groups of experts in the Council. However, Mr Medina Ortega, as in the case of the earlier amendments, the possibility of introducing an opposition procedure could be considered as part of the monitoring provided for in the directive itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments also raise problems: I am referring here to parts of Amendments Nos 2, 6 and 8 and the whole of Amendments Nos 23 and 24 which relate, directly or indirectly, to the scope of the directive. These amendments are designed to exclude substances and processes from the scope of the directive. I would draw your attention to the fact that excluding substances and processes from protection by utility model harks back to a now outdated view. The consultation set under way with the 1995 Green Paper showed that most of the groups concerned were in favour of including substances and processes. The three‐dimensional requirement, which therefore excludes protection of substances and processes, is a step backwards in Member States' legislation. Currently, only four Member States regard three‐dimensional format as a condition of obtaining protection by utility model. For those reasons, the Commission is unable to take on board these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can we accept Amendment No 12, which provides for a reduction in fees for small and medium‐sized enterprises. I absolutely appreciate the concerns reflected in that amendment, but a provision of that nature cannot be included in a harmonising directive, as it would have financial implications for the Member States disproportionate to the aim of the directive. It might be possible to introduce a recital mirroring the concept which underpins that amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other amendments which the Commission is unable to accept: Amendment No 15 which provides, in addition to control <span class="italic">a posteriori</span> , control <span class="italic">a priori</span> of the exemptions, cannot be accepted because it calls into question the fact that there is no formal examination of the conditions of protection; nor can we accept part of Amendments Nos 6 and 10 or the whole of Amendment No 16, which put forward practical or technical advantage as an additional condition for obtaining protection. That would introduce a new requirement, whereas technical or practical advantage must be considered as simply justifying inventive activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor are we able to accept Amendment No 30, which provides that applications for utility models are invalid if the owner was not entitled to the utility model, since the invention could no longer be considered to be new; rather than making it invalid, it would be appropriate to make provision, in cases of that kind, for the right to be transferred to the genuine inventor.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to end by mentioning the amendments tabled during this part‐session: the Commission can, in principle, accept Amendments Nos 34 and 35, both of which are designed to allow full and equal legal protection for games and toys by utility models: in particular, by deleting the word ‘game" in Article 3(2)(c), Amendment No 34 will place games and toys on an equal footing for the purposes of protection by utility model; Amendment No 35 reflects the same need in its Article 6 which relates to the criteria for defining inventive activity. But Amendment No 35, although, as I have said, acceptable in principle, needs to be worded differently in the Commission"s view.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, Mr President, that if, as we had all hoped, our young Europeans had waited until now, they might perhaps have understood that we were discussing games and toys, albeit, I regret to say, in rather complicated technical terms.</p>
