We naturally support the calls to respect democratic rights and freedoms in these two countries and we condemn the executions that continue to take place in Tajikistan. It should however be emphasised that the Kazakh regime’s failure to respect human rights, which the European Parliament is preparing to condemn, does not bother the large oil trusts at all. These trusts are fighting it out with billions of dollars – 13 million, more than in Russia – for the Kazakh energy reserves, which are considerable. Nor does it bother the building groups, including Bouygues, which have made considerable amounts of money thanks to the construction of the new capital, Astana.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that these trusts, among the main pillars of capitalism in the so-called democratic Western countries, are also the pillars of dictatorships, both in Central Asia, the Middle East, or elsewhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maat (PPE-DE). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, it is with a certain regret that we are again debating Kazakhstan, all the more because it is a fantastic country with fantastic inhabitants and perhaps even wonderful opportunities if you consider its economy and the fact that a fledgling democracy has been built up. That does, however, give us in the European Union a responsibility, in our cooperation with Kazakhstan, to talk about each other’s position as good friends, and that is what is now a cause for concern. Our point of concern is about the development of democracy and the further curtailment of the freedom of the press. I will quote you the example of Sergei Duvanov, a journalist who was arrested after he had published some critical articles; he was also accused of an indecency offence on pretty dubious grounds and was not given a proper public trial. There are therefore quite a few examples of intimidation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important point is that it is, in fact, becoming increasingly difficult to form political parties and to set up social organisations there, as ever more stringent requirements are being imposed and what is gradually happening is that these organisations are only being allowed to exist if they can demonstrate that they really have tens of thousands of members in each region. This does not promote the development of a democratic constitutional state. In view of the cooperation agreements we have signed, we, the European Union, are partly responsible for our relations with Kazakhstan. That point in particular causes us concern, but it also makes us more responsible for the implementation of the agreements and for Kazakhstan's continued development. For this reason I am asking the Commission and the Council very explicitly to pay attention to the situation on the basis of these cooperation agreements and to contact President Nazarbayev and the government in Kazakhstan with a view to finding a way, as a true friend, of improving the development of democracy and of paying more attention to human rights. True friends tell each other the truth; we must be able to do this in this relationship. I hope that the Commission and the Council do in fact intend to play this role on the basis of the treaties we have signed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although it is true that certain regions of the world are attracting the attention of the European Union, this vast, fragile sub-continent, currently in transition, torn between Russia and China, all too often escapes our vigilance and our requirements. These countries are far from the eyes of the Union, and therefore far from its control. The signals coming from Kazakhstan, however, are more reminiscent of a return to Soviet methods than of a transition towards the rule of law, democracy and a system that respects human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">How else can we interpret these cases of intimidation and persecution of journalists and the opposition? What is the historical precedent for these fixed or arbitrary trials suffered recently by people such as Mrs Petrushova, Mr Abbyazov and Mr Zhakiyanov? Does the fact that these phenomena are increasingly common not imply a return to the previous authoritarian regime rather than the inevitable ups and downs of a transition towards democracy?</p>
<p class="contents">More than a decade after the collapse of the USSR, these kinds of misadventures and alibis cannot be tolerated. Although there are still reservations regarding the European Union’s vigilance with regard to these Central Asian republics over the past few years, the Union must now show genuine firmness in order to promote its principles and its values in this region of the world. Tomorrow, certain former Soviet republics will join our Union. Today, already, the Union is concentrating a key economic and industrial force in Europe and the world. It must use this as a political lever to demolish the non-democratic regimes of these third countries that are so eager to obtain Community investment.</p>
<p class="contents">We clearly have ways of putting pressure on Kazakhstan, on the countries in this region of Central Asia which, at a time of globalisation and the enlargement of the European Union, are no longer, and must no longer, be outside our horizons. We have the power, and it is our duty, to bring the current situation in Kazakhstan into conformity with the international treaties and agreements and in particular with the partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Union and Kazakhstan.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to plead the case of the Kazakh journalist Serguei Duvanov to this institution, as was the case here for Professor Baudajevski of Belarus or Mr Chbih Ould Cheikh Malainine of Mauritania. I would like the European Union to assess political and human rights developments in Kazakhstan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is entirely justified, as the Stichting Friedensstimme Nederland even mentions an unfortunate trend that has been ongoing for the past eighteen months. Insiders describe the increasing aggression on the part of the government and politicians, which goes hand in hand with disruptions of Christian acts of worship, as being reminiscent of the victimisation during the Communist era.</p>
<p class="contents">Two non-registered Baptist communities were attacked at the beginning of this month. On Saturday 1 February police brutally raided a prayer centre in the municipality of Yevgenyevka in the north-east of Kazakhstan. Confiscations and destruction followed, with even the pastor’s personal possessions being seized, even though Kazakhstan’s constitution does not explicitly prohibit non-registered religious groupings, and this is not even to mention the underhand official fine imposed on the same community last year.</p>
<p class="contents">One day later, on Sunday 2 February, a police officer accompanied by a colleague and two drunken ‘witnesses’ disrupted the morning service of the non-registered Baptist community in Leninogorsk.</p>

I was expecting it to start at 4.30 p.m.</p>
<p class="contents">I had the opportunity to visit Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan briefly with the Central Asian Delegation at the end of September and the beginning of October 2002. I have to say that all the signs are that there is a danger of Kazakhstan slipping into authoritarianism. There is increasing intimidation and persecution of the press. The case of Mr Duvanov, sentenced to three and a half years in jail is well known and has been mentioned. The case of Irina Petrushova with Respublika weekly, sentenced to one and a half years in jail is another example. And there is a series of new criminal cases.</p>
<p class="contents">A new law on the creation of opposition parties requires 50 000 citizens' signatures before they can be registered. Many of our parties in the European Union would not be able to register that level of support! Of course, there is the increasing pressure on the opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">We still have problems with regard to legislation, particularly the fact that the crime and the practice of torture still exist and there is no clear definition of what torture is. Clearly, we want a dialogue in Kazakhstan between the government and the opposition; we want them to respect international law. In the meantime, we ask the Council and Commission to raise these questions firmly at the next meeting between the Council, the Commission and the government of Kazakhstan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am still vice-president, Mr Di Pietro is still president and Mr Koukiadis is still vice-president as well. Mr Mussa very kindly stood in for us at a meeting yesterday. We welcome the genuine dialogue that we have with the Kazakh Government, parliament, the opposition and the wider community.</p>
<p class="contents">Kazakhstan is travelling the road from a Soviet republic to an independent and democratic state. Our task is to help keep them firmly on that road. They have our sympathy and support in tackling the many problems they face: pollutants, locusts and AIDS, to name but three. We understand how far Kazakhstan has already travelled towards democracy and human rights. They understand our need to air concerns when they arise and when they are brought to us. To some extent, the tabling of this motion has already brought some answers. The ombudsman system, for example, could be expanded. Perhaps the European Union could help them do just that. But at least it is the first ombudsman system in a CIS country.</p>
<p class="contents">Religious minorities were targeted by the government, but I am pleased to hear now that has been vetoed by the president. Mr Duvanov's trial was closed to the public. That is not entirely satisfactory. The US and Dutch embassies may have been represented but why were not the Kazakh human rights groups? The Council of Opposition Parties has now been established, although one of the main opposition parties is not represented on it. We need to know more about the 19 January presidential law that was brought in on political parties. It inhibits the ability of some opposition movements to operate legally in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Kazakhstan must not slip on its road. We are watching, listening and supporting. The concerns that we have in this motion for a resolution need to be tabled. We need to ask Parliament's Central Asian Delegation to put these on our agenda for the PCA discussions we shall shortly be having with the representatives of Kazakhstan, and then report back to Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, over the past years, democratic conditions in most of the countries of Central Asia have deteriorated. However, the Commission understands why the focus of Parliament’s attention in this debate is on Kazakhstan.</p>
<p class="contents">Once considered one of the ‘hopefuls’ in the region, the past two years have seen a crackdown on political opposition and critical media. Especially hard hit were those who had the courage to criticise corruption at the highest level, involving the President and his family. The Commission agrees that the court cases on corruption charges against Mr Ablyazov and Mr Zhakianov, the two leaders of the opposition movement Democratic Choice for Kazakhstan, had every appearance of being politically motivated. The Commission has furthermore viewed with great concern the campaign of intimidation that has been going on against a great number of critical media in Kazakhstan. This has included the firebombing of offices, the vandalising of transmitter equipment with a machine gun, a decapitated dog nailed to a newspaper office door and physical attacks against individual journalists. The perpetrators of these crimes have never been apprehended, and many cases have simply been closed. A number of newspapers, furthermore, have been subject to judicial proceedings, endless tax and safety inspector visits and heavy fines, in a number of cases resulting in closure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also agrees that the recent court case against Mr Duvanov on rape charges was marred by grave irregularities. We therefore strongly believe that the trial should be reviewed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is against this background that President Nazarbaev’s recent statements that Kazakhstan will seek its own pace of democratisation – to be achieved by 2030 – and that western standards should not be automatically applied to Kazakhstan, are to be met with due caution. President Prodi underlined our deep concern over Kazakhstan’s recent democratic record during the President’s visit to Brussels on 29 November 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it is important to take a number of positive developments in Kazakhstan into consideration as well. Prisons have been transferred from the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry of Justice, and we hope that pre-trial detention facilities will soon follow. A law on the humanisation of prison conditions has been passed and a serious effort seems to be being made to implement prison reform. Kazakhstan, as well as other countries in Central Asia, has also established the post of Human Rights Ombudsman, although much remains to be done in terms of strengthening their mandates and facilities. A 'Standing Council' for further democratisation and development in civil society was approved by Presidential Decree on 29 December 2002. It is to be hoped that its recommendations, for example those on the Law on Political Parties, will be followed up.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission notes that Parliament’s resolution focuses on Kazakhstan only. The Commission believes, however, that the matter of human rights in Kazakhstan is to be viewed in its regional context. It cannot be denied that there has been a crackdown on non-governmental media and opposition in Kazakhstan. But the Commission does not believe that the state of democracy and human rights in Kazakhstan – nor, for that matter, in Kyrgyzstan or Tajikistan – is beyond repair. We believe that the EU can continue to have an impact on democratic conditions in these countries through critical but constructive dialogue under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">We have deeper concerns regarding Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, on which Parliament’s resolution remains silent. Uzbekistan has no independent press, whereas Turkmenistan has no press at all worthy of the name. Opposition parties do not exist in these two countries. Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have been under the close scrutiny of human rights watchdogs for some time now because of the deterioration in democratic conditions. This scrutiny has certainly been justified. But let us not forget that in Uzbekistan, and certainly in Turkmenistan, for years there has been no democracy at all left to deteriorate. In these countries, any opposition activist, critical journalist or simply any Muslim practising his belief, risks ending up in a torture chamber, a penal colony or on death row on charges of terrorism, religious extremism or an attempt on the life of the President.</p>
<p class="contents">Opposition and civil society in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and, to an extent, Tajikistan, are under pressure, but this has, at least so far, not made them less resilient or vocal. Through constructive dialogue and targeted support, the EU can still make a difference in these countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
