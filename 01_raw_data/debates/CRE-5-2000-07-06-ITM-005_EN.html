Thousands of female workers in various countries in the Union have benefited from it, but it is now out of date. It is out of date because the 1952 ILO convention has just been revised and there is an expectation that most countries in the world will substantially improve their maternity protection. It was and still is, of course, hoped that the Union will continue to be in the vanguard in social terms, in this area as in others. </p>
<p class="contents">But not everything is out of date, because in terms of organisation of work, there have been shortcomings in transposing the directive and even greater shortcomings in implementing it. In most countries, the three stages of job organisation are not being respected. These stages are: the employer should adjust the working conditions and/or hours of the worker to avoid exposure to risk; if that fails, the worker should be moved to another job; only if neither option is possible should the worker be granted leave, as this reduces the worker’s income and also her career opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of example, I must tell you that in some countries, not even a minimum period of recuperation is allowed for the mother, which the experts say should be around 45 days for a normal birth for a woman working in a normal job. Nevertheless, there are countries that are not complying with these rules at all, on the pretext that they are guaranteeing women a choice. We think that women must be guaranteed the option of enjoying an appropriate period of maternity leave, which they can share with the father, but that the leave should be assessed and guaranteed according to the risk to her own health.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, this directive does not provide for a link between its own risk assessment provisions and other directives, particularly the framework directive on risk assessment and information for workers. Since there is no such link, employment of women is subject to unfair criticism because the costs of maternity-related risks apply exclusively to young women of childbearing age. These risks are being underestimated and should not be a matter for the employer or constitute an obligation on the employer only when the woman’s doctor informs the employer of her condition. Firstly, because this is too late: risks from radiation, chemically-charged atmospheres and poor working posture are well known now and all have harmful consequences for the health of the woman and her baby, particularly in the first few weeks. Secondly, these measures do nothing to protect the reproductive health of men and women. There is a considerable degree of infertility in the Union today: over 11% of European couples suffer from such problems, which result from lifestyles shaped by the economic structures within which we live, and also by the fact that measures are not in place to provide protection against these dangers. An example of this is the extreme temperatures that cause infertility in women and men. The Union, which is today in a position to do so, should draw up and implement legislation to this end. With regard to maternity leave, we are aware of the costs to economic activity of proposals to extend this leave. We also know that these costs are much higher when employing women, but health specialists recommend that a baby should remain at home for at least five months, protected from the outside world and, above all, growing up in a suitable psychological and emotional environment, which will provide it with the necessary balance for growing up with a sense of security, because it needs its parents. Parental leave should therefore be extended, and, if healthily divided between the parents, will benefit them both.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive should also take the informal economy and atypical employment contracts into consideration. Finally, I hope that the Commission will tell us what it is intending to do in this area, now that it has an extended legal basis, which includes Article 13 and ex Article 118. This means that it can certainly cover other aspects mentioned in the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is most important to everyone to improve the health and safety protection at the workplace for women who are pregnant, have recently given birth or are breastfeeding, both to protect the woman and to protect the unborn child. This is a general social issue and must be treated with the greatest care.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s report on the 1992 directive is only concerned with the technical transposition of the directive and does not look at the situation at the workplace, which has to some extent changed, or at the changed role of women in society. The number of single parents has risen and women are more concerned with achieving economic independence. The Commission must submit a proposal for revision of the directive that takes account of all these changes, and it must do so as quickly as possible, this very year. There is a considerable need to improve the legislation. That applies to preventive health protection measures at the workplace for the mother and for the unborn child. Here we must avoid any risks. Any activity that puts their health at risk should without exception be prohibited. Periods allowed for breastfeeding should be regulated and there should be facilities for breastfeeding at the workplace. Maternity leave after the birth of the child should be at least eight weeks. There must be clear rules on financial support, both for the period of pregnancy leave and for maternity leave. The question of reinstatement also needs to be clarified. None of these necessary provisions must lead to discrimination against women or to a reduction of their chances of access to the workplace.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I well remember its genesis and the problems that were discussed at the time. A positive aspect is that at that time, irrespective of the dispute about the legal basis, its importance to women workers in the single market was recognised and a first step was taken towards establishing minimum standards for the protection of pregnant workers and new mothers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission report before us continues to show up weaknesses in the implementation of the directive, which means we must increase our efforts to establish the protection of women during a special period of their life in law and in practice. Really it is very sad for a society to find we have to pay much greater attention to this area in particular. So I support the call to revise the directive as soon as possible. However, we will not manage it by the end of the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the demands that will have to be incorporated in a proposal for a revision of the directive are set out in the draft amendments before us, and the PPE Group can therefore support at least some of them. First and foremost, they include the call for a strict prohibition on dismissal during pregnancy and maternity leave, safeguards to ensure that on expiry of their leave the women will be reinstated in their job or given a comparable one and effective penalties for those who infringe that prohibition. For women who want to or have to reconcile working life and motherhood, anything else would mean penalising or unjustifiably discriminating against them in their occupational and private life.</p>
<p class="contents">Seen in these terms, the effective protection of pregnant workers and new mothers is one of the most important contributions to an active family policy. With a view to eastward enlargement and protection in those countries, let me also point out that the single market must not lead to discrimination against pregnant women and new mothers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an extremely sensitive issue which is closely related to other matters which are regularly referred to such as the ageing population, the demographic trend, the low birth rate, the right to health, the right to work, the right to motherhood and the social value of motherhood. This matter cannot be viewed as affecting women alone: they must be protected and supported by society.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1992 directive, whose implementation in the Member States we are assessing today, is intended precisely to introduce minimum measures to encourage the improvement of the health and safety of pregnant women and women who have recently given birth and are breastfeeding.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's evaluation report shows that the directive has proved its utility in that it has been of some benefit in a number of Member States in certain areas of the issue, such as leave on grounds of health and safety, etc. However, apart from these points, which are of a general nature, we share the rapporteur's criticism of the Commission's report.</p>
<p class="contents">This report was overdue and limited almost exclusively to dealing with legal and technical transposition. There is a lack of concrete statistics and data on vital aspects of the directive, such as the monitoring of workplace risk assessment for pregnant workers and the frequency of work-related accidents and illnesses, and satisfactory information is not provided on the coordination of legislative adaptation of specialist inspection, penalties or scientific research for the detection, prevention, elimination and recuperation of professional hazards relating to pregnancy. We feel that there has been a lack of serious monitoring on the part of the Commission. There has been a lack of coordination between the health and safety directorate and the equal opportunities unit, and the ambiguity of the directive itself in this area has become apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">The delay in the production of an evaluation report – and I would remind you that, precisely because of the low minimum standards set, Italy was only persuaded to approve the directive on the condition that its implementation would be monitored very soon afterwards – should have led the Commission to put forward a proposal to revise the directive, particularly in relation to certain aspects referred to by the rapporteur: the length of maternity leave, the increase in the duration of maternity leave where risks are involved, a more precise definition of the concept of an adequate allowance, the prohibition of dismissal of women during pregnancy or maternity leave with effective penalties, the prohibition of any form of discrimination with regard to women's careers or the improvement of working conditions, the implementation of all the measures necessary to safeguard the health and safety of woman and unborn child, without prejudice to the woman's right to work or her career and encouraging breastfeeding through diverse measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to taking all the necessary compatibilities into consideration, when they revise the directive, the Commission and the Member States should be motivated by the principle of non-discrimination and the recognition of motherhood and fatherhood as fundamental rights which are essential for a balanced society.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has now investigated the Member States’ implementation of this directive and, in her report, Mrs Damião quite correctly points out that the Commission’s report contains only a technical and factual assessment of the directive’s implementation and does not provide an evaluation of whether the directive in practice provides pregnant women or women who have just given birth with better conditions. She does not, therefore, think that the Commission’s report provides an adequate basis for carrying out a review of the directive. I very much agree with the rapporteur about this. I am, therefore, also opposed to our requesting a review of the directive now. I do not think we should demand a new draft directive which contains the right to a longer period of leave, together with demands for longer enforced leave, and which lays down more detailed requirements for financial compensation in a way that does not take the necessary account of the differences between the Member States’ social systems. The existing rules make for great flexibility, and most countries guarantee women better conditions than the common regulations require. It might be wondered whether new regulations would mean very much in practice. In any case, maternity leave and financial aid ought to be given priority in the individual countries. However, I think it would be a good idea to obtain a better overview of what the circumstances are in the different countries so that governments can learn from each other’s good and bad experiences and inspire each other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The assessment of the existing measures, which was intended to lead to change, is four years behind schedule and fails to meet the requirements which the European Parliament prescribed at the time. </p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance calls for an increase in the level of protection. The report mainly focuses on institutional aspects. In our opinion, this report should also embrace the right to return back to work to the same or an equivalent job after maternity leave. </p>
<p class="contents">We are asking for the rights of pregnant and breastfeeding women to be extended. In practice, women are often discriminated against during this period, despite rights on paper. </p>
<p class="contents">This is why we call for a reversal of the burden of proof. Employers will need to demonstrate that any dismissal or change of job is not linked to pregnancy. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we would like the Commission to explain why at the recent ILO conference, the Member States failed to adopt the common positions. How is it possible that the United Kingdom abstained from the final vote, which, in view of the procedure, is tantamount to voting against? </p>

<p class="contents">This freedom is achieved through a right to specific protection for women, a right that is always related to their bodies, in particular to maternity and, more specifically, pregnancy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore pleased with Mrs Damião’s excellent report, which highlights the urgent need to revise the 1992 directive. Her request for a formal ban on dismissal during pregnancy is essential, and I will dwell only on this point. It seems to me to be dangerous to allow employers any leeway in this field, as they will always use it to their advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, with the revision of Convention 103, the ILO is levelling down the protection of pregnant women, by accepting certain dismissals that are said to be unrelated to pregnancy. Europe, with Mrs Damião’s report and the revision of the directive, has a duty to be a political reference for women’s rights world-wide. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were happy to contribute to this in committee, not only by giving the report our total support, but also by adding some amendments that were accepted in the final version. </p>
<p class="contents">We consider the approval of this report to be a significant event as we approach the summer recess, for four fundamental reasons. </p>
<p class="contents">- Firstly, we think it is unacceptable that women should suffer social prejudice or discrimination because of pregnancy or maternity issues; </p>
<p class="contents">- Secondly, because we must more vigorously tackle risks to the health of mother and child associated with working conditions; </p>
<p class="contents">- Thirdly, the idea of reconciling personal and professional lives, the family and work, in modern society is becoming increasingly important to those of us concerned about people’s day-to-day lives. This is precisely one of those key areas in which a responsible approach to reconciling these interests is called for; </p>
<p class="contents">- Fourthly, because maternity policies must be consistent with family and childbirth policies generally, particularly at a time when the crisis resulting from Europe’s ageing population is increasingly drawing Member States’ attention to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall also be discussing some of the amendments and our position will be based on the balance that we feel has been struck in the report. Nevertheless, we will not support all of the amendments, because we feel that this balance is actually preferable to some of the steps suggested in the amendments. We shall support the amendments suggested by our British Conservative colleagues, such as Mr Bushill-Matthews, who drew our attention to the issue of small- and medium-sized enterprises, which we feel must be taken into account when legislation is adopted, whether at Community or national level. </p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, we hope that the British Conservatives will back the report, because although it is true that some of the Portuguese Presidency’s conclusions highlight this issue, I must emphasise that paragraph 36 of the final Feira Summit text stresses the importance of companies’ sense of social responsibility. For us Portuguese Christian-Democrats and Conservatives, this is a very important idea. We believe that companies also have a certain social responsibility, which they should build upon. </p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to add that we wish certain votes to be held separately, as a means of improving the report, some points in which strike us as rather obscure. We do not view pregnancy as a social resource and there is one other point on which we would like to see a separate vote in order to improve the report. Lastly, I would urge all Christian-Democrat Members to endorse this report by my Socialist colleague. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, although I wish to highlight the considerable harm that this omission has caused to mothers, every cloud has a silver lining, and this report, which has been brilliantly drafted by Mrs Damião, is proof of that such silver linings exist. This report will enable the European Parliament to move ahead now. </p>
<p class="contents">The report clarifies concepts, harmonises legislation at Community level, establishes shared responsibilities, takes account of new risks in the way work is currently organised, looks for incentives to increase the population in an ageing Europe and considers pregnancy to be a natural condition for women, and one which should be respected and protected. </p>
<p class="contents">It specifically notes the rights of women working independently or as teleworkers, and highlights the growing concern about single parents, who are becoming increasingly common in Europe. The aim of extending maternity leave to twenty weeks is an ambitious one, which is recommended from a technical point of view, and must gradually be implemented. We must therefore prepare ourselves for this in economic terms, by sharing out responsibilities through cooperation between states and employers’ and workers’ organisations. In order to achieve the aims that are being proposed, it is also crucial for us to encourage greater dialogue, collaboration and coordination between specialists in health, hygiene and safety at work, so that a more suitable working environment can be provided for pregnant women. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Community must strive to gain the support of applicant countries to ensure that awareness is raised as rapidly as possible, so that the measures recommended in this report can be adopted, since there may be greater resistance in those countries, which could be difficult to overcome. </p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to sound a warning about point 9 of this report, because measures for protecting new mothers, such as very long maternity leave, may have unwanted effects, as it may become disadvantageous for employers to employ women, and they may consequently prefer to take on men. The Commission must therefore create a system for detecting fraud and for applying harsh penalties to companies practising this kind of discrimination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have a good example of this here. According to the Commission’s assessment, the situation regarding the health and safety of pregnant women looks fine, but that is certainly only on paper, for is that also the way it looks in reality? I am not so sure. The pace in the labour market is more hectic than ever. Great efficiency is demanded, and women are supposed to work as if they were not pregnant, even if they are. It is stressful, and it is unhealthy both for the pregnant woman and the foetus. We know this, because investigations have proven this to be the case. The European Parliament and ourselves as representatives of the people are entitled to know whether the legislation we adopt also actually works in practice. I think we have an example here of the Commission’s doing all too little in this area. The message from Parliament to the Commission should therefore be that the work which has been done is not good enough. It needs to be re-done. We must know whether the legislation is working. The Commission’s purely legal analyses now already show that there is a need for further protection. I think there is a greater need to discover what suitable protection consists in, and there should be stricter rules governing dismissal during pregnancy. The Commission must go back to the drawing board, set to work again and table the necessary proposals. The European social model is characterised by the fact that we have a high level of protection. This should be an area – and this remark is aimed at the Liberal Group which has adopted a very different view – in which the EU should have a big influence. It should not be left to the individual Member States. Women’s participation in the labour market is a prerequisite of our achieving the ambitious goals we have set ourselves regarding employment and the modernisation of the European social model. Modernisation and efforts in this area are therefore important. They cannot be left to the Member States. Europe as a whole needs to attend to these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that many lose their jobs when they become pregnant. This is completely unacceptable! The Damião report contains many good proposals, but we in the Swedish Liberal Party still have fundamental objections to the report. I would like to say to my predecessor, who spoke just a moment ago, that, in this Parliament, we ought more often to ask ourselves the question: What should the European Parliament actually be doing? How much detail should we go into? We believe in the subsidiarity principle, i.e. that decisions should be taken as close as possible to the people they affect.</p>
<p class="contents">Social policy is an area where the EU ought to have <span class="italic">limited</span> jurisdiction, except when it is a question of free movement for citizens within the Union. Every Member State should have full responsibility and the right to make its own decisions regarding its social security systems. Maternity/paternity leave and maternity/paternity benefit are examples of issues that are not directly transnational. We do not believe in detailed common European social legislation. This does not, however, prevent Member States from cooperating and sharing ideas concerning social issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The Damião report contains an amalgam of legitimate demands for proper security for women workers throughout Europe, demands for greater freedom of movement and a better functioning single market and demands for the national right of decision on the details of the socio-political system. In this connection, the report contains an imbalance.</p>
<p class="contents">My final question is: Why should the European Parliament decide that every woman in the whole of Europe must have eight weeks off work when she has had a child?

The report quite rightly laments the Commission’s failure to comply with the timetable set by the directive and the fact that there has been no assessment of how effectively the directive has been implemented. The report stresses the need for a proposal for an urgent revision of the directive, and suggests inclusion of various measures, which we essentially support and agree with. </p>

<p class="contents">In general, the amendments were accepted, with the exception of the amendment on the payment of allowances during time off work and maternity leave, which must be equivalent to 100% of the previous salary and be taken into account for the purposes of calculating pension entitlements.

The report has two clear shortcomings: firstly, the fact that it is overdue and secondly, its limitations. It could have been finished as far back as 1997, but even though it is late, it could at least have clarified the wording of certain articles of the directive and defined the many undefined concepts which have given rise to numerous interpretations.

<p class="contents">The European Parliament recognised the need to revise the directive as early as 1992, with the result that now, given the need for a social market economy, it agrees with the objectives of Mrs Damião's report: to link maternity policies to family policy and to remove ambiguity by practically and quantifiably enhancing the rights of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Pregnancy is a natural state for women which society must respect, defend and protect.</p>
<p class="contents">Society must care for working women in particular by ensuring that they remain in their jobs. The incorporation of women into the workplace is a reality which cannot be reversed and women cannot be put in a situation of having to chose between having children and keeping their job because of the complications which a pregnancy may entail.</p>
<p class="contents">The ageing of the population, together with the low birth-rate in the European Union, means that this is an issue of enormous importance for all social operators. As important as the protection of pregnant women is provision for breast-feeding, which is beneficial to the health of both mother and child. The protection of maternity and breast-feeding cannot be considered as a form of unequal treatment between men and women, since maternity is exclusive to women and it is women who must be protected, independently of the fact that some parental leave can be granted to men.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States must deal with the possible negative effects of this directive by making it easier for companies to employ young women by exempting them from the social costs during parental leave. The directive must include a minimum leave of 20 weeks, with an obligatory period of at least eight weeks after giving birth. A minimum salary of 80% must be guaranteed, with no loss of pension rights. The ban on dismissal during pregnancy must be strictly complied with.

The rapporteur has set this all to one side, effectively saying it is irrelevant, claiming that the original directive just did not go far enough.</p>
<p class="contents">I like some of the suggestions in her report. I congratulate her for the enthusiasm with which she has pursued her agenda. But in general it is not a health and safety agenda. It is very much a traditional socialist agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, her report aims to harmonise social policy across the EU rather than leave the detail to Member States – a point made with great force by Mr Olle Schmidt earlier in this debate. Secondly, it wants to improve the terms and conditions of employment for pregnant workers and new mothers by way of extra maternity leave and specified minimum pay levels. Neither of these are really health and safety issues. She is proposing solutions for which there is no health and safety problem.</p>
<p class="contents">As British Conservatives we confirm our concern about health and safety for all workers, especially vulnerable groups. We confirm our commitment to subsidiarity regarding terms and conditions of employment. But we also confirm our concern to help more women into jobs rather than putting up further barriers to female employment. Hence we urge the House to reject the report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission, though, has side-stepped some key issues in its evaluation report, which it submitted almost four years late. After 1992, the Member States allowed important years to pass when they could have introduced improvements for millions of mothers and prepared themselves for the changed framework conditions in the information age. There are too many loopholes in the directive, the question of the reversal of the burden of proof is not settled, nor is the question of financial contributions, which clearly reflects a need for substantial improvement. Employers regard their contributions as cost factors they will do their best to avoid. But for many women, that obviously means they have to make a decision: job or child. However, their desire for economic independence must not force them to decide between the alternatives of either a career or a child. The right to choose is a human right, applying to both women and men, and the possibility of reconciling family life and a job is a key social democratic demand.</p>
<p class="contents">Pregnancy is not an illness and we must change the situation where pregnant women and new mothers have to give up their income during the period of legal protection and where for women collectively the potential ability to bear a child leads to discrimination on the labour market. Here we need to change Community law. The Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities will spearhead the EU in the fight to increase maternity leave to 20 weeks and drastically reduce the number of derogations, such as in the hotel and restaurant trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Special assistance needs to be provided for high-risk pregnancies and multiple births and 21st century society needs to take the health of mothers-to-be seriously. I hope those colleagues who are chatting so animatedly among themselves also take it seriously. We must speak with one voice in order to implement ILO Convention No 103, and for small and medium-sized undertakings we must regulate the assistance elsewhere, for instance in the Treaty and not in this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this respect, we may well be surprised that the Commission has waited as long as it has to present us with its evaluation report on the implementation of this directive and proposals for improving conditions for maternity leave. It seems to me that, in this proposal for a revision of the directive that we are asking the Commission to present quickly, it is essential to preserve the reality of three fundamental principles for women and their well-being: the prohibition of dismissal for pregnant women or women on maternity leave, the right to a mandatory minimum leave and allowance during this leave to be taken into account for the purposes of acquiring pension entitlements.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it seems to me that this new directive should comprise substantial improvements, in particular all women must be offered the opportunity to take 20 weeks’ maternity leave, without necessarily being obliged to take the entire period, but the employer shall be obliged to offer it, and a minimum of 8 weeks after the birth, in order to foster development of the bond between mother and child.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to high-risk pregnancies and the birth of disabled children, it is obvious that provision must be made for specially adapted proposals offering an extension of the length of maternity leave, taking account of the specifics of the case.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as definition of the allowance is concerned, it seems that the figure to be considered must be at least 80% of the previous salary, and that includes for purposes of acquiring pension entitlements. Finally, it is recommended that this text should correlate and reinforce the formal prohibition of dismissal during pregnancy and maternity leave.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report certainly represents progress, not just for women in general but also in that it safeguards family rights and upholds fundamental values.</p>
<p class="contents">The European People's Party has always upheld the concept of the family, the basic unit of society, as the basis for European construction and the Christian values from which it stems require that it be respected. At a time when Europe has demographic problems, the institutions need to issue a firm signal to reassure working women, who have to have sufficient peace of mind and the necessary guarantees to be able to opt for motherhood. This is why it is necessary to have a sufficiently long period of rest from work before giving birth and even longer afterwards, when there is a child to breastfeed, look after and bring up. Therefore, benefits should not be cut considerably during this period and pension funds should not be affected either. I would add that, as regards the matter in question, self-employed women should also have a guaranteed right to benefits, which should be funded from contributory national sectoral funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to express my support for maintaining the prohibition on dismissal of women during this period, and also for the fact that the cost of benefits for workers on maternity leave are not borne directly by the company where the woman works but entirely by the State, in order to avoid discrimination and penalising women in the labour market.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must accept these criticisms since they are true and are based on real facts. However, I must offer a justification and an explanation. In order to produce this text, the Commission has had to rely on documentation provided by the different Member States and, unfortunately, that documentation has not been provided with all the speed and efficiency which the Commission would have liked. That is the reason for the delay in presentation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission obviously fully shares the Parliament’s interest in improving the protection of pregnant workers and those who have recently given birth.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community legislation and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice still do not offer a sufficient framework although they are undoubtedly key elements to making further progress in this aspect which is essential to safeguarding the rights of pregnant workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Directive 92/85 was adopted before the Treaty of Amsterdam. We believe that it is now, after the Treaty, that we will be able to go further and take some steps forward. That is what we propose and to this end we are going to prepare a supplementary report on the implementation of this directive, which we will present in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Members know well, the Commission last week approved its new social agenda for 2000-2005 and it is within this framework that we hope to offer an adequate solution, not only to this specific problem, but also to a whole series of other issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to draw your attention and the attention of fellow Members to a very sad matter. This Parliament’s reputation with the press is excellent, because for the past twenty years, Parliament has managed to issue press releases for the written press twice a day. </p>
<p class="contents">This previous system has now been changed. I had a brief look to see how the system worked this week. The press release to commemorate former President Pflimlin did not appear until 11.22 p.m. on Monday evening. The report on the Feira Summit was issued on Tuesday morning, the report on Tuesday morning’s discharge sitting was issued at 9.12 p.m. The report on Zimbabwe, Tuesday afternoon, was issued at 10.55 p.m. The report on the European Central Bank on Wednesday morning was issued at 8.00 p.m. the same day. This kind of reporting is not really of much use at all to the written press. At that time of the day, editorial staff have gone home and we are, in a way, generating old news. </p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you, Mr President, to revert back to the old system and to ensure that the press releases, the daily press releases, not only appear on time, but also afford a general overview – in a decentralised manner – for each language. I would ask you to request the Bureau to think about this very carefully and reconsider their decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
