The Council discussed the recovery plan for hake in December 2003 and accepts some of the proposed amendments set out in the report: firstly, we have now deleted fishing effort from the proposal. Secondly, we have reduced the minimum safe level according to the precautionary approach from 143 000 tonnes to 140 000, and the critical limit from 103 000 tonnes to 100 000, as recommended by the scientists.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite these amendments, the objective remains the same. The aim is to restore Northern hake stocks to safe biological limits, which entails a number of measures. Firstly, we must set a critical limit below which, according to scientific advice, stocks would be at risk of collapse. We must also set guidelines on the establishment of Total Allowable Catches (TACs) based on a scientific evaluation. The TAC will be set according to the precautionary approach unless it results in a reduction in the biomass in any given year. If the size of the stock falls below the minimum level, the Council must reduce the TAC. However, the TAC may not vary by more than 15% year on year.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the proposal also contains measures for more effective control of vessels catching North Sea hake, as well as provisions for the prior notification of landings. Landings of more than two tonnes of hake may only take place at authorised ports and stricter provisions on storage and transport also apply. So much for the proposal; I will comment on the proposed amendments in my closing statement. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission proposal establishing a plan for the recovery of the Northern hake stock is made by virtue of the new provisions laid down in the framework regulation reforming the CFP. This new legislation, which in principle covers species that are under particular threat, is combined with a new instrument, management by fishing effort, which comes on top of the instruments already in place, in particular the setting of TACs and quotas. Following the cod recovery plan, the Northern hake plan is the second of this type to be proposed by the Commission. It in fact turns out to be the second link in a long chain because, since it was tabled, two further plans with exactly the same structure have been referred to Parliament, concerning Southern hake, Norway lobster in the Cantabrian Sea and sole in the Bay of Biscay and the Channel, and we are told that further plans are in the pipeline, in respect in particular of Norway lobster and plaice.</p>
<p class="contents">This point should be stressed, all the more so because it would seem that when a fishing undertaking fishes stocks under different recovery plans, it is obliged to comply with the provisions of all of the recovery plans concerned, both for catches from stocks subject to recovery measures and catches from stocks of similar species. This is what arises in particular from the written answer dated 9 February that you have just sent me, Commissioner, in response to a question that I had asked you. This is a particularly onerous constraint for the industry, especially in areas where the Commission intends to superimpose several recovery plans that apply to practically all of the species fished, and I am thinking in particular of those in the Bay of Biscay.</p>
<p class="contents">Originally, the Commission had planned to deal with cod and Northern hake stocks together, despite the fact that these two species have very different characteristics. Fortunately, this unsatisfactory link was subsequently broken.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee drafted its report after holding in-depth consultations with representatives of the industry concerned, notably at a hearing in Brussels on 25 November that was attended by representatives of the French, Spanish and British trade organisations. They expressed particular regret that they had not been properly involved in drafting the recovery plan or in producing the assessment of the state of the stock on which the recovery plan is based, contrary to the provisions of the new framework regulation and contrary to what Parliament had called for, in particular in its opinion on integrating environmental protection requirements into the CFP. We were told that the regional workshop organised by the Commission was more like an information session on decisions that had already been taken than a meeting involving genuine consultation prior to any decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The industry representatives also stressed the fundamental imbalance in the Commission proposal. This is based purely on considerations of a biological nature and is not accompanied by any impact assessment of the socioeconomic consequences of the proposed plan. In fact, it is clear that the drastic reduction in total allowable catches (TACs) planned for the very beginning of the plan is incompatible with the survival of undertakings involved in fishing Northern hake.</p>
<p class="contents">The industry representatives also wished to tell us of their reservations about the effectiveness and practicability of the rule for reducing fishing effort, whether it be by the system of days at sea or kilowatt-days. They told us of their fear that superimposing a new management system on the system of TACs and quotas and on the specific management measures already adopted might jeopardise the principle of relative stability and contribute to an increase in discards. They also doubt that a system for reducing fishing effort can effectively achieve the desired result in terms of improving stocks. In fact, we do not have any scientific evaluation by ICES on this subject such as to guarantee that a reduction in effort really would reduce catches. Nor do we have an evaluation of the transitional measures taken to restore stocks under Annex XVII to the regulation setting TACs and quotas for 2003. Furthermore, the extremely complex effort reduction formula entails serious problems of equity and predictability for the Member States. Moreover, it institutes a uniform and rigid system, transposed practically unchanged from one stock to another, which does not take any account of the specific characteristics of the various Community fleets, particularly their versatility.</p>
<p class="contents">Your Committee on Fisheries considered the multiannual approach that was adopted to address the issue of the management of the Northern hake stock to be perfectly well-founded and appropriate. This approach actually sets an essential conservation objective for the long term, while at the same time giving fishermen the visibility and security that they need to guarantee the survival of their businesses, which is no less essential. Nevertheless, it seemed to us that establishing a plan for the recovery of the Northern hake stock was a measure that was disproportionate to the state of the stock concerned as revealed by the latest scientific reports and observations of fishermen. Although it is clear that we need to remain vigilant, the trend observed over the last two years shows an increase in the level of the resource.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Northern hake stock is not outside safe biological limits, it would not seem appropriate to us to apply a recovery plan to it under Article 5 of the framework regulation. In your committee’s view, the Northern hake stock should be covered by a multiannual management plan pursuant to Article 6 of the same regulation. This instrument would appear to us to be preferable because it corresponds better to the state of the resource and will better enable us to achieve the twofold objective of the sustainable conservation of the stock and the conservation of our fisheries. In making this proposal to substitute a multiannual management plan for the recovery plan advocated by the Commission, we are completely in line with the approach that we have already adopted that recommends that fragile stocks should be managed by adopting simple, flexible rules, that can be constantly adjusted – such as multiannual TACs – rather than uniform and complex systems with uncertain effects, like the arrangements for management via fishing effort, which have not yet been tried and tested. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission presented us with a proposal which, initially, was combined with cod – and which our Parliament rejected, as has been said already. Secondly, it made a separate, but very rigid and severe, proposal, which compared Northern hake with cod, with a genuine recovery plan and with fishing effort. Our Parliament had been consulted at the same time as the Council, and the negotiations were carried out in parallel, which obliged our rapporteur to be flexible in terms of adopting our draft report.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Souchet has made a serious study of issues relating to hake – as he has said, our Committee on Fisheries spoke to the sector – and has presented a report which fundamentally changes the Commission's original conceptions, for which he has our full support and thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank Mr Souchet for having accepted the numerous amendments which we had presented on behalf of the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – I am truly grateful to him for this – since we have ensured that it is not a recovery plan, but rather a genuine management plan. I would like to draw the Commission's attention to this issue: it is a genuine management plan without fisheries effort, in accordance with the sector's request.</p>
<p class="contents">The Souchet report is coherent, solid, reasonable and combines the defence of sustainable and responsible fishing of Northern hake with the social and economic aspects of the fisheries sector. The combination of these two aspects is something fundamental which we hope will be taken into account in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the future regional advisory councils will have to help us not to take false steps and to present proposals for the management of fisheries resources which have the consensus of both scientists and the sector itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also appointed Mr Souchet rapporteur for the future management plan for Southern hake. Although it will possibly be the next Parliament established following the June elections which has to deal with this issue, the Committee on Fisheries will have to hold the necessary meetings so that, having heard the advisory councils which are created in this regard, both scientists and the sector can take part in the debates on Southern hake, and this must take place in parallel with the socio-economic measures we have requested and adopted already in the modification of the FIFG. And more importantly: in the future, the FIFG will have to provide for socio-economic measures so that, when any recovery or management plan is adopted, it is automatically accompanied by the corresponding socio-economic measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We congratulate Mr Souchet once again and we hope that by means of this report, which we will vote on tomorrow, we will have taken a very important step in terms of supporting sustainable fisheries and the fisheries sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first innovation, which we should be grateful for, is that the Commission has finally decided to separate stocks of hake and cod into two different plans. There was no other choice following the clear improvement in hake stocks, a direct result of the management measures applied by the sector over the last two years.</p>
<p class="contents">When we move on to the analysis of the measures proposed, we discover that the Commission is not taking account of the best scientific information available, nor is it dispelling the doubts of the fisheries industry, since once again there has been no dialogue with the scientists and the proposal has been drawn up without the serious participation of professionals. The Commission is working on the basis of scientific opinions the content of which it does not specify and which, as the rapporteur, Mr Souchet, quite rightly says in his explanatory statement, has not been revealed to the Committee on Fisheries either, despite our having requested it.</p>
<p class="contents">The precautionary biomass should have been established on the basis of these scientific reports which do not exist. Neither does it appear that this biomass is in proportion to the state of the stock affected, since the latest independent scientific reports and observations of professionals demonstrate that it is not below the safe biological limits.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither do we have scientific evaluations from the ICES which guarantee to us that the reduction of fishing effort proposed will lead to an effective reduction in catches, nor an evaluation of the effects of the technical recovery measures – which I referred to earlier – which have been applied for two years and have had such good results.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither does the Commission’s proposal seek a balance between biological recovery and socio-economic repercussions. Once again, I must point out that the approach is based on exclusively biological considerations and does not take account of the socio-economic context when recommending the re-establishment of stocks within one year, rather than adopting a progressive approach, based on multi-annual TACs, and this is incompatible with the capacity for survival of the companies in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The technical measures, which, as we have said, have produced good results, are completely overlooked. What Mr Souchet proposes in his report, namely the replacement of this recovery plan with a multi-annual management plan, is the result not just of the – I believe correct – analysis of the European Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries and of our own debate, but also of the guidelines already defined by the European Parliament itself and Mr Souchet in relation to the management of fragile stocks: the application of simple and flexible rules, such as multi-annual TACs, rather than rigid systems with uncertain effects, such as measures based on the fishing effort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is basically ICES' way of saying that it is in deep trouble. That is why the Commission has been trying for some years to convince the Council of the need for a recovery plan.</p>
<p class="contents">The recovery plan proposed had a number of positive elements, including a formula for setting TACs and a reduction in fishing effort. Nonetheless, in its 2003 assessment ICES noted that the reductions indicated in the proposed plan are very far from achieving cuts in fishing mortality that could rebuild the stock in the short term: in other words, ICES is basically saying that even the Commission's proposal was not enough to ensure rapid stock recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">What have the Council and the Committee on Fisheries done? They have seriously weakened what was already a very weak proposal, primarily by removing any vestige of a reduction in fishing effort: the very thing that is most needed. Council even went one step further by increasing the TACs for hake by almost a third where the Commission had recommended a reduction.</p>
<p class="contents">In December 2002 it was announced with great ado that the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy was a great success and, amongst other things, it was said that recovery plans with effort reduction were to be applied. But at the Council meeting in December, the Council set 199 TACs in total. As an indication of the seriousness of the situation the Commission recommended cuts of greater than 10% for a quarter of them – that was 49 stocks. But the Council rejected much of that advice. For 42 stocks it set TACs that were more than 10% higher than the Commission's proposal. In some cases it set TACs at double, or even treble, the recommendations. For ten stocks they adopted an increase where the Commission had recommended a decrease.</p>
<p class="contents">If this is the way Council and the Fisheries Committee are going to continue they are basically proving correct the cynics and all those who said that the reform of the common fisheries policy was not going to see any achievable result in relation to sustainable fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Something has to be done. The Commission is too soft on this issue and it needs to be more radical. The Council needs to take a realistic approach to the situation facing the fisheries industry and listen to the scientists' advice. It must listen to ICES' advice to ensure the survival of the fishing industry in Europe, otherwise we are basically voting for its demise. It is regrettable that the Fisheries Committee could actually reduce what was already an inadequate proposal by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is namely the case that one of my fellow MEPs suggested to the press that the Dutch members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and also of my own group, never reimburse any of their travelling expenses. Radio, television and newspapers accepted this piece of information without checking it out properly. Since that time, my fellow MEPs and I have been inundated with telephone calls and e-mails asking me why I keep money back. This is bizarre; the reason why I do not return any money is that I do not declare any trips that I have not taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that many fishermen are in a similar situation. They do not have to fight a lie but a half-truth. The situation of Northern hake may not be full of hope, but it is not so bad that a recovery plan is needed. Relying on ill-defined data, the Commission is proposing a drastic reduction in the quantity of fish to be caught. Recent information from biologists suggests that the situation surrounding hake is not so bad as to call for drastic action, and so I wholeheartedly support Mrs Souchet’s report and call on the Commission to adjust its plans. A control plan for Northern hake with adequate monitoring and enforcement is sufficient in order to offer this fish species a future. Insufficient scientific research is already putting fishermen at too much of a disadvantage. It is time for sound scientific research to benefit both fish and fishermen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I congratulate the rapporteur on his report. Mr Souchet is one of the most hard-working members of the Committee on Fisheries and his expertise in this area has earned him the accolade of being appointed rapporteur on the recovery of southern hake, a report which is currently in the pipeline.</p>
<p class="contents">During our deliberations in committee, it was repeatedly stated that the advice we received from ICES – the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas – in respect of stocks of Northern hake was at odds with the advice of fishermen. Indeed, the fishermen claimed that hake stocks were not in a state of terminal decline, as stated by the scientists. Once again, this divergence of opinion has demonstrated the need for fishermen and scientists to work together in the preparation of management strategies. It is also clear that the Commission must be prepared to listen to the advice of fishermen as well as to the dire warnings of scientists. In this respect, I am delighted that plans for the creation of Regional Advisory Councils, which Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna mentioned, will bring together fishermen and scientists. These plans are well under way and constitute an essential part of the CFP reform package. Had an RAC been in place in this instance, I do not think we would have had the original recommendations for drastic cuts in hake TACs combined with severe effort limitation targets which the Commission proposed and which have shocked the members of the Committee on Fisheries. Cuts as proposed would have devastated the sector and caused widespread socio-economic hardship. I am glad that the Commission has revised these proposals in the wake of strong representations from the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We all support sustainable fishing. We all have an interest in seeing the long-term recovery of Northern hake. However, we also have a duty to sustain the livelihood of fishermen and to protect fishing communities. A balance therefore has to be struck which links best practice to achievable socio-economic goals. So, despite what Mrs McKenna said, I believe that Mr Souchet has sought to achieve that balance and I commend his report to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am doing so today too. I am doing so because I am in such despair about the fact that we shall not be able to bring about a strict recovery plan, not only for hake but also for other species such as cod and other threatened white fish.</p>
<p class="contents">This plan for the Northern hake stock was adopted in December, and the objective was clear: to protect the stocks and obtain an acceptable level of security. The truth is that the Council and the Commission together have weakened the original proposal so that it no longer complies with that objective. I think that the proposal that has now been negotiated by the Committee on Fisheries is very poor. I absolutely cannot vote in favour of it because it would further weaken an already weakened proposal. An absolute minimum would be to stick to the Commission’s original proposal, because stricter controls are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Economics and social problems, which are always referred to, are also important issues but, if we do not apply the precautionary principle when it comes to the biomass and fish stocks, we quite simply do not make it possible for fisheries to continue. That is something we should appreciate. We have now rejected four or five recovery plans from the Commission. It quite simply has to be realised that neither in this House nor in the Council is there any political will to adopt measures that genuinely take account of the precautionary principle and guarantee that we have fisheries in the future too. I am very concerned about what this will lead to. I should like more people to fall in with my policy when we vote on this matter, for I am now beginning to become extremely impatient and anxious. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Commission's initial proposal of introducing a recovery plan for Northern hake was not – or at least did not seem to be – anything more than an unjustified transposition of the measures applied to the recovery of cod to this species. Clearly, the executive Committee did not take account of the latest opinions of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), according to which the hake stock will reach a level of total safety if over the next five to eight years the level of mortality from fishing is maintained. It will therefore reach a safe biological level, to use the term recently used by the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">According to this information, it is not necessary to implement a drastic recovery plan for Northern hake. Rather than a recovery plan, it would be more appropriate to implement a management plan in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, in a manner which is compatible and also consistent with the biological and environmental component, on the one hand, and socio-economic factors on the other, within the context of the new common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the will expressed by the Committee on Fisheries in its opinion: to replace the recovery plan proposed by the Commission, which imposes severe restrictions on the fishing effort and extremely serious social consequences, with a management plan which allows for the establishment of a total allowable catch that is compatible with the maintenance of the reproductive biomass.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission recently presented another proposal for the recovery of Southern hake stocks and langoustine stocks, and it has not calculated the socio-economic consequences for the sector of the measures proposed in that case either. A scientific study is therefore needed, as well as the opinion of the new regional advisory councils provided for in the reform of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we should also stress – and I will end here, Mr President – that the Council of Ministers for fisheries last December committed itself to consulting the professionals of the sector before drawing up an action plan for these species. The involvement and participation of the sector in decision-making should not be forgotten given that these decisions affect the viability of fishing, jobs, living conditions and the very survival of families which live in European regions highly dependent on fisheries policy. And I believe that we must insist on this involvement and this participation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a further initiative in the pipeline covering Southern hake. While the sustainable management of fish stocks clearly justifies the conservation of species deemed under threat, measures aimed at limiting fishing must be properly based on accurate and up-to-date scientific opinions, and must take on board the first-hand observations of fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">The deficiencies in scientific research are well known. Parliament has had the opportunity this week to express its opinion on the matter by means of the Lage report. In this context, the Souchet report is excellent, drawing attention to the need to keep data up-to-date, based on information provided by international bodies in the fisheries sector. These limitations have had a devastating socio-economic impact on sea professionals, restricting already limited fishing activity still further. The figures presented by the Commission for limiting the hake catch are such that if they were implemented they would be socially devastating, economically untenable and commercially unmanageable.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears obvious to state that socio-economic impact should be assessed prior to presenting any recovery plan. This, however, did not occur in this case. Such measures are therefore only acceptable if strictly commensurate with the aims of sustainable exploitation of stocks and if their economic impact is taken into account. Great variations in total allowable catches (TACs) may in some cases lead to companies converting fishing activity from one species to another, thereby indirectly causing imbalances. On various occasions, Parliament has drawn the Commission’s attention to the excessive inflexibility of the recovery plans. Consequently, a multiannual, flexible and gradual approach would certainly be more suitable, in that it would lead to fishing effort perfectly suited to the state of stocks, which will not be achieved by implementing inflexible plans, with irreversible and socially devastating consequences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, I should say that I reject all the proposed amendments which aim to rename this entire project a ‘management plan’ rather than a recovery plan, because it is still a recovery plan. I think it would be wrong for us to gloss over the situation, although I gladly admit that the situation for Northern hake is less critical than for Northern cod.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 2: I must reject this amendment as this recital is already contained in the framework regulation on the common fisheries policy. It is not that I reject it on principle; it is quite simply redundant.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Amendment No 5 and the consultations with the Regional Advisory Councils, or RACs, as they are also called, I am pleased to reassure you that as soon as they have been set up, we will naturally be consulting the RACs regularly on this issue. However, we do not need a recital for this purpose, as that is the whole point of the RACs – to be consulted on such matters.</p>
<p class="contents">I reject Amendment No 6 because the hake stock is below the precautionary level and is therefore not yet within safe biological limits. The purpose of Amendment No 7 is to show that we need criteria to determine when recovery has been achieved. It would be quite inappropriate to determine politically when recovery has been achieved. That is a scientific issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I reject Amendments Nos 12 and 27 because the additional control measures are absolutely essential. It is the fishermen themselves who frequently complain that control is uneven. We really do need these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I can accept Amendment No 15 in part and I approve of amending the precautionary value for the biomass. I cannot, however, accept Amendment No 16. We should not be setting priorities for scientific evaluations here. It would be a little too simplistic to say that the practical observations made by fishermen should be given higher priority than systematic monitoring by scientific institutions. Of course the fishermen should contribute their data. Some of the uncertainties surrounding the scientific evaluations are due precisely to the fact that there is a lack of such data, as fishermen only tend to pass on data which they think will influence the evaluations in line with their own interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I can accept Amendments Nos 19 and 20 in part. The TACs are based on a fishing mortality rate of 0.25, and we incorporated this value into the proposal at the Council meeting in December. However, I cannot accept Amendment No 21. After the Council meeting in December, the proposal was amended so the Council has more scope when setting the TACs. The minimum level no longer needs to be reached within one year; instead, the TACs can be set so that this is achieved over a longer period. Consequently, I must reject Amendment No 25 as well, as the Council must have the opportunity to reduce the TACs in exceptional cases if this is necessary on biological grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I must also reject Amendments Nos 22 and 23, for logically, they would mean that the TACs could be amended by more than 15% year on year, and that is not acceptable. We must have the same degree of fluctuation in both directions; otherwise, the rules will be uneven.</p>
<p class="contents">I can accept Amendments Nos 8, 11, 18, 24 and 26 in full. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
