<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Záborská (PPE-DE)</span></span>  , <span class="italic">author</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(SK)</span> Mr President, Madam Commissioner, on Sunday 17 October the international community observed the International Day for the Elimination of Poverty, in order to draw attention to poverty as a violation of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We are endeavouring to eliminate poverty, but, if we are to succeed in this, society must redouble its efforts. It must take as its starting-point the experiences of those who actually live in poverty, and of the families that reject poverty and do everything to ensure a better future for their children. Such people are a lasting testimony to the idea that wherever there are women, children and men condemned to a life of poverty, their human rights are violated. It is our fundamental duty to unite in order to ensure that these rights are respected throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On 17 October 1987, in response to the call of Father Jozef Brezinsky, 100 000 defenders of human rights gathered in rue Trocadero in Paris to pay their respects to the victims of hunger, violence and ignorance. They demonstrated their opposition to poverty and called on the human race to unite in order to ensure respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament subsequently adopted this position in its annual reports on basic human rights in the European Union. In 1996, in the same spirit, the United Nations launched its first Decade for the Elimination of World Poverty. Through the Lisbon Agenda the European Union also became active in this area. Allow me to mention two important points that relate to this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the adoption of a position on participation. It is important for the poorest members of society to participate directly in the planning, implementation and evaluation of programmes and strategies. The World Bank, for example, has adopted precisely this type of participatory approach in the fight against poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the European institutions are concerned, there should be much more determination and conviction, as well as the appropriate instruments, if they are to be able to act effectively. In spite of the finest resolutions, European Community policy has not been sufficiently successful in dealing with the feminisation of poverty. Programmes to counter social exclusion often lack specific measures aimed at women. I am thinking, above all, of single mothers, widows, handicapped women and pensioners, women who have become dependent on others, and also of women who suffer sexual discrimination within their ethnic group or other minority.</p>
<p class="contents">In short the European project has failed to create equal opportunities. I am, however, filled with pride when I see women taking on important responsibilities with respect to inter-generational solidarity within the framework of the family. I am convinced that each and every woman can have a positive influence on the ways in which society is organised and its structure is shaped.</p>
<p class="contents">Since all women support basic human values like truth and justice, love and freedom, they should be supported in the fostering and propagation of these values in their family and professional lives. I would like to pay special homage to those who live far from their homes or in difficult conditions, but who manage to overcome their suffering and exhaustion in order to help their nearest and dearest. In this respect I utterly condemn those people traffickers who exploit vulnerable women and children like these.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important aspect is the Internal Stability Pact. It is generally recognised that poverty is a real test for democratic systems. In spite of this, the European Union heads of state and their governments have refused to recognise the elimination of poverty as one of the aims of the European Union in the draft Constitutional Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Many have already heard of the Stability and Growth Pact. On 17 October I would like to introduce another kind of stability pact, an internal stability pact, which would give women and impoverished families more self-esteem and dignity, a pact that would open the doors of society to women and the poor. We should support this pact for internal stability within an enlarged Europe and eliminate poverty, thereby promoting solidarity between generations, outlawing discrimination, and encouraging equality of opportunity and constructive dialogue, so that together we can build a genuine partnership with the weakest members of society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you also, Mrs Záborská, for your passionate speech.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot, however, go along with your general assertion that the European Union has failed to bring about equality. From the very beginning of the European Union, equality of opportunity has had a major role both in the Treaty and in legislation, and much has been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, though, that poverty, and consequently social exclusion, are more of a threat to women, including those in Europe’s Member States – whether in or out of work, whether young or old – than to men. Very many women have no secure income of their own and are financially dependent on their families or obliged to rely on minimal incomes. Many women of pensionable age have an inadequate pension or none at all, whether because they have never worked, have stopped working, have been obliged to stop working, or were employed part-time.</p>
<p class="contents">What is especially alarming is that, where families are in poverty, the burden falls to a disproportionate extent on women. There are two causes underlying this: one is the gender-specific aspects of working life and the other is the gender-specific division of labour in families. Single-parent families, most of which, as you have said, consist of women with children, very often find themselves in financial need, and we should have particular respect for women bringing up children on their own.</p>
<p class="contents">The adverse effects are compounded in the case of women belonging to at-risk or excluded groups such as immigrants, ethnic minorities or the disabled. Such women are very often the victims of multiple discrimination, something that has ceased to be acceptable, and this is where our campaign against poverty and social exclusion must start.</p>
<p class="contents">The efforts of the actors at European and national level to combat poverty among women and what you have termed the feminisation of poverty may be observed in the context of the open method of coordination in the field of social inclusion. Even though primary responsibility for this still lies with the Member States, the European Commission and the Social Protection Committee have an important part to play in effectively implementing the principle of gender mainstreaming.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the shared goals underpinning the process is gender balance, which is to be taken fully into account when drawing up action plans at national level. Such plans should also provide for measures geared to the specific needs of women, with the Member States being required to ensure the involvement of non-governmental organisations dealing with women’s specific needs in the development, follow-up and evaluation of the national action plans. Along with the open method of coordination in the spheres of poverty and exclusion, there is to be a Community action programme running until the end of 2006, and cooperation between the Member States in combating social exclusion is also to be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth mentioning that one criterion for the granting of financial aid – in the Structural Funds, for example – is the promotion of gender equality. As has already been mentioned, the Commission is aware that it is women in particular who are at risk of poverty when they reach retirement age. It is in relation to this that the open coordination method has also been applied to such issues as the adequacy of pensions and the financial sustainability of pension systems.</p>
<p class="contents">A series of initiatives taken at EU level over recent years have helped to give practical expression to the concerns raised by your House in its 1994 resolution on women’s poverty in Europe. These include, for example, not only the measures under the open method of coordination, but also the reversal of the burden of proof in legislation on gender equality and the latest directive based on Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities. Gender mainstreaming has been included in the European employment strategy, and reform of the Structural Funds involves giving them an even stronger gender equality dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure we are all agreed that reliable and specific data are needed if strategies are to be effective and focussed. Data, broken down by gender, are of crucial importance in combating poverty and social exclusion; without them, indicators cannot be watertight. The open method of coordination in relation to social exclusion uses a number of common indicators, supplemented by national data, as a framework for exchange and analysis. The breakdown of all indicators by gender is standard; they must also be divided up by reference to age in order to take special account of children and child poverty. The Commission regularly publishes quantitative information on poverty and social exclusion, and this is broken down by gender and age.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that the Commission is aware of the problems of women in poverty. It is also aware that poverty is one of the principal reasons and causes underlying the trafficking in women and other forms of sexual exploitation. I would like to press home the point that none of us – the European institutions, the Member States or society – can tolerate women falling victim to exploitation, whether this be sexual or takes some other form. We must continue to act decisively and make further effort to combat the causes that exist. We must ensure that more economic possibilities are open to women, that they gain greater economic independence and full access to economic resources, to support and assistance and to education. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It particularly caught my attention and I automatically thought that such a billboard would not be out of place in our societies, in the European Union. Unfortunately, we all need to realise this, even we who are responsible for policy-making and come into daily contact with reality, because it is something which offends our democracy and brings the effectiveness of our policies into question.</p>
<p class="contents">The statistics we have at our disposal are both revealing and worrying. An average of 15% in the European Union of the 15 at least, in the old European Union; anyway, the problem is chronic in most countries. Nor is the situation uniform and this is something which we should pay particular attention to, in order to find out why the situation is better in some places than others and what good results are being achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">From Sweden to Ireland and from the countries of the south to the new Member States, the situation is very serious everywhere for certain groups, such as the unemployed, single parents, the elderly living alone and families with large numbers of children and women are in the majority in all these groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens of the European Union – and women especially – have extremely acute concerns and demands, as we all saw during the European elections. That time is still very close. The debate on the Constitution will focus on these issues, if my experience is anything to go by. Let us all be prepared for that; we need to prepare not only our responses to the dialogue, but also our policies, at both European and national level. The debate on the financial perspectives for 2007-2013, the new regulation on the Structural Funds and next year's budget give us ample opportunity to turn our attention to these matters. However, it is not only the financial resources which we provide for employment and social support policies that count. A better qualitative approach to the evaluation of our policies is needed. We need to see if the money we provide is having an effect, at least in accordance with our wishes and calculations.</p>
<p class="contents">Are the European Commission and the Council (which is absent today, as usual during such debates) satisfied with the evaluation being made of the national action plans on employment, the national action plans for social integration, the results of coordination, to which you referred, Commissioner? Are they getting to the root of the problems and the results? Has the gender dimension been substantively integrated? The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality has insisted many times and has made numerous recommendations on efficient and substantive gender integration. However, for this special studies and research are needed, statistics need to be collated by category and, as you mentioned Commissioner, indicators are needed. We also need, of course, to look at all the statistics we collate at a harmonised level, because the statistics of certain Member States of the European Union are not harmonised. Harmonisation is necessary if we are to be able to collate real data and have comparative tables which will allow us to make better use of our policies of exchanging best practices. I believe that this is vital, not only to our cohesion in the Europe of the 25, but also to preparations for a new enlargement and to the success of the objectives of development aid in our foreign relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One might say that, at the Beijing World Conference on Women, Europe stood out as a beacon of women’s rights. We have always spearheaded them, and thus it is particularly painful that we have been unable to bring about any decisive reduction in the gap between the poor and the well-off in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I see poverty as having a woman’s face, and the facts make it apparent to all that there is still much to do to change that situation. Women still make up the majority in the groups at risk: the long-term unemployed, the lone parents and the impoverished elderly. It is particularly painful and tragic that children are at particularly high risk of poverty in our prosperous society, and let me just say that I was therefore particularly outraged by Mr Buttiglione’s discriminatory remarks about mothers who bring up children on their own. That is something we must not put up with nor allow to go unchallenged.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in education that the gender gap becomes glaringly apparent. A reading of UNESCO’s figures reveals that the lack of education is one of the key factors forcing women into poverty. Another factor in Europe is that we women are employed under insecure conditions; there is also the exceptionally high incidence of violence in these social groups. Maternal mortality is on the rise, and the lives of women living in poverty are at particular risk. Women are also especially hard hit by the epidemic of HIV and Aids, currently representing the majority of those newly infected worldwide. All these aspects we have to take into account and redouble our efforts to deal with them. The economic losses resulting from them are enormous, and so, when implementing the Lisbon strategy, and on the points to which the Commissioner referred, we should really press the point home that the key element underpinning the European social model is, in the final analysis, women’s development and support for them, and that we in Europe really do have the most generous resources for further empowering women and thereby making European society more human.</p>
<p class="contents">We on the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality demand that these points be incorporated in future major projects on the European social model, in the Progress programme, in the Structural Funds and in the new employment guidelines. The Constitutional Treaty provides us with good instruments for this purpose; let us make it come alive and, by means of gender mainstreaming, give women pride of place in our deliberations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nor do we have to be told that women are hit harder by poverty than men. For many years, we have talked about development, aid and solidarity, but in practice far too little money has been made available. We in the rich part of the world have, however, obtained large amounts of money at the expense of poor people far away. This applies above all to the EU, to which I am nonetheless thoroughly proud to belong.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty both within and outside the EU hits women harder than men. In and outside Europe, poverty is particularly widespread among women living in the countryside. When people can produce their own food, they have made at least a little progress in the fight against poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we in Europe help women in the very poorest countries? For me, the answer is simple. A large proportion of the world’s farmers are, in actual fact, women, and the EU has a crucial role to play regarding the developing countries’ food supply. Our agricultural policy with its subsidies, including export subsidies, is a direct impediment to families in developing countries being able to produce food to sell and being able to export products to our part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Through our policy, we are excluding them. By subsidising our own producers, we are dumping the prices on their market. Our agricultural policy is a disgrace to the EU. As you know, the responsibility does not lie with this House. It is no secret that Europe’s Heads of State or Government bear responsibility for the fact that approximately half of the EU budget helps make the world’s poor still poorer. This reverse aid policy must be brought to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, Commission President-designate Barroso received a rebuff. The fact that, here in Parliament, we succeeded in getting our act together and clearly emphasising that we did not accept a Commission based on homophobia and misogyny is a great victory. We in Parliament have the opportunity to do much more. Hopefully, we shall also be able to do away with the shameful agricultural policy. Only then shall we be able to say that the European Union is doing something to combat poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Poverty hits single parents, above all women with children, especially hard. Our society may well talk about children being its wealth, but the end result is poverty for the people who have many of them. This is indeed scandalous, and I believe that the Commission, in the Lisbon process and elsewhere, must do much more. There is a need for more employment for women, and it must be one of the EU’s most especial concerns to do more about childcare, in order to improve the situation as regards education and childcare.</p>
<p class="contents">We know too that older women are particularly affected. The removal of discrimination against women in private pension provision represented one small step in the right direction, but, here too, there still remains much more to be done. There are far too few indicators at European level to facilitate progress in the battle against poverty among women, and too little account is taken of the issue when making policy. The Commission needs to take another great leap forward in order that more account may be taken of women’s issues, of equality for women, in the EU’s policy areas.</p>
<p class="contents">There are too few statistics to really back that up. I hope that the Commission will keep to its timetable for the Gender Institute and that there will be no further delays. As the Council has emphasised, we need the Gender Institute, not only to collate these statistics, but also, perhaps, to derive conclusions from them.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finally mention one point that has not been made so far, namely women and the environment. We know that the destruction of the environment increases the risk of poverty, particularly in what we call the Third World. It follows that sustainable development must continue to be at the top of the list of priorities on the agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is that not reason enough for abandoning the neo-liberal economic policy with its Stability and Growth Pact and convergence rules? This policy has, of course, proved not to lead to equality or reduced poverty. On the contrary.</p>
<p class="contents">Patriarchal power structures permeate the whole of our society, in both the Member States and, above all, in the European Union. Gender equality is definitely not a feature of the EU’s economic policy which is, in large part, designed by and for men. Gender equality is a feature neither of economics, politics, education nor health care.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is poverty characterised by gender equality. Women are hit hardest and are most exposed to poverty and to the consequences of living in poverty. I have to acknowledge that it is sometimes quite wearying year after year to hear people in power coming out with fine words about, for example, objectives in terms of gender equality and of reduced poverty for women and, at the same time, to know that extremely little is happening in terms of practical action.</p>
<p class="contents">Female poverty is not a law of nature. Nor should it be. With the right political and economic decisions, this state of affairs can be changed. I also want to ask why the principle of ‘gender mainstreaming’ has still not been implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Statistics show that of the EU’s 450 million inhabitants, over 65 million suffer from poverty or even live in destitution that is an affront to their human dignity. In the countries that recently joined the European Union, the problem has been particularly exacerbated by a drop in production, an increase in the level of unemployment and the economic expansion of rich countries. This is especially true of my homeland, Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, enlargement of the EU cannot be said to be a success if it is occurring at the cost of great suffering, distress and injustice, along with a widening of the gap between the rich and the poor. When poverty turns into destitution, it becomes a threat to peace. As the Holy Father John Paul II reminds us, ‘if you want peace, reach out to the poor’. Poor countries are not only up against the problem of debt. They have to face many other disturbing problems including lack of access to education and health care, mental disorders, depression, suicide, addiction, various diseases, the forced prostitution of women and children and even human trafficking. They also have to deal with the problem of migration and the threat it poses to the stability of the family, or in other words to that of the whole of society. Stressful working conditions and the exploitation of workers mean that the future appears ever more uncertain.</p>
<p class="contents">The impact of poverty is felt most by those who live in rural areas, by the unemployed, disabled people and invalids, the majority of whom are children and women. These latter should be afforded special protection, as they are responsible for raising the next generation. It is women, weighed down not only by housework but also by paid employment, who shoulder the enormous burden imposed by the effects of the transformation process, and this holds true for my country as well. Ever-increasing numbers of people in Poland are affected by poverty. On a global scale, women carry out two thirds of all work, but are said to receive less than 5% of global income, and own less than 1% of global property. Thought should therefore be given to whether the illusory and superficial increase in the percentage of women in governing bodies can compensate for these injustices. It is important to consider whether the Community’s key watchwords of democracy, equal rights and equal opportunities should not be replaced by respect for moral principles and changes to economic mechanisms to guarantee a more equal division of property. Concrete measures to provide active help and care for those who need it are probably called for. Dealing with the issue in a mature way means adopting an in-depth approach. If this is not understood, the material poverty of millions will be as nothing in comparison to the spiritual destitution of the powerful and wealthy of this world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is even evidence to suggest that poverty is becoming an increasingly feminine problem.</p>
<p class="contents">This poverty is due to obvious social factors and, crucially, to inequalities between girls and boys in terms of access to schooling, university education and professional training. Without training, no job and no salary. Without a salary, no social security contributions and therefore no medical or social insurance, no unemployment benefit and no pension. It follows that poverty increases with illness and, when old age comes, the situation becomes desperate. Nevertheless, these women have undeniably made a significant contribution to society throughout their lives by raising their children and doing jobs that are menial, badly paid and, usually, undeclared. As you will be aware, this poverty is also the cause of discrimination against women and trafficking in women.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that it is vital to tackle this evil at its roots, because scattering individual subsidies around will not solve the problem for good and will not eradicate poverty amongst women. We must do all we can to ensure that they have equal access to schooling and professional training. That is where we need to start in our fight against poverty which particularly affects women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, a lot of research has shown that women have borne the main part of the burden of transition in the new Member States, both from the psychological point of view and the socio-economic point of view. This is also closely linked to the feminisation of poverty. Both unemployed and employed women run the risk of poverty. As far as employed women are concerned, this applies in particular to the lowest paid professions and is primarily the result of the fact that women’s pay has long been around 25% lower on average than men’s pay. This is not an exception but an average that applies to virtually the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of unemployed women, it is the elderly in particular who find themselves in the most complex and difficult situations. In some countries, time spent raising children has not been taken into account and this particularly applies to single mothers.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been shown that the opportunity to get out of the poverty trap is reduced where there is little work and long-term unemployment, and that the opportunity is further reduced the longer a person has been unemployed. In my home country of Slovakia, according to the latest statistics issued by the Statistics Office and calculated according to Eurostat methods, up to 21% of the population is at risk of poverty or lives below the poverty line.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation is that one of the most important dimensions in sustainable development is the social dimension, and poverty in particular. The feminisation of poverty is not a problem restricted to the new Member States. Moreover, it is quite clear that poverty amongst women often results in the social exclusion of children, thereby impacting on the future prospects of the new generation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support the view that these questions are urgent, including the need to strengthen gender-specific statistics within the framework of building a knowledge-based society. I also agree that certain countries, and in particular the governments of certain countries, are attempting to make light of the problem of poverty, as if it were a symptom of personal failure.</p>
<p class="contents">I expect the European Commission to take a more robust policy in this respect too.</p>

This is not exclusively a women’s problem, but it does particularly affect women. Women earn lower salaries and receive a lower level of social protection. They are the last to gain access to permanent work and the first to be laid off. Women’s economic dependency places constraints on their freedom. As for poor single mothers, how many of them have no means of feeding their children, no roof to shelter them and no government support on which to live with a minimum of dignity?</p>
<p class="contents">These single mothers, whom Mr Buttiglione chose to insult, are real heroines. Fortunately, Parliament gave him the response he deserved and I was delighted to hear Mrs Schreyer say that we must respect single mothers. I trust that Mr Barroso will also keep this in mind in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything is linked: poverty, disease, illiteracy, lack of academic success, infant and maternal mortality, urban and environmental decay, social discrimination, lack of professional qualifications, unemployment, promiscuity, domestic violence, trafficking in human beings. Around 700 000 women and children every year are seized by networks of human traffickers. The European Institutions cannot turn a blind eye to this shocking figure. It is because of poverty that more children than ever are abandoned, raped, trafficked, beaten up and even murdered by their own parents. Everything is linked, such as poverty and death due to backstreet abortion, as we showed recently in this House with regard to the case of the boat belonging to the ‘Women on Waves’ movement. We must not forget that those who suffer most from the consequences of criminalising the voluntary termination of pregnancy are women from the poorest sections of society. Poor women pay with their health and even with their lives for the monstrous laws that prevent them from gaining access to a safe and hygienic voluntary termination of pregnancy. Such is the case in Ireland, Poland and Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against the social exclusion of women requires practical measures, as, in fact, laid down in the Lisbon Strategy. What is needed is an updated reading of the Lisbon Strategy to include a gender perspective. The Europe that we want and deserve must show greater solidarity, fairness and humanity towards women too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The gap between words and action is still worryingly large when it comes to women’s rights and, as a result, poverty has been feminised in the world. We must put our faith in women in the poor countries and, in that way, also fulfil the UN’s Millennium Declaration, which states that extreme poverty must be halved by 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no simple solution. Poverty is solved not through money but through commitment to human rights and sustainable development. The award of the Nobel prize to Wangari Maathai is an example of what can be done.</p>
<p class="contents">By guaranteeing women’s rights, land and water are also secured, as well as opportunities for self-provision and local development. We must dare to make demands of the surrounding world. That is why it is important for women to be accorded full status in aid policy, both as aid providers and as aid receivers.

<p class="contents">The situation becomes worse still as the number of people thus affected increases. Some figures indicate the seriousness of the situation, which, incidentally, varies considerably from country to country. In the EU, for example, over 51% of the approximately 20 million unemployed are women. In other words, unemployment, just like poverty, has a female face and seriously affects the women who are victims of multinational companies restructuring and relocating, as happens in my country, Portugal. On the subject of unemployment, the latest Eurostat figures show that across the 25 Member States of the EU, only 38% of permanent posts are held by women, meaning that most work done by women is insecure. Even so, the overall employment rate among women is only 55%, whilst that of men is as high as 71%.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore not enough to defend the principle of equality. What is needed is a root-and-branch review of Community policies, with priority given to jobs, social inclusion and the fight against discrimination. This would entail a change in the financial and monetary policies of the European Central Bank and the Stability and Growth Pact, which should be replaced by a development, jobs and social inclusion pact. Similarly, with regard to the Lisbon Strategy, the policy on competition and the internal market must be amended to guarantee access for all to high-quality public services in education, training, health care, social protection, public transport and housing, and to promote social inclusion and economic cohesion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If, on average – as has been said – women’s pay is much lower than men's pay, it is essential that we take effective measures to deal directly with the causes of this discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true – as you have said, Commissioner – that the employment discrimination suffered by many women is a result of their having had fewer opportunities for access to education and training and also, in many cases, difficulties reconciling family life with working life. This unquestionably has an effect on the nature of their jobs and their salaries, but it is equally true that many women directly suffer hidden wage discrimination, either because many of them are employed in the lower paid posts, or because lower salaries are paid to categories largely made up of women or because reducing women’s rights increases the incentive to employ them. It is therefore urgent, Commissioner, that we prevent, detect and also eliminate these types of discrimination in order to achieve true equality of pay.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to refer, although very briefly, to increasing female emigration. For years, men have made up the bulk of migratory flows, while women came to our territory solely for reasons of family regrouping. Nevertheless, the model is changing quickly and in recent years more and more women have been emigrating on an individual and direct basis with a view to joining the workforce.</p>
<p class="contents">The high number of lone women immigrants, whose family burdens are not shared with anyone, who undoubtedly face two-fold discrimination on grounds of origin and on grounds of gender, oblige us, Commissioner, to pay much more specific attention to women immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, putting an end to the increasing feminisation of poverty is an issue we must all be fully committed to, because we must remember that we are talking about justice and well-being for everybody. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, no one has yet addressed this issue with efficient and radical reform. A new social map is needed, based on a specific and integrated strategy to combat poverty and social exclusion in all social classes, especially among women.</p>
<p class="contents">At European level, the most basic policy for combating poverty is to determine the minimum guaranteed income, which is something which could start to be applied to the female population on the margins of poverty. Such a policy will ensure that the entire population receives a satisfactory income. The minimum income is the income that needs to be used as a transitional stage, for reintegrating women into employment, and combined with development policies inside and outside the Community, with social insurance and health policies, social welfare policies, housing and child support policies, education and training policies, rural development policies and employment policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation between all the countries of the European Union, between local and regional authorities, is important and necessary in order to mitigate the new types of poverty among immigrants and the emergence of groups of <span class="italic">nouveaux pauvres</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, as you well know, addressing poverty is not the priority of social policies, of Community policies and the Structural Funds. The Member States, like the Community, are strengthening the competitiveness of the European economy, rather than social issues, such as women's issues and poverty. The modern European model, Commissioner, cannot be put to shame by marginalised social classes such as women, with whom impoverishment begins. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While it would be worthwhile to consider many of the points made, I would like to highlight two of them, one being the connection between the European Budget, agricultural expenditure and poverty – including among women – in the developing world. The statement has been made that something like one half of the Budget would help to further aggravate the poverty of women in the developing world. I cannot allow that assertion to go unchallenged. You made, of course, specific reference to agricultural subsidies, at a time when the Commission, in negotiations within the World Trade Organisation, has made progress in reducing agricultural and export subsidies and opening up greater opportunities to the countries of the developing world.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, agricultural expenditure does of course play an essential part in preventing poverty in rural areas and in the agricultural sector. We are all aware of how poverty, rural areas and women are interlinked, and so our European Budget’s programmes for fostering development in rural areas are of immense importance in keeping women out of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">My next point has to do with the Lisbon strategy. You asked about broad outlines and specific proposals. I would like to remind you that it was the Commission that devoted its efforts to formulating the objective, as part of the Lisbon strategy, of increasing the number of women in employment, and that in a relatively short time. Then it was the Commission, too, that pointed out that it was impossible to simply set an increase in the number of women in employment as a target without giving practical attention to childcare. Without that, the goal of getting more women into work is beyond reach, and, as a woman, I was very happy to learn that the Heads of State and Government, at a summit, had considered the issue of childcare facilities and had come up with a resolution to the effect that childcare needs to be more readily available. The fact is, of course, that you cannot make Europe more competitive without increasing women’s opportunities for employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
