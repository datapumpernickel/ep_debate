So where do we stand today in the implementation of the project? As foreseen, the pre-qualification tendering procedure for the programme management unit was launched in June this year and the tenders will be opened on 20 July at the ACP Secretariat General. The committee evaluating the tenders will consist of three members designated by the ACP Secretariat and three members designated by the Commission. This committee will decide which companies will participate in the tender for the programme management unit. I expect that this programme management unit will be in place by December this year at the latest; with some luck, a couple of weeks before.</p>
<p class="contents">This would keep us within the original time schedule foreseen for the implementation of the project. The project will not be fully operational before the programme management unit is up and running. However, in view of the importance of some of the activities in the project in particular, the Commission has taken steps to begin on an ad hoc basis to implement some of the actions foreseen in the project, and this is already going on. It includes seminars on capacity building sessions of the ACP Ministerial Trade Committee for negotiations of new, WTO-compatible, trading arrangements with the EU. Two sessions of this kind have taken place, one in Johannesburg on 10 and 11 April 2001 and a second one in Brussels on 13 and 14 May.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a seminar was organised at the second meeting of the heads of ACP organisations working on regional integration on 3 and 4 May this year in Brussels and further seminars are scheduled to take place in the period July/September this year. So all these action-oriented seminars are actually in the process of taking place. We can either be satisfied that the preparation and implementation is on track or be disappointed and frustrated because it is such a slow track, but this has to do with more general problems, which we may not be able to take care of today. Let me also say that, important and useful as these activities are, they are not, and never were, preconditions for the opening up of trade negotiations in September 2002 in accordance with the Cotonou Agreement. But I understand well why the question has been put. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The honourable Member will recall that at the Faro meeting of the European Council in June last year, Member States signed up to an ambitious target of 5 000 police officers for international missions to be available by 2003. Preparatory work has progressed well since then. The necessary structures are being established in the Council, including a police unit in the Council secretariat.</p>
<p class="contents">The ESDP report to Göteborg contains a police action plan, which sets out the next steps in the process. A ministerial conference will be held by the end of 2001 at which the Faro commitments should be turned into specific pledges. The Belgian presidency will also continue work with the police experts' group to look in more detail at the modalities for implementation of the Faro commitments, particularly qualitative aspects, such as training, selection criteria and equipment. The Commission is being supportive of the efforts of Member States in creating this crisis management capacity, for example with the funding of training projects through the OISIN programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also become more involved over recent years in local capacity building and police reform in post-conflict situations. Just to give some examples, the Commission is funding major initiatives for reform in justice and home affairs, including police, in a number of Balkan countries under the CARDS programme. In that context, the Commission will take over the WEU police mission in Albania. The Commission is also providing technical assistance and training to the police in Central America, in Guatemala and El Salvador, as part of the implementation of peace agreements in those countries. Furthermore, the Commission has recently started a programme of support to police training in Algeria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, we can make a particularly important contribution by trying to ensure that training in this area, and in others which are related to civilian crisis management, is compatible with that provided by the UN. The UN and the European Union – the European Commission – now have more experience than others in this area and it is absolutely imperative that we ensure that the training provided – whether for police officers, people running penitentiaries, justices of the peace or magistrates – is compatible and appropriate wherever their services are required.

<p class="contents">What we are looking for is not a conventional community police officer. What we require is a trained officer – man or woman – who is capable of the traditional policing functions of detection, who is capable of providing community policing, and capable, from time to time, of the sort of paramilitary policing which is needed, for example, in parts of the West Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">In the country I know best there are very few police forces who have that sort of capacity, which includes the regular use of arms. The police service in Northern Ireland is an example of a service which has that sort of all-round capacity. That is one reason why it is difficult to provide exactly what is required, but whether or not arms will always be necessary will depend on the circumstances. I hope that the success of policing will mean that arms, increasingly, are not required. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also believe that intellectual property rights are essential for encouraging creativity and innovation. In our opinion, they also encourage investment in research and the development of new medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">The TRIPs agreement, a WTO agreement on intellectual property, should not, therefore, be a barrier it should be part of the solution that you are looking for. Criticism of this agreement is generally based on the fact that it would limit the political options in developing countries in the area of public health.</p>
<p class="contents">Our position focuses, in the main, on one key point. We believe that the agreement allows WTO members sufficient scope to put in place an intellectual property regime that is able to meet their concerns in terms of public health. Our belief is that it is up to the WTO members, within the Council for Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs Council), to interpret this degree of flexibility, rather than leaving this up to a panel.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the European Union has already been working for some time in order to reach a consensus between the WTO members instead of leaving the way open to legal disputes. This is also why we supported the request from African countries to bring up the question of access to medicines at the WTO. This debate took place at the last Council meeting held on 20 June 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">We presented a document, which summed up our views on some of the provisions of the agreement, such as Article 31, for example, which does not specify the grounds for issuing a compulsory licence. We believe that these concerns regarding public health can, legitimately, be considered as good grounds for granting a compulsory licence.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is that of respecting procedural restrictions. On this point, we think the procedure provides enough flexibility in cases of national emergencies and that the current rate of HIV/AIDS infection in some developing countries constitutes this type of emergency and that intellectual property can also be lifted if a patent is required in cases of public non-commercial use.</p>
<p class="contents">Our position on this point is, therefore, constructive. We are committed to protecting intellectual property, which is an important stimulus, but we also believe that this must and can be achieved within the existing legal framework, as long as it is clarified in order to take account of urgent public health situations.</p>
<p class="contents">To refer to the recent debate at the WTO, many developing countries, such as India, Brazil and some countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia, presented a document which welcomed this debate. Like us, they stressed the need to ensure that this agreement does not compromise the rights of WTO members to draw up and implement health policies designed to safeguard public health.</p>
<p class="contents">This group of countries also stressed that the use of compulsory licensing was a crucial instrument for putting in place these public health policies and giving wider access to medicines. Lastly, they believed it was necessary to look into extending temporary provisions to implement this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the information available to us, none of the WTO members have yet requested a debate on reducing the term of patents. The patent term is currently set at 20 years and further negotiation of the agreement would be needed in order to change this requirement. The same is true with regard to the idea of a moratorium on possible trade disputes, which is not permitted under the current agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore maintain the position that we have held in this matter, to the satisfaction, I believe, of most of the parties involved, which is to find an appropriate balance between the interests of the patent holder and public health concerns. We shall continue to discuss this issue in a constructive manner. The TRIPs Council will be holding further meetings in July and September. It is, of course, rather premature to issue an opinion on the content of the decisions that come out of these meetings but, whatever those decisions are, rest assured, Mrs Sandbæk, that the Commission is committed to finding the right balance between these two objectives – namely, to acknowledge inventors’ rights and to provide access to essential medicines – and we will continue to be committed to this over the coming months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have our own interpretation which we have made clear, but we will not leave the matter there. We shall be discussing this interpretation at a meeting of the TRIPs Council, which we and others have requested. Like others, we believe that the text has achieved the right balance but that WTO members must hold a debate on its interpretation so that it is they and not the judges who decide. Therefore, this certainly shows political will.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point on transition periods has not, as far as I know, been the subject of any requests. There have been no disputes on this issue either, since, as I am sure you are aware, Brazil and the United States settled the matter out of court last week and I would like to point out that the European Union was not involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and final point concerns the length of patents protection. In this case, we believe that the current length of patents protection again provides an adequate balance between the need to preserve intellectual property and public health requirements. I believe our position on this point to be effective. We are among those who draw attention to the issue of access to medicines. Admittedly, there are other issues including those relating to public health systems and the availability of care. I believe that, in this matter, we are being true to the position that we hold generally, namely, to bridge the gap, using an acceptable and proactive approach, between the concerns of developing countries and those of some countries in the North, that are concerned about the protection of intellectual property. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The product then still has to be launched and another 20 years must elapse before third parties can manufacture it. That is why the question arises as to whether instead of resorting to patent rights and compulsory licences, it would not be better to have a development fund for such cases and to make an effort, at international level, to make a large amount of money available so that by means of bulk purchasing medicines can be made available at correspondingly low prices. Let us not forget that the selling price is a combination of manufacturing costs and licence fees. Companies would be able to supply medicines at more favourable prices if volume purchasing applied. So my question is whether the Commission could take an initiative in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a tiered pricing option mid-way between the strict protection of intellectual property, the patent system in other words, and exceptions to this system such as compulsory licensing, and this is the option that we have considered in conjunction with the pharmaceutical industry and some of the countries concerned. Tiered pricing involves a pharmaceutical laboratory reducing the prices that we pay on our markets by around 10% for countries such as Africa, for example, whilst still owning its patent.</p>
<p class="contents">This process is beginning to get off the ground although its scope is, in our view, fairly limited at the present time, and it will be the subject of an international initiative, which has, moreover, already been launched by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The idea is for there to be a joint fund, to which several countries have already contributed and which will be used to buy medicines wholesale at low cost, which will therefore solve this part of the problem regarding price-related access, provided that the necessary funds are in place. For the time being, however, the funds are still very limited.</p>
<p class="contents">I would reiterate that the price of medicines is just part of a much wider problem which, in the main, relates to the health care system, distribution and the ability of the people concerned, particularly in the case of AIDS, to take their medicine regularly, something which involves extremely complicated medical procedures. In general, however, to answer your question, yes, the international community is moving in this direction and the European Union will follow suit since some funding has already been earmarked for this purpose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Testing cosmetics on animals and the WTO</span></p>
<p class="contents">Under WTO rules, imported products must be treated the same as ‘like products’ of domestic origin. In past cases of dispute, a decision is based on the end product and not the way a product is produced. It has been argued, therefore, that the introduction of a ban on the marketing of cosmetic products if they are tested on animals will result in a trade war as the process, i.e. not testing on animals, would not be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of the Parliament’s vote on 3 April 2001 to move towards such a ban, what action would the Commission take to avoid a potential trade war and does the Commission consider that the WTO rules should be interpreted to include the processing of a product when deciding on its 'likeness'? </p>

<p class="contents">The Commission shares Parliament’s objective of improving animal welfare and we fully acknowledge that placing restrictions on animal testing would contribute to the achievement of this objective. On the other hand, the European Union is also required to provide a high level of health protection and to ensure that its policies are in line with its international commitments. Now, a marketing ban that is based not on the product characteristics but on manufacturing procedures would certainly force many of our trading partners to change their policy and legislation in order to be able to enter our market. This could, in fact, provoke a reaction. We should be aware that, until now, animal testing is the only method used in most countries to assess the safety of products intended for consumption, particularly cosmetics.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as we are concerned, we remain convinced that there are other methods, aside from a marketing ban – which is Parliament’s position – which can be used to bring an end to testing the finished product and its cosmetic ingredients on animals. This is the purpose of the proposal that the Commission made in order to ban animal testing within the European Union. In our opinion it is the acceptance of alternative testing methods by the international community that will provide the most effective contribution to animal welfare. We are committed to encouraging the use of <span class="italic">in vitro</span> cosmetic testing, particularly within the OECD in order to move forward in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to provide a precise answer to your question, Mr Purvis, we believe that there is a strong possibility that the WTO may challenge a marketing ban, if it enters into force. There are many issues to be considered in this matter such as extra-territoriality and proportionality of this and many others measures.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the issue regarding ‘like products’, the GATT panels supported the fact that the determination of identity criteria of two products can only be based on the characteristics of the end product and not on the way that the product is produced. In other words, production methods and processes cannot be taken into consideration when coming to a decision on the issue of a product’s identity.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe that any defence against an attack based on a product’s identity has little, or hardly any, chance of succeeding at the World Trade Organisation. This is also the reason why, on a number of occasions, we have drawn Parliament’s attention to the danger of moving in this direction from the point of view of respecting our international commitments, which we believe should also be one of Parliament’s concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal must, therefore, be appreciated within the context of protecting animal welfare, guaranteeing a high level of health protection and avoiding legal disputes, which would certainly cause problems for everybody concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that this situation – meaning rules which allow measures on production methods to be established only within strict limits – is far from satisfactory. This applies to the WTO’s current legislation. This is the reason why we hope to be able to include these issues in the agenda of the next round of WTO negotiations. If current legislation can be changed – and we hope that we are able to clarify it in this area – then so much the better. As the texts currently stand, there is a risk that disputes will arise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is preferable that I avoid disputes altogether. I believe that my task, therefore, particularly in my dealings with the Council and Parliament, is to be totally honest when a Council or Parliament decision might mean we are in danger of losing a dispute. I am sure you have a good understanding of the risk. The proof of this, in fact, is that we are now discussing the implications that all this will have on sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot say what the current situation is because, in order for sanctions to be taken against the European Union, a panel would have to be set up, we would have to fail before this panel and the amount of sanctions would then have to be assessed. In general, the amount of sanctions is assessed by considering the volume of trade affected. In a hypothetical scenario, in other words, a scenario where this proposal ends up becoming a European Union proposal, which is not yet the case, if it is challenged and if we lose, the volume of trade in question must be assessed and, at that point, we would have an idea of the system of sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would reiterate, so that you have all the details, that in this case, sanctions do not necessarily and do not generally target the industries which are at the root of the problem. They target others, since sanctions are chosen by the party who wins the dispute at the WTO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You yourself referred to the possibility of bringing up in the next WTO round the question of whether in the future more attention could be paid to the way the product is produced in these trade issues, in other words not merely the end product.

It is my duty, and I think that I do this openly, to explain that, when a political decision taken by the European Union brings us into conflict with our international commitments, as would be the case here, then the people who are taking this decision must be made aware of the risks they are taking. If you want to run this risk, do so. I will handle it. Incidentally, I believe that there are more intelligent, less risky ways of resolving this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, we could consider a compromise solution between our proposal to ban testing and your position to ban marketing, in other words, that of labelling requirements. From the point of view of international trade legislation, these requirements present less of a risk than a ban on marketing. If we could move in this direction, in order to bring together both our points of view, I believe that we would avoid provoking useless disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to our desire to have some of the WTO rules clarified, in order to allow the European Union to move in the direction that it wishes, and this concerns production methods, for example. We hope to move in this direction since we are relatively isolated at the moment. One of the reasons for this is that we are faced with the belief of some of the developing countries that the use of these production methods may equate to protectionist measures. We are, therefore, in need of some very strong arguments in order to show that this matter is not about protection, it is a matter of collective preference and that we each have our own ethics. Within the European Union, animal welfare is part of our ethics, although this is not necessarily the case in other countries – as we can see – and perception varies according to the level of development.</p>
<p class="contents">This is our position. We will do everything that we can so that this issue is placed on the agenda of the next round of negotiations, so that progress can be made. I make no secret of the fact that, at the moment, our position is hardly shared at all in other parts of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From this perspective, it is quite straightforward. It is sometimes slightly more complicated, as demonstrated, for example, by the panel on hormone-treated beef, at which we were unsuccessful. As we imposed a ban on hormone-treated beef within the Union, we banned imports of it as well, but the conditions of this ban meant that it was found to be in breach of international legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, the principles which apply are those of non-discrimination and of proportionality and the national treatment principle. These are the principles that we wish to see taken into account in the agenda on the environment at the negotiations, especially everything which relates to the precautionary principle. We have some way to go before this can be done. There are risks in what we are doing within the European Union – in some cases, perhaps – with regard to existing laws which are considered to be excessive. Therefore, on the one hand, we must adjust our internal approach and, on the other, we must adjust international legislation to our own preferences, which is only possible if other countries are in favour of changing this international legislation which is outside of our control. Since we do not have any particular unilateralist tendencies, we must, therefore, change the legislation on a number of points or, at the very least, clarify its position on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the situation at the current time. We are aware of your concerns in this area. We support them, particularly from an ethical standpoint. I cannot hide the fact that, as things currently stand, some of your plans will pose serious problems from the WTO’s point of view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given this context, public administrations’ accounts will balance out in 2001, the labour market situation will improve and the unemployment rate will fall for the second consecutive year, reaching 10.3% in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to real production growth, the Commission’s estimate is slightly lower than that given by the Greek authorities at the end of 2000 and is reflected in the stability programme drawn up in spring 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission forecasts take account of shrinking world demand in the first few months of the year and therefore differ from those given by the Greek authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, contrary to what might appear to be the case, the macroeconomic forecasts of the Commission’s stability programme are worse than the Greek forecasts. For the moment, there are no grounds to believe that the medium-term prospects for the stability programme are any less valid.</p>
<p class="contents">We, as the Commission, will soon be initiating work on the autumn forecasts and for the moment do not envisage making significant changes in the case of Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">According to recent announcements by the Greek authorities, given the new, less favourable, international climate, the national forecasts will be adjusted more towards the Commission’s spring forecasts. In any event, in the 2001 update of the stability programme, which is due to be presented by the end of the year, the Greek authorities will undertake the necessary adjustment of their medium-term macroeconomic outlook and an assessment of the impact of this on public finances. To summarise very briefly, the economic situation is not particularly favourable, but since this assessment still falls within the levels forecast in the stability programme and in its 2001 update, we do not feel that the problems are as serious as some speakers are suggesting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should just like to correct your last finding: I do not foresee any deterioration in the situation and, may I say, nor do I wish for one. I am just a little concerned by what I see. You say that the programme will be updated at the end of the year. But Greece's entire economic policy is already being drawn up on the basis of the assumption that there will be a large budgetary surplus rather than equilibrium, as you said, and that unemployment will fall. At the same time, there are absolutely no data concerning Greece in all the statistics on the Union. You have no official data. At least those of us who read the statistics do not. If you have some other statistics, then maybe things are different.</p>
<p class="contents">This was the thrust of my question. And my question does not refer just to Greece; it refers to all the countries of the European Union, which is why I should like you to tell me more about public finances and changes in unemployment. I think this updating exercise should already have begun. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I was saying just now – and Greece’s case applies to the other Member States too – the stability pacts are based on figures provided by the countries themselves. It is true that the Commission’s estimates in some cases give higher or lower figures than those given in the stability pact, but leaving aside the figures given in the stability pacts, which are, nevertheless crucial to understanding developments in public finances, we can already state that our estimates for a growth of 2.8% today represent an excessively optimistic position. We also feel that our actual growth percentages will be much closer to the Union’s growth potential, which stands at around 2.5%.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, even with this growth rate of close to 2.5% – a little above or a little below – we feel that employment will continue to be created in the Union and, for the time being, we have not yet seen any significant fall in employment growth or an increase in unemployment. Unemployment continues to fall. For the moment, therefore, we continue to be relatively optimistic about developments in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of public finances, it is true that the less favourable economic climate might have some impact. With this eventuality in mind, the Commission has already stated its position on public finances to the Council, indicating that, in our opinion, we should allow the automatic stabilisers to play their full role in those countries that have achieved a more or less balanced position in terms of public finance and in other countries that have a national debt of around 60%.</p>
<p class="contents">In this situation, the countries in which the automatic stabilisers should not be allowed to play their full role should be the four countries with deficits of more than 1% and the three that have a debt of close to 100%. Italy is included in both groups. The remaining countries are Germany, France and Portugal where deficit is concerned and Greece and Belgium in the case of national debt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I would point out to him that the Commission is not responsible for the introduction of notes and coins. As he knows, notes are the responsibility of the Central Bank and the system of central banks and, in the case of coins, it is the national authorities who are responsible. However, with regard to the changeover process, we must distinguish between activities within the eurozone and those outside it. Within the eurozone, it is the central banks and the mints, or the Finance Ministries, who have decided on the changeover plans. Outside the eurozone, it is considered basically as a commercial activity and it is left to the whim of the market. That means that the national banks are not, therefore, involved in the logistics and channels for distributing the new coins or recovering the old coins, and they must maintain the systems they have traditionally used for this type of operation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it is true that there is concern within the European Central Bank and in some national banks, in particular the German Central Bank, as a result of the enormous number of German Marks in existence outside the eurozone, that action should be taken to support the changeover situation in the countries outside the zone. In this respect, on 14 December 2000, the European Central Bank took the decision to allow frontloading or the pre-supply of euros to those financial institutions which are branches or subsidiaries of European banks in the countries outside the eurozone. Clearly, if the Central Bank is working on the possibility of pre-supply, the first step has been taken for this type of financial body to be able to move ahead with the process following the change of currency.</p>
<p class="contents">In the former Yugoslavia there are three different cases: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo and Montenegro. In the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina, we are talking about a currency board with a national currency linked to the Mark with an exchange rate of 1 to 1. However, it is the case that that currency belongs to Bosnia-Herzegovina and will not undergo any change in itself. It will no longer have a relationship with the Mark, but a set relationship with the euro and will be approximately half of the euro, which is the same as the Mark-euro relationship. With regard to Kosovo, there is a significant level of possession of physical<span class="bold"> </span>currency. It is an economy where the currency circulation is based on notes which are not normally from the area and which, in particular, are not from the Mark zone. The Yugoslavian Dinar is still legal tender, but it is also the case that the Mark is in circulation and it was recognised as a currency which can operate and the circulation of the euro will clearly not change that situation. There is a specific problem of how to change these Marks which are circulating into euro notes and coins. According to my information, the German Central Bank, which, at the time, became aware of this situation, is thinking about which solution to adopt for this type of situation. The problem of Montenegro is similar. In November 1999, it decided to unilaterally establish a double currency system between the Mark and a parallel currency; on 1 December, the Government of Montenegro declared the Mark to be the only legal currency in the territory of the republic and, as in Kosovo, the Commission has no powers to act and, in our opinion, it will also fall to the Federal Republic of Germany’s Central Bank to take the relevant decisions in order to carry out operations other than frontloading operations which, as I said before, will be carried out using branches and subsidiaries of the European banks which work in that area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That basically means maintaining a period of exchange rate stability for two years, approximately, not from any old moment but logically from the moment they are members of the European Union and, in accordance with the interpretation of the Council of Ministers, they must be part of the exchange rate mechanism for a period of two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Some countries have raised the difficulties caused by reversing stable exchange rate systems such as they have at the moment (this is the case with Estonia, with its currency board linked to the Mark) and that it would mean returning to a system of greater flexibility and of currency flotation in order to retrieve a situation of stable exchange rates. For that reason, the official interpretation and application is that the situation of the countries which have a currency board, if they are linked to European currencies, is compatible with the exchange rate mechanism, although these decisions are clearly adopted unilaterally by the countries involved. To put it another way, the responsibility to maintain stability of the exchange rate falls to the national authorities and they will not receive any type of privileged treatment, apart from that resulting from their presence in the exchange rate mechanism. This is the situation which has been maintained and clearly, <span class="italic">sensu contrario</span>, the interpretation must be that neither the Central Bank nor the Council nor, of course, we in the Commission, are in favour of ‘euroisation’ processes which in some cases have been suggested and which, in our view, in no event should allow entry to the euro through the back door or allow countries which do not fulfil the conditions set for all Member States of the European Union to benefit from the advantages of being in the euro legally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In both cases it is perfectly justified to possess these holdings. And there is no problem in changing these holdings into the new euro, via their commercial banks, via the European banks which have branches or subsidiaries in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain different cases are raised: the possible existence of European currency on unofficial or black-market networks. There must clearly not be any favourable treatment for this type of situation. The same rules must be applied as for exchange in the European Union, that is, in those cases where somebody is identified as the holder of a quantity of a currency, the exchange takes place without any type of risk, even for quantities greater than the minimum amounts laid down in the money laundering directive. When quantities are exchanged which do not reach the limits of the directive on money laundering, the exchange may take place without requesting identification of the holder of the funds. However, in my opinion, when the quantities are high and exceed those laid down, identification should be demanded.</p>
<p class="contents">You have raised a different problem. Since this requirement is going to be maintained, is it not possible that some of these holdings will move to the dollar. Firstly, we do not have that impression, given the figures for the inflow of notes into the different central banks; secondly, in the countries which have signed up to the obligations of the money laundering convention, the same criteria I have mentioned must be applied for exchanges from European currency to the dollar. The situation you mention could only arise in certain countries which have more lax legislation, which today allow a European currency to be exchanged for another currency, the dollar or any other, without being subjected to those requirements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Almost five years since the complaint was lodged, the parties are still awaiting a decision from the Competition DG.

I agree with you about that. On the other hand, as I am sure you are aware, this case is very complex. From a factual point of view, the Commission has to take into consideration the evolution of the port's activity over almost a ten-year period.</p>
<p class="contents">The market itself, which is at the core of any competition analysis, is very difficult to determine. It depends on the type of traffic considered: foot passengers, cars, transportation of goods and so on. In addition, as I mentioned a moment ago, the situation has changed greatly with the opening of the Øresund bridge last year. In addition, to make things more complex, there is no direct precedent. This explains why, as Mr Stenmarck underlines, this decision is eagerly awaited.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in the process of analysing, in particular, the consequences of the opening of the bridge on the definition of the markets. All parties concerned will be asked to contribute all relevant information. The case is being given top priority and will be resolved as soon as possible. But I cannot, at this stage, indicate a time or possible outcome. That will depend on the facts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this case, one might well wonder why the Commission believes that the funding given to a theme park such as Tierra Mítica can affect intra-Community trade. In fact, the Commission believes that large theme parks like Tierra Mítica are much like other tourist destinations, and this affects – or might potentially affect – tourist numbers. On the other hand, these theme parks are an added tourist attraction for the area where they are built.</p>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 37 by Lennart Sacrédeus (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0551_EN.html">H-0551/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Limit on government subsidies for film production in small countries</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Swedish press reports that the EU competition authority has proposed a 50 per cent limit on national state aid to the film industry. This announcement has also been interpreted as the possible introduction of a ceiling as a first step towards reducing the limit to 30 per cent. These reports have appeared at the same time as the Commission continues to avow its intention to guarantee linguistic and cultural diversity and equality within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Film production in Europe differs from that in the USA in regard to the large number of languages in the EU. Against that background, producing films in the small Member States, such as my own country Sweden, without any support at all, is in many cases financially impossible. A film in a minor language is obviously severely handicapped compared with a film in English, and it is therefore clear that some support is absolutely necessary to ensure that domestic film production can continue in those countries with smaller populations.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission not consider that the introduction of an EU ceiling to limit national state aid to the film industry is directly contrary to Article 151 of the Treaties which states that 'The Community shall contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity…', and is the Commission therefore prepared to take action to prevent the introduction of such a limit? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The 50% aid intensity limit was fixed by the Commission, in its decision of 1998 on the French scheme of automatic aid to film production, with reference to the French situation. According to that decision this limit does not apply to difficult and low-budget films. It is up to each Member State both to define the notion of "difficult" and "low-budget" films and to fix the aid intensity applicable to this category of work according to national criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, apart from this derogation for other Member States with a comparatively limited cultural and linguistic influence, the Commission has made it be known that it will study potential further derogations where they prove necessary to ensure the viability of films with great cultural content.

<p class="contents">I would like to put a follow-up question to the Commissioner: bearing in mind the answer given, is there any guarantee that film production in countries with languages which are not widespread, i.e. film production in minor Member languages, will regularly be exempted from the 50 per cent rule so that, in principle, all film production in, for example, Swedish, Danish or Portuguese could be counted as not exceeding the 50 per cent rule? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, on cultural diversity – a key point in our Community – the diversity of characteristics in the schemes operated by Member States reflects the cultural diversity in the European Union. Accordingly, the Commission does not wish to impose any particular model under the review. The Commission does not want to harmonise the provisions of the different schemes but just to ensure their compliance with the four specific compatibility criteria that were set out in the French decision.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of whether the 50% aid intensity threshold applies to smaller Member States with limited cultural markets and could an exception be envisaged for them: Well, the answer is that the 50% aid intensity threshold applies in principle across the board to all Member States without distinction. It is to be noted that in the absence of territorialisation, the 50% aid intensity criterion becomes irrelevant. The Commission might consider applying exceptions to the 50% aid criterion if such a limit would make cultural production impossible. The Commission has already established an exception for difficult low-budget films. For certain smaller Member States, in the case of territorialisation, the Commission might consider authorising higher aid intensities on a case-by-case basis, if it is established that the 50% aid intensity level would not ensure cultural production because the cultural area and market diffusion were limited. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission is at the moment contemplating what position to take concerning the idea of sharing infrastructure in third-generation mobile phone networks. At this stage, the Commission has stated that telecommunications companies might breach EC competition rules if they choose to share infrastructure with their rivals.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Investment Bank has also stated that it will take competition concerns over mobile phone networks into account when deciding whether to finance third-generation projects.</p>
<p class="contents">When will the Commission state its position on this very important matter? Is the Commission aware of the EIB's plans and does it think that competition concerns should be taken into account when making decisions on EIB funding? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Monti,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Thank you, Ms Kauppi, for this extremely interesting and timely question. It is true that currently, given the prevailing market conditions and, in particular, the decline in the market valuation of most technologies companies, network sharing has been seriously envisaged by certain third generation operators as a means to alleviate their debt burden and lower their network deployment costs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already indicated that, in principle, it considers network infrastructure sharing positively, due to the potential economic gains, always provided that competition rules and other relevant Community laws are respected, in particular those of the licensing directive. This view has been expressed in the Commission communication on the introduction of third generation mobile communications in the European Union that was adopted on 20 March 2001. Certain forms of networking infrastructure sharing, notably site and mast sharing, could greatly contribute to reducing the environmental impact of network deployment.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, the Commission has not been formally notified of any agreement between 3G operators, therefore, it is not yet clear how network sharing will take place and how it will be implemented. Some operators may choose to engage in network infrastructure sharing within a limited geographical area, while others may opt for full geographical coverage. In the same vein, some operators may choose to share only sites and masts, whereas others may choose also to share antennas and what I would call 'active elements' of their networks, such as radio network controllers.</p>
<p class="contents">From contacts with operators and manufacturers, it appears that the degree of cooperation among 3G license holders will be influenced by the availability of new technology which will enable operators to share even active elements of their networks, without having to exchange or share sensitive information among themselves or otherwise compromise their independence as competitors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already had some preliminary discussions with national regulators on the competition law issues raised by network-sharing. At this stage, the Commission can only require parties to ensure that when they conclude network-sharing agreements, competition among themselves and with third parties is not restricted or affected. Any restriction of competition could be tolerated only if it brought benefits to consumers and fulfilled all the other conditions set out in Article 81(3) of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the freedom of contracting parties to disengage from their network-sharing cooperation and deploy their own networks in areas where they previously shared infrastructure should be preserved. Given that the Commission has not yet been formally notified of, or had occasion to examine, any case of network sharing, it is uncertain at this stage whether the Commission might need to issue, in the future, any kind of specific guidelines on the competition law aspects of network sharing.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the EIB, the Commission is aware of the Bank's intention of taking account of competition considerations in assessing projects for loans. The Commission clearly welcomes this intention as ensuring coherence between the Bank's objectives in rolling out projects in accordance with its mandate, particularly following the Lisbon European Council and Community policy in a liberalised environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank the Commissioner for his excellent answer. I was very pleased that the Commission takes a positive view of network sharing. At the moment the different ways in which this can be achieved are still open. I also understand your view that the competition rules must, of course, be respected and that these concrete assessments will only be able to be made once you have applications and notifications on this issue in your hands. You also referred to the Commission possibly providing specific guidelines on this issue, should the need arise. Furthermore, I would like you to confirm that, in your opinion, at the moment all the possible methods of network sharing – both geographical and the other methods to which you referred – are also open from a competition point of view.<span class="italic"> </span>Is this your final opinion? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As to the aspect of possible adoption of possible guidelines from the competition angle on network sharing, as I said in my previous response, the Commission has not yet received any notification of a network sharing agreement. Thus it is still too early to have a clear idea about possible anti-trust issues which may arise from such forms of cooperation among competing network operators and which may require the Commission to publish some sort of guidelines in order to provide further needed clarification for the industry concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">What needs to be made clear is that network sharing is subject to the same rules of competition law as other forms of cooperation or collaboration among competitors. It would be wrong if operators believed that network sharing deserves different treatment under competition law provisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
