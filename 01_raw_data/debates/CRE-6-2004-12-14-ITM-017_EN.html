<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catania (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European Union’s anti-drugs strategy, which is on the agenda for debate, ought to operate exclusively through a scientific approach, through an analysis of the actual situation and of the experience on this issue built up over recent years. In contrast, unfortunately, the argument is all too often permeated with ideologies and dogmatic or emotive approaches.</p>
<p class="contents">The data available to us allow us to take a practical approach. I refer, in particular, to the data supplied to us by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, based in Lisbon. As is well-known, these data are not only of high scientific value but also of proven reliability. The 2004 report by the Lisbon Centre indicates that the situation regarding deaths from heroin and heroin users in Europe is, all in all, stable but that no decrease has been seen in the transmission of HIV, which is even spreading in some new Member States; that the consumption of cocaine is increasing in the majority of Member States; that cannabis is the most widely-used substance, with over 20% of European citizens having used it or currently using it; and that the use of ecstasy is as high as, if not even higher than, amphetamine use. All this unequivocally demonstrates that the strategies adopted up to now have not had positive results.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to drug use in prisons, the Centre indicates that drug users are over-represented in prison; that the use of drugs among detainees ranges from 22 to 86%, depending on the prison population, the prison and the country; and that prisons are a high-risk environment for the spread of infectious diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the criminalisation of drug use, the Centre explains that in many Member States the process of criminalising the use of narcotics has led to an increase in the use of these substances. I should point out to my Swedish fellow Members that the Centre’s report contains a specific reference to the situation in Sweden, where a study is cited which shows that with the repressive strategies in force in that country the drug market has intensified; it concludes that there is no specific proof for the argument that the criminalisation of drug use has a deterrent effect on young people.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to drug trafficking, Europol indicates that narcotics trafficking accounts for approximately 2 to 5% of world GDP, which goes directly into the hands of drug traffickers and large criminal organisations worldwide. The US drugs agency estimates that in 2005 Afghanistan will export over five thousand tons of opium, of which 95% will end up in Europe. This demonstrates that the action plan adopted by the UN in 1998 has not had positive results, and this is also true in terms of the importance of drugs in funding organised crime and terrorism. A prominent prosecutor, Gerardo D'Ambrosio, has explained to us that to finance the Madrid attack the Al-Quaida terrorists bartered 250 kilograms of hashish for the TNT.</p>
<p class="contents">Our report, which has been adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, is therefore based on the need to fight drug trafficking, organised crime and terrorism and to give priority to saving lives and protecting health. The issue must not be treated as a question of public order or a matter for repression, but exclusively as a social and economic issue. For these reasons we have focused the report on the issue of the strategy for harm reduction and substitution treatment in prisons, as well as on the need to apply scientific knowledge to the effects produced by drugs, to launch scientific studies on the costs and benefits of the current policies to curb narcotics, to help producer countries to convert their agriculture, to study the effects that cannabis, opium and coca leaves can have in the medical sphere and, lastly, to take action on the confiscation of criminal and terrorist assets derived from money laundering and drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on the European Parliament to adopt this report, on the Commission to back it and on the Council – which is unfortunately absent, having clearly already made up its mind – to consider including this recommendation on the agenda for the meeting to be held in three days’ time. I would also like to mention that this recommendation was put together with the support of many organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is based on an assessment of the previous strategy, which the Commission carried out back in October.</p>
<p class="contents">The European approach, which favours a balance between demand-reduction and supply-reduction measures, therefore covers 25 countries. This strategy clearly addresses the need to enhance coordination within the Union as well as to raise the profile of EU efforts in other countries. The principal aims laid down in the strategy will be translated into specific actions in the two successive four-year action plans, which, as you are aware, will be proposed by the Commission at the start of 2005 and the start of 2009 respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to adopt its proposal for an action plan in February 2005. It believes that Parliament’s contribution in an area such as the drugs issue is essential as a means of bringing European policy closer to the people. What we need, in other words, is a shared European political strategy. Rest assured that the Commission will not falter in its commitment to this approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Recent figures about drug use among young people are alarming. An increasing number of young people start experimenting, and at an ever-younger age, with soft drugs, in particular, which are made ever more accessible by the falling prices for them. I believe that the rapporteur, in his report, is minimising the problem, and I see this as clearly inappropriate in this situation. On the contrary, the situation requires a bold and comprehensive approach with only one goal in mind: that of reducing the use of drugs and all their adverse consequences. The Commission’s assessment report and the annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction prove that a great deal is yet to be done, including at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The European policy should, as the Commissioner stated, add value to the differentiated approach in the different Member States in terms of coordination, information, scientific research and the tackling of the cross-border drugs trade and crime that goes hand in hand with that. We believe that, if such a policy is to be adopted, a separate budget line should be created for supporting new initiatives and promoting the exchange of useful experience between the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing of the sort is to be found in this report. Far from it; it is incoherent and riddled with contradictions. For example, it calls for an approach based on facts and scientific research – something that we can, of course, support – while, in the same breath, drawing conclusions most of which are incorrect. It claims that repression has no benefits, and that past action has failed to bear any fruit. Moreover, it jumps to conclusions as to what should be done.</p>

We support it for many of the reasons which the previous speaker mentioned, including in terms of the science and pragmatic facts of this debate. We do not take an overtly ideological stance, but there is some ideology in the debate and the ideology says that, unless we deal with harm reduction, unless we understand addiction and unless we understand the explosion in crime which leads from drugs to the domestic crime that we suffer in all of our European Union Member States, we cannot tackle the problem efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">This report – which was a much amended report with approximately 106 amendments in committee – shows two things. One is that there is an active interest in this House in an EU drugs strategy. Secondly we all know as MEPs that there is a very strong public appetite for there to be an EU strategy. So what is that strategy to be? The answer to that question is very much contained in this report. For example, in this report we talk not about being hard on drugs or soft on drugs, but about actually looking at intelligent harm-reduction strategies. We know the connections between drug use and HIV. If we ignore those in this House, then there will be further harm, further crime and further suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to lay much greater stress on harm reduction, but also on rehabilitation. We want to provide appropriate funding for information measures and not to pretend that the public has sufficient information about this problem. We also want to take appropriate steps to prevent the profits of illegal drug-trafficking from being used to fund everything from international terrorism to other forms of crime. This report is thus not 'hard' or 'soft'. It is effective. It tackles crime, as well as the harm being done to individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report we also urge governments and national parliaments to take effective measures to prevent drugs entering prisons. Mr Catania continually stressed this point, because it is too often ignored in Member States. It is for us in the European Union to tackle some of the difficult issues across Member States which sometimes individual Member States are not emphasising enough. Prisons are now multiplying the effects of drug harm. People are coming out of prisons and committing more crime. This is a serious issue for the European Union. There is a strong public appetite for us as MEPs and for the Commission to tackle drugs with an effective drugs strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The old style of clichés and information about drugs has long gone. We now need a more effective strategy. This report places the right emphasis on harm reduction, tackling addiction and dealing with the source of drug problems, rather than expounding clichés about the effects.

I therefore call on this House to support this report, for it is an excellent and courageous one. What is its objective? I think we all share it. I have also listened to Mrs Brepoels, and we have supported a large proportion of her amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective is harm reduction, limiting the damage for the user and for the environment. We must look into the best way of achieving this. We must look to see which policy can produce results, because they are what matter. This is not about ideology, but about results. We must adopt policy that is based on fact, research and exchange of knowledge and experience, rather than on ideology. It is therefore unfortunate that the assessment of the previous strategy was not available on time. Moreover, it was stated a moment ago that the Council would, in the next few days, be deciding to adopt this strategy after all. It would be very regrettable if the Council were to do so without Parliament having had a say in it.</p>
<p class="contents">The report takes a pragmatic, realistic approach, and I have to say, in all honesty, that I have interpreted it in a completely different way from Mrs Brepoels. I do not think at all that it rules out repression as an option. It is, of course, the case – and that also applies to Dutch policy, which is widely misunderstood – that such repression must be specific and effective. Looking at the tough war on drugs waged by the USA, I would say that this has done nothing to reduce the use of drugs, but has only lined the pockets of the drugs barons.</p>
<p class="contents">Crucial to our approach must be prevention and pragmatism. I will give you a few examples that are controversial, even in the Netherlands. Everyone has difficulty accepting them, and they are not decisions to be taken lightly. Should we, for example, provide needles to drug users who live on the streets? Are we, by doing this, condoning their use of drugs? No, of course not, but if we provide needles, then we know for certain that there are no dirty needles in circulation or in use. At major house parties, where young people take all kinds of tablets, including ecstasy and that sort of thing, should we test the quality of those tablets? Should we provide information? Should we ensure that those young people do not mix alcohol with drugs? By doing this, do you give them the message that it is okay to use drugs? That is a risk. On the other hand, I can see that, if this is not done, then young people die at these parties. As long as they still use drugs, which they do, I think that prevention and information are important.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have tabled two amendments about the exchanging of information and consideration of alternative methods. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This plan, however, focuses mainly on protecting everyone’s health. This is why the harm reduction strategies are absolutely fundamental. Only by keeping alive persons who currently cannot or do not want to stop using narcotic substances can we hope that in the future they will succeed in escaping from all forms of dependence. We must not forget that most deaths are due to AIDS and heart failures, that is, pathological situations connected with drug-taking methods.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, harm reduction involves taking action on the street and at low-threshold centres. In addition, we must firmly distinguish between drug dealers and drug users, although repressive policies tend to place them in the same category. Finally, it is essential to integrate social measures and pharmacological substitution measures. We must avoid any kind of moralistic attitude that sets these in opposition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Judging by the title of the report, we seem to be in agreement on this.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no place for drugs in a healthy society. If we in the European Union are serious about tackling the drug trade, we will need to impose sanctions. We can no longer tolerate the people who ruin lives by making money from addicts. However, we might well have a running battle on our hands if, contrariwise, we did not do everything in our power to fight drug use. In addition to taking preventive measures, it must still be possible to penalise the use of drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group, I have therefore tabled two amendments enabling the continued application of sanctions in respect of drug offences, alongside preventive measures. I urge you to support those amendments. This, of course, does not make it a good report. I have to get it off my chest: the report is full of ideology, despite the fact that it claims the opposite.</p>

Despite what he may say about the need to move away from ideology, there is an awful lot of ideology within the report. If we have differing opinions, it will be hard for us to find the common ground that we should all strive for.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say at the outset that on reading the report one would believe that the criminalisation of drugs and drug use has led to an increase in the use of drugs. One would therefore have to tacitly agree that decriminalisation would lead to a reduction in and the safer use of drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">The references to 'harm reduction' methods and so on are an abuse of the English language. It is merely facilitation. Despite what people may say and despite the good intentions that they may have, it is incorrect to say that the death rate from AIDS could be reduced through needle exchange. A user will always use more needles and pass them on to other users.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be realistic when we look at this problem. The fact is, first and foremost, that we are dealing with people's lives – and the lives of people who are invariably some of the most vulnerable in our society. There are claims that we would make their drug use safer by supplying shooting-up kitchens, by giving them clean needles, or by the medical use of heroin – as stated in the report – and that this would make these people's lives better. The reality is that addiction is hell, addiction destroys.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way to stop people from being addicts is by stopping them from using drugs. The only way to prevent people from relapsing into addiction is to take away their need for the drug. If you disbelieve what I say, do not bother looking at any of the so-called 'illegal drugs'. Look at the legal drugs that are available in Europe – alcohol and cigarettes – and see the damage that they cause. Mr Moraes spoke earlier about the devastation that is caused on the streets because of drug-related crime. Look at the devastation that is caused by alcohol – a legal drug – on the streets of every city in western Europe. If we go down the road of legalisation and harm reduction, as proposed in this report, then we would see the problem exacerbated a hundredfold across all our cities.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue here is not about a mix-and-match of best policies. The issue is about information to show people the damage and dangers that they face if they get involved in drugs. The issue is about strong criminal penalties to ensure that those who traffic in drugs are hit where it hurts: in their pockets. That requires asset seizures and asset freezing; a strong policy to ensure that those who are addicts and those who fall into drug problems are given proper resources to overcome their addictions. As somebody who has worked with young adults who are drug addicts and alcoholics, I have seen that the only way that people get off drugs is when they stop. That should be the ultimate aim, not facilitating drug use. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Most Swedes, especially parents, are in favour of the latter approach. It means that prevention and the fight against drugs under criminal law have the highest priority. To maintain, like Mr Catania, that current drugs policy could be a crime against human rights is quite alien to us. We do not see the taking of illegal drugs as a human right. Penalties that enable drug addicts to choose care instead of prison are not a crime against human rights. They are a way of helping people escape drug dependency. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon also points this out at the end of the introductory summary in its report, which I think Mr Catania should read.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not wish to decriminalise drug abuse. Instead, we wish to give clear and unambiguous signals that reject drugs. Proposals to have doctors offer people help in taking drugs or, even worse, proposals to distribute heroin are just as alien to us. What is central as far as we are concerned is that the rehabilitation of drug addicts and the content of the care given to them should be, and remain, a national competence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, in common with we Swedish Moderates, will vote against Mr Catania’s report precisely because we take a stand in the fight against this epidemic. Our approach is directed towards releasing people from drug dependency, not seeing them hooked on drugs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They saw the use of soft drugs as part of their fight for freedom. Since then, policy in a number of states has been aimed at isolating, criminalising, penalising and eliminating drug users. This repressive approach has not prevented the use of drugs from spreading.</p>
<p class="contents">The alternative to this approach is not to become indifferent and consequently to resign oneself to the damage which drugs do to the health of the users and the nuisance they cause for others, as also do alcohol and nicotine. We should not shy away from the conflict with the dealers, who make a good living from other people’s problems. In his report, my colleague, Mr Giusto Catania, has shown the right way to reduce the problems as much as possible. He endorses the practice, developed in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and parts of Germany, of tolerance, prevention and provision of aid to users and of distinguishing between the addictive tendencies of different types of drugs. I am aware that this approach meets with emotional objections among those who laboured under the illusion of being able to stamp out drugs by penalising the users, but that has only resulted in resistance to the lack of freedom. That is why broad support is needed for the alternative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the proposal, a genuine EU policy to combat drugs must be introduced. A common drugs policy within the EU means a compromise policy that is liberal regarding drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">In Sweden, any use of drugs, except for medical reasons, is banned. For us, it is important for Sweden’s restrictive drugs policy to continue in the future too. We recommend preventive work, treatment, social education and rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="contents">The report emphasises a drugs policy designed to reduce harm. We want to work towards a drugs-free society instead of accepting the use of drugs. We object to drugs being classified as soft or hard, as well as to the assertion that so-called soft drugs are not addictive.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of internal border controls able to prevent the drugs trade between the Member States is a problem in this connection. An individual EU Member State must be able to monitor its national borders in order to prevent drugs from coming into the country. As matters now stand, internal border controls in the EU are practically non-existent.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would note that drug problems in the EU are in large measure a consequence of the prevailing poverty in many countries in the world. Not being informed by a sense of solidarity, EU trade policy involving duties, licences and quotas contributes to the problems of global poverty. It is important for the UN, rather than the EU, to work towards making it profitable to cultivate alternative crops in the poor countries of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur’s aim is to amend the current strategy and it will be to no one’s surprise that we have voted against this report</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Catania mentioned the report by the European drugs and drug addiction monitoring centre. Mr Estievenart was with us last month and pointed out that, and I quote, ‘there are positive signs that progress has been made in reducing some of the worst consequences of drug use’. He said that the number of drug-related deaths has begun to fall, that heroin use has levelled off in a number of countries, that the HIV epidemic among users is slowing and, I quote, ‘measures to reduce drug-related harm are intensifying and, across much of Europe, drug users have better access to treatment and care’. This clearly demonstrates that not everything has been negative.</p>
<p class="contents">Much remains to be done and, despite all the policies that we have been pursuing, enormous problems still exist in terms of the production and trafficking of drugs, and in terms of drug use, which continues to hit extremely high levels in all Member States. In light of the accession of ten new Member States, it is essential that we step up cooperation with the countries that now border the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is room for a European anti-drugs policy that fights back against drug-related crime, and that, as per the programme, meets the four main objectives of preventing drug use and dependency, reducing the supply and demand of illegal drugs, limiting social and health damage and reducing crime. This is the path that we must follow – the path of combat, not the path of slackness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is it possible to get rid of drugs? Shall we give up and just limit the damage? Emphatically not. We know that it is specifically with cannabis that most people who end up mis-using heroin, cocaine and amphetamines begin. That is why it is crucial for us to ensure that fewer new cannabis users are recruited.</p>
<p class="contents">According to Mr Catania’s report, the restrictive policy has failed. The figures from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon, which was published a couple of weeks ago, is unambiguous. In countries such as Sweden, with a restrictive view of drugs, 7% of 15 year-olds have used cannabis. In Great Britain, 42.5% of all 15 year-old boys have used cannabis. The restrictive policy has led to dramatic reductions specifically in the number of drug users recruited.</p>
<p class="contents">According to Mr Catania, ‘soft’ drugs are not dangerous. According to the Monitoring Centre’s new data, there is an increased risk of a range of physical and mental problems such as depression, psychoses and schizophrenia.</p>
<p class="contents">A review of European drugs policy is under way right now. In countries such as the Netherlands, too, the attitude has changed over the last ten years. Now, only a third of the country’s so-called coffee shops remain. The Dutch Justice Minister has said that the Netherlands will probably be forced to alter its policy. There are high hopes of reversing the trend. Anyone who wants to see fewer drugs in Europe should vote against Mr Catania’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Talk of soft drugs gives out completely the wrong signals. It makes these drugs out to be harmless, but there are no soft drugs.

<p class="contents">I have visited many different treatment centres for drug addicts where just about all addicts have agreed that what are mistakenly called soft drugs started them off on the drug misuse that destroyed their lives and robbed them of their future. These addicts feel angry and frustrated that society has not made the dangers of cannabis, hashish and similar drugs sufficiently clear.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, Sweden, we have combined a restrictive drugs policy and the criminalisation of drugs with care and treatment for addicts. This combination has proved to be the best way of stopping drug abuse. The small increase we have seen in Sweden in recent years has been due partly to the open borders and partly to the influence of the legalisation debate taking place elsewhere in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
