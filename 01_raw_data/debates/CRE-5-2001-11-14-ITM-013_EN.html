<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Κatiforis (PSE)</span></span>  , <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am really sorry but, as far as this draft directive is concerned, I am unable to help reconcile the two institutional bodies. I am sorry, but I must recommend that the Commission proposal be rejected. As you know, cigarettes are not a tax-free commodity. They are already subject to excise and value added tax and in Europe these taxes are extremely high, accounting for 70% to 80% of their price. The Commission has proposed a fixed minimum tax of EUR 70, in addition to the system of proportional taxation which already applies.</p>
<p class="contents">The argument is that, instead of converging, taxation diverges from one country to another in the Union. That is the first mistake. It is not true that there are tax divergences; there is no particular convergence, but that is not the same as divergence. There is greater convergence on cigarettes than there is with numerous other items, as confirmed in the independent study by the Directorate-General of Research of the European Parliament, which naturally was not written solely to back me up.</p>
<p class="contents">Why does the Commission feel that taxes should converge? Because they are one reason why prices differ, which is one reason why smuggling and tax fraud are on the rise. Of course, these need to be stamped out and Parliament has repeatedly proposed measures which, unfortunately, have not been taken up, in order to stamp out cigarette smuggling. But if price differences are to be wiped out, the difference in price itself needs to be wiped out. The Commission has admitted that we do not know if tax convergence will bring about price convergence. It is certain there will be no convergence because the industry is a monopoly industry and can therefore engage in strategic price setting. These prices are not the result of market forces, they are competitive weapons used by the monopolies and we are living in cloud cuckoo land if we expect them to level out.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Commission proposal makes no provision whatsoever to harmonise value added tax, which fluctuates from one Member State to another by as much as 100%. How can taxation be harmonised unless value added tax on cigarettes is harmonised at the same time? Indeed smuggling – if it is smuggling to buy cheap cigarettes in one country of the Union in which the tax on them has been paid and sell them in another country in the Union in which they are more expensive, which in my view it is not, it is the normal working of the single market, but insofar as it is smuggling or if the tax is not paid, as in the case of England, where the situation will not change and which has a serious cigarette smuggling problem, with 50% of cigarettes smoked in England smuggled in, precisely because the tax costs as much as the price of the cigarettes, the situation will not be affected in England because the Commission proposal will not affect prices in Belgium, Holland or France, which is where the smuggled cigarettes come from.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, prices will rise in the Member States in the south, especially, of course, if we accept the candidate countries into the European Union; or rather when we accept them, which I hope we shall, prices will rise there as a result of this directive by up to 200% to 400%. Just imagine if there are derogations to cover this sort of price increase and just imagine what will happen with smuggling from the Ukraine or Russia or from China or India if we allow this sort of price increase.</p>
<p class="contents">The public health argument, that is, that higher prices reduce smoking, has also been wheeled out. How do we know it will? Because we have statistics. But the statistics are based on legal cigarettes. The increase in the price of cigarettes does indeed reduce legal smoking, but it encourages illegal smoking and in England the mafia is having a field day and has put the cigarette market completely out of kilter for precisely this reason.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Commissioner, I must say that the Council has not demonstrated the necessary respect or tact vis-à-vis Parliament, because a week before we submitted our opinion, it presented us with a political agreement in which it attempts to force our opinion. I hardly think that is the way to run democratic institutions but if, nonetheless, that is how Parliament is to be run, then one wonders why we won the Cold War. And I heard you say in your previous speech that you are a dyed-in-the-wool liberal. This makes we wonder how you can come along and support a measure from which, in the economic sector, only large monopolies stand to gain for reasons which, unfortunately, I cannot go into now, but you know full well that I am right, while, in the political sector, you come along with something which looks to me very much like totalitarianism. I think that this sort of difference between the theory which we espouse and the practice which we follow should give you food for thought. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We, in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, are rather reluctant to do this without telling the Commission why, at least without giving the Commission a written explanation. However, in conclusion it has to be said that the directive cannot remain as it is. In its opinion, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also made a number of comments. It confined its comments to its particular field. The issue of health protection undoubtedly has a role to play in this proposal for a directive. However, this is not an issue for our committee. The question of whether the minimum excise duty should be EUR 140, 120, 100, 80 or 60 is also undoubtedly significant in connection with health protection, but not for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. For us, it was exclusively legal considerations that mattered. In this respect, the directive would appear to have two essential weaknesses, which mean that it does not stand up to scrutiny against reasonable internal market considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the system of having a minimum incidence of excise duty comes under pressure from the fact that value added tax is imposed on top of this minimum rate. If I take a country where the rate of excise duty is the bare minimum required and the rate of value added tax is also very low, then I have to conclude that there are distortions of competition if I compare it with a country where the rate of excise duty perhaps exceeds the minimum and there is a relatively high rate of value added tax. That is why we think that in the future, instead of requiring a minimum incidence of excise duty exclusive of value added tax, it would be appropriate to work on the basis of a system which provides for a minimum rate of excise duty inclusive of the applicable value added tax.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns Article 3(1). We think that this proposal no longer draws a proper distinction between cigarettes and cigarillos or cigars. The proposal tries to give the impression that cigarillos with filters are cigarettes with dark-coloured wrappers and that they should be taxed accordingly, like cigarettes. We believe that this is wrong. The health effects of filters can certainly be disputed, but it ought to be indisputable that a cigarillo with a filter is in any case slightly more healthy than a cigarillo without a filter. If, however, I treat cigarillos with filters as equivalent to cigarettes for tax purposes – and I am not a cigarillo smoker! – then I penalise the fundamentally healthier product by taxing it like a cigarette. That is why I think that improvements also need to be made here. We agree with the conclusion that the proposal should be rejected. Even if it sounds harsh, technical improvements are necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament requested this a few years ago and the Commission is now meeting this request. In our view, the proposal is an improvement on the current situation and also solves a number of problems, including that of continuing to allow for exceptions, as is the case for Sweden now and the accession countries in future. For that reason, we believe it is a considered proposal. We did, however, table a number of amendments. Firstly, there is the issue of VAT which Messrs Katiforis and Wieland also mentioned. I share their point of view on this score, and that is why my group has re-tabled the amendment that was already adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, namely to include VAT in the equation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, our committee was of the opinion that the issue should be clearly placed in the context of existing negotiations in the World Trade Organisation, for the latter plays a major role in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we believe that a great deal must be done against smuggling. I do not subscribe to the rapporteur’s point of view that an increase in excise will, in itself, promote smuggling or, vice versa, that a reduction in excise will lead to a drop in the incidence of smuggling. I am of the opinion that completely different measures should be taken against smuggling, which are, in fact, the topic of debate in the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we have tabled an amendment on tobacco subsidies, a much-debated topic which is also relevant in this context. We have also tabled an amendment in which we state that, concerning products which are less unhealthy, we should be working towards a system, maybe not now, but in 2005, whereby the excise on those products would also be lower. We therefore support the gist of the Commission proposal, as well as the position which the Council has already adopted in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sorry, but common sense is nowhere to be seen in this proposal for a directive, which we, too, propose should be rejected in its entirety. If it is not rejected, we are all in danger of exposing ourselves because, if this sort of directive is adopted, it will have exactly the opposite of, what the Council says, are the desired results. I should also like to point out that it would be most useful if the Council were present rather than absent, like their common sense.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council says that the aim is to combat tax evasion and cigarette smuggling. If we increase tax, then we shall increase tax evasion. We all know that, the higher the tax, the more attractive tax evasion becomes. If we increase the price of cigarettes, as is proposed, then we shall, without question, increase cigarette smuggling because we shall be making legal cigarettes more expensive than smuggled cigarettes. So we shall be working counter to our aims. Again, the Council tells us that one of its aims is to protect public health and that this aim will be achieved by people giving up smoking because cigarettes are more expensive. And who can say that people stop smoking when cigarettes go up in price? The best case scenario is that there will be no change in the consumption of cigarettes. The worst case scenario is that smokers on low incomes will change to cheaper, that is, more harmful cigarettes. Is that what we want to achieve? How clever of us!</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the proposals in the proposed directive are wrong because, first of all, they restrict application to five, mainly southern countries. The other ten are not affected because they are already at the topmost point. Secondly, the cost of living will rise in these five countries, four of which are southern countries, without any increase in wages, thereby exacerbating inflationary pressures. I also think we should ask ourselves what the candidate countries have to say about this proposal for a directive? Do they think it shows the European Union's concern for them? And it would be helpful to know how their governments are going to persuade them that integration into the European Union will benefit consumers, when they will have to pay 200 to 500% more for cigarettes under this sort of directive.</p>

The rapporteur gives me no option but to disagree with him. Only yesterday in this House we passed a resolution giving the European Parliament's opinion on the third round of negotiations for the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.</p>
<p class="contents">This House should never forget that tobacco is the biggest cause of preventable illness and disease across the European Union. It is like no other product. Each year half a million EU citizens die needlessly due to tobacco. In Scotland, which I represent, 13,000 people died last year due to smoking. The Commission proposal will help people to stop smoking. This proposal will introduce a cash minimum amount of cigarette duty. Currently the rule is expressed as a percentage of tax, inclusive of the retail selling price, and therefore has little effect on Member States and applicant countries where retail prices are already low.</p>
<p class="contents">The more expensive a packet of cigarettes, the bigger the incentive to stop smoking. Some say that the most effective way to help smokers cure their addiction is to make cost the issue. Therefore any measures to reduce smoking are more than welcome and are more important to my mind than any arguments which support the tobacco industry.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards smuggling, unlike the rapporteur I believe this proposal will prevent smuggling within the EU. Minimum EU rates of duty are sensible and effective in tackling the scourge of smuggling. The Commission's proposal is a good proposal and therefore should be wholeheartedly supported. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Blokland (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, it strikes me that the Katiforis report does not explain why the European Commission proposal to change excise duty rates for tobacco is being rejected. It appears impossible to underpin this position. As this new proposal introduces changes to existing directives, the legal base is not at issue. One of the reasons for change is the fact that the Member States miss out on a huge amount of excise on account of fraud and smuggling. The internal market, therefore, still leaves something to be desired, and there is also competitive distortion. If the discrepancies between the Member States become less pronounced, fraud and smuggling will be discouraged and will, hopefully, even vanish altogether. Furthermore, the necessary increase in tobacco excise for a number of Member States, following on from this proposal, will not cause any damage to health. For the reasons already stated, I welcome a minimum excise duty of 57%. Where smuggling practices persist and even involve tobacco manufacturers, the European Commission will need to take additional measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already called for the dismantling of tobacco subsidies several times. The amendments by Mr Maaten therefore receive my unqualified support. The European Union is still very much lacking credibility on this score. On the one hand, tobacco consumption is discouraged by warning labels, bans on tobacco advertising and higher excise, while on the other hand EUR 1 billion goes up in smoke in the form of tobacco subsidies. Supporting tobacco growers in the switch to another crop which also entails subsidies, is a very generous solution and therefore deserves Parliament’s support. I call on the Council to support the European Commission proposals and to stand up to the pressure exerted by one or two Member States. Moreover, I object to Mr Folias’ appropriation of common sense. I could claim with just as much justification that everyone is entitled to their own stupidity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<tr><td width="70" align="center" valign="top"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="photoframe_blue"><tr><td><img alt="MPphoto" src="/doceo/data/img/photo_generic.gif" align="right" width="50" height="63" /></td></tr></table> </td><td width="5"> </td><td align="left" valign="top">
<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, the position taken by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal under discussion has surprised me. It diverges considerably from the position taken by this Parliament in 1996. At that time, Parliament urged the Commission to make proposals for upward harmonisation of tobacco prices, based upon higher duty rates across the Union for reasons including health protection, and to consider measures to reduce the scope for price manipulation by cigarette producers applying widely diverging pre-tax on the markets of each Member State. The present Commission proposal is consistent with that opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I say that the advice of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee has greatly surprised me. The Commission is doing what Parliament wanted in 1996 and therefore it is odd that the report should not accept the Commission's proposal. The changes proposed will bring about increased convergence in duty rates within the European Union and, as such, improve the functioning of the internal market, both now and as it will be after enlargement. They will also reduce the incentive for excise fraud within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">More surprisingly – and Mr Blokland has just drawn attention to this – the draft report does not set out the reasons for rejecting the Commission proposal. That is the least that the Commission would have expected. According to the working document presented by the rapporteur to EMAC in June, the main justification is that the introduction of a minimum amount of taxation of EUR 70 for cigarettes constitutes a shift towards specific taxation, and would disadvantage small- and medium-sized producers in southern Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that this is emphatically not the view of the Commission. The introduction of a fixed amount in euro does not alter the structure of excise duties on cigarettes. Member States affected by the introduction of the fixed amount will retain the flexibility they enjoy at present to determine the proportions of the specific and <span class="italic">ad valorem </span>components of cigarette taxation, as other rules remain unchanged.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that the Commission proposal has received broad support in the Council. Last week in the Ecofin Council the Member States unanimously agreed a compromise text produced by the Belgian Presidency, which is clearly in line with the Commission's proposal. For cigarette taxation, the most significant element is the introduction of a minimum amount of duty of EUR 60 at the initial stage and EUR 64 at a later stage, rather than the EUR 70 proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of the proposal is also extremely important in view of the forthcoming enlargement of the Union eastwards. Mr Folias has quite rightly drawn our attention to that aspect of the proposal. The existing minimum taxation requirement – the so-called 57% rule – allows for a higher degree of price manipulation and would not in itself be sufficient to reduce to a sustainable level the gap between the tax and price levels of the present Member States and the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a situation would result in substantial revenue loss for present Member States, especially those having borders with candidate countries. The requirement for a minimum amount of duty will avoid this happening and ensure the proper functioning of the internal market after enlargement. The Commission is aware that achieving the amounts in euro will require a significant effort from most candidate countries. Therefore, it has proposed that the Council grant limited transitional periods to candidate countries for reaching the minimum rate of taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, I was pleased to see that the two Parliament committees that have issued opinions on the proposal – the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, with Mr Maaten as draftsman, and the Committee for Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, with Mr Wieland as draftsman – accepted the general thrust of the proposal, subject to a number of amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the amendments proposed in Mr Maaten's report have been re-tabled in this plenary. The Commission broadly shares the concerns of Mr Maaten on the need to pay more attention to health policy and to combat fraud and smuggling. I do not see why Mr Katiforis cannot accept the arguments relating to health. It is a well known fact – and I am sure he is aware of it – that 75% of smokers started before the age of 18. Report after report and study after study confirm that for young people under the age of 18, price clearly is a determining factor in terms of smoking.</p>
<p class="contents">I was pleased to hear both Mrs Stihler and Mr Blokland support the view of the Commission that there is a direct link between price and quantity consumed and that therefore the price very definitely has a bearing on health. Mr Folias said that if the price goes up then cheaper cigarettes will be purchased and smoked. According to that reasoning, if the price went down then more expensive cigarettes would also be purchased. That is something that, in reality, is not noticeable. Therefore, with all due respect to Mr Folias, his reasoning is not in line with reality.</p>
<p class="contents">While I am answering specific questions by Parliament, I have to say that I do not understand the argument by Mr Wieland – referring to the legal aspects of the case – when he says that the interplay of VAT and excise taxes would be illegal. Of course they have a bearing on competition and smuggling, as we all know, but why should this be illegal, as he maintains?</p>
<p class="contents">The point of view of his committee is based on the legal state of affairs. He says that there is a problem in that cigarillos of a certain dimension and character should be treated as cigars and not as cigarettes. Well, I have some here. If you showed an average citizen of the European Union this packet of cigarillos, took one of them out – of the same dimensions and weight as an ordinary cigarette – and asked them if it was more like a cigarette or more like a cigar, I would wager Mr Wieland 144 packets of cigarettes or cigarillos – whichever he prefers – that the average citizen of the European Union would classify them as cigarettes.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the amendments proposed in Mr Maaten's opinion have been retabled for this plenary. The Commission broadly shares these concerns on the need to pay more attention to health policy. But the amendments require no change to the proposal. According to the existing review requirements, the Commission already has the obligation to take into account the wider Treaty objectives, including health. New developments, resulting for instance from the conclusion of a WHO framework convention on tobacco control, will thus automatically have to be taken into consideration in a subsequent review.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Member States have also taken a number of initiatives to combat fraud and smuggling following the conclusions of the high-level group on fraud in the field of excise duties.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, for the reasons I have given, the Commission is still convinced of the merits of its proposal and still considers the proposals by the Commission to be a direct reply to Parliament's own opinion expressed in 1996. Therefore the Commission invites all Members of Parliament who have expressed an opinion contrary to that of the Commission to reconsider their position on this issue very carefully before tomorrow's vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
