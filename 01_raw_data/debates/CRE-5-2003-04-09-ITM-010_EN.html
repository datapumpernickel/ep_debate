The main objective of this proposal is to authorise two new sweeteners that have received a favourable opinion by the Scientific Committee on Food: Sucralose and the salt of aspartame and acesulfame.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission proposes to reduce the intake of cyclamate, as an already authorised sweetener, for which the Scientific Committee on Food has considerably lowered the acceptable daily intake. To this end, the Commission proposed to reduce the amount of cyclamates permitted in soft drinks and to prohibit their use in a series of other foodstuffs, such as confectionery, chewing gum and ice cream.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also proposed to decide in comitology whether a substance fulfils the definition of a sweetener as laid down in the directive. Such a decision is of technical nature and can already be taken by comitology for all other food additives according to existing legislation. It is necessary to have a formal tool to bring certain substances under the scope of the food additive legislation. This is in the interest of consumer protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the Commissioner has just explained, the European Parliament is being asked to vote on the second amendment to the ‘sweeteners’ directive since its adoption in 1994. The Directorate-General responsible is therefore proposing that two new sweeteners, namely sucralose and salt of aspartame-acesulfame, should be added to the positive list of sweeteners already approved in the European Union. This proposal follows the favourable opinion on these two sweeteners issued in the year 2000 by the Scientific Committee for Food.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of this second revision of the sweeteners directive, the European Commission has also proposed that the use of a third sweetener be revised, namely cyclamic acid. Following a re-evaluation of this sweetener by the Scientific Committee, the Commission proposes that the cyclamate thresholds contained in certain foods and drinks should be reduced. Studies, in particular those carried out in Denmark, have shown that a child weighing fifteen kilos or less might very rapidly reach the threshold of the acceptable daily intake (ADI), which could involve a risk to that child’s health. New studies being carried out in several Member States would seem to confirm this opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the last amendment proposed for this directive by DG Health and Consumer Protection is concerned with the committee procedure. The Commission, as you have just reminded us, wants to be given the power to decide whether a substance falls within the ‘sweeteners’ category, without going through the process of approval by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">On this point, the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy showed a very clear refusal to transfer that power to the Commission alone. Even though Members of the European Parliament are aware of the technical nature of this type of decision, your rapporteur believes that the European Parliament’s prerogative should be retained, since scientific expertise may be subject to controversy.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, this amendment will be proposed again when the framework directive covering sweeteners is revised. Your rapporteur would prefer to wait for this more general revision. In any case, the absence of amendments on this point would seem to indicate that Members of the European Parliament would also prefer to put it off until the forthcoming general legislative revision.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy voted in favour of the request for the authorisation of the placing on the market of the two new sweeteners, but it also voted in favour of the adoption of an amendment requiring a re-evaluation of these two substances three years after the entry into force of the revised directive. Your rapporteur is aware of the provisions of the directive, particularly as regards the monitoring system, but I would prefer to remind the European Commission and the Member States of their obligations regarding the monitoring of sweeteners and the collection of data. The collection of information on real consumption in the European Union and on the possible effects of the consumption of sweeteners on human health must be organised as soon as the products containing those sweeteners are placed on the market, so as to enable a re-evaluation of existing information to be carried out within the time limits laid down.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be admitted, however, that Member States are not doing enough to collect this information, and the European Commission does not always have the means to ensure that Member States observe the provisions contained in the directive, particularly with regard to reporting to the Commission. Your rapporteur is well aware of the gap which exists between the adoption of legislation and its implementation, and I believe that the work of Parliament also includes reminding those responsible of the need to apply the law.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as cyclamates are concerned, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy voted in favour of adopting a stronger position than the one recommended by DG Health and Consumer Protection. In effect, the committee is proposing to reduce cyclamate levels to 250 mg and to extend this provision to cover all drinks. This extension is necessary because drinks containing cyclamates may easily be served to small children, owing to the very nature of those drinks.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, this greater reduction is also necessary because it takes more account of the switch from a temporary ADI to a lower permanent ADI adopted by the Scientific Committee. On this basis, your rapporteur supports Amendment No 9, tabled by Mrs Schörling.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I finish, I should like to mention the issue of fine bakery products. Two amendments have been proposed. I shall not attempt to conceal my preference for the one that I and my political group have proposed, because it is the result of collective work and because I believe that consumers ought to know what ingredients or products the foods that are sold to them contain. However, I am also prepared to accept Amendment No 12, with an oral amendment which will be proposed tomorrow. It enables us to find a solution as far as this category of foods is concerned, and I believe that these two amendments propose an acceptable solution. I hope, therefore, that Members will vote in such a way as to enable us to propose a solution on this point to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Having spoken about the technical aspects of my report, I shall now conclude my presentation of that report by referring, in broader terms, to the question of consumer protection, which in this case is linked to public-health issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I am well aware, of course, that sweeteners can bring some comfort to people whose state of health requires them to follow a special diet. However, the existence of products containing such sweeteners must not be allowed to hide the very serious public-health problem of obesity. This public-health issue is of course linked to that of eating habits, and of nutritional and health education. It is also linked, therefore, to new kinds of consumption and to the presence on the market of increasingly sweetened products, consumed in excessive quantities by children, which are often the subject of false advertising. This is why I am anxious to draw the Commission’s attention to this problem once again, although I know that Mr Byrne has already confirmed that he is very much aware of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Before other speakers take the floor, I just want to say that I very much hope that we shall reach an agreement with the Council at second reading, and I hope that tomorrow’s vote will enable us to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bowis (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, you are obviously in a generous mood tonight. I hope your generosity will extend to the daunting task that I have of replacing Mrs Oomen-Ruijten – because of her sad illness – as the shadow rapporteur on this measure.</p>
<p class="contents">I start by thanking the rapporteur for her remarks and for her work in committee. I have to say that many have questioned the need for some aspects of this measure. Where we need this measure, it is important that our directive is based on science. It is not for us to second-guess the scientific advisers to the Commission. They say these products are safe and the Commission is right to accept that advice. Sucralose presents no problems: it is made from sugar, it is non-calorific, it does not lead to tooth decay or – and here let me declare an interest – to risks for those of us who live with diabetes. Indeed, if it could do something for my brainpower as well, I would sit here munching it all night. It has already been approved in some 45 countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past cyclamates have rightly been treated with caution. However, now science shows that a reduction of the permitted level from 400 mg/l to 350 mg/l is all that is needed. To go further has no basis in science, except for a tiny sample of 43 children in Denmark, which was itself rejected by the Danish Food and Veterinary Administration. The acceptable daily intake – the ADI – is not only the favoured measurement of the FAO and WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives, but it also sets an intake level – not a maximum for a single day, but an average over a lifetime. The proposed ADI is 7 mg/kg of body weight.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus all seemed plain sailing, until we had the rapporteur's proposal to reduce the figure to 250 mg, whereupon we had the Commission's brainstorm. A normally sensible, wise and objective official, widely respected and, indeed, loved by the world of food and food safety allowed herself to be bounced into a statement that the Commission could accept 250. She then had to admit that this was not based on one iota of scientific evidence. That is a very dangerous precedent. If the Commission ignores the advice of its own scientists, who can we trust?</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and I are both of the view that the requests for a new report on the re-evaluation of the approval of aspartame are also completely misplaced. In December 2002, the Scientific Committee on Food, in cooperation with the French and British food authorities, concluded that there is no reason to adjust the approval of aspartame in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the FDA and JEFCFA – the scientific advisory body of WHO – have approved the substance. Therefore, it is absolutely unnecessary to question the validity of the conclusion of the European Union's independent scientific committee – the SCF – that aspartame is a substance safe for human consumption. It has to be taken into consideration that in the approval of a substance like aspartame the SCF sets the allowed daily intake in which the vulnerable life phases are included at a level such that even the heaviest users of the substance will not exceed 30-40% of that maximum intake.</p>
<p class="contents">A new report on the evaluation of aspartame would lead simply to negative publicity. It would bring about rumours and feelings of uncertainty among consumers, as a substance that has been approved safe by an independent scientific committee is being questioned again for absolutely no good reason.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just add that my good friend Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, who, jointly with Mrs Ayuso González, tabled Amendment 12, to which Mrs Ferreira referred, asked me to point out that she thinks there is a translation problem – at least in the English version – and that the category 'fine bakery products, energy-reduced or with no added sugar' – is supposed to be an addition to the previous text and not a replacement for it. I put that before you and leave it in your good hands, Mr President, and exhort the services, if possible, to look at this before we come to vote on the matter tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I, however, tend to take the view of the rapporteur and of those of my political Group in the Committee of which we are all members. I wake up every morning, like Mr Bowis, and say to myself 'I am not a scientist'. I have no right to second-guess scientists. However, I do have a right to the long view and to second opinions, and where there are concerns, even if these have been allayed to some degree in the period when a new product is coming into use, as is certainly the case with salt of aspartame, nevertheless it is right to think after these products have gone into use – and they are now being used in many hundreds of different confectionery and other products – that over time a periodic review of a new substance is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that any of us know, because we are part of this vast experiment, how far the human metabolism has been changed by this whole range of new artificial products many of which bring great benefits, as salt of aspartame obviously does to Mr Bowis, but which could also cause concern. He has probably received, as I have, a number of letters from the Additives Survivors' Network, who relate pretty grim stories of the adverse consequences of salt of aspartame for some of them. We are not advocating second-guessing the scientific committee and our own Foods Standards Agency in the United Kingdom. We are simply saying, over time you need to have the right to review this, to take another view once it is general use and is part of that great experiment among the population.</p>
<p class="contents">My second and last point relates to the reduction of cyclamate levels. Mr Bowis says this was all the result of some brainstorm in the Commission. Some feckless person in the Commission foolishly said yes, a 250 mg limit would be acceptable. It is also actually as Mr Bowis probably knows, the view of the UK Government – in the advice that it circulates to us and is more frequently sometimes copied on that side of the House than on this – that a reduction to 250 mg measurement may be necessary. Why is that? It is because lifetime use has to be considered in the light of the intensity of the intake. We do have to take into account the extensive use, for very young children in particular, of products which have been flavoured and sweetened in this way. I believe that we should reduce to 250 mg and I am glad to see that I am in good company, though not alas that of Mr Bowis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I shall try to keep within my allotted speaking time.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the main concerns highlighted by this report? I think that Mrs Ferreira, who has done some very serious work on this subject, has stated them quite correctly. I should therefore like to give you my opinion on what seem to me to be the main points, starting with the addition to the list of sweeteners of a new sweetener called sucralose, and I should like to draw your attention to the fact that sucralose is no ordinary substance. It is an organochlorine substance obtained by the conversion of sugar with the addition of three atoms of chlorine. I would point out to you that organochlorines are substances which generally give rise to problems regarding the environment and even health. I am astonished, therefore, at a proposal which seems to treat as something quite commonplace the inclusion of this new sweetener in the list of approved sweeteners. In addition to that remark, I would also point out that the ADI, or acceptable daily intake, which is being proposed for this sweetener, is three times higher than the one proposed by the US Food and Drug Administration. Consequently it seems to me that there are enough unknown factors regarding this new sweetener to justify our not agreeing to allow it to be added to the list of approved substances.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point refers to aspartame. Despite the considerations put forward by Mr Bowis, I share the rapporteur’s view that Amendment No 4 is entirely justified. A re-evaluation of aspartame does not seem to be in the least embarrassing. It would not call into question the honesty of what was done previously. It would simply show that knowledge can develop and that that development sometimes leads us to question the authorisations that were given previously. Personally, therefore, I believe that this proposal is correct.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns cyclamates. On this subject, the European Commission is proposing to amend the maximum level for use in water-based drinks. It would be reduced from 400 mg/l to 350 mg/l. mg/l. Mrs Ferreira’s proposal is more ambitious, and I believe that she is right. However, it seems to me that, given the role played by cyclamates, and given that they are prohibited, or at least not approved, in the United States, we should ask ourselves about the possible risks posed by these sweeteners. I would draw Members’ attention to the fact that sweeteners, and therefore cyclamates, are often present in drinks or other products widely consumed by young children, so that the acceptable daily intake for this type of sweetener is easily exceeded. Consequently it seems to me desirable that we should be even more ambitious and I hope that we shall support Mrs Schörling’s amendment, which proposes that the maximum level should be fixed at 100 mg/l. I believe that this is a realistic proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sitting here on an evening like this, I think we all belong to Parliament's survivors' network.</p>
<p class="contents">The trouble with sweeteners in the additives category is that they excite fundamentalist reactions of exactly the same type as genetically modified organisms. Basically, that reaction leads to the position of Mr Lannoye, which really is that he does not want any sweeteners authorised at all at any level and would like them all taken off the market. It is as well to bear that in mind as a background to what he has just said.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on two amendments and would like to hear the Commission's view on them. Amendment 4 has been mentioned as requiring a new investigation into aspartame. That illustrates the point about fundamentalism, because this would take place less than a year after the publication of the Scientific Committee for Food's opinion on aspartame. Can the rapporteur tell us – because she did not say this in her speech – why we should doubt the FDA assessment? Does the rapporteur have evidence of the FDA's inadequacy and the inadequacy of its own assessment? If so, she should share the evidence with us, because there is no point in tabling an amendment like this without giving us that information.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point on Amendment 4: why is the rapporteur against a sweetener which is known apparently as stevia? There is no mention of this in the justification. The amendment seems to be against stevia and wants another investigation of that. What does the rapporteur know that we do not? Can Mr Byrne help us?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in relation to Amendment 8 – which has been mentioned by more than one Member – it worries me more for the process by which it was agreed than for the substance that it contains. When it was moved in the committee by the rapporteur, the Commission indicated willingness to accept a change from the level of 350 mg/l to 250 mg/l. The Commission gave no substantive reason for this. It almost seemed to us, as Mr Bowis has said, that it was picking a figure out of a hat. As Mr Coleman of DG SANCO stated in a letter he wrote shortly after that: 'A clear majority of experts from the Member States have expressed the position in both the Commission and the Council working parties that the reduction to 350 mg/l is not sufficient, and wish to go further.' That information was not given to the committee. No information was given to the committee! We were certainly not told that Member States' experts thought that 350 mg/l was too high or why they did. Can the Commissioner now take this opportunity to say why the Commission changed its mind – on the basis of which scientific studies? And, indeed, when did it do so, given the fact that it presumably consulted the self-same national experts who were happy with 350 mg/l when it drew up the directive not very long ago? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think Amendment No 4 is entirely justified, for what we want is a re-evaluation of aspartame, especially as regards its effects on risk groups, particularly pregnant women. We know far too little, for example, about the effects of heavy consumption of sweeteners during pregnancy or on the health of infants and children. The same applies to sucralose and cyclamic acid, about which Mr Lannoye has already spoken. Let me say a few brief words about cyclamic acid. Although Mrs Jackson, with reference to aspartame, has just mentioned the FDA in the USA, she does not want to heed the FDA's warnings about cyclamic acid. As Mr Lannoye has quite rightly pointed out, a far lower maximum usable dose of that is permitted. I think we must all take note of this. We really should adopt the proposal put forward by my colleague, namely to cut it as low as 100 mg/l. We must try to reduce the high levels of sugar use. We are finding that our children, for example, can no longer taste the sweetness in fruit, that sugar is no longer perceived as a seasoning, and that foods are oversweetened to such an extent that at some point, we get used to these sweeteners, with the result that more and more sweeteners are being used in order to reduce the massive consumption of sugar.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in a vicious circle. For this reason, I fully support the proposal put forward by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. I think we must follow this debate very closely, for there is one thing that we must not permit, and that is the use of carcinogenic substances such as sweeteners. The precautionary principle applies here, and as long as potential threats cannot be ruled out, we cannot run any risks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Personally, I find sweeteners a difficult subject. In my opinion, the Commission’s proposal does have the scientific rigour required when dealing with such issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall comment first on the most controversial aspect of the report, namely cyclamates. The Commission’s initial proposal was to set the maximum dose at 350 mg/l, in line with the ruling by the Scientific Committee on Food.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission did however change its view regarding the maximum dose. It revised its initial proposal of 350 mg/l and supported the proposal of 250 mg/l. Commissioner, we are all wondering why that was so. We were told that a compromise had been reached in the Council, resulting in agreement on the figure of 250 mg/l. That suggests both political and scientific arguments were invoked.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot endorse this figure for political reasons. We must be rigorous and support the Commission’s original figure. I therefore call for Amendments Nos 8 and 9 to be rejected. I believe they lack sound scientific basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament cannot and must not take political opinions or compromises into account when dealing with as technical a subject as additives. If the Commission really believes that a maximum permitted dose of cyclamates of 250 mg/l is more appropriate it should withdraw its initial proposal. It should then present us with a new one, giving a scientific explanation of why it is now proposing a lower dose.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons for reducing the dose still further are inconsistent. Reference is made to a study carried out in Denmark in 2001. This study was based on a particularly small sample of children who consumed sweeteners. Crucially, it had not been designed as a study of the intake of sweeteners. It had been intended as an assessment of the use of sweeteners in soft drinks in Denmark.</p>
<p class="contents">Simply extrapolating from the results of such a study cannot be a sound basis for reducing the maximum permitted level of cyclamates in soft drinks in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration stated in a press release on the publication of this study that the RDA study was based on safe lifetime intake. It went on to state that consequently there would be no harmful effects on the health of children aged between one and three who might temporarily exceed the RDA. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<tr><td width="70" align="center" valign="top"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="photoframe_blue"><tr><td><img alt="MPphoto" src="/doceo/data/img/photo_generic.gif" align="right" width="50" height="63" /></td></tr></table> </td><td width="5"> </td><td align="left" valign="top">
<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the European Parliament for its collaboration on this proposal. In particular I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteur, Mrs Anne Ferreira, for her work on this dossier. She has given broad support to the proposal of the Commission. She has agreed to the proposed authorisation of two new sweeteners and to the reduction of the use of a further, already authorised sweetener.</p>
<p class="contents">In the latter case, the rapporteur even wished to go further than the Commission’s proposal – by seeking to reduce the level of cyclamates in both soft drinks and juice or milk-based drinks to 250 milligrams per litre (Amendments 1 and 8). The Commission can accept these amendments. I have been asked to give more details in relation to that and I am happy to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Bowis in saying that scientific advice must not be second-guessed. However, in accepting their advice on an acceptable daily intake, it is the job of the risk managers – the Commission, the Council and Parliament – to set the maximum permitted doses in particular foodstuffs. This is always a difficult task. However, the Commission, in proposing to accept a lower limit of 250 milligrams per litre in soft drinks, did not act on a whim of any individual official. This was done after careful consideration of the science and intake studies and after hearing the views of Member States and Parliament. Let me clarify the following.</p>
<p class="contents">A clear distinction must be made between the acceptable daily intake of a food additive which is purely based on science and the maximum permitted use level of a food additive in a given foodstuff which is determined taking into account a series of criteria laid down in the legislation. There is no scientific mechanism to translate an acceptable daily intake into a maximum use level. In the present case the acceptable daily intake for cyclamates has been lowered from 11 to 7 milligrams per kilogram of body weight by the Scientific Committee on Food. Soft drinks contribute to a large extent to the intake of sweeteners and are also consumed by children. Furthermore, Member States indicated that the acceptable daily intake for cyclamates might be exceeded in their country. For these reasons the Commission can support the further reduction of the levels of cyclamates.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Parliament has introduced several additional amendments to the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 4 calls for the re-evaluation of the authorisation of two sweeteners – aspartame and stevioside. Furthermore, the amendment would require the Commission to present a report on the process of authorisation of aspartame by the US Food and Drugs Administration. The Commission cannot accept this amendment for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">At the request of the Commission, aspartame has been re-evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food in collaboration with the British and French Food Safety Authorities. To this end, the scientists have reviewed all the scientific literature published since the last opinion on aspartame – amounting to around 150 articles. The resulting opinion, adopted as recently as December of last year, fully reconfirmed the safety of aspartame and that the intake of this sweetener remains well below the acceptable daily intake. Therefore, the Commission does not consider it justifiable to proceed with a further re-evaluation of this sweetener, nor to restrict its conditions of use.</p>
<p class="contents">The leaves of Stevia and the sweetener extracted from this plant, stevioside, have also been thoroughly examined by the Scientific Committee on Food. The Committee has serious doubts about the safety of stevioside and did not consider it as acceptable for use in food. Therefore, the Commission has never proposed this sweetener for authorisation. To date, no new scientific data justifying a re-evaluation of stevioside have been presented to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the request to examine how aspartame was approved in the United States, it is not the competence of the Commission to enquire how an authorisation has been granted in a third country.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the protection of the consumer, I would like to reassure honourable Members that proposals for authorisation of food additives under EU legislation are done on the basis of a risk assessment undertaken by the Scientific Committee on Food and, in the future, by the European Food Safety Authority. If the result of this risk assessment is favourable, the Commission proposes the use of an additive after verifying that all the criteria for authorisation of a food additive are met. The proposed conditions of use are based on the technological need and on intake data gathered by the Member States. This process of risk analysis is fully independent from what is done in other countries. The Commission is satisfied that this process is carried out in a transparent and independent manner in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 5 addresses the review of the conditions of use for the two newly proposed sweeteners. This amendment duplicates requirements that already exist in food additives legislation. In fact, the review of authorised food additives is required in the overall framework directive and in the three specific directives on the various classes of additives. This is done from time to time. The framework directive requires food additives to be re-evaluated whenever necessary. Article 8 of the Sweeteners Directive obliges Member States to monitor regularly the consumption of sweeteners. This monitoring has to provide data on intake both by adults and by children. Therefore, the Commission is in a position to identify whether the intake of specific additives would exceed safe levels both in adults and children.</p>
<p class="contents">Whenever necessary, the Commission will propose restrictions to currently authorised use patterns, in particular to ensure that intake by children is safe. Furthermore, it is not realistic to set a three-year deadline for this exercise. On the contrary, to gather data on the two sweeteners before they are fully established on the market runs the risk that their intake would be underestimated. Therefore, because this amendment duplicates existing requirements and because the deadline is not realistic, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 5.</p>
<p class="contents">Two further amendments (Amendments 2 and 3) would refuse comitology for the decision as to whether or not a substance should be considered as a sweetener according to Directive 94/35/EC. This is a purely technical decision necessary to bring certain substances under the scope of the directive that would otherwise escape from the strict rules set out for sweeteners and instead simply be considered as food ingredients. Therefore, the Commission cannot accept Amendments 2 and 3.</p>
<p class="contents">A series of amendments has been tabled concerning the Commission proposal to clarify the meaning of the wording of the food category 'fine bakery wares' for special nutritional uses. The intention behind the Commission proposal was to render more homogeneous the interpretation of this food category by Member States. However, so far, the Council has not been able to agree on the wording proposed by the Commission, nor on any alternative wording. Therefore, the Commission can agree to the deletion of the proposal on fine bakery wares (Amendment 7).</p>
<p class="contents">However, the alternative wordings proposed in Amendments 12 and 13 are not clear and would render the implementation of the directive difficult. Therefore, the Commission cannot accept Amendments 12 and 13, although I note Mr Bowis' point on Amendment 12 which may change the view of the Commission. I will have to give reconsideration to that issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, two amendments have been tabled that aim to ban cyclamates and sucralose. Both substances have been evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food and have been assigned an acceptable daily intake. That means that these substances are safe if their consumption stays below the acceptable daily intake. To ensure this, the Commission has estimated the consumption of sucralose and introduced measures to reduce the consumption of cyclamate.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament proposes to reinforce these measures and the Commission can support that. But as the Commission considers these sweeteners to be fundamentally safe, there are no reasons to deprive consumers and the food industry of their use. The Commission cannot therefore accept Amendments 9, 10 and 11.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, the Commission can accept Amendments 1, 6, 7 and 8, but cannot accept Amendments 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
