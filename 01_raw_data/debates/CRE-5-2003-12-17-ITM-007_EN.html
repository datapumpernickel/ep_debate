<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lisi (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, this Commission proposal on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights has, at last – it is to be hoped – come to the end of its journey. Before going any further, I have to say that I believe conciliation has yielded the best possible outcome, given the fact that the process has been just as difficult and complex as that we have just been discussing.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now summarise the key points of this conciliation, which focused on what had not been resolved at first and second readings, but I would also like to stress the essential and fairly simple concept underpinning this compromise: in other words, we have to consider the rights of air transport passengers as part of a more general context, as part of the whole system of air transport. A system in which all the players on the field, including control authorities, management authorities, airlines and the passengers themselves, are interdependent. Thus, the best way of guaranteeing effective passenger rights is to ensure the smooth running of this system: to make sure that none of the rules we want to introduce hampers this extremely sensitive, large-scale mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Members will remember, the Commission’s initial proposal gave rise to huge numbers of concerns. Parliament attempted to address them by adopting 40 amendments. Then came a Council common position, which we immediately realised had improved the text, in particular as regards the then thorny issue of the amount of compensation, although other points which Parliament had raised had not been followed up.</p>
<p class="contents">What were the most important of these points? They were those which concerned procedures for implementing the various levels of assistance to passengers in the event of cancellation or long delay of flights. Now, as regards these two points, long delay and cancellation of flights, I believe that the result we have achieved reflects to a great extent what the best airlines already offer to passengers voluntarily and only introduces one new element, namely the certainty of these rights for passengers, certainty which is not limited, even though extraordinary circumstances are not excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, we convinced the Council, and Parliament is pleased to have achieved this, that there is just one message we have to send out: ‘Dear passenger, we cannot guarantee you many rights, we can only guarantee you a few, but those which we guarantee are certain, they are not subject to conditions’. It would, indeed, be a mistake and counterproductive to raise expectations and then see these rights denied and these expectations crushed by the behaviour of airlines. I am talking about even the most basic rights such as, for example, the right to be able to have a drink, to be able to make a telephone call, to be able to contact friends or relatives.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore produced a mechanism which introduces a tier-system for services which have to be provided to passengers, and, most importantly, a full range: from minimum service – on-the-spot assistance in airports in the event of cancellation of flights or excessive delays of over five hours – to some sort of compensation for damages, specifically financial compensation, which is the highest level of protection we have provided.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel it is important to mention the agreement on mutual right of redress: this was an important point of the conciliation text because it allows, for instance, tour operators who have to comply with these regulations to claim from the air carrier operating the service where the air carrier is responsible for the provision of bad service. As you know, the other points are of minor importance, such as, for example, coherence with everything we had introduced at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President, by thanking all those who have helped to achieve this result, which I feel is to be supported, despite the pressure in recent hours from a number of lobbies who are doing everything they can to stop the text being adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This Regulation is intended to reduce the frequency with which two entirely unacceptable practices take place in the field of transport, which seriously prejudice passengers, who sometimes feel – we feel – as if we are treated as luggage, rather than people, or citizens, or consumers with rights. One of these practices consists of passengers with perfectly valid tickets, who fulfil all their conditions, not being allowed to fly when the time comes to use it. The other practice consists of a flight being suspended by an air company, despite the passenger holding a perfectly valid ticket, in other words a contract with that company, not for external or extraordinary reasons preventing the flight – such as fog, for example – but for commercial reasons such as, for example – and I imagine that this has not just happened to me and that some of the honourable Members will have been in the same situation – there being few passengers for that flight.</p>
<p class="contents">The provisions being proposed here are intended to establish compensation which will mean that air companies do not have incentives and are dissuaded from carrying out these practices and furthermore to restrict as far as possible the inconveniences and problems caused for passengers and citizens who find themselves in these situations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to go into details, because the rapporteur, Mr Lisi, has explained them very well. I hope that, with the entry into force of the Regulation, there will be a drastic reduction in the number of passengers prevented from flying and that, if this happens, that thanks to the use of the auction system or volunteer system – which is implemented with this system – there will be few difficulties and problems for citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that some of the honourable Members are concerned, and also that representatives of certain airlines have talked at length with some of you, in defence of their legitimate interests. I understand this concern, but I would like to say to you that companies are now clearly getting through the rough patch they have suffered over recent years. Nobody has greater responsibility and greater concern for the economic success of our air companies than the Commission. In this regard, we have implemented over all these years a series of measures aimed at supporting, sustaining and defending our air companies within Europe and outside of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you of one of these measures: the ‘Single Sky’ initiative, which is going to mean a reduction in costs and better rotation of the fleet, the authorisation of alliances, the combating of distortions in competition conditions – specifically, the issue of support for our air companies in the face of anti-competitive or predatory practices on the part of third countries – and the support we have given them in relation to issues such as insurance when there have been difficulties in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that we are dealing with European air companies and defending their interests, which is what we must do: now we are specifically negotiating agreements with the United States, so that we may have a United States-European Union common transatlantic aviation zone.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not all, however, because we must also defend the rights of passengers, of citizens. And that is what we are going to support and strengthen through these measures. I would also like to say that serious and responsible companies are already applying the majority of these measures on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I hope that tomorrow this Parliament will support the result of this conciliation, and I would like once again to thank the chairperson, Mrs Cederschiöld, and the rapporteur, Mr Lisi. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why all of us, from the beginning, focussing on the consumer's interests, said that this view should be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we also looked at the interests of the airlines, especially in this critical period which we are going through in the air transport sector and, for this reason, the European Parliament was in favour, from the outset, of balanced measures which, on the one hand, would serve the consumer without, on the other hand, damaging the airlines and their competitiveness. Our rapporteur, Mr Giorgio Lisi, who has done an excellent job, which was ultimately crowned with success during the conciliation procedure, also personally took this line.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally was in favour, including during the conciliation procedure, and I shall also vote in favour of the result of the agreement with the Council tomorrow, because I think that, without damaging the airlines, it provides a good framework within which to protect the consumer, the passenger. I know that certain airlines continue to have some objections. I have taken them into account, but I do not agree with them. I think they are exaggerating, I think that the agreement we have is a good agreement and that we should accept it as it stands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Flight cancellations and delays are also increasing, especially in the tourist season. That is not in the consumer’s interests. My group therefore welcomes the regulation. It will give us a uniform European legal framework, probably from 2005. I am sure we have succeeded in achieving a fair balance between the interests of consumers and carriers. The excessive level of compensation sought by the Commission has been cut back to a realistic amount. The reference to extraordinary circumstances reduces carriers’ responsibility to a reasonable level. I therefore anticipate that the Council will follow Parliament in agreeing to the outcome of conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">This represents an advance over the existing arrangements because we now have a list of benefits to which passengers are legally entitled, not just in cases of overbooking as before, but also when flights are cancelled or delayed. At the heart of the improvement are the compensation payments, which are twice as high as was hitherto the norm in Europe under the voluntary arrangements. For example, if I get to Tegel before finding out that my flight from Berlin to Mallorca has been cancelled, I not only get my ticket replaced, but I also get EUR 400 compensation. I get the same amount if I am left behind because of overbooking. This also places a measure of pressure on airlines to be more sensitive in their use of the overbooking system, necessary as it is. Of course, we also hope that greater efforts will be made to reduce delays and the occasional abusive cancellation of flights when they are not quite full.</p>
<p class="contents">One side effect of the regulation will be to reduce the gap in the terms of competition between budget and traditional airlines. We are now setting standards for passenger rights in aviation which sooner or later ought to apply for other modes of transport as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of Europe’s assemblies, ours is probably the one whose Members travel most as part of our daily work. We are therefore only too well aware of overbooked, delayed flights and poor service, as well as the resultant frustration. I therefore believe that the proposal, involving limits upon delays and compensation in the event of cancellations, would put pressure upon the airlines, which would thus be given a clear incentive to tighten up on departures and get their planes away on time, to the benefit of passengers. It would also hopefully lead to more sensible departure times and clear compensation for passengers whenever they do not leave on time. Details of the compensation payable by the airlines must, however, be publicly available so that people can see clearly what it amounts to.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, a problem I fear may arise. In connection with the legislation, the principle, which is also to apply to package trips, has been introduced of refunding air tickets. That is something I can, of course, only welcome since it places European consumers in a better position. The problem is just that it can often be difficult to discover the correct price of an airline ticket that is part of a package trip. I am certain, however, that this is something that can easily be solved in practice, as and when the problem arises. In general, I am, as I say, well satisfied with the proposal by the Conciliation Committee and hope and expect it to be adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposal is important because improving the conditions and criteria under which passengers should be reimbursed and assisted in the event of being denied boarding, cancellation or long delays is something that must be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also take account of cases of cancellation or long delays due to valid technical reasons for safety. We do not want to create a situation where airlines will decide to fly regardless of what the outcome will be. Nevertheless there have been many cases where passengers have been denied boarding because of overbooking – something which many in this Parliament will have experienced regarding some airlines in Europe – and people have been left high and dry, whether it be in Brussels or somewhere else.</p>
<p class="contents">A constituent of mine bought a flight online with the notorious Ryanair but when they went to collect the ticket they were denied access because they had an international student ID card and were refused boarding on the grounds that it was out of date. So they used a national student ID card which was valid but this was refused. So there is a major problem of what actually constitutes acceptable ID. This person paid quite a lot of money for the ticket; it was not one of those tickets costing a couple of euro, it was quite expensive. So how much are airlines making on this?</p>
<p class="contents">Another constituent got as far as London where he was then refused boarding on a continuing flight out of London to Europe. Airlines need to take responsibility for their passengers. They cannot be allowed to get away with treating passengers like this any longer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This regulation will, I hope, encourage airlines and travel companies to curtail their normal practices. I also welcome the reference that the regulation makes to sanctions, which have to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. In this respect, air passengers should receive compensation, an alternative flight, and assistance appropriate to the inconvenience suffered, and they should be offered these things as quickly as possible, which is not always the case at present. The extension of air passengers’ rights to include all types of flight is a welcome innovation. Thus passengers on scheduled flights, which represent only half of the market, and those on non-scheduled flights, particularly on package tours, will be able to assert their rights in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission Stated in its White Paper, ‘European transport policy for 2010: time to decide’, its objective is to refocus that policy on the basis of citizens’ demands and needs. We are counting on that. The inconvenience resulting from denied boarding, namely stress, fatigue and humiliation, can have serious consequences for the people affected. They may lose business, be prevented from attending funerals and so on. Members of this Parliament who frequently have to use air transport in order to travel between Brussels, Strasbourg and their own regions are particularly aware of such inconvenience and of the resulting loss of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as Vice-Chairman of the ‘Handicap’ Intergroup, I am glad that Article 11 refers to giving priority treatment to persons with reduced mobility. However, the list could have been extended to cover people travelling with young children.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the exemptions in the case of strikes, the required periods of notice should make it possible for airlines to react in good time and to remain subject to the constraints of this regulation. I also welcome the provision concerning the obligation to inform passengers concerning their rights, by means of a notice in easily legible characters displayed in the check-in area, giving special attention – more explicit than that laid down in the regulation – to providing information, by appropriate means, for blind or partially sighted persons. Such passenger-protection schemes should be extended to cover other modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it would appear fundamentally necessary for airlines to seek to ensure, in advance, that they offer a high-quality service to their passengers, so that the latter no longer have to suffer any inconvenience. I hope that the Members of this House will support this agreement, which seeks to respect the rights of passengers so that the practices in question occur as rarely as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some Member States have recently been having doubts about the compromise, thinking it places too heavy a burden on the airlines. But that cannot be the case at all. The European Parliament has clearly reduced the rates of compensation in the airlines’ favour. The European Parliament has introduced clear rules for cases of <span class="italic">force</span> <span class="italic">majeure</span> so that airlines do not have to act if they are not responsible for the circumstances leading to a cancellation or overbooking. The Parliament has even put back the entry into force for 12 months because we take the airlines’ particular and difficult economic situation seriously. So these entire arrangements will not come into force until 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">If the transport industry, be it the tourism sector or some other one, is now voicing doubts about this compromise, then I have to say that it is more than unfair and not at all acceptable. Many governments need to think whether they want to risk being shown by us as a Parliament to be clearly hostile to the consumer if they take this line in the Council. European elections are looming, should the Council wish to take this subject up.</p>
<p class="contents">May I make one further remark in conclusion? The budget airlines, who did not take any of this at all seriously at first, are now coming and saying that these levels of compensation are far too high. If a budget airline offers a flight for EUR 50, then it is still obliged to make the flight, despite the low price. Because the rights of the citizen who wants to go somewhere at a particular time, be it for business or tourism, have been violated and he must be compensated if he is left standing or can only fly a day later. Even budget airlines must compensate their passengers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I could also thank Mr Jarzembowski for saying many of the things I was going to say, which is a rare thing indeed. I agree with him completely, for example, that it is a nonsense to say that the airlines will not cope. Let us be honest: air travel will double in Europe in the next 30 years, so it is not as if the airlines cannot afford to provide a glass of water and a biscuit if there is a delay. That is the sort of basic standard we should expect in the future, if this goes through.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome many of the features. For example, for too long passengers have suffered when airlines have cancelled or delayed flights for purely commercial reasons. I hope that will end. At last airlines will be forced to provide passengers with the food and refreshments they deserve, with the dignity and respect they deserve. I hope that all this will mean that the days of commercial cancellations and lengthy delays will be over. This is a great breakthrough for all airline passengers and also for the airlines, because it will not affect good airlines which look after their passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, this deal could have been even better had colleagues on that side of the House stood firmer in conciliation. That was not to be. To misquote Neil Armstrong: it may not be a giant leap for mankind, but it is an important first step.</p>

In the last 30 years I have been flying round the world an average of twice a week, which is perhaps more than many others here in this House. I cannot in general agree with the statement made by many of my fellow Members that air passengers are being treated badly. We deserve rights but should we cram as many Christmas presents as possible into this package?</p>
<p class="contents">Because, ladies and gentlemen, what do the airlines do for money? They operate using the money they receive from us, the passengers. Would it not be better to solve these problem situations through greater competition, broken monopolies and reduced regulation? We cannot provide passengers with better service by increasing legislation and putting a strain on the airlines, because even today’s system works excellently in the countries which apply it. We live in a world of open competition and this will only mean that third countries will have the competitive edge. The European consumer deserves as many options as possible and the cheapest tickets possible. More red tape of this sort will not help the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to interlining, I would say that if a British Airways flight from Tokyo arrives at Helsinki and Finnair goes on from there to Oulu and this onward flight is cancelled due to bad weather, it is unfair if Finnair has to pay the whole cost of the ticket.</p>
<p class="contents">I truly believe that an air passenger’s rights must be protected, but air passengers and airlines go hand in hand and, at the end of the day, their interests cannot be separated. Increased fares may easily be awaiting us at the end of the runway. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not believe that anybody disputes the importance of the air sector, but I am from a country for which the air sector is of great strategic importance. I believe that those countries with a high level of tourism have a greater interest than anybody in the air sector being more solvent and having greater capacity, since vital elements of development depend on it in numerous European countries. But it is true that this is perfectly compatible with passengers being compensated for the harm done to them. What is the harm done to a passenger when they are delayed? Is it simply that they are made to wait two, three or four hours in the departure hall? When there is an overbooking, what harm is done to the passenger? It would be very difficult to evaluate that harm, but I am absolutely certain that it is a harm which goes much further than the compensation which we are establishing here, at times without any possible comparison. We must therefore deal with it.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this Parliament has carried out a very important and interesting exercise with this report. I would therefore like to thank Mr Lisi for the care he has taken. Parliament has moderated – and even reduced, in some cases – the proposals presented to us by the Commission and the Council. We have taken account of the objective interests and the survival of companies, which does credit to this Parliament and, naturally, it seems to me absolutely essential that we stop classifying many of the specious arguments that companies frequently give passengers as ‘extraordinary circumstances’.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we have begun an interesting process. Let us hope that it is extended to other forms of transport and that we go further in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It goes without saying that I, along with my colleagues, expect passengers travelling on European airlines to be treated in a fair and respectful manner. I also firmly believe that if their travel plans are disrupted and it is the fault of the airline, then that airline should take full responsibility. Sadly this regulation, in its present state, will badly damage our airline industry and, in particular, our regional and low-cost carriers, thereby threatening jobs and reducing the opportunities the consumer has come to expect in terms of choice and a competitive level of airfares.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore with regret that I will be unable to support this regulation, for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">First, in the final draft of Article 6, referring to delays, the regulation is seriously flawed. The exclusion of extraordinary circumstances places an unacceptable financial burden on the carrier. Situations such as industrial disputes, air traffic delays, adverse weather conditions and possible terrorist threats cannot be foreseen by any airline. Therefore to include full reimbursement, as well as a return flight to the first point of departure, is wholly unacceptable. To suggest that the airlines will be able to obtain compensation from third party providers is a myth. Maybe they will apply to heaven if it is a weather problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, referring to Article 5 on cancellations, I echo my previous points. The impact of this regulation has taken no account of Parliament's support in strengthening our regional airports. Nor has the Commission thought through the impact on charter carriers, which often have only one or two flights a week to particular destinations.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, at the beginning of this process I criticised the Commission on its ill-timed, badly drafted proposal. It ignored the new voluntary commitment and failed to provide a financial impact assessment. An extra GBP 1 billion of costs for the airlines will not benefit passengers but will penalise them by increasing the price of tickets and reducing choice.</p>
<p class="contents">The irony is that none of these rules would apply to third country airlines flying into the EU. If the Commission wanted to give our business away to the rest of the world, then it has done a jolly good job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that we have come up with a more or less balanced text, compared with an initial proposal which seemed to us to contain a certain number of risks.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that passengers’ rights are sacred. All too often the airlines treat them very lightly, whether it is a matter of looking after their passengers or of providing them with information. It is also clear that the practice of overbooking has in many cases revealed its limitations and proved that it is used as a commercial tool. We have even seen cases where planes did not take off because they were not full, which is absolutely inadmissible for someone who has signed a sale or purchase contract as part of the process of obtaining a ticket.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the text we have come up with is balanced overall. On the one hand, it tries to ensure that the practice of overbooking does not constitute a purely commercial practice but is restricted to a flexibility practice. We are aware that overbooking will never be reduced to zero by the airlines, because that is how they manage imponderables. There are some of us here in this House who often travel by air, and many of us benefit from overbooking practices when we arrive late or when things do not go according to plan and we have trouble getting to the airport. I do not think, therefore, that we ought to make a big issue of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the compensation scheme must be fair and equitable, and it must not be too complicated if we are to avoid endless disputes, and above all it should not be an incentive to airlines to take risks with safety. We must not go too far: we must not end up with a situation in which airlines are determined to take off at any price, even if there is a technical incident, because it would otherwise cost them too much to provide compensation for passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we have achieved this sort of balance in this report. I hope so but I am not altogether sure. Nevertheless, we shall be giving it our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was thought necessary because some airlines had got into a very bad habit of cancelling flights at the last minute, overbooking flights, inflicting delay because of inefficient operational practices and then, to add insult to injury, they treated their victims – their passengers – with total disdain and little or no sympathy.</p>
<p class="contents">Members may wish to dwell on the fact that a voluntary code of practice did exist with the more reliable airlines. However, the refusal of the so-called low-cost carriers to sign up to this voluntary agreement and the low levels of compensation given to the victims meant action on a more formal basis was required. The pendulum had to swing back in favour of the consumer to a more reasonable, balanced position.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal before us is a first step in ensuring that the travelling public are protected when transport operators fail to live up to their promises and obligations. I look forward to similar schemes being introduced with other modes, particularly ferries and so-called high-speed ships.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have before us today is not perfect. I regret that the Council of Ministers insisted on charter flights being included. I also regret the removal of extraordinary circumstances in the delay section, but welcome the exemption of rotor operators, the levels of compensation agreed and the inclusion of the low-cost carriers.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is not perfect: it poses many questions in regard to existing legislation and highlights areas where existing legislation is inadequate. I cite the package travel directive as one example. But we must recognise that at last consumers and the travelling public are being given rights that they deserve, backed up with compensation when airlines fail in their promises.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent months I have been subjected to every kind of doom-and-gloom scenario from some airlines and even certain Members of Parliament. But remember this: if the airlines do not cancel or overbook, if they run the services they advertise on time and stick to their contract with the travelling public, then this proposal will not cost them one euro. It becomes expensive to airlines when they fail to deliver – and what is wrong with that?</p>

As others have already mentioned, it is not a perfect solution, but it is necessary at this time. We would not need a regulation of this kind if it were not for the fact that every year in Europe over 500 000 passengers are affected by cancellations and the denial of boarding. It is important that the European Parliament and the Commission are seen to be serving the public of Europe. This regulation demonstrates the added value that the European Union can provide in terms of rights for European citizens.</p>
