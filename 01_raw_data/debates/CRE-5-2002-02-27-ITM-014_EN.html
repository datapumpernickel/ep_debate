This proposal is based on Article 285 of the EC Treaty, a new provision introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam. In particular, this article lays down that the Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251, shall adopt measures for the production of statistics where necessary for the performance of the activities of the Community<span class="italic">.</span> Article 285 goes on to stipulate that Community statistics are to be compiled in accordance with the principles of impartiality, reliability, objectivity, scientific independence, cost-effectiveness and statistical confidentiality and that their compilation must not entail excessive burdens on economic operators. The framework here is one of codecision procedure, and the European Central Bank has requested that this statistical instrument, this labour-cost index, be an indicator to be taken into account when drafting the monetary policy. The Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) meeting on 29 September 2000, adopted an action plan on the statistical requirements of the economic and monetary Union, which includes a project to draw up provisional statistics on labour costs. I ask that this project be presented at the earliest possible date. At the present time we already have an index of labour costs. The index was created during the 1990s by the Statistical Programme Committee, but it has no legal basis, and the way in which it is calculated leaves a lot to be desired in terms of how recent the figures are, its coverage and comparability.</p>
<p class="contents">The underlying notion of the European Central Bank’s request and the Commission’s proposal is that the cost of labour is one of the causes of inflation. The European institutions responsible for economic, employment and monetary policy therefore need to have regular reliable indicators of labour costs. This opinion is debatable and I also believe that it is shared by one committee within the Commission and rejected by another. As far as low pay is concerned, the argument against the aforesaid opinion is that several Member States have a minimum wage which is increased in response to rises in the cost of living and not <span class="italic">vice versa</span>. Nonetheless, it is useful for the European Union to have a macroeconomic indicator of labour costs, which can be a particularly valuable tool for management and labour representatives in their negotiations on the formulation of collective agreements, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the proposal is to establish a common framework for the production, transmission and evaluation of comparable labour-cost indices. That is the objective of Article 1. These costs are defined as the total quarterly costs incurred by the employer in the employment of labour (Article 2). The data must be broken down by economic categories. Four indices will be established: an index relating to total labour costs, another index showing labour costs, excluding bonuses, which are not paid regularly, then an index of wages and salaries and, lastly, an index of the combined amount of social security contributions plus taxes paid by employers less the subsidies they receive as compensation for direct labour costs. On this last point, it should be noted that it is often the government which sets the level of these contributions and that it cannot therefore be claimed that inflation is fuelled by pay rises alone.</p>
<p class="contents">The data for the labour-cost index are to be compiled on a quarterly basis (Article 5(1)) and must be supplied in index form within 70 days of the end of the reference period (Article 6(1)). Transition periods may not extend more than two years from the date of entry into force of the regulation (Article 9(1)). In implementing the regulation, including the adoption of decisions on derogations from its provisions, the Commission is to be assisted by the Statistical Programme Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Here are a few points to consider. Analysis of labour costs is undoubtedly an important factor, as I have said, in terms of the macroeconomic perspective. It may, however, raise some questions. This index will ultimately have to be refined through the creation of a separate index for total cost excluding expenditure on vocational training for which the employer is responsible. There is also the possibility, for which provision is made in an amendment tabled by my group, of taking hourly productivity into account and of postponing the first deadline for the submission of an assessment report until 31 December 2003, in order to permit an analysis based on a period of operation which takes account of a possible transition period. For technical reasons, this matter was not raised in committee, and so we were compelled to table this amendment belatedly.</p>
<p class="contents">Please excuse me, but I realise that my time has run out. I am not used to these timed reports and have exceeded my allotted slot by one minute and eleven seconds. At such a late hour, I appreciate that this is a reprehensible abuse of your tolerance, and for this I apologise again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our electors are surely unlikely to be interested either in the work and effort we devote to these proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I am often the rapporteur on proposals concerning the compiling of statistics by Eurostat, and I am forever preaching to my fellow Members that ill-informed citizens or politicians – yes, even female politicians – will misjudge situations and take unwise decisions, and that is dangerous. When it comes to statistics, there are certainly some people who delight in citing the quotation about there being three kinds of lies – lies, damned lies and statistics – on the grounds that quoting statistics is the most devious form of lying. Be that as it may, we still must not forget that reliable and comparable statistics are a necessity. Eurostat does excellent work in this domain and will continue to do so, provided that we politicians furnish it with a legal base and the financial resources it requires to perform its task.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, now that we all have the single currency in our pockets, I should like to emphasise the need to have statistics on labour costs at our disposal, because they are part of the indispensable information that makes it possible to evaluate what is actually happening on the ground in terms of inflation within the euro area, to evaluate developments that are crucial to the stability of our currency, which is now the currency of all our countries apart from the three that have not adopted it. It is wrong to say – and I disagree with the rapporteur here – that the cost of labour is not a source of inflation, because it is simply not true that increases in labour costs are always justified by the rising cost of living or by improvements in the productivity of the workforce. Think of what is happening in Germany, where, contrary to all common sense, the trade unions are demanding pay rises which would threaten thousands of jobs and increase inflation at a time when the largest Member State of the European Union is already causing us enough concern over its compliance or non-compliance with the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solbes can tell us something of what went on in the Council of Ministers, because many people believe that the Stability Pact has already died a natural death. This is why every effort must be made to ensure that we obtain as quickly as possible a common framework for the production, communication and evaluation of comparable labour-cost indices of the sort that will result from this proposed regulation, which must be adopted as soon as possible. My group, by the way, does not agree with the amendments tabled by the rapporteur on behalf of his group, because he is asking for things that are impracticable and counterproductive – and this, incidentally, is also the view of the Commission and Eurostat. We shall therefore reject these amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What strikes me about me about the Commission's statement is that in a zone as large as the EMU, labour costs are generally considered as the main potential source of inflation. That is an overstatement of the situation. I accept, of course, that rises in prices and labour prices and labour costs can impact on inflation, but clearly in our Member State economies, where increasingly wage rates are negotiated through national agreements and are linked to productivity, and have all kinds of other factors built into any increases that employees get, the likelihood of labour costs being the driving force behind inflation to my mind is untrue. That is not to say that it is not a factor.</p>
<p class="contents">What is a significant factor, however, is the operation of the market itself. I have personal experience of this in Ireland where prices on the housing market have simply exploded. Houses that were being sold five years ago for IEP 80 000 are now selling for IEP 250 000 Irish Pounds. This is extraordinary and wage rises had nothing whatsoever to do with it. It had to do with market demand, growth in the economy, etc. In fact probably, indirect taxation as part of government policy in relation to spending has a greater impact on inflation.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said all that, this is a useful tool for the European Union to develop. It is important in order to manage the euro and the European monetary zone. It is inadequate in some respects because large areas of income are excluded. Professional fees for example are not included in this labour cost index and we all know the extent to which professional fees are virtually uncontrollable. These bodies set their own fees by and large, certainly in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Also the issue of costs for education and training should be factored in, because obviously this is a cost, or should be a cost, in most cases to employers. So this is a useful tool and we should proceed with it. We need to review the position within a year or two to see how it is working to see what else might be factored in. And I would just ask the Commission to bear in mind that if it really believes that labour costs are the main potential factor for driving up inflation it will be making bad policy decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, you have opened a debate which is of certain interest, but which is not exactly a debate on the proposal for a regulation that we presented. I would say that the concern that some of you have expressed about the interrelationship between salaries and inflation, which could be a debate for another occasion, has little to do with what the text of the preamble to the proposal for a regulation actually says. This states that a set of statistics, of which the labour cost indexes form an essential part, is an aspect that is crucial to understanding inflationist processes and the dynamic of the labour market. I would say that this statement is hard to refute. Clearly, we could go into the other issue in greater detail.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the debate itself, I shall simply refer to the two concerns expressed by Mr Mayol i Raynal.</p>
<p class="contents">To what extent, on the one hand, can indexes be drawn up in the future which do not take account of training costs and which exclude this type of cost? Clearly, here we have a purely technical problem, to do with the cost/benefit ratio. These total costs are quite insignificant. Ultimately, they affect less than 2% of total costs and, nevertheless, calculating these training costs would have or would lead to a very significant cost in terms of compiling the statistics as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, until we have better information that enables us to do so at a lower cost, we are not in favour of adopting this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor are we in favour of not drafting the report that is planned for the end of 2002. I fully understand the arguments put forward by Mr Mayol i Raynal to the effect that we will still be in a transitional period and not all of the regulation will apply 100%. The truth, however, is that we will already have a certain amount of experience in implementing the regulation and, furthermore, we will be able to more clearly highlight its shortcomings and problems.</p>
<p class="contents">If the aim of the report is to understand the difficulties of implementing the regulation and adopting the measures necessary for this implementation to take place as efficiently as possible, we believe that maintaining the year 2002 as the target date is still correct. Nevertheless, if Parliament wishes to have additional information at a later date on the implementation of the regulation, it is fully within its rights to request it and Eurostat and I, personally, will be happy to provide it.</p>
<p class="contents">That, ladies and gentlemen, is all I have to say. Thank you for your cooperation in approving this regulation, which is important in statistical terms and also important to defining the future of monetary policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
