I believe that you can.</p>
<p class="contents">The presence of a broken down nuclear submarine in the waters of the Bay of Algeciras has now unfortunately become a diplomatic conflict between a colonial and nuclear military power and a second category Member State, according to the latest classification in Nice, which does not demand its rights and gives in to infantile explanations.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty is not being complied with, nor are important directives on radioactive protection, and you, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, know this and merely look the other way.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems that you do not want internal conflicts, so why sign Treaties? Where, here and now, is the Charter of Fundamental Rights for the citizens of Gibraltar and Algeciras and the Andalusians of the area? Have you received the general information relating to the evacuation plan of the British authorities, which they are obliged to produce?</p>
<p class="contents">The plan should include the evacuation and the possibility of an accident which contaminates another Member State, a possible cross-border contamination. You know this. What are you doing? Have you replied to the complaint of the Association of Municipalities of <span class="italic">Campo de Gibraltar</span>? When is the Committee on Petitions going to reply to a communication presented and signed by more than 35 associations – collectives, unions and municipalities – from the area?</p>
<p class="contents">Let us forget about the yellow submarine and other tomfoolery, which has no place here. This is now real. Let us be serious.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, your initial jeers, when I condemned this case on 5 July, and your laughter, have simply increased the desire of the Andalusian people to be respected and not to be humiliated with shameful explanations and to be obliged to endure an unnecessary situation of risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, do not allow the repair of this submarine in an inappropriate base. Ask and demand that it be removed when the technical and climatic conditions allow it. Commissioners, do not allow our gorgeous bay to become nothing but a workshop for nuclear junk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Once upon a time there was a British nuclear submarine called the Tireless. While sailing through Sicilian waters, back in the month of May, its nuclear heart showed worrying signs of deterioration. Those in charge of the submarine tried to have it admitted into a hospital, classified as suitable for providing treatment, of which they were coproprietors, at that time a NATO base. But the director of the hospital did not authorise the admission.</p>
<p class="contents">The submarine sailed on, infecting the waters of the Mediterranean on the way, until it arrived at an agreed hospital called Gibraltar. There, showing themselves to be fully in charge, they parked it.</p>
<p class="contents">In order that it might be admitted, they said that the illness was not serious. When, by means of the medical dispatch which they distributed in the country where the owner lived – that is, by means of the British press – it was discovered that the illness was serious, instead of changing hospitals, they changed the classification of the hospital.</p>
<p class="contents">A patient was admitted to a first aid centre and, when it was discovered that it did not have flu, but a serious illness, a painter was employed to change the sign on the door and put ‘Hospital’ where before it had said ‘Health Centre’.</p>
<p class="contents">However, that strategy was not enough to prevent all the patients and their families from finding out that they had admitted an infectious patient and from knowing that there was a risk of catching the disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Then the lies and manoeuvrings began: the lies – or silences – of the person who had admitted it and the lies and silences of the person in charge of health in the area. Because, while the owner of the submarine told us something different every day, the person in charge of health in the area did whatever he wanted. He even told us jokes about the yellow submarine or about jurisdiction in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">To top it all, it was at that time that the population most directly affected discovered that, some time before, that same country which owned the submarine had, for ten years, deceived all Europeans about mad cow disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this situation cannot be allowed to continue. Citizens’ associations, social organisations, local authorities and autonomous communities have asked both this Parliament’s Committee on Petitions and the Commission to intervene and protect them.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe and its institutions cannot remain on the outside. There is considerable and understandable alarm, the consequence of a perverse double combination of stubbornness and incompetence: The stubbornness of those people who refuse to alter their initial position and the incompetence of those who are unable to vigorously defend the health and safety of hundreds of thousands of European citizens who live in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not being alarmist. It would be alarming if we failed to act immediately in this situation. Every day there are statements to the effect that there are reasons not to authorise the repair of the Tireless in Gibraltar. Let us not wait any longer. Let us accept the situation once and for all and take the submarine, with every possible safeguard, to a British port which fulfils the requirements for its repair, before it is too late; before the Tireless ends up wearing all of us citizens and Europeans out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What the various parliamentary Groups have expressed in their questions is that we want the Commission to inform us about their representations to the Government of the United Kingdom with a view to ensuring compliance with the obligations contained in the legislation in force and, secondly, to inform us about its initiatives on this issue, in accordance with the powers attributed to it, where relevant, by the Euratom Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we await the Commission’s reply with great interest, in order to see whether the objective has been fulfilled. We do not doubt the Commission’s good intentions, but we all hope that we do not have to regret ending this debate with the same information with which we started it.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that very diverse interests are at play in this debate – and this is also the case within my Group. However, we have made an effort to achieve dialogue and mutual understanding, which I believe could allow us to broaden this consensus on the basic issues to a majority in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, that is what can be deduced from a careful reading of the motions for resolutions of the Socialist and European People’s Party/European Democrat Groups. In both, I truly believe that we agree on the essential issues. In both, we express our understanding of the natural concern of the local population. In both, we ask for the greatest degree of transparency, in order not to promote unfounded fears. In both, we ask the Commission to examine the possibilities contained in the current Treaties to ascertain what opportunities it has to contribute to this issue. In both, we express the need for the two Member States involved, the United Kingdom and Spain, to work together closely to find a safer solution for the repair of the submarine, while keeping the public fully up-to-date, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">If, in the light of the texts presented, we agree on this – and this is a lot – I wonder why we have not been able to produce a joint motion for a resolution. I can assure you that it was not due to a lack of will on the part of my Group.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the Socialist Group presented an urgent motion for a resolution in the last plenary session; that it then voted in favour of a proposal from my Group to remove that point of order; the fact that it did not attend a meeting called by all groups to try to produce a consensus text; and that then the main signatory of the Socialist resolution and various others also signed the joint motion for a resolution of the Green and United Left Groups, no doubt sends us all into confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">And what is the Socialist Group going to vote for now? That is anyone’s guess.</p>
<p class="contents">I would modestly like to suggest that they vote for our motion for a resolution. And I would humbly like to advise my Spanish Socialist compatriots to be guided by the general interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to stress the warranted importance of the pact against terrorism agreed between the Popular Party and the Socialist Party, and I believe it is important that, from the European Union’s point of view, progress is made in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue we are dealing with – the anomalous situation of the British submarine Tireless in the only British colony in the Mediterranean, Gibraltar – on 7 September I asked an oral question about it. In this, I pointed out that the fault with the submarine which, since 12 May, had been in Sicilian waters, could not be repaired in the port of Gibraltar, since the Italian and NATO authorities had refused to receive the submarine in its ports.</p>
<p class="contents">In that intervention I also pointed out the lack of seriousness and respect shown by the British authorities in reclassifying the role of the port of Gibraltar, moving it in the best colonial fashion from category Z to X for the purposes of being able to carry out repairs. I also pointed out the alarm amongst the 200 000 people who live in the area, within a radius of 10 kilometres.</p>
<p class="contents">The evasive response that I received from the Commission on that occasion forced me to ask a second question, on 21 September, urging the Commission to ask the British Government to remove the Tireless to a British port, and also to monitor this issue. The reply received from the Commission was disappointing and unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that that feeling of dissatisfaction with the reply has nothing to do with the fact that Commissioner Patten is British, but, on the other hand, on the most important issue – the repair of the submarine in a European Union port which does not meet the minimum requirements – he said that this was an internal issue for the United Kingdom, when, according to the Euratom Treaty, this is not the case; and, on the other hand, he simply said that he would keep Parliament informed. Nevertheless, since that moment the European Parliament has received no information from the Commission, despite the fact that it has promised to provide it. So, over these months, we have been on a wild goose chase.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had statements from the responsible parties in the British army to the effect that the fault was not significant, and others saying the complete opposite, that it was serious and required long and difficult repairs. We have heard statements from the Spanish Government to the effect that there was no cause for alarm, and others, recent ones fortunately, from Minister Piqué, urging that the submarine be taken away as soon as possible – although they have given a time period of three months – so that it may be repaired in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">After visits to the submarine by Spanish nuclear safety experts, we have heard that there is no danger, but we have had later statements indicating that they were not allowed to see, observe or inspect the actual site of the fault.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, I believe the Commission must be aware of what an anomalous situation we are dealing with and that, firstly, it must demand an immediate halt to any repairs taking place in Gibraltar. Secondly, it must demand that all possible information be given to the population, as laid down in the Euratom Treaty. Thirdly, I believe that the British Government should be taken to task for the irresponsibility and flippancy it showed in carrying out this reclassification, so that the port of Gibraltar may return to its original category.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the submarine Tireless should be taken to Great Britain to be repaired as soon as possible, as soon as the weather conditions are suitable.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we can reach the conclusion that there is general alarm about this type of atomic submarine in all the countries of the European Union and throughout the whole world and, therefore, I believe we should recommend that this type of nuclear submarine disappear from the map and from the oceans.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out, given that the Commission has been so ineffective, that a delegation of experts should be sent to view the situation on the ground, since so far we cannot have confidence in what the government has done.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I believe that the British Government should compensate the area economically, since there have been losses in terms of tourism and fishing for which the British Government is responsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like, as well, to salute the courage of all those in Spain like Basta Ya and those involved in the democratic process who resist terrorism in all its cowardly and vicious forms. I was here yesterday during the presentation of the Sakharov Prize to listen to Basta Ya. I agreed entirely with everything that was said yesterday and I too would like to offer my condolences to the family and friends of the murdered democratically-elected official. I have had some experience of dealing with terrorism myself in another environment and I very strongly support those who resist terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to the honourable Members for their questions to which I am replying on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Wallström. She regrets that she cannot be here to answer the questions in person because she is engaged in meetings in Brussels to prepare for next week's important ministerial meeting on climate change. I know the House recognises that she would have been here if possible and it falls to me to answer in her stead.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to say one thing to the honourable Member who spoke a moment or two ago. When I became a Commissioner I swore an oath to be completely independent in the performance of my duties in the general interest of the Communities, to neither seek nor take instructions from any government or from any other body in the performance of my duties. I would not take an oath lightly.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members have asked a number of questions relating to the presence of the British nuclear submarine <span class="italic">HMS Tireless</span> in Gibraltar for repairs to her nuclear reactor. I know the Commission knows how concerned they are about this issue and I hope that this debate is heard and read elsewhere. Honourable Members have asked whether the Commission considers that Directives 89/618/Euratom, on informing the public in the event of radiological emergency, and 96/29/Euratom on basic safety standards, apply in relation to the submarine and what steps have been taken accordingly. Honourable Members have also asked a question concerning Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty in relation to the presence of the submarine in Gibraltar and, naturally, I have carefully read the terms of the joint motion for a resolution. I want to make a few remarks now and since this is an extremely important debate and important issues will be raised, I hope that I will be able to intervene again briefly at the end of the debate to pick up any points which have not been resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">I can confirm that the issue to which honourable Members refer has indeed been the subject of complaints to the Commission and I will come back and talk about those complaints at the end of my remarks. Let me set out the position under the Euratom Treaty. Chapter III of the Euratom Treaty headed "Health and Safety" is the legal basis for the three directives that are potentially relevant, Directive 89/618/Euratom on informing the public in the event of radiological emergency, Directive 96/29/Euratom on basic safety standards and Directive 92/3/Euratom on the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste. Article 37 of Chapter III concerns plans for the disposal of radioactive waste. The procedure under Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty relates to the submission of plans for the disposal of radioactive waste so as to enable the Commission to determine whether the implementation of such a plan is liable to result in the radioactive contamination of the water, soil or airspace of another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has taken the following action entirely in line with its legal competences. A letter was sent by the Commission to the British authorities on 10 October 2000. This requested information on: firstly, the existence of an intervention plan for the area of Gibraltar and for the Port of Gibraltar under the terms of Article 50 of Directive 96/29/Euratom; secondly, measures taken to inform the public in the event of a radiological emergency in connection with the repairs being carried out to the submarine in the Port of Gibraltar; thirdly, whether these measures take into account the possible impact on Spanish territory; fourthly, whether there are any plans for shipment of radioactive waste resulting from the repair of the submarine from Gibraltar to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Kingdom authorities replied by letter on 14 November and 1 December. These replies are currently under technical and legal assessment by the Commission's experts but, at this stage, the Commission can give the following information.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to whether an intervention plan exists for the area of Gibraltar and the port of Gibraltar, the British authorities have drawn the Commission's attention to the existence of the Gibraltar public safety scheme, known as "Gibpubsafe", which is the intervention plan for Gibraltar. The Commission is analysing this plan.</p>
<p class="contents">The British authorities state that Gibpubsafe provides background information and guidance on action to be taken in the event of a nuclear accident in Gibraltar. The intervention plan is "drawn up by the interested parties, which include the British Ministry of Defence, the Gibraltar Government and the emergency services and is issued by the Chief Officer, Gibraltar City Fire Brigade, and the Commander of British Forces, on behalf of the Gibraltar Local Liaison Committee." Gibpubsafe is apparently a public document and is freely available in the Gibraltar Public Library – but I will come back to that in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The British authorities state that there will be no shipment of radioactive waste that will transit through any other Member State; they also state that they are in regular contact with the Spanish authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members also asked if the port of Gibraltar meets the technical conditions needed for the repair of nuclear submarines. The Euratom Treaty does not enable the Commission to offer any judgement on the United Kingdom's decision in that regard. That is a matter for the UK authorities.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Protests from Ms Izquierdo Rojo)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I state what is the law. With regard to Article 37, the honourable Member can work to change the law and change the Treaty. I am telling her what I and my colleague Mr Wallström are legally advised is the position under the directives and Treaties. If she is a better lawyer than them, then I look forward to hearing from her. With regard to Article 37, then, due to the fact that a submarine is concerned for the first time, further assessment of the general applicability of Article 37 to such cases is being carried out by the Commission's services. It is clear, however, that Article 37 relates to the disposal of radioactive waste in general. The Community competence does not require general data to be submitted for the specific repair operations being undertaken. I again stress that every word I am delivering in this Chamber is what I am told by our legal advisers.</p>
<p class="contents">I have made it absolutely clear that we have to base our response to the legitimate concerns raised with us on the basis of Community competence. Pursuing Community competence, we have received a letter from the UK authorities in response to a letter of our own to which I referred earlier. Under the usual complaints procedure, we are not entitled to make this reply public, although we can say broadly what it says. What I am doing and saying about public access to documents is, as the House will know, entirely within the rules on public access, when there has been a complaint and when there may be, as a result of the complaint, infraction proceedings. Under the usual complaints procedure, as I have said, we cannot make the reply public – although we can say, as I have, what, broadly speaking, is in the reply.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I want to go beyond the legal. Speaking personally, I would encourage the British Government to make that reply public. I want to underline that point. As I mentioned, the reply makes reference to the nuclear intervention plan for Gibraltar. This is a public document available in the Gibraltar Public Library. I therefore asked my office last night to contact the Chief Secretary's office in Gibraltar to ask for a copy. I have a copy here and I am happy to provide it to the House straight away. I will respond again at the end of the debate, if I may.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry for taking rather longer than my allotted time, but it is an important subject. I just want to say one final word about the complaints so that Parliament knows <span class="italic">exactly</span> what the situation is. We have received <span class="italic">four</span> complaints so far. The first two have been registered with the Secretary-General, and the first reply has been sent. The last two complaints have only been received in the last few days and have been sent to the Secretary-General for registration. When the information in those complaints has been assessed by Commission officials and when more information has been sought and obtained from the United Kingdom, we will reply substantively to those complaints. I repeat that the information which we are able to make available on that process will be as is set out in the existing code on the public access to documents.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to repeat again that the more information that is provided by the British Government on this issue, the better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too have had some experience of that in another place.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point I would like to make is that the repairs to the cooling system of this submarine are already under way. It is already happening, so let us be realistic about what options face the UK and Gibraltar authorities in dealing with it. Let us please be realistic about the notion of lifting this submarine, waiting for weather conditions to be favourable and somehow transporting it back to the UK. It needs to be repaired <span class="italic">in situ</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">You have just heard the Commissioner say that defence issues in general, and in particular nuclear defence issues, are a matter for national sovereignty, not for this Parliament, but that the concerns of the public in Gibraltar and the adjoining areas are a natural and legitimate cause for debate in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">One might well ask whether the government of the United Kingdom has exercised its responsibility in that regard to keep its defence equipment properly maintained, and indeed whether people in the UK are aware that, because of this incident, and the withdrawal of other nuclear submarines, our shores are currently being defended – rumour has it – by a U-boat from Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is very important to keep this matter in proportion and to avoid crying wolf with alarmist statements which are not supported by the facts. This is a technical problem with a technical solution and the sooner the repair is completed, the better it will be for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Y el mensaje que debemos mandar de esta Cámara es simplemente a los terroristas que no pasarán nunca jamás. </span>[This Spanish phrase is very well known in my country “<span class="italic">¡No pasarán!</span>” (There is no way through!).

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If I could pass on to this issue, which is also a very sensitive one, I was interested in Mr Patten's response because, as I see it, the Euratom Treaty deals purely with civilian matters, not military matters, and this is a military matter. There is one aspect of the Euratom Treaty which is the transport of contaminated waste between Member States of the European Union; but, of course, Gibraltar is part of the United Kingdom and any contaminated waste will go from one part of the United Kingdom to another part of the United Kingdom, without passing through any other Member State in the European Union. Therefore, the Euratom Treaty does not apply.</p>
<p class="contents">Before us we have a green, gooey, compromise resolution and rarely in my time in the European Parliament have I seen a resolution which is more wrong, more deliberately inaccurate and more designed to scaremonger than this particular resolution we have before us. Let us deal with the details. The reactor is shut down. The submarine is entirely safe. It is a fault to the coolant circuit only. There was no over-heating. There was no danger and there was no contamination; and no, the submarine was not refused permission to enter Naples because it never asked for permission to enter Naples.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the alternative? Do we see a nuclear-powered submarine being towed through the Atlantic in the middle of winter in order to return to the United Kingdom? I can think of no more dangerous scenario, as we have seen in relation to submarines in the former Soviet Union. The only time we can do this is June or July, and yet the British Government said clearly that this submarine will be repaired by the end of March. So it would be better to repair it than to try and tow it through the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="contents">And no, the classification of the port was not changed by some sleight of hand. This is a category Z berth, a berth for nuclear submarines where nuclear submarines can be repaired, provided the nuclear authorities give permission. And the independent nuclear authorities have given permission. There is no permanent change to this berth. This is a temporary measure to repair this nuclear submarine, and I will recall that there are three category Z berths in Spain designed for the berthing, and presumably the repairing, of American submarines. And, of course, any repairs will be to the same standards as they are in the United Kingdom and in 40 years of having nuclear submarines the United Kingdom Navy has never had one incident.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a public safety plan, to which the Commission has drawn attention. The experts say that we need to have a public safety plan for a two-mile radius which does not come into Spanish territory; and yes, the public have been informed. There have been meetings of trade unionists, there have been meetings of the public, there have been public statements, there have been meetings with ministers of the Government of Spain and the Government of Gibraltar and they have entered the submarine; and our experts have gone off to Madrid in order to give information. Never in the history of the Ministry of Defence has there been so much openness in the United Kingdom. And on that my case rests, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are fully in sympathy with the Spanish people and very sorry to hear about it.</p>
<p class="contents">This problem with the submarine has to be settled calmly and with full cooperation between all interested, relevant authorities. Calm cooperation is the method which our Union uses. Hence I am happy to support the call by the Commissioner for as much transparency as possible and the publication of the British Government's letter. I felt, listening to the Commissioner's excellent report, growing confidence that the matter is being handled in the proper way.</p>
<p class="contents">The two major criteria which we have to study are the question of technical safety – a number of Members have spoken about that already – and gaining the full confidence of the public that everything is being handled in the way it should.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a Member who once used to represent Gibraltar as well as the constituency which I was elected to. So I would like to say something about the overall problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all democrats here by definition. In the Union we all try to look forward and not back to disagreements in the past. We all support the right of self-determination. I count my very dear Spanish colleagues among my best friends in Parliament. Mr Galeote Quecedo and I shared a delegation earlier this year and got on very well. So I should like to say to them that the way is open, in my opinion, for Spain to regain the sovereignty of Gibraltar if it really wishes to. All they have to do is to gain the confidence of the Gibraltarian people who live on the Rock. At some point there may be another referendum among the people on the Rock asking: "Under whose sovereignty do you wish to live?" The key is to win their votes. The way to do it is to make the Gibraltarian people feel entirely comfortable with the idea of being part of Spain. So do not create difficulties at the frontiers and slow things down; do not create difficulties with air transportation; let there be free movement of people by road, sea and air and let us solve this problem in a calm, cooperative manner and not – as one has seen in some of the resolutions tabled by the smaller groups – in an emotive manner.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lambert (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, obviously the best way to avoid the threat of radioactive pollution is to do without nuclear installations entirely. However, given that the submarine exists and is facing repairs after having undergone an extensive refit which finished just over a year ago, it is obvious that a number of important issues have been raised for the Union, not least within the context of the development of a common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Setting aside the operational purpose of the <span class="italic">Tireless</span> being in the Mediterranean when the leak in the pipe work of the reactor cooling system was discovered, let us look at some of the issues. What duty of care and information is owed to a neighbouring Member State when such an incident occurs? Do we have the effective protocols in place? Should there not be a principle of access to information and the supply of information for populations potentially at risk, whether in one Member State or across borders? It is no longer sufficient for an educated public to simply be reassured that all is well. They want to know on what the information is based and the nuclear and military industries have a history of paternalistic reassurance which means it is not surprising if they are not believed. Information on this has eventually been forthcoming and independent assessment permitted, but that has been forced as a result of public intervention and the actions of the Governor of Gibraltar rather than of a feeling of responsibility due.</p>
<p class="contents">How are our governments to cope with their wider responsibilities in this new European architecture and the development of a common foreign and security policy? Do we actually have the necessary instruments, if we are being told that Euratom is not enough? Are military matters going to take precedence over our responsibility to our common environment and the threats to the health of our citizens? I would be very interested in the Commission's perspective on that particular point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, we are lacking information because the British Government appears to be covering up the major part of the matter. Maybe the incident is serious, maybe it is not. The British Government is acting just as the Russian Government did recently when one of its submarines was damaged. Perhaps both governments were right to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">But I must still point out that, however worrying, this affair also has its amusing side and, if nothing else, illustrates the current state of Europe, the Europe of Nice. Obviously, it is a cause of concern to the bordering countries of Spain and Morocco, and also to the people of Gibraltar, who are rightly worried about the implications of this affair, especially as information seems to leaking out more slowly than water from a frozen pipe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is significant first and foremost, and this is the point I should like to stress, because it illustrates the current state of our so-called united Europe and, from this point of view, sovereignists may even find it amusing. We keep on being told that there is a European people. Well, here is an example of one Member State treating public opinion in another Member State just as it would in any other country in the world, just as if, at the end of the day, there were no <span class="italic">affectio societatis</span> fifty years after the start of the European project, just as if European solidarity had made no progress whatsoever. And we also hear voices being raised, all highly official and all very pro-European voices, taking advantage of the situation to call for nothing less than disarmament of nuclear submarines, just as if Europe should give nuclear monopoly to other powers. And all this against the rather mediaeval backdrop of territorial dispute between two Member States, a dispute which is far from being settled.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are in fact seeing here, in both the minor and major incidents, is the extent to which the Europe of Nice, designed to be a driving force, has in fact broken down, irretrievably broken down, for the reasons clearly described by Mr Bourlanges the day after the Nice Summit. These reasons stem quite simply from the fact that it is running on empty and it has no men of vision capable of seeing the world and history as one. In fact, it was inevitable in such a serious period of ebb or breakdown in Europe, that obstacles of the scale of the Rock of Gibraltar and all sorts of problems such as terrorism would rear their heads. Because we have destroyed any sense of national identity and have failed to replace it with the strong sense of identity which European citizenship should have represented, regional idiosyncrasies are bound to take root.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bourlanges’ finding is correct. For him it is cause for complaint, to us it is cause for satisfaction: that is the only difference between us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree that more resolute action is required against terrorism. It is worth bearing in mind that those responsible for the 28 murders in Omagh have still not been brought to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the problem of <span class="italic">HMS Tireless</span>, it seems to me that this is indicative of a more widespread difficulty in the equipment of the British armed forces as a direct result of policies pursued by the Labour government. On the one hand we have a government with no connections to the armed forces and with a card-carrying member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament as Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, using the armed forces as a political tool to further its ambitions in Europe and apparently realising rather too late that the European Union defence scheme would indeed damage the NATO alliance and transatlantic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other, the Labour government is not prepared to ensure that the armed forces are provided with the resources to carry out the increasing burden of commitments being placed upon them. It is scandalous that, at this moment, 11 out of the 12 hunter-killer submarines in service in the Royal Navy are non-operational, with four in refit and 7 showing signs of the defect which afflicts <span class="italic">HMS Tireless</span>. The recall of the submarine fleet has robbed the Royal Navy of a quarter of its fighting vessels and left the Trident and carrier forces with much reduced protection.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact that at one stage the only submarine operating in British waters was a German U-boat. Last year, much of the Royal Navy was forced to stay in port because it had overspent its clearly inadequate fuel budget. Meanwhile, at a time when flexibility and rapid response are military watchwords, the Navy's frontline strength is being slashed. The submarine fleet is being cut by almost 20%, the frigate and destroyer fleet, already too small, is being cut from 35 to 32%.</p>
<p class="contents">I point all this out because the maintenance and repair problem of <span class="italic">Tireless</span> is a reflection of a wider malaise affecting the Royal Navy through cutbacks which have gone too far. And, as we have already heard, it has provided those that do not really have the wider, democratically expressed interest of the people of Gibraltar at heart with an opportunity to make mischief. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The situation we are talking about is extremely serious. A nuclear vessel, suffering a fault classified as serious, is going to be repaired in a small port which is not equipped for the purpose, when more than 300 thousand people live in the vicinity. And the decisions on repairs and safety are to be taken by a government which is foreign to those inhabitants.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no way that this situation can be treated as a bilateral affair between two Member States which belong to a political union. The Commission, in its clear response two months ago and in its reply today, has been responsible enough to recognise this, although it has not been recognised in the Group of the European People’s Party’s motion for a resolution, a fact which, together with other trivialisations of the affair, has prevented us from supporting it.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, with this same sense of responsibility, the Commission must exercise its powers and not hide them behind an approach of diplomatic prudence and submissiveness towards the Council. I am not being alarmist, I am not against nuclear energy, I would never defend, as I believe nobody in Spain would, the idea of a submarine being moved at any cost if that meant an increased risk, but it is not in the spirit of European democracies, nor of the European Union Treaty, for decisions to be taken which jeopardise human safety and cause a population to be put at risk for the sake of greater technical, budgetary and diplomatic comfort.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now, despite the information provided by Mr Patten, the citizens have not been aware of the risks in scientific terms, the date of repair or what the repairs are going to consist of. They are not aware of any plans in the case of a radiological emergency and they do not know whether moving the submarine presents more risks than repairing it there. Can the Commission allow a situation such as this? I am not turning this into a matter of national honour, nor is this the moment to condemn the territorial anachronism represented by Gibraltar. This specific issue is more serious than all that, since it affects hundreds of thousands of human beings on Community territory, not only Spaniards, but people of all nationalities and British people in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that these citizens have found the protection which is their right in their most modest territorial representation, that is to say, their local authorities. In fact, the municipal and social representatives of those citizens are with us today. Whether or not they have found that protection in their national government is a matter for the Spanish Parliament. A debate is taking place there, but the citizens, on the basis of their knowledge or intuition, are turning their attention to the European institutions. It is the responsibility of those institutions that the citizens, in relation to the European Union, should stop thinking simply in terms of when their agricultural subsidies will arrive or when their Community funding will arrive and start thinking about what degree of safety the Community institutions can offer them.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask you to adopt the proposals contained in the joint motion for a resolution which will be voted on first, or at least those proposed by the Socialist Group. In any event, I trust that the Commission will not only fulfil its obligations but that it will persuade the two Member States involved to fulfil theirs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As one of the six MEPs nominated to represent Gibraltar until direct elections are held in four years time, it has been partly my responsibility to liaise with the Gibraltar authorities and the London Ministry of Defence to establish the truth of the situation regarding the repairs to the nuclear submarine <span class="italic">HMS Tireless</span>. The facts are that a single crack in the cooling system was discovered with a leak of water, described in the Spanish press rather inappropriately as radioactive. Although this is technically correct, the level of radiation is so low that it is actually fit to drink.</p>
<p class="contents">The reactor has been fully shut down as preparations are made to cut out a circular section of the main pipe and to return this to the UK for thorough examination before coming to a final decision as to how best to weld or remove it in the defective pintle area of the ship. There is absolutely no immediate danger or emergency of any kind, or any threat posed to the surrounding population of Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">The interests of the people of Gibraltar and southern Spain are identical in this regard. Chief Minister Peter Caruana has wisely asked a panel of experts to report directly to him. The panel has recommended allowing the next stage to proceed, while stipulating that the Ministry of Defence must fully understand the cause of the defect before commencing the essential repairs. Repairing a submarine <span class="italic">in situ</span> remains by far the safest option available: towing it would not only be dangerous but would, in any event, require considerable repairs to be done beforehand.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish Government has until now shown considerable maturity in its response to this situation. I would point out with regard to references in the motions for resolutions to the role of the Commission that it is not the view of the UK Government that the Euratom Treaties are applicable in military situations of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the British authorities have endeavoured to be as open as possible with their Spanish counterparts. Lack of spending on new military hardware because of defence cuts by the British Labour government will no doubt in future result in more frequent episodes of defective military equipment being taken out of service for essential repairs. That said, I hope that this debate will not degenerate into an attempt to attack either Mr Aznar or the Royal Navy, whose resolve this century against threats of tyranny from the right and the left is an important reason why all of us in this Chamber are able to enjoy the freedoms that we share. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The truth is that I would have liked him to have felt so vehemently Andalusian when it came to signing this House’s condemnation of terrorism – and this must be said this afternoon more unequivocally and with less reticence – especially given that more than 70% of the members of the security forces murdered by ETA have been Andalusians.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, we must remember that there has been a lot of contradictory information since May when the nuclear submarine <span class="italic">Tireless</span>, belonging to the British navy, chose the port of Gibraltar – which flies the British flag – to have repairs carried out on the cooling system of its nuclear reactor, which, according to the British authorities initially, presented no special difficulty or any danger to the inhabitants of the area.</p>
<p class="contents">Further explanations have followed and concern about what was happening to the <span class="italic">Tireless </span>has been increasing. The Spanish Government, from the outset, has held a position based on two points: the need for transparent information, based on technical and scientific criteria, in order to assess the scope of the repairs and their potential risk; and also, the view that any decision, either on its repair in Gibraltar or on its removal to a naval base in the British Isles, be taken in accordance with rigorous technical principles. This has been and, in our view, remains, the most coherent position and the one which safeguards the interests and safety of all the parties involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, what has been neither coherent nor appropriate has been the deliberate creation of social alarm in the area, with the clear purpose of turning this problem into an attack on the Spanish Government. In this event, we must tell our Spanish Socialist Members – with the greatest of respect – that they have allowed party interests to be placed above State interests. This is demonstrated by the curious agreement which they reached with British Labour Members to take responsibility away from the people who own the submarine, the people who are responsible for its mooring and remaining in Gibraltar and who are responsible for its repair, and who are also in charge of the port in which it is anchored.</p>
<p class="contents">The important thing at the moment is to ensure that we are provided with good, transparent information, with a sufficient scientific basis, on the scope and consequences of the repairs, and that there be a serious study of the possibilities and risks involved in a possible removal of the submarine, if that becomes necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do not need are demagogic attitudes, which can only be explained by pure party-political opportunism and which create, amongst other things, alarm and concern within a population which has every right to safety and information, but which need not endure, as well as all this, being manipulated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – I will be brief but I would like to clarify once again some of the extremely important points that were raised in the debate. I was well aware, from reading the newspapers and listening to the radio and television, of the passions engendered by this important issue. Those feelings have understandably been reflected during this debate, but honourable Members know that in responding on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, I have to restrict myself to setting out as clearly as I can what is and what is not Community competence: what we can do and what we cannot do. I just want to rehearse the arguments again so that we are all absolutely clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Commission competence under the terms of Chapter III, Health and Safety, of the Euratom Treaty covers the following issues which are relevant to this case. First, informing the general public about health protection measures to be applied and the steps to be taken in the event of a radiological emergency. Second, the availability of an intervention plan to deal with various types of radiological emergency. Third, the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste. All these issues are being assessed further in detail by Commission officials. This competence enables the Commission to ensure that Member States first inform the public of potential risks and the steps that should be taken should a radiological emergency occur; and second, adequately control and supervise shipments of radioactive waste. Community competence, however much some people may wish it otherwise, does not extend to the classification of ports to carry out repair work on submarines, questions of technical safety of nuclear reactors and requirements on a submarine to be removed for repair elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member, Mrs Lambert, raised the question of cooperation between Member States and it is an important question. I want to make it clear that under Article 51, subsection 5 of the Euratom Basic Standards 96/29, cooperation is obligatory, and I quote: "each Member State shall, in the event of a radiological emergency occurring at an installation on its territory or being likely to have radiological consequences on its territory, establish relations to obtain cooperation with any other Member State or non-Member State which may be involved." An additional point which has been raised, it came up both before I spoke previously and since – an additional point in this context is the applicability of Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty concerning the submission of general data relating to plans for the disposal of radioactive waste. The relevance of the Community competence in this case is frankly not clear. The general question of submissions of plans for nuclear-powered submarines is being studied by Commission officials. Community competence does not require general data to be submitted for the specific repair operation being undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just say one other thing. I assume that if any Member State had any doubts at all about the way the Commission has handled its competence in this matter, it would have let us know.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking, finally, not as a Commissioner but as a politician who was once also an environment minister, it seems to me that the important thing in cases like this is to make as much information public as possible. I would urge the British authorities to do exactly that. For its part, the Commission undertakes to keep honourable Members who have raised these important questions with us fully informed of developments in the coming weeks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
