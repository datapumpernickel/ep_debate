<p class="contents">When it comes to budgets at times of crisis, the key word is definitely austerity, and I do not think we can ignore that at the moment. However, I think that the EU will never be able to respond properly to the current economic and social crisis or prevent future crises without further political integration, common instruments and measures to strengthen solidarity between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of problems related to the crisis which are troubling the European economies: the reduced competitiveness of our businesses, problems in accessing credit, and the extremely high levels of unemployment, especially among young people. Indeed, I would like to reflect just briefly on young people. The youth of today are more educated, technologically advanced and mobile, and we must support them because they are – and will be – the most important resource for growth in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, the statistics to hand are alarming: one young person in five under the age of 25 is looking for work and cannot find it. Moreover, we have 7.5 million young people under the age of 24 who are not in work or education. Accordingly, I think it is essential to use the resources at our disposal to help young people to develop skills that meet the needs of the job market, guaranteeing opportunities for work experience and training in order to ease their path into the world of work.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly believe that in order to respond properly to these problems, we need to implement a ready-made and coordinated European initiative, including targeted investments to ensure that we meet the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy for growth and jobs, particularly in terms of youth employment.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises takes on fundamental significance, as they have the biggest potential for economic growth and innovation, and have provided 85% of new jobs over the last decade. Young people, growth and competitiveness: these are the targets that Parliament has put at the centre of its budget for 2013, both to quell the crisis and to get the European economy moving again, once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">The guidelines that we will vote on tomorrow do not go into the specifics of the individual headings and policies. Part of the reason for this is that it would be too early: we are waiting for the Commission to present the draft budget before starting to work on the numbers, when we will be depending on the valuable contribution of each specialised committee for their guidance.</p>
<p class="contents">We do, however, want to send a message to all Member States, which concerns the major added value that the EU brings. National budgets alone are not enough and no Member State can think about getting through this period by itself. Accordingly, we need to find real synergies between national and European budgets during the European Semester.</p>
<p class="contents">I must add one final thought on the issue of payments: 2013 is the seventh and final year of the financial perspectives: we all remember what happened during last year’s conciliation procedure and, hence, we have got to expect an increase in payment needs. Therefore, Parliament hereby declares that it will not look favourably on any artificial cuts in budget payments, because this puts us in danger of coming to an unsustainable level of payments in 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">A pure ‘net EU budget contributor/net EU budget beneficiary’ approach does not take due account of the great positive spill-over effects the EU budget produces between Member States to the benefit of common EU policy goals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Janusz Lewandowski, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, I welcome in the name of the Commission the position of Parliament on the guidelines for 2013 and, what is more, I agree with the major points as presented by the rapporteur, Giovanni La Via.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, properly shaping the last budget of the multiannual perspective 2007-2013 is quite a challenge, as is shaping it in the context of overall consolidation of national finances.</p>
<p class="contents">Nowadays, austerity and consolidation are not the only dimensions of the economic debate in Europe. What is next and what is equally important is how to boost investment, how to boost employment opportunities, especially for the younger generation, and how to support small and medium-sized companies in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Here is the place and here is the added value of the European budget and here is the perspective we should also seek for the European budget in the discussions over 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to properly shape the budget for 2013, we should take into account the logic of the multiannual perspective. It is a very well known logic.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything is moving late, but moving at cruising speed at the end of the financial perspective, and we should remember, as mentioned by the rapporteur, the lesson of 2011. Another important lesson is the full implementation of commitments and payments, but also more than 100% consumption and implementation in many areas, for example, competitiveness and innovation – 135% implementation; lifelong learning – 107%; Social Fund – 111% of what was assumed for 2011. There is also the lesson of reimbursements. Bills for reimbursement came late in December. The inability of the Commission to pay what it should pay for legitimate projects in several countries is also affected by the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not able, due to the shortage of money, to repay Rome over EUR 2 billion, to repay Madrid more than EUR 2 billion and to repay more than EUR 1 billion to Athens. This is an important lesson for drawing up our draft budget for 2013 and, I think, for the conciliation procedure of 2013. There is also inflexibility over financial regulation; that is, the inability to transfer what is underspent to what should be spent at the end of the year. These are the reasons for the cash-flow problem today and it cannot be repeated next year with the accumulation of all sorts of problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in 2013, we should be equally sensitive to negative priorities, that is, what is under-implemented, but also how to boost the growth opportunities and investment opportunities for the younger generation via existing means at our disposal. Additionally, we have to find a place for ITER financing and we also have to accommodate Croatia joining as Member State Number 28 as from July 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, concerning the area of savings and to prove that we are really taking into account all sorts of things in the environment of today’s Europe, we must consider administration. That is why we should not grow in administration. In the Commission, we are starting the programme of annual cuts, not waiting for the next financial perspective but starting for 2013 – 1% cuts in the administration of the Commission every year.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that this time, we are drawing on the lessons of experience and I count very much upon the wisdom of the people elected by the people, here in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to thank and congratulate Commissioner Lewandowski and say that after two years of budgetary austerity, the situation of the European budget is becoming untenable. For the Member States which finance most of the budget, the level of payment appropriations is no longer sustainable. Some Member States are themselves ruined; they can no longer increase their contribution to the European budget. The others are busy paying the previous budgets; so they, too, are unable to increase their contribution, which is calculated on the basis of the payment appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, as regards EU programmes in these latter years of the current multiannual financial framework, the level of payment appropriations is so low that, in reality, the Union is practically in default. This is not a default that affects lenders but local authorities, companies, researchers, innovators, all those who are carrying forward investment projects, on which a return to growth depends.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, before any negotiation on the next budget, we have a duty to closely examine the precise state of the requirements and the consumption of the payment appropriations. The more difficult the political agreement, the greater the need for us to guarantee that we are all actually talking about the same figures. We must be realistic, but a budget based on the principle of reality must start out from the same figures. I hope that, from there, we shall be able to arrive at the optimal solution both for the Council and for Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say this because when debating political guidelines, it is more important to agree our strategy than go into details about how we are going to fund the policies, which is where I believe we are failing here.</p>
<p class="contents">I really hope the proposed budget for 2013 is in line with what you have expressed today because we will be on the right track in that case. Up to now, however, you have prioritised temporary and short-term debates over a structured and long-term approach. You have paid more attention to resolving the consequences of the crisis rather than the causes, and you have imposed austerity as the only way out of the crisis. As you mentioned, history shows us that austerity has never worked. For this reason, in this report, we call on you to use the budget to put measures in place that promote solidarity and stimulate sustainable economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the European budget is too small to get us out of this crisis, but it can and should play a decisive role when it comes to deciding our priorities when using this EUR 150 billion. On 30 January, the members of the European Council issued a statement in which they stressed the need for investment in growth and job creation, particularly for SMEs and young people. The Commission made a major announcement that we were going to invest EUR 82 billion, but we have not really heard much about this great announcement since. It has gone from being a headline to complete silence.</p>
<p class="contents">You have to work on the European Union budget to develop the policies for the Europe 2020 strategy, which we always forget about, with the goal of promoting competitiveness and innovation. You have to present a budget that supports SMEs, so that they do not have to reduce their investments due to the crisis. You have to adopt a sustainable industrial policy. You have to urgently tackle unemployment and the rising poverty levels within the European Union. All of this can only be realised through a serious and responsible budget, coordinated with national budgets, with the aim of fulfilling the Union’s priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if you continue to view the budget as a table of figures where cuts can be made, you will be going about things the wrong way. If you believe that cutbacks in innovation and research are the way to finance ITER, then you are again in the wrong. By continually focusing your approach on cutbacks or delays in payments, you are not only going about things the wrong way, but also infringing on the legislation that you yourselves have approved.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Lewandowski, we know that these are difficult times, but we also know that things can be done differently and in a better way, which you mentioned here today and I hope you keep your word. Therefore, we should work together to make our resources work and meet our objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not easy to present a budget when so many different interests are involved and Mr La Via has succeeded in highlighting the majority of Parliament’s priorities. In my opinion, there are three decisive aspects to the budget guidelines: the budget must be balanced, it must be sensible and it must be responsible. Mr Lamassoure has just referred to the fact that we have had two austerity budgets in a row. This is absolutely the right thing to do in this situation. During this period, the Member States have only been able to provide limited resources. At the same time, as the previous speaker rightly pointed out, we need to make investments. These are, of course, complementary measures. First of all, we need to create the necessary structures, which are based on a responsible approach to the use of taxpayers’ money, so that we can make investments. Otherwise, we will be throwing good money after bad and this cannot be in our interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I believe it is important that we remind ourselves of this in the guidelines from the parliamentary side. We played a significant role in ensuring that the Member States agreed on automatic sanctions after the summit on 1 and 2 March and this must now be put into practice. I would like to see the Commission and not the Council taking responsibility for this, because then we could be sure that it would be implemented. At the same time, however, we need to give the Member States support with regard to European added value. The issue of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has been mentioned. They form the backbone of the European economy. It is not the large organisations and the multinationals that create jobs. It is the medium-sized companies which ensure that Europe’s engine for growth and employment continues to function.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we need to make targeted and sensible use of money. More funding does not necessarily mean better policies. Finally, I would like to express my full support for what Mr Lamassoure said about the need to resolve the problem of the outstanding commitments or <span class="italic">reste à liquider</span>. Most importantly, as far as the budget is concerned – and it is a pity that the Member States are not represented – it would make sense for us to draw up a sensible budget right from the start, so that we do not find ourselves in a difficult situation because amending budgets are required. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They must put in place a debt brake, they must make progress with the necessary structural reforms and they must invest in new competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lewandowski has just rightly said that consolidation is the one important task, which, although it is not enjoyable, is absolutely necessary, but that is not enough. The question is how we are to make particularly clever investments over the next few years. It goes without saying that the European budget does not include any debts. It also only amounts to 1% of the gross domestic product of the Member States, but nevertheless, it is clear that the European budget has an essential role to play with regard to the way in which the European Union will invest in future developments over the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament and the Council have agreed on a modernisation strategy, which is the Europe 2020 strategy. This is primarily about investing in inclusive growth and in sustainability, which means renewable energies, new energy grids and research in this area that will genuinely improve our position on both the European internal market and the world market.</p>
<p class="contents">Only when we have new sustainable products will we be able to create new jobs. New studies indicate once again that if we invest in sustainable agricultural policy and in sustainability using the Structural Funds, we will create more new jobs than was possible with the old measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, we have just had the first anniversary of Fukushima. You have said that we must do everything possible to continue funding the ITER nuclear fusion reactor. I think this is the wrong decision, because this technology also generates nuclear waste. We would be well advised to invest our resources, which we really must concentrate in specific areas, in no-risk technologies and new sustainable technologies and products. This would allow Europe to make faster progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That means that it is going to be important to strike the right balance between austerity and sound, judicious investment.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect, our rapporteur has set out a number of principles which we are happy to support. I strongly agree with his assertion that we need a budget that focuses on jobs and growth. He is right to point out that this is best achieved through clear prioritisation and targeted, coordinated investment amongst the Member States. In particular, I strongly agree with him that the key test for EU expenditure must be the creation of European added value.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also impress on him, however, the need for value for money. I would urge greater thought to be given to the efficiency of this budgetary process. Specifically, inaccurate budgeting and the growth in the ‘Reste à Liquider’ both lead to large sums of unspent money, both of which suggest that we should be looking for ways to increase flexibility in the budgeting process.</p>
<p class="contents">But the one point that is missing in this report is a commentary on the size of the budget. At a time when most of Europe is experiencing austerity and most of Europe’s governments are cutting expenditure, it is most important that we, too, show a determination to reduce our expenditure wherever possible. Can I therefore recommend to our rapporteur that in his future report, he calls for a freeze in the size of the budget? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to emphasise that we welcome what Mr La Via’s report says on the subject of growth, which is that the focus must be on growth.</p>
<p class="contents">We need growth that creates jobs and that can help combat youth unemployment. We think that this is very important. I would like to highlight the fact that we welcome the points relating to research and investment in research. However, I think we need clearer statements on fighting poverty within Europe and also in the world as a whole, on a global level. Moreover, the report did not look at how we are to combat climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very critical of the opening section of the report, which concerns automatic sanctions. I think that threatening the Member States with automatic sanctions is a mistake, given that they are already in a difficult situation with regard to their budgets. We are opposed to this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I want to highlight one point which I think is very sensible and that is increased coordination of the budgets of the Member States and the EU using a process which has democratic legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one final remark on the subject of cutbacks. I want to emphasise that we do not believe that budget cuts are appropriate. We have already made it clear that Croatia will be joining the EU during the course of the year. We will have a whole series of new jobs to do in the EU and we have had new supervisory bodies in place now for more than a year. We need these bodies and we need funding and staff for them, so that they can work effectively and prevent future crises. This will ensure that the expenditure is a sensible investment which will help us to save money in future. In my opinion, these are the crucial points. Most importantly, we hope that we can work to ensure that there are no budget cuts. For us, that is essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead, they are asking for more money from EU citizens to finance another failure to come: the 2020 Agenda. This is treating EU citizens as fools. When will this Parliament realise that stimulating growth and jobs requires much less red tape and much less pointless legislation? Why can this Parliament not admit that growth-targeted spending would be best directed at Member State level?</p>
<p class="contents">Year after year, this Parliament is happy to put more taxpayers’ money in the hands of the Commission, an institution which – as the auditors tell us – is unable to ensure the proper use of EU funding. Of course, the Commission never runs a deficit, and it never will, because it can always go back to the Member States and tax them more to balance its books.</p>
<p class="contents">If this House refuses to show common sense and responsibility, it will be the architect of its own downfall.

I very much welcome the fact that the guidelines highlight the particular importance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the EU. Between 2002 and 2010, they created around 85% of all the new jobs in the EU. They are the backbone of future economic growth and, therefore, they need more support than they have been given in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">The report focuses on the serious problem of high levels of youth unemployment in Europe. In this area, we must take the necessary measures quickly and decisively. The results of the Europe 2020 strategy depend, to a large extent, on the young people of today. They are well trained, they are up to date with the latest technology and they are mobile, which is why they represent the most important capital for growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Budget resources must be diverted from all the Structural Funds, so that we can provide EUR 28 billion to support SMEs and to combat youth unemployment. This is the first step in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not know the reason for this absence. I hope that the Danish Presidency, using modern methods and technologies, will listen to us on the Internet or otherwise. I am sure that many of the arguments made here will be repeated in the negotiations that await us this year.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, Europe needs growth-enhancing investments. In times of crisis, we need to strengthen the competitiveness and innovativeness of the European economies, but we also need – and this is very important – to support small and medium-sized enterprises, because they create new jobs. I would also like to repeat something we often discuss in connection with other programmes and other EU policies, namely, the importance of supporting young Europeans in finding their first job. Young Europeans are increasingly well-educated but, at the same time, they face ever greater problems finding a niche in the labour market and finding employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the catalyst for investment in jobs and growth is the European Union’s budget. It is therefore very important that we adopt an appropriate budget for 2013, a budget that allows for the implementation of agreed and key EU policies and commitments. I would also like to emphasise that 2013 is the last year of the multiannual financial framework. We must therefore have an appropriate level of payments to meet our commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, above all, necessary to take a realistic view of the situation. The report’s claim that deepening integration and EU budget growth can avert the economic crisis and prevent other crises is wide of the mark. We must not take advantage of the current crisis to increase budget expenditure. We need, on the contrary, a stable budget at about the current level of expenditure, which will be adopted quickly and without the unnecessary arguments and interinstitutional clashes we have seen in the last two years. The 2013 budget must take account of current developments in the EU, including the accession of Croatia, and also the fact that for the first time since 2004, farmers in the new Member States will receive the same direct payments as their previously better funded West European colleagues. We must also take account of the fact that we are still in a situation of economic stagnation – and in some places even crisis – where national budgets are forced to make cuts and limit expenditure. We should do likewise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The existing rules on this should be toughened up and anyone who breaks them should pay back the funds.</p>

Here is a quote from the report: ‘Parliament takes the view that solidarity and austerity measures undertaken at national level should not lead to an equivalent decrease at EU level’.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, you heard that right! While citizens in the Member States are doing their utmost to save money, Brussels says: just carry on partying, because we will not be making any cuts. We, the Euro elite, will never give up a single cent. You know that it is our children, more than anyone else, who will be the victims of this terrible policy of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats and the PPE Group. The day will come, Mr President, when the Netherlands, as a Member State, will not only reject the previous year’s budget, but also that for the new, coming year. The Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) is going to do exactly that right now.</p>

Beyond the measures for a return to balanced budgets, a number of necessary structural reforms, such as Basel II, Solvency and so on, have further weakened the natural economic dynamic. Without investment, without growth, the recession cancels out the debt reduction policies, increases deficits, makes competitiveness and purchasing power collapse and, all told, we get the opposite of the desired result.</p>
<p class="contents">Investment in three priority areas is necessary to re-launch our economies: innovation, education and infrastructure. It is precisely at European level that these areas are most effective. Applying a pure logic of austerity at European level is to believe that each State individually will recover better due to restraint. The structure of the European budget, its use and its objectives are different from those of national budgets. Even though it is modest, this budget is still the best integrated anti-crisis tool and, as such, it must be energised, not restricted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With EU countries sliding back into recession, it is vital that EU funds are efficiently targeted at jobs, growth and investment to try and turn the EU economies around. Austerity alone cannot rescue us from the current crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2013 budget year will prove to be a very difficult one with, on the one hand, a real need for budgetary constraint and austerity but, on the other hand, significant demands for payments from Member States as we come to the end of this financial perspective. As the Commissioner pointed out, with at least EUR 5 billion of payments which were carried over from the last financial year, it is absolutely vital that the Commission get a clear idea of the likely drawdown for 2013 from Member States. There can be no surprises or else it is going to be very difficult to try and shape a sensible budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see us aim for a freeze in real terms of the 2013 budget but this must be tempered by the fact that we are nearing the end of the financial perspective and the budget must reflect that fact. I hope we can work constructively with the Commission to square that difficult circle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has caused a major fall in public investment in key sectors for reviving employment and economic growth. The guidelines set out for the 2013 budget focus on creating jobs for young people, in particular, by supporting the small and medium-sized enterprises that make up 90% of the EU’s production base.</p>
<p class="contents">A suitable level of funding for the EU’s 2013 budget is crucial, since it is the final year of the current financial programming and this funding will form a model for what is to follow. It ought, also, to set out a pathway to growth, jobs and competitiveness in view of the Europe 2020 strategy. To conclude, I think it is essential that the Council does not compromise the potential of the 2013 budget by deducting from it any unauthorised payments generated in 2013. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, a one-off subsidy in the form of EUR 28 billion for small and medium-sized businesses is, in my opinion, not enough to compensate for the mistakes of recent decades.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Basel directives need to be revised and we must give small and medium-sized businesses permanent access to EU subsidies. Secondly, we finally need to reduce the amount of red tape. Most importantly, the ink on the agreement about the new strict budget regulations is not even dry and we have already come to the acid test.</p>
<p class="contents">When an economic heavyweight like Spain, for example, is not expected to make further savings, despite the gaping holes in its budget, but, on the other hand, Hungary is having its funding cut, because of its alleged failure to meet budgetary objectives, then it seems to me that double standards are being applied and this is dishonest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me to finish up by saying thank you to the Commissioner, obviously, and to all my fellow Members for their contributions to the discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would just like to emphasise a couple of points. The first, which came out in various speeches, is the payment requirement. We are at the end of the multiannual financial framework and there are bills to be paid, there are commitments made in previous years that have generated – and still generate – payments that have to be made. These payments must be honoured. On this point, I would obviously like to ask the Commission to be unabashed in the 25 April budget proposal, bearing in mind the bills to pay and the payments to be made, setting out fairly what has to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank everyone for their support for the strategy on small and medium-sized enterprises, which – I am absolutely sure – is a key driver for job creation and economic recovery, so I obviously hope that the budget will reflect this. I did not look into the priorities of the individual budget lines because I believe that is what procedure dictates. Evidently, we will have time to identify Parliament’s priorities, both positive and negative. However, I would like to appeal to the other institutions – the Council is not here right now, but we all hope it is following our work and our debate – for robust interinstitutional cooperation so that we can see this process through together and come up with an EU budget that is sizeable enough to face the challenges ahead, especially at a difficult time of economic crisis like the present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The guidelines for 2013 put forward by Mr La Via echo our previous calls for the Council to balance austerity with investment. We have repeatedly stated that economic recovery cannot be achieved by austerity alone. Promoting growth and job creation requires specific actions and enhanced budgetary efforts to support European competitiveness, innovation and SMEs. Entrepreneurship is another theme we should support, especially female entrepreneurs. International Women's Day reminded us of the great financial contribution women employers and business owners make to the economy. Supporting female entrepreneurs fits the EU 2020 strategy. Another important issue is payments. I strongly urge EU Member States to reduce the level of payments for 2013. The level of payments should take account of actual budgetary needs and existing agreements with other countries and institutions. If payment levels are reduced, the EU’s ability to respect standing agreements and obligations will also be reduced. The 2013 guidelines should be seen as a tool to boost growth and ensure Europe is prepared to address future financial difficulties. We need to guarantee a responsible budget that will strike the right balance between our needs, our responsibilities and our commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These priorities bear a strange resemblance to the priorities Parliament defined for the 2012 budget. Now, the difficulties of the latest budget negotiations are already putting in doubt the result of the discussions that are soon to take place on the drafting of the 2013 budget. Are the budget guidelines merely Parliament’s pious hopes? I fear so, as the negotiations have followed the same tragic route for two years: the draft budget from the Commission, supported by Parliament, undergoes cuts by the Council, which is more interested in reducing its contribution to the EU budget than in the budget’s added-value. This fool’s game has been played since Parliament failed to use its new powers of budgetary codecision to oppose the Council’s sterile wishes in 2010. 2012 will also be the year when the 2014-2020 financial framework is drafted. It will be difficult to prevent the Council’s short-term ‘in times of crisis’ vision from being applied to the definition of the ‘post-crisis’ financial perspectives. We must, however, support an ambitious position, for a Europe in line with the expectations of Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the most important issues concerns SMEs. Generating the vast majority of new jobs, this sector is the engine driving our economy. The Europe 2020 strategy sets economic growth, job creation and the generation and maintenance of competitiveness as some of the EU’s key objectives. I am of the belief that we must allocate considerable resources to small and medium-sized enterprises, and ensure a suitable environment to assist start-ups. The recovery and invigoration of the SMEs sector would generate increased labour market demand. In this context, emphasis must be given to another relevant subject, namely that of young people, who represent the future of the EU. Resources spent on education, research and development and innovation also represent indirect support to SMEs. We need only think of how many enterprising youths there could be, and how few young people actually take the risk of starting their own business. Instead, they put their creative and innovative ideas to use at various multinational companies, which is a barrier to the EU’s competitiveness. There are numerous alternative solutions to help invigorate the sector, such as investments in business incubators, whether they are start-up centres that help and monitor the establishment of businesses, or technology centres that are clusters of sites suitable for innovative, technologically oriented enterprises. For all this to be implemented, we need new budgetary resources, a possible source of which could be Eurobonds or the introduction of a financial transaction tax. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without joint programmes financed from EU funds and funds for their operation, this will not happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Many countries have shifted a large financial burden to future generations, and for many years, their public spending far exceeded their income. Financial markets will not be willing to refinance public debts if governments do not consolidate and resolve the discrepancy between public revenue and expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">They will monitor consolidation and the strengthened fiscal framework at European level closely. The EU budget is one of the most important instruments for expressing solidarity between Member States. If the EU’s policies were to be financed solely by Member States, their costs would skyrocket. The European budget is a clear common saving.</p>
<p class="contents">The austerity measures adopted at national level should not lead to an equivalent reduction of funds at EU level. Every euro paid out at this level may generate savings in the Member States. The annual budget of the European Union with its leverage effect, priorities set out in national budgets, and all other European policy instruments, must support the policies for the recovery of the Member States, and must be in accordance with the growth and jobs strategy, Europe 2020. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU budget is in a position to strengthen solidarity, kick start growth and support increased employment. The slogan for the decisions to be taken on the EU budget for next year should be ‘growth and employment’, rather than ‘austerity’. It should also be made clear to the Council that it cannot continue to ignore real needs and outstanding payments if we are to avoid a repeat of what happened last December, when the Council refused to finance claims of EUR 10 billion. As a result of that, the payments in question were postponed to 2012 and are expected to cause numerous problems towards the year end. Finally, I should like to point out that the accession of Croatia to the EU should be accompanied by suitable additional financing and to emphasise that I am totally opposed to any form of rearrangement of the top priorities of the European Parliament in terms of financing for ITER. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is this year that Member State cohesion programmes will be at full swing, and it is now that the largest sums will need to be disbursed. At the same time, the 2013 EU budget will also reflect the individual institutions’ ideas regarding the future as, in the absence of a consensus, this year will serve as the basis for the next period. The European Parliament sees the European budget as a means of recovery from the crisis and an engine of growth and job creation: a reflection of the intention to create a strong Europe guided by common policies and possessing sufficient funds. Some Member States are interested in a smaller EU budget and, focusing on short-term goals, would rather reduce their contributions. This carries an enormous risk, as it diminishes faith in European solidarity and in the EU, and leads citizens to turn away from the EU institutions. In the long term, this could jeopardise the very existence of the EU. In the medium term, the success of the Europe 2020 programme could also become questionable if we fail to provide sufficient financial resources for its implementation. We must not tarry, but show citizens that they live in a European Union which uses its funds in a sensible and appropriate manner to achieve common goals and strengthen the European idea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
