<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paciotti (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, in countries with a high level of technological development, the protection of privacy is always more at risk, and therefore appropriate safeguards must be established.</p>
<p class="contents">The countries of the European Union are at the vanguard in the protection of privacy compared to systems adopted in other parts of the world, especially those countries which have implemented the two directives, Directive 95/46 and Directive 97/66 – on the protection of individuals with regard to the protection of personal data.</p>
<p class="contents">The European model considers the protection of personal data to be a fundamental right guaranteed by legally binding rules, based on the principle of peoples’ self-determination of data,<span class="bold"> </span>that is the principle whereby everyone must be able to decide whether and how personal data concerning him can be collected and used. In this model, respect for standards and procedures is guaranteed by an independent authority and final jurisdiction lies with the judges. Since a great deal of personal data is also collected and processed by the institutions and the Union’s bodies, the system of guarantees contained in the European model must apply to them as well. Therefore, a rule laying down the right of everyone to the protection of personal data concerning him, which must be processed fairly for specific purposes on the basis of the consent of the person concerned and subject to control by an independent authority, has been included in Article 8 of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Moreover, Article 286 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities, introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, lays down that Community acts on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of data – that is the two above-mentioned directives – apply to the institutions and Community bodies and that an independent supervisory body responsible for monitoring the application of such Community acts must be established.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a regulation which is being examined by Parliament today implements these provisions, transposes the Community legislation and establishes the office of European Data Protection Supervisor, thereby providing appropriate, tangible guarantees of this fundamental right. Over months of work and with the constant assistance of the Commission, we have attempted – and we can inform you that we have been successful – to produce a detailed regulation responding to the concerns voiced by the Council and by the Parliamentary committees responsible for assessing the regulation and formulating opinions. The willingness of all the institutions concerned to discuss the matter resulted in exemplary cooperation which, it is my fervent hope, will make it possible for us to reach a consensus at the first reading. The many joint amendments reproduce the majority of the solutions identified by the Council, and these already take into account the proposals made during the Parliamentary debate. Acceptable solutions have therefore been reached, for example regarding the appointment of the European Supervisor and the Assistant Supervisor, which is to be agreed by Parliament and the Council from lists of names drawn up by the Commission following a call for candidates.</p>
<p class="contents">With the unanimous support of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, your rapporteur nevertheless insists upon certain amendments which, for example offer a novel solution to the much-debated subject of the scope of the regulation. It is restricted to the Community context but a form of protection is provided for in respect of the activities of the institutions outside the first pillar; this solution is obtained by referring to the rules for the protection of privacy relating to the right of access to documents, governed by Article 225 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities. In fact, Article 225, unlike Article 286, is also referred to in the Treaty on European Union. Provision is also made for cooperation with the national supervisory authorities and with the authorities established in the third pillar, with a view to coordinating and gradually harmonising the entire regulation of this sensitive area. Moreover, provision has been made for an autonomous budget heading, in accordance with the prevailing system for the European Ombudsman, in order to provide a greater guarantee of the independence of the Data Protection Supervisor.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident that our untiring work will win the full approval of the European Parliament and the Council. Thus, for the first time, codecision will apply at the first reading to an extremely complex text which is full of technical difficulties on the particularly sensitive sector of the protection of civil liberties. The very technical complexity of the text suggests that it would be a good idea to postpone the vote until the next part-session in order to allow an accurate check to be carried out on all the different language versions, for this has not yet been carried out. If this result is, as I hope, achieved, this will be due to the mediating capacities of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, the positive contribution of the Commission and the sensitivity to public interest and the rights of the citizens displayed by the Members of Parliament of all the political groups which contributed to the adoption of the report by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs. I would like to thank them all publicly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every day, a host of personal data, for example in connection with telephone conversations and payments on the Internet, is recorded and put into circulation. Personal data circulates within the EU in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a Regulation lays down sound bases for the protection of privacy. Freedom of movement requires effective crime prevention, which is less successful without effective protection of privacy. According to the proposal, the EU must not handle data concerning ethnic origin, political views, religion, health and sexuality at all. Data concerning criminal backgrounds and security measures may only be dealt with if special conditions are fulfilled. Such data may only be handled for legitimate reasons and if the individuals concerned are informed about the data.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been calling for a long time for independent European supervision of the protection of privacy, without new bureaucratic structures. I think that Mrs Paciotti has come up with a successful proposal for a European supervisor able to guarantee the rights of individuals in relation to the institutions, to carry out supervision and to provide the institutions with advice. At the same time, we must of course maintain and develop the cooperation that exists between the Member States’ own data authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to establish a system that works and to merit people’s confidence. The protection of privacy must therefore be developed. The protection of personal privacy is included in the new EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. In the future, we may perhaps be able to go to court for further protection in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of us who stand for European values in a Eurosceptic country are now being given further arguments in favour of the EU, namely more effective protection of privacy, which is important for the citizens of a modern society.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if this matter has been rather difficult to deal with, I nonetheless want to congratulate Mrs Paciotti on a very good report. I hope, however, that the model which we have used in this Chamber and which has somewhat hindered MEPs from participating on a broad basis will not act as a guide to the way in which we are to deal with these issues in the future. Mrs Paciotti has been very successful in uniting all the institutions. I therefore want to congratulate her, and I hope that the Chamber will support the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These rules are to apply, in particular, within the second and third pillars. We welcome the wealth of initiative and invention which has characterised this work. We should like to thank the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that the institutional solutions are very good. We are not talking about some form of collegiate body but about a supervisor and assistant supervisor.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to ensure that, important as data protection is, this must not mean limited access to documents within the EU’s institutions. The European ombudsman has unfortunately been compelled to point out that the Commission has used data secrecy as a reason for limiting access to information about who had taken part in a meeting intended to sway the Commission. This is an example of the misuse of data protection, which must not occur. I really do hope it is ensured that the regulations will not be applied in that way.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also be aware of the fact that the European ombudsman and the data protection supervisor will be on opposite sides of the fence. We must not be surprised if they sometimes end up in public discussion with each other. The fact that their tasks have not been combined is extremely positive.</p>
<p class="contents">To some extent, this is an automatic transfer from the old Directive 95/46/EC. In this connection, I want to take the opportunity to ask the Commissioner when revision of the general directive on data protection is to begin. There is, of course, an obvious need to revise this directive with a view to modernising it, so that it meets those needs mentioned by Mrs Cederschiöld. Data protection on the telecommunications network ought also to be reviewed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to point out that, as a Finnish citizen, I have realised that the European Parliament is the only institution – the only elected body – to supervise the Commission’s decisions when it comes to the level of data secrecy in third countries. We are aware of the famous case in which such supervision was applied. The European Parliament is the only body which can democratically supervise decisions by means of the committee procedure which exists.</p>
<p class="contents">I now see that my own country is to alter the law relating to personal data which deprives elected representatives of any influence at all over the Commission’s decisions. I therefore welcome the constructive dialogue we have established with the Commission, together with the appropriate committee procedure which will guarantee citizens’ security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The exponential growth of the European Union’s tasks and jurisdiction, and the proliferation of Community bodies, mean that we must have a precise legal definition of the citizens’ rights, and these should cover the transfer of information between European Union institutions and bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the codecision procedure, the Council submitted a proposal for a regulation to the European Parliament on the basis of Article 286 of the EC Treaty. This article specifies that data protection should be effective within the European Union by 1 January 1999. Nigh on two years later, we have not yet brought matter to a conclusion. This means we should not get embroiled in a lengthy codecision procedure which would delay the implementation of this instrument even longer. This is what Mrs Paciotti has done, and I really think our rapporteur has done a truly remarkable job.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us get to the heart of the matter. The main bone of contention between the European Parliament and the Council is to do with the jurisdiction of this future supervisory authority. Should it confine itself to the first pillar, i.e. the purely Community bodies, institutions and legal standards, or should it cover all Union-related provisions, i.e. the second and third pillars, such as Schengen or Europol? We think it obvious that the risks related to the private lives of citizens and the misuse of citizens’ personal data are far greater in the context of the third pillar, which at present is subject to little or no judicial and parliamentary control, than in the context of the first pillar, which falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is clear that we would be closing our eyes to the problem if we set up an authority of this type to cover just the Community area, while the main problems arise and will, in future, arise due to third pillar bodies too. Are you aware, for instance, that the Schengen system has amassed over ten million files on almost one and a half million citizens, and that Europol, whose sphere of competence is being incessantly expanded, has a central database of information from the various police forces of the fifteen Member States, all this supervised only by an authority with neither the powers nor the resources available to it to enable it to carry out another task properly.</p>
<p class="contents">The report which we are to adopt does not reflect this ambition. The scope of the regulation adopted on the basis of the report is limited to the first pillar, i.e. to Article 286. The second and third pillars will not be covered by this regulation and will therefore remain impenetrable, to the detriment of citizens’ basic fundamental rights. In addition to the restrictive reading of Article 286, however, it would have been possible to take Article 255 of the Treaty as a further legal basis in order to expand the scope of this regulation. Indeed Mrs Paciotti attempted to do so by including a reference to this article in Article 12 of the regulation, but the Council refused to entertain this possibility. There are many other problem areas which require some pragmatic evaluation if they are to be practicable.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, though, our rapporteur is well aware of these problems and is anxious not to add another two years to the existing backlog. We shall therefore offer her our support, in spite of everything, in the hope that the Council and, in particular, the Commission will be careful not to take advantage of the weaknesses of the text in order to attempt to make nonsense of it. They must, furthermore, seek to implement means for the protection of personal data in the second and third pillars too at the earliest possible opportunity. It is dangerous, in any case, to allow bodies such as Europol or the Schengen system to develop without parliamentary or judicial control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Effectively, the problem arises from the exclusions and exceptions in the protection of personal data with regard to the second and, in particular, third, pillars, but also from the exceptions already laid down by the directives as regards police activities and activities related to national security. Like Mrs Boudemiene-Thiery, I feel that these activities give the greatest cause for concern in terms of citizens’ privacy. In my opinion, the rapporteur has done everything feasible to extend the possibility, at least of cooperating and probably of exerting influence on this matter, and so we fully support her report.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I would like to take advantage of the fact that the Commissioner is here to say that it would appear appropriate to concern ourselves not only with protecting citizens in respect of new technologies but also with the use of these technologies to increase the European citizens’ means of intervening and interacting with the European institutions. I feel that other directives should be applied, in a similar way to the directives on privacy in the context of the Community institutions, such as the Directive on electronic signatures, in order to allow the citizen to interact telematically with the institutions as well, by means of petitions, appeals to the Ombudsman, competitions and appeals to the Court of Justice. This would increase the channels for protecting the citizens – an extremely important element – but also make it easier for them to act, to be active and to interact with the institutions. This point is not, of course, made in the Paciotti report, but I wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to raise the issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In today’s modern society, a huge volume of personal data is collected, recorded and processed every day. The European public’s concern about whether its privacy is being protected or not is therefore quite legitimate, as are its hopes that a balanced solution will be found to safeguard and guarantee their rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither of the two directives currently in force in the European Union to guarantee protection against the improper use of personal data applies to the Community institutions. It is therefore a matter of urgent necessity for us to put into practice what was agreed in Amsterdam and to approve a regulation that gives individuals rights protected by law. This regulation must also set out the obligations in the field of data processing incumbent on those responsible for such activities within the Community institutions and bodies. Finally, we must have a regulation that creates an independent supervisory body responsible for monitoring the processing of personal data undertaken by Community institutions and bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">We must move ahead with the creation of this supervisory body – the European Data Protection Authority – in the hope that in the medium term, it will be given new powers including those currently exercised by other supervisory authorities. We also hope that it will create a single secretariat that will ensure that all cases submitted for monitoring are treated in the same way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are approximately two years behind schedule in relation to the date set in Article 286 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities, hence the urgent need to reach agreement on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, with the crucial encouragement of the Presidency, succeeded in overcoming the problems raised by a number of delegations, to ensure that the proposal for a regulation will most probably enjoy the unanimous approval of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, in turn, demonstrated great determination in order to enable a decision to be made at first reading, and I should like to express my appreciation and my thanks to your rapporteur, Mrs Paciotti, who has spared no effort, with the support of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, to ease the path of this agreement. By taking the Council proposal as a starting point and encouraging that a solution acceptable to all three institutions regarding the scope of the regulation be adopted, Mrs Paciotti has to a great extent made the way clear for agreement at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has, in turn, also played a part in initiating and mediating between the Council and Parliament. The Commission also decided not to hold up the adoption of an instrument that is significant for the protection of citizens’ personal data. Even though it considers that the outcome is not completely satisfactory as far as it is concerned, the Commission in turn decided to adopt the text produced as a result of the discussions in the Council and Parliament as reflected in the Paciotti report, and will therefore reject any other amendments to its original proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, the Commission’s position on the amendments contained in the Paciotti report is as follows.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 1, 2, 4 to 10, 12 to 40, 42 to 54, 57, 58 and 60 to 64 reflect the Council text on the points to which the Commission can give its assent. These amendments are therefore acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment Nos 55, 56 and 59 differ from the Council text, but they were the result of a political agreement between the rapporteur and the Council Presidency. Since the Commission has decided not to obstruct the adoption of the regulation at first reading on the basis of this compromise text, it will accept these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 3 and 11 differ from the Council text, but they were the result of a political agreement between the rapporteur and the Council Presidency. The Commission has decided not to obstruct the adoption of the regulation at first reading on the basis of this compromise text, on condition that a statement be included in the Minutes recording its legal position at such time as the Council approves the regulation. If this statement is made, the Commission will accept the scope of the regulation being limited exclusively to first pillar activities. It will also highlight the need to subject personal data processing under the second and third pillars to clear legal regulations. In the view of the Commission, it will be possible to adopt such regulations on the basis of Article 286. It therefore reserves the right to propose legislative initiatives to this effect. The Commission further reserves the right to subject the processing of personal data carried out under the second and third pillars to the principles contained in the regulation until such time as the regulations applicable to said data processing be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that the wording of Amendment No 41 is not compatible with its right of initiative, and therefore rejects this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 69 is a correction to Amendment No 41, presented by the rapporteur, Mrs Paciotti, in consultation with the Commission and the Council Presidency, with a view to safeguarding the Commission’s right of initiative. The Commission supports this amendment, and I should like to thank Mrs Paciotti for tabling it. The European Data Protection Supervisor will in fact play a leading role in Community institutions’ respecting the provisions protecting citizens’ personal data. It goes without saying, then, that his opinion on the legislative proposals to do with the protection of personal data will be very valuable insofar as it will be a major contribution to the legislative debate between institutions. It goes without saying, moreover, that the Commission, in framing such legislative proposals, must be free to make the appropriate proposal at the time it thinks right.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 69 would seem to be acceptable to the Commission inasmuch as the wording does not entail a challenge to its right of initiative. The Commission, therefore, understands this amendment as obliging it to consult the European Data Protection Supervisor after adopting its proposal. The text would be improved if it were amended to make that clear, perhaps this can be done when it is proof-read. In any case, the Commission will make a statement to this effect when the regulation is adopted in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to honour the political agreement made with the Council and the rapporteur to enable the regulation to be adopted at first reading, the Commission rejects all other amendments which were not part of the Paciotti report adopted by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, except for Amendment No 69 which is a correction to Amendment No 41. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
