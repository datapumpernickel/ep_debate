There have been 17 000 children born in those camps over the last ten years. This resolution seeks to encourage initiatives and action and ask the Commission to help perhaps with financial mechanisms to support the re-settlement of these people.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that Japan has donated USD 1.3 million to the refugees, and that USD 1 million has been forthcoming from world food programmes. But the people in those camps would prefer to be re-settled back in their homelands and not have that money.</p>
<p class="contents">They sent us this memorandum asking our support for action to solve their problem and to have justice. In it they say "we pray at your end, honourable European Parliamentarians, that justice may prevail on us". That is what we are doing here today. Let us hope that our resolution will bring some justice to these people, will help them re-settle in their homelands and achieve some results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, earlier this year, I had the honour to be part of a delegation from the European Parliament to New Delhi and Nepal. Arising from our visit and in particular our visit to the refugee camps in eastern Nepal, the delegation gave a commitment that they would do everything possible to raise the issue of the continuing plight of the Bhutanese refugees in Nepal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to assure the Members of the House that the refugees are fully aware of, and greatly value and appreciate, the earlier efforts of the European Parliament in drawing attention to their situation. This was clearly demonstrated to us during our visit to the region, and our resolve to continue to encourage an agreement now between Bhutan and Nepal is as strong as ever.</p>
<p class="contents">The influx of Bhutanese refugees into Nepal began in late 1991 and the fear of diminishing international attention, therefore, is always present. The refugees have been waiting for the last ten years for an amicable and permanent solution to the crisis. As Ms McCarthy has said – very many of them want to go home. There have been numerous bilateral talks but so far a final political settlement has not been secured.</p>
<p class="contents">In New York, the United Nations Millennium Summit is taking place as we speak and it offers the Prime Ministers of Bhutan and Nepal an opportunity to come together and to demonstrate their commitment to the ideas of peace and tolerance by agreeing to an early solution to the problem of Bhutanese refugees in Nepal. This would be a fitting way to mark the UN's Millennium Summit. I hope they will be given every encouragement to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the crucial issues to be decided is the definition of the family unit for verification purposes. Nepal has accepted a compromise put forward by the UNHCR who has been playing an important role in seeking to help to resolve the impasse. I strongly urge the Bhutanese authorities to accept the compromise so that field verification can begin immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">While the European Union remains one of the major donors, both the UNHCR and the World Food Programme are finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds to run the refugee camps. I would urge international donors to continue to make sufficient funds available to permit the running of the camps during the negotiation and the verification process. At the same time, I would expect the donors to insist that the Bhutanese Government facilitate a rapid repatriation of the refugees. I very much welcome the news conveyed to the House by Ms McCarthy of the generosity of the Japanese people in this particular respect.</p>
<p class="contents">We were assured that bilateral negotiations would be speedily concluded and that actual verification in the camps would begin last July. That agreement regrettably is still outstanding. I therefore reiterate once more our appeal to all those concerned to take the necessary political initiatives to achieve a lasting solution to the unacceptable plight of the Bhutanese refugees, of whom over 17 000 have been born in the camps. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dupuis (TDI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I think first we must thank the chairman of our delegation for relations with South-East Asia, Mr Gerard Collins, who has just spoken and to whom we owe this resolution, for the efforts he has made over the past months to try to resolve an issue which is not really that marginal, since it concerns tens of thousands of people who are now destitute, and have often been so for years. </p>
<p class="contents">I also want to say that Mr Collins had the support of the entire delegation, Mrs McCarthy, Mr Thomas Mann and all the other members, and I hope the Commission will follow up Parliament’s unanimous position and that we will see rapid results. I think the ball is in Bhutan’s court, but it is now up to the Commission and the Council to put pressure on the Bhutanese Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Aside from this question, I want to draw attention to a matter that concerns us all and concerns our future. Yesterday we voted for the Galeote Quecedo report on a common Community diplomacy, which in the end was reduced to a report on a future college of common diplomacy. That is not much. It is not much when we know that there is no Commission delegation in Bhutan, when we know that there is no Commission delegation in Nepal, but when we also know that no Member State has an embassy in Bhutan. That certainly does not make for increased contact, nor does it make it easier to take diplomatic action to help solve this particular problem and other more general ones.</p>
<p class="contents">That, ladies and gentlemen, is the report you adopted. It does not mean the communitisation, even in part, of our common foreign and security policy. Is it really that inconceivable that in a country such as Bhutan, where we have no embassy, we could have a Commission delegation that also acted as an embassy for the 15 Member States? Is that really impossible? Is it beyond your powers of imagination? That is the question I wanted to ask you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The assistance from the European Union and the international organisations is quite respectable, but no one can guarantee long-term financial aid at that level. It is high time that substantial agreements were reached.</p>
<p class="contents">Bhutan and Nepal are not neighbours, but they are close to each other in spirit. Both are kingdoms, both have parliamentary systems with short histories, one is Buddhist and the other is Hindu. Both are aware that lasting conflict will paralyse their national and economic progress. Bhutan criticises Nepal on the grounds that its constant changes of government make it incapable of action. That has changed. Nepal accuses Bhutan of not being ready to adopt effective solutions. I hope that will change.</p>
<p class="contents">The undertakings given by the Bhutanese Foreign Minister when he visited us in Brussels on 8 June have been honoured, as crucial negotiations began mid-year. There is agreement on the four categories of people living in the refugee camps. However, there has to be a common definition of the term ‘family’ for the purposes of the compromise put forward by the UNHCR, which Mr Collins has referred to. Nepal has already agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also appealing to India to stop primly holding back. It is linked with both neighbours through agreements and economic ties. There are 6 million Nepalese working in India. The borders are open, and there are no asylum problems. I am very familiar with the charter stipulating that bilateral conflicts should not be resolved at SAARC level. Nevertheless, the largest democracy in the world does have the greatest influence in the region and bears some humanitarian responsibility here. Some movement is discernible. The Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats is putting its faith in far-sighted people of good will in Thimphu, in Kathmandu, and also in Delhi. We are hoping that the talks in New York between the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the Prime Ministers of Bhutan and Nepal will lead to a decisive breakthrough. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The text on Burma, unfortunately the umpteenth one, is very good. The situation in Burma is crystal clear; there is a perfect dictatorship on the one side and an exemplary opposition on the other. There has, in fact, been no sign of progress in this country for ten years. That is the situation. So I think we should ask ourselves a few questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Our policy towards Asia is a criminal policy; it is quite literally criminal. We treat regimes such as India, which continue to consolidate and strengthen democracy, however difficult that may be, on the same footing as other countries like China, Burma and North Korea, which, you could say, do all they can to strengthen dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">So, I think we should consider drawing up lists, defining categories and establishing different types of relations depending on the type of country. Unfortunately that is not the case. The European Parliament has been calling for this for a long time and we must continue to urge it. We cannot continue to dialogue with organisations such as ASEAN and pretend that we regard them as a homogenous whole. ASEAN is simply a grouping of totally different countries, with widely diverging interests and no prospect of integration. We must encourage forms of integration based on democracy – which is absolutely not the case with this kind of country – and therefore promote and encourage our bilateral relations with the countries that respect democracy and want to strengthen democracy and the rule of law, and pursue an extremely tough policy towards countries like Burma.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish by saying that Burma is a country now occupied by the People’s Republic of China. We are informed by many sources that there are dozens of Chinese military bases in Burma. The People’s Republic of China is currently encircling India: that is a real fact, an actual fact. You are aware of the situation in Pakistan. The People’s Republic of China’s strategic aid to the rearmament and strengthening of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons is a form of encirclement and if, in the course of the twentieth century, the major world problem was the German problem, the Franco-German problem, today and tomorrow too it will be an Indo-Chinese problem; and if we do not, as of now, support the countries that are moving towards democracy, towards strengthening democracy, such as India, but instead continue to roll out the red carpet for the Beijing authorities, we will simply be encouraging a grouping that will eventually become explosive. The explosion will hit not just Asia, but in the end will also affect Europe and the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that over the past two years, we have submitted as many as five or six resolutions on the situation in Burma. It is almost intolerable that a President, elected more than ten years ago with 80% of the votes behind her, who offers peaceful protest against her country’s military regime, should receive insufficient support to truly adopt the role which she deserves in her country, in order to fight a military regime which rides roughshod over human rights and the rights of minorities. This is despite the fact that she receives verbal support – by Mr Clinton only a few days ago –and the fact that she has received both the Nobel Prize and Sakharov Prize for her peaceful protest.</p>
<p class="contents">The national economy stays afloat thanks to drugs. Burma, the world’s second-largest drug-producing country, after Colombia, has dismantled its own parliament, has had numerous parliamentarians killed and imprisoned in the process, and forces its minorities into slave labour, especially in the construction of infrastructure. However, it still benefits from investments, including investments from European countries, such as those of the French oil company Total and the Dutch hydraulics industry, and there has been no attempt to block this kind of investment, either on the part of the EU or on the part of national Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not actually in favour of economic sanctions, but in some cases – I am thinking of South Africa and Chile in the eighties – it is necessary to stop cruelty in its tracks. In my opinion, the European Union and the United States should agree on a strategy against Burma. I believe that Burma should be isolated politically and economically and that real, effective pressure must be exercised; if not, we sanction violent opposition. People elsewhere have commented: look at Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi. She has now been in peaceful protest for twelve years and still she is being sidelined and placed under house arrest, and her people are being arrested. And what happens? The international community looks on and does nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the European Union to enter into talks with the United States in order come up with concrete ways of helping her, and in order to ensure that she and Burma’s parliament can re-establish democracy in Burma. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is ten years since the NLD won a huge majority of seats in free and fair elections, but despite that, democracy has been suppressed from every angle and at every opportunity. I believe that the recent readmittance of Burma to the Asean and EU-Asean meetings was a major mistake from the start. Burma has done nothing since being readmitted to Asean to show that it deserves it. There should be a serious rethink of this policy. Burma should be excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the European Union could do a lot more. Aung San Suu Kyi has asked for sanctions but we have done absolutely nothing about this. Even the United States has at least halted new investment. Why is the European Union not ensuring that sanctions are imposed? We have to do everything we can to try and stop the forced labour and the human rights abuses. As the resolution says, we should discourage any kind of tourism to Burma.

<p class="contents">In September 1999, James Mawdsley, from the north-east of England was sentenced to 17 years' solitary confinement in a Burmese prison. His mother is currently travelling to Burma hoping to see him.</p>
<p class="contents">His crime, according to the Burmese authorities, was to enter the country and attempt to draw attention to the human rights abuses taking place there. The charges against him were trumped up. For example, he was alleged to have entered the country illegally and yet British embassy staff have seen his passport, which is stamped with a Burmese immigration stamp showing that he had arrived completely legally. British Government ministers and staff have been making constant efforts to draw the attention of the Burmese authorities to his plight, but with no success.</p>

We will continue to concern ourselves with that situation. However, the current situation and the scandalous decisions being taken by the Burmese military Government and their appalling behaviour simply make it essential for the European Parliament to take a stand on this. We are full of respect and admiration for the non-violent action, the remarkably consistent action being taken by the Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and also by the members and politicians of the National League for Democracy. They have earned our unreserved respect, and we wish to assure them that they have our support and that the European Union, together with the international community, will do everything it can to help to restore human rights, or to be more accurate, to introduce human rights, democracy and also the rule of law in Burma.</p>
<p class="contents">We are certainly still pinning our hopes in San Suu Kyi. Her continuing campaigns show that her voice cannot be silenced and that we in Europe, therefore, also have a duty to do everything to ensure that her voice is heard not only here in Europe, but also in America and above all in Asia. She bears the hopes of the persecuted and the repressed, and also of the many men and women used as forced labour. She also bears the hopes of those citizens who opted for democracy, the parliamentary system and the rule of law before 1990. We must call on our partners, the ASEAN States, but also other states in Asia to do everything to bring about a change in this ‘transitional government’ as it so cynically still calls itself.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I think it is right that we should take stronger economic sanctions. The EU has acted correctly here. We now need an institutionalised dialogue, and a debate on Burma should be right at the top of the agenda of the Laos Summit, to make it clear that both ASEAN and the EU bear some responsibility for events in Burma. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation in Colombia is that of a latent civil war in which, over several decades, the violence has taken on a structural nature. This latent civil war was complicated a great deal as a result of the development of drug trafficking, with Colombia becoming a country where drugs are produced and transported to the rest of the world. In that situation, there are various groups who use violence. I am referring not only to the paramilitary organisations and the guerrillas, but also to the drug trafficking organisations. At times, even military units use violence and violate human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In a situation of this kind, the attempt to establish peace zones, for example through the peace communities established in the rural region of Urabá, has faced great difficulties. In fact, recently there have been murders in these communities in Urabá, specifically in the region of La Unión. Their leaders have had death threats, and death threats in Colombia are something to be taken very seriously, because they tend to be carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">There is really not very much this Parliament can do.

Fortunately, the Colombian Government has decided to pursue those responsible and punish them accordingly. But the fact is that, since 1997, there have been three murders, the most recent on 8 July of this year, and the Peace Community of La Unión and the Intercongregational Committee for Justice and Peace, including the Irish Franciscan priest Brendan Forde, have had repeated death threats, despite their position of remaining neutral and contributing to bringing peace to the area.</p>

My group, the Green/EFA Group, signed the amendment, but we were appalled that the amendment and the resolution does not go far enough. They do not cover a number of serious issues like Plan Colombia and the grave human rights abuses that are taking place in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been stated by many human rights organisations that human rights abuses by paramilitaries have the support of the armed forces and that the murder of the poor people in rural areas is as a result of this. Most of the Colombian military forces continue to be implicated in serious human rights abuses and their aiding and abetting of paramilitary atrocities are basically ignored by the Colombian authorities. The US State Department has consistently reported that Colombia's armed forces have taken measures to punish human rights abuses in their ranks.</p>
<p class="contents">Plan Colombia will result in USD 1.3 billion from the US being allocated for mainly military purposes. Many human rights organisations believe that the plan will worsen conditions for poor rural populations and will certainly increase political violence. It is going to irreversibly damage the people and the environment and it will not solve the drugs problem. There was no consultation on Plan Colombia with the Colombian people, which is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I was in Colombia last year with NGOs and I can tell you that the situation there is really grave. The Colombian soldiers continue to actively encourage the paramilitaries responsible for human rights violations and it is clear that the United States and Colombia have acted against the interests of the people. I believe that this should have been part of the resolution. The only group that wanted to address Plan Colombia and the whole human rights situation in Colombia was our own group. That is really unfortunate and a gross abdication of our duty to people all over the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the high level of responsibility of the Government itself, which covers up violations of human rights, torture, kidnapping and murders committed by paramilitary groups in collusion with the army.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, that such serious problems as cocaine growing and violence can only be solved through peace talks with the FAR and the ELN.</p>
<p class="contents">And thirdly, that he was preparing Plan Colombia for military intervention in the area with the United States, going behind the backs of European and world opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, and given the danger represented by Plan Colombia of Latin America becoming another Vietnam, we need to act with three specific proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, that any aid to Colombia from the European Union will be granted once a peace agreement has been signed between the Government, the FAR and the ELN.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, that the European Union must condemn Plan Colombia and demand that the solution to the conflict be a negotiated and peaceful one, in order to avoid this escalation of military action.</p>
<p class="contents">And thirdly, the European Union must demand that President Pastrana puts an end to all violations of human rights by paramilitary groups in his country, and that the sad world records of thousands of victims that are reached each year should come to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, allow me to also add – as has already been said, but I think that it is worth saying it specifically – that the European Union should establish a human rights observatory in Latin America, associated with the United Nations observatory that already exists. Because there are so many countries, but above all Colombia, that fail to guarantee respect for democracy and human rights, it is our responsibility to give adequate help to the region, which has such importance for us and for the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will mention but a few, listed in the last e-mail I received from Amnesty International: 50 civilians were killed last month by paramilitaries; 400 civilian massacres took place during 1999; 3 500 victims of police crimes; 1 000 abductions; 250 000 Colombian civilians have been thrown out of their homes for political reasons. In addition, there has been another massacre in the rural community La Unión, the third in three years. We have a moral obligation to declare that this massacre was perfectly planned, that, nowadays, everything that happens in Columbia happens for a reason.</p>
<p class="contents">So what can we do? Wait for the next massacre in La Unión or another village to produce yet another resolution expressing our grief or, as some of the Members have suggested – and rightly so – make our voice heard, loud and clear? In my opinion, Parliament must now find the courage to make its voice heard, for, to make reference to Amnesty International once again, all the parties taking part in the conflict are responsible for the violations of human rights in Columbia, but one of them – the paramilitaries – has a greater responsibility. Indeed, the paramilitary groups are crushing the civilian population in a lethal vice.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been pointed out, President Pastrana appeared before this House and offered to make a substantial effort<span class="bold"> </span>to bring all the parties to dialogue. It is Parliament's responsibility to call for a system of rules and rights to be re-established, within the Colombian State, most importantly, as well as condemning the current situation in Columbia.</p>
<p class="contents">The paramilitaries act in agreement and in cahoots with the army, which in many cases – including this one – draw up the death lists. To date, there has been no serious attempt to bring the heads of this alleged paramilitary army to justice – for example Carlos Castaños, who continues to broadcast his interviews on Colombian radio with impunity.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore reiterate our support for a peaceful solution and, without hypocrisy, we call upon the Colombian Government to reflect upon the tragic actions of the paramilitaries. Lastly, we call upon the Commission and the Member States to employ all the appropriate political resources to preserve the security of the civilian organisations involved in upholding human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union, Mr President, should, in my opinion, do something more than expressing its concern, demanding the safety of its citizens and reiterating its support for the peace negotiation efforts initiated by President Pastrana with the paramilitary groups. It is now time to move from words to actions so that we do not just carry on making purely rhetorical statements.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that President Pastrana was the first foreign Head of State who wished to appear before the plenary session of Parliament in this legislature. He now needs a specific response from the European Union that shows solidarity on the three fronts that he has opened up: the process of negotiation of the armed conflict, combating drugs, which we should approach from a point of view of shared responsibility, and strengthening institutions, with a particular appeal for the defence of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to recall the words of President Pastrana in this Parliament: “I believe that a decent and democratic future is not possible without a culture of respect for fundamental rights. I know that in the course of the protracted internal conflict in Colombia these rights have suffered serious violations, and this must not continue. I am totally committed to the defence of human rights.”</p>
<p class="contents">The reality that is currently devastating the country is quite different, Mr President. Therefore, I think it is important that the Commission tells us what resources it has in order for the Community to respond to this problem, because, in the draft budget for 2001, no reference is made to the response that Mrs González Álvarez mentioned a moment ago: a genuine response from the European Union itself. How does the Commission intend to respond, to show solidarity with the conflict that is devastating the country? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This time it is the kidnapping of eleven British soldiers by the West Side Boys militia. To this we must add the attacks carried out by this group of rebels with the aim of extending their area of influence, which have cost the lives of three members of the pro-governmental forces.</p>
<p class="contents">These are actions that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats strongly condemns and which the European Parliament should also condemn. At the same time, it should also demand the immediate and unconditional release of the soldiers who are being held hostage and show its support for the Government of Sierra Leone, and for the UNAMSIL and British army forces who are working to consolidate peace in that country. It is still a precarious peace, which is demonstrated by this kidnapping. That is why we cannot just stop at words of condemnation, but we must move on to action and also demand that the Lomé Peace Agreements are complied with and that all the militias are disarmed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as long as poverty continues to rule in Sierra Leone, until the trafficking of diamonds is put to an end once and for all and the arms trade is ended, there will be no chance of peace for this tortured country.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must therefore use every means within its power, not only in order to help fund the peace process, but also, above all, in order to make it possible to establish living conditions that make peace irreversible. We therefore need a generous and coordinated policy of development cooperation, especially in the field of education. This is why a budgetary effort is being requested for this policy, as a policy that will contribute to ending the blight of poverty. But, above all, we need decisive action on the part of the European Union, the Member States and the whole of the international community in order to put an end to diamond trafficking in the area. As long as a country’s natural wealth is only benefiting warlords, that is, as long as diamonds enable the paramilitaries to have sufficient capital to provide themselves with arms and continue their activities, peace will be nothing more than an impossible dream. Without peace, development will only be a Utopia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union should now pull out all the stops in order to make this embargo happen and to stop all trade in blood diamonds.

They, too, are the victims of a policy whose main victim is the people of Sierra Leone. But primarily, that policy is a result of government action, of the action of the UK Government supported by all the major western powers, especially France, and the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it disgusting that the resolution makes no mention of the United Kingdom’s past and present role in that country. After plundering and exploiting the region, that former colonial power rigged the elections and imposed a government that mainly represents its own interests. Its machinations are one of the main contributing factors in a barbaric civil war in which it is implicated directly, by its diplomacy and by the naval pressure it is exerting, and indirectly by the behaviour on the ground of the troops of its former African colonies, which is just as dreadful as that of the armed gangs. These armed gangs, including the RUF, certainly do not represent the interests of the people of Sierra Leone, in terms either of their methods or their objectives. But, however great their responsibility for the misfortunes of their country, it does not match the cynicism of the British ministers and high dignitaries.</p>

We warned the British Labour Government months ago about the dangers of an open-ended commitment of British troops to Sierra Leone. Our troops should have been given a clear and finite mission with a realistic exit strategy from the start. The present unacceptable situation is a clear consequence of mission creep and political indecision and provides a clear lesson for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, we are not faced with a merely political issue, but with a criminal act that falls under a criminal code. We are talking about a kidnapping carried out by criminals who have no political links, either with the members of the former military junta or with any of the groups that signed the peace agreement in July 1999. Their demands are limited to a request for a group of prisoners to be freed and for the revision of a peace agreement that is supposed to be putting back together a country that has been torn to pieces. The victims of the kidnapping undoubtedly have a great deal of political significance.</p>
<p class="contents">The international presence in Sierra Leone is a good example of the perseverance on the part of the international community in seeking world peace. Therefore, taking on that responsibility, we are in support of the European Parliament addressing the Government of Sierra Leone today and calling for the immediate and unconditional release of the British soldiers who have been taken hostage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Turkey, as we appreciate, suffers from an extremely vulnerable border and it is a particular problem for it to establish the requisite stability and peaceful circumstances that its integration to Europe properly requires. As a part of the pre-accession phase of Turkey's candidacy, we should try to establish a functional forum where military as well as civilian and economic issues should be shared between us. Turkey's membership of NATO presents many of our Member States with a special responsibility in this respect. The development of a common European Security and Defence Policy should be seen as a pretext, and also as a bridge, for us to reach common positions on ways to combat terrorism while respecting fundamental rights.</p>

Commissioner, I think we should be quite plain about this. Matters will never improve without a clear, political and peaceful solution to the Kurdish problem, and Turkey should realise this. I believe that stabilisation – and we at least hope that peace in the Middle East is inching nearer day by day – will only happen if a solution is found to the Kurdish problem. We naturally want to express our sympathy to the families hit by bombings, most recently in August, and we demand the greatest respect for international borders.

Why should women, children and defenceless civilians always be the victims of military action? Over 32 people were killed and 40 were injured in the bombing of Kurdish villages by the Turkish military in Kendakor on 15 August. This is a bloodbath and a crime against humanity. It is a sign of the Turkish Government's attitude towards peace and towards the Kurds at a time when the Kurds had made a peaceful gesture.</p>
<p class="contents">As a spokesperson for the Turkish Ministry for Foreign Affairs has confirmed, Turkey from time to time carries out operations against the PKK, who have now, for the third time, declared a unilateral ceasefire. I would like to know why arms are being delivered to Turkey right in the middle of the pre-accession process, and why arms factories are being built. Why were the human rights organisations and World Peace Day banned on 1 September? Is it really possible to accelerate the democratisation process using weapons and arms? The answer is no.</p>
<p class="contents">The best way to achieve peace is a peaceful solution of the Kurdish problem and respect for human rights. Why is that mothers always have to suffer? Can we not help to foster fellowship and peace between the Kurdish and Turkish peoples? I welcome the MEDA programme, which states that all state, legal, political, cultural and social discrimination against the Kurdish population by the Turkish Government should cease. Granting EU financial aid to Turkey should be tied to solving the Kurdish problem, and this aid should be devoted to overcoming the economic and social underdevelopment of the Kurdish region.</p>
<p class="contents">Bombing civilian populations should no longer be allowed in this century. I wish to condemn this inhumanity and want to see an end to this crime. Those guilty of such crimes should be condemned. I call on the Council and the Member States to consistently condemn the bombing of Kurdish villages and to make representations to the Turkish Government for them to start negotiations with the Kurds' democratic representatives for a political solution as soon as possible. That is the fast track into the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This will have given me an opportunity to address a number of points that I will be taking up in the report this Assembly has asked me to draw up on enlargement to Turkey and its accession to the EU. I will not go back over that but I do want to give my opinion here. If it turns out that the bombardment of Kendakor on 15 August was carried out by the Turkish army, we will have to encourage the Turkish Government gradually to reduce the role its armed forces continue to play, on the pretext of combating terrorism, in areas likely to cast serious doubt on the credibility of Turkey’s wish to join the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There seem to be signs that the fight against terrorism is being won and I sincerely believe that the time has come to take this kind of decision.

<p class="contents">New impetus and political will are needed from both sides to find an appropriate solution. Above all, arrangements should be agreed for those who wish to go back to Bhutan voluntarily. Technical solutions cannot be found unless the negotiators are firmly resolved to reach agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission acknowledges the results achieved by Mrs Ogata, the head of the UNHCR, for instance, when she visited Bhutan and Nepal last May, and the commitment of both sides to find a viable solution soon. I have also talked to government representatives from both parties. They also seem determined to find a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ogata's and the visit of a European Parliament delegation in April this year have been instrumental to genuine progress. However, the Commission regrets that the formula for verification in the camps has not yet been agreed, despite recent expectations that an agreement would be found.</p>
<p class="contents">In its regular contacts with the Nepalese and Bhutanese authorities the Commission has invariably stressed that this problem must be dealt with as a matter of urgency. The EC is a major donor of humanitarian aid to the refugees and to date has spent more than EUR 11 million. The Commission has used every opportunity to urge both sides to achieve tangible results. It has repeatedly stated its commitment to provide the necessary resources to facilitate reintegration and resettlement of the refugees once real progress has been made. A number of EU Member States have made the same commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current financial year the Commission will supply EUR 1.5 million in assistance to the camps via the UNHCR. The risk that funds might run short should be avoided. This is completely manageable, given the amounts involved. It is our responsibility to prevent it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is looking forward to assessing the results of the forthcoming discussion between the Prime Minister of Nepal, Mr Koirala, and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bhutan, Mr Zimba, due to take place in the UN General Assembly on 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the recent events in Burma, on 18 May the Commission deplored in this House the continued violation of human rights by the Burmese military machine. We referred on that occasion to extrajudicial killings, the imposition of forced labour, the forced displacement of local populations, the repression of political opponents and the prevention of the full functioning of legitimate political parties.</p>
<p class="contents">We also condemned the restrictions on the freedom of movement of Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the National League for Democracy and the routine practice of arbitrary arrests.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Commission expressed its support for the common EU position on Burma and for the decision of the April 2000 General Affairs Council to strengthen this common position. We use every possible opportunity to press our Asian partners to urge the State Peace and Development Council to enter into a substantive dialogue with the democratically elected representatives and the ethnic minorities. The aim must be to arrive at a mutually agreed solution to the present situation, re-establishing respect for international standards of human rights in Burma.</p>
<p class="contents">Several speakers this afternoon have mentioned tourism. The EU has already clearly expressed its support for Aung San Suu Kyi's call on people from all civilised countries to refrain from tourist visits to Burma. We encourage our citizens to respond accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent developments in Rangoon provide perfect proof, if proof were needed, of the validity of our condemnation of the military regime's unacceptable practices. The unwarranted seizure and subsequent detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and senior members of her party, together with local youth leaders, last Saturday, cannot in any way be justified by claims that they need ‘protection’. Nor can such treatment be justified by unsubstantiated allegations of conspiracy. This was a simple exercise in thuggery by an administration acting in panic. The Commission therefore joins its voice to the calls from all over the world for an immediate end to the house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi and her senior colleagues, the immediate restoration of normal channels for diplomatic access to the leadership of the National League for Democracy, the immediate release of the local youth leaders currently held without charge, and an immediate end to the illegal surveillance of private telephone conversations by democratically elected political representatives in Burma.</p>
<p class="contents">On the human rights situation in Colombia, our attention has been drawn on a number of occasions to the murders of innocent civilians in Colombia. Impunity for the perpetrators of such atrocities has almost been systematic. We have also seen a dramatic increase in death threats against people providing assistance on the ground to more vulnerable groups. For example, we have been informed that serious threats have been made against the Irish priest Brendan Forde, who is working in one of the regions most affected by violence. The Commission deeply deplores and condemns this situation and calls all parties in the conflict to respect humanitarian law and principles.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also supports the peace efforts promoted by President Pastrana. It will do anything in its power in order to promote support for lasting peace in the country. As regards what has been said in the debate this afternoon, in my view more guns are not a shortcut to a solution for Colombia but will merely add to the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully shares Parliament's concerns over the recent kidnapping of eleven British soldiers in Sierra Leone. We hope the ongoing efforts to secure the release of the remaining six soldiers are successful. We would like to express our solidarity with the soldiers and their families. The Commission is concerned that incidents like this and the abduction of UN personnel could hamper attempts to put the peace process back on track. We would welcome any decision by the United Nations Security Council to strengthen the UN force in Sierra Leone.</p>
<p class="contents">The Security Council's resolution of 5 July this year banning the illicit trade in diamonds from Sierra Leone has now been transposed into Community law. This ban, as well as the ban on arms sales to other groups which has been in force since 1997, must be strictly implemented. The Commission calls on all parties concerned – and that, of course, also includes the diamond industry in Europe – to support the UN's sanctions committees in achieving this end.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission remains supportive of the Government's attempts to restore peace to the country and to implement programmes of economic recovery. With funds from the European Development Fund support is being provided to demobilise and reintegrate ex-combatants within the framework of a wider reconstruction and rehabilitation programme. Economic recovery is being assisted through a EUR 8.2 million programme of budgetary support and a technical assistance programme supporting improved public financial management. Within the next few weeks the Commission will be seeking approval for a rehabilitation and reintegration programme of EUR 30 million, a health sector support programme of EUR 28 million, a programme of post-conflict budget support of EUR 34.75 million and a support programme to the Ministry of Finance of EUR 4.5 million.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards humanitarian assistance, the Commission, through ECHO, is continuing to finance programmes in support of displaced and refugee communities through international NGOs and the UN. Since the beginning of 1999 ECHO has provided some EUR 26 million of assistance covering the supply of medical aid, therapeutic feeding, water and sanitation and psycho-social support for children affected by war. This is especially important, given the terrible situation for child soldiers and children in general in Sierra Leone. In addition, this funding has specifically covered support for amputees and refugees and internally displaced populations.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards northern Iraq, the Commission shares the concern expressed in various draft resolutions about the latest operations by the Turkish Air Force and the resulting civilian casualties. The Commission has noted that the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs is looking into the incident and into possible compensation. The upheavals caused by each incursion of the Turkish military into Iraq undermine the efforts to stabilise the area and inflict unnecessary suffering on the Kurdish population. They have suffered enough. What is needed for a return to normal life in the area is stability, peace and support for economic development. Over the past few years, the Union has repeatedly stressed the need to respect the integrity of Iraq and its border with Turkey. These latest border violations again do not solve the problems in Turkey, or anywhere else. In our view, a peaceful dialogue between the parties is the only viable path to lasting stability in the area. I have noted carefully what Members of this House have said this afternoon about their expectations in relation to Turkey, not least regarding its future place in European cooperation, and I certainly share their views. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My immediate response is that we have to be careful, to put it plainly and directly, not to be cast in a role as simply providing funding for activities that we may not agree with 100%. We also have to take care to be sufficiently focused on poverty and doing something that really is to the benefit of the most disadvantaged groups. So what we are doing now and what we will do in the future, financially speaking, in Colombia, will have to be tailored very carefully against that background. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
