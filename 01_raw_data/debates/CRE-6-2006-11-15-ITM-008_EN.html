Since its origins we have been trying to build a common area, and not just an economic area but, above all, an area of life opportunities and freedom. We are doing so amongst people and nations that have many things in common; I am not just referring to the strategic, political and social interests that we share, but also to our values, habits and ways of looking at life.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a common cultural background based on Greek thought, Roman law, Christianity, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, the Renaissance and even globalisation. At the same time, however, there is no question that we still have cultural differences and special identities and, in particular, our own languages. This diversity, though it could be seen as just an obstacle, is in fact a source of great wealth and vitality.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it has not been approved, I have therefore voted in favour of the proposal that the European Union Treaty be modified, so that there can be Community legislation in the field of respect and protection for languages, particularly minority languages, as well as the creation of a European Agency for Linguistic Diversity and Multilingualism.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also voted in favour of promoting the learning by all European citizens of at least two other languages in addition to their own, since I believe that that is the best way to bring about mutual understanding, co-existence and unity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, I voted in favour of it, albeit with a number of reservations, which I still have. I believe that neither the European Commission nor Members during the vote in this House – the majority, at least – showed sufficient courage on a number of amendments. Multilingualism is a precondition for tolerance and acceptance, and, in the interests of understanding within the EU, more must be done in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact that Parliament decided the Commission should study the issue of the creation of an agency and present a report to Parliament on this, and it is equally true that the Commission has been found wanting in this regard. This omission must be rectified.</p>

The individual Member States will be responsible for implementing this policy. Some Member States are currently carrying out changes to their education systems. The teaching of foreign languages, as a means of both communication and recognising cultural diversity, forms a substantial part of these changes.</p>
<p class="contents">We must give unequivocal support to the European Indicator of Language Competence if we are to make the best possible use of individual systems of current language knowledge in educational planning. The motivation for teaching foreign languages is also increased by the transparency of language examination and certification, which is of benefit to those who have them in their future careers.</p>

There are some excellent things in this report, in particular the fact that it points out that English teaching does not need to be subsidised by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It includes an extremely ambitious position, which is aimed at making all sixty or so minority languages official languages, but this is somewhat to the detriment of the 21 national languages of the Union, some of which are already, to some extent, under great threat: Latvian, Lithuanian, Estonian, Hungarian and Slovenian are not languages of international communication. Even the status of Italian, German and French is of some concern.</p>
<p class="contents">It is somewhat illogical for the report to propose making savings on the grounds that these official EU languages are not necessarily regarded as working languages in all of the delegations, and this so as to release funds for the benefit of regional languages. Yesterday, we had the rather regrettable example of the Head of a State that has recently become fully independent, who felt obliged, rather than to speak in his mother tongue, to speak in English, even though he had been a student in Strasbourg! That does not bode very well, in my view, for the development of multilingualism in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As regards the European Indicator of Language Competence, mentioned in the report, I shall reiterate the arguments I put forward in my written statement on the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of an Indicator of Language Competence is needed to redress the lack of verifiable data on the EU citizens’ language skills. This Indicator must not, however, be restricted to the five most widely spoken languages in the EU. Among other factors, we must take into account the profile of other European languages around the world. This is a key aspect of the issue, and one which the EU must incorporate into its policy of openness towards, and cooperation with, the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, my vote in favour of Amendment 4 is a way of emphasising the call for the Commission to set out a specific timetable for extending the Indicator to all of the official EU languages, as I proposed in my written statement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Around the world, 350 million people have English as their mother tongue; Spanish is the mother tongue of 280 million people; Portuguese is the mother tongue of 230 million people, and 125 million have French as their mother tongue.

<p class="contents">Turning to another aspect of the issue, I am aware that those opposed to the European promotion of multilingualism cite cost as one of the reasons for eliminating it or replacing it with one working language, or just a few.</p>
<p class="contents">It is undeniable that it costs money. It must be remembered, however, despite the financial arguments that are trotted out, that of the costs incurred in the construction of modern Europe, this one is in a very good cause, the promotion of our tradition.

I should first like to say that I am convinced that it is a good thing that after three years of protracted negotiation the European institutions have reached a decision on progress towards liberalising the free movement of services. This will lead to the creation of more than half a million new jobs and will support economic growth in our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the directive in its final form does not correspond entirely to my original idea of the liberalisation of services in the EU internal market, it will still bring added value to all stakeholders, and this is why I voted in favour of it. It will allow traders and small and medium-sized enterprises easier access to the markets of the other Member States. The compromise reached in the Council is a very fragile one, however, and there is no point in putting it at risk. For this reason I did not vote for certain amendments relating to sensitive issues, such as compliance with labour or criminal law, the definition of social services and screening obligations. These issues will certainly form the subject of future debates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, services of general economic interest are still part of the scope of the directive, as are some services of general interest. The scope of the exclusion of social services of general interest is also far more limited. The fundamental rights guaranteed by the European Charter now only feature in a recital. Finally, the text remains ambiguous as regards the exclusion of labour law.</p>

They did nothing to promote the agreement that they had made and voted for, following the protests and demonstrations in Strasbourg. They have now returned to some of the most damaging aspects of the original, notorious Bolkestein Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">What they are seeking is the liberalisation of services, including in the area of public services, thereby caving in to pressure from the large economic and financial groups, which have seen this ‘step’ as a fresh opportunity to exploit the workers and for economic domination. Not only will it undermine the sovereign right of States to define, protect and fund public services, it will also remove their ability to define funding standards and to protect services as a whole. In so doing, it will strengthen the power of supranational bodies such as the Commission.</p>

<p class="contents">The key issue in the debate on the Services Directive has been that of whether the country of origin principle should underpin the directive or whether the host country’s legislation should apply in full. The country of origin principle affects significant, but strictly limited, areas such as construction, installation activities and consultancy services.

<p class="contents">We were told that these provisions have been removed in order to prevent social dumping, but there is no truth in that. Those provisions would have clarified the ground rules and controls within the European Union regarding businesses and workers. Equally, we very much celebrate and welcome the fact that the country of origin principle – which was accompanied with the necessary safeguards – has disappeared.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, how can we, at the same time, look forward to taking a great step forward for the internal market? What do we offer our businesses and our citizens? Not, at any rate, the clear rules that they need in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Too many lies and fears have marred the debates surrounding this matter, to the detriment of the internal market and the integration of our Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">With this directive, we have missed a great opportunity to integrate ourselves more. Let us learn lessons from it for the future and let us not make the same mistakes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It gives exclusive prominence to the freedom to provide services across borders, whereas freedoms such as social rights and collective bargaining are excluded or dismantled.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive puts downward pressure on wages and provides companies with numerous loopholes which they can exploit to pay less than the minimum wage. It provides an incentive to service providers to establish themselves in low-wage, low-tax countries, and encourages a race to the bottom in relation to wages and employment conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulatory requirements are an integral part of the functioning of all services, and the need for such requirements increases with the amount of private-sector involvement. The directive challenges the right of Member States and local authorities to regulate services.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, we have not treated people like numbers, at the service of the market, but, rather, we have placed workers’ rights above all other considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason is that we have removed all restrictions on the movement of persons, not by playing workers off against each other and thus having a contest that is won by those who offer their services on the worst conditions, but by showing that we want to use freedom of movement to enhance workers’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This vote should send out a strong signal that no one should continue to abuse foreign workers by offering worse conditions than those offered to local workers. Nor should it be admissible to pressurise local workers into accepting lower wages and conditions through such methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above this, workers should be given full information about conditions being offered to local and foreign workers and should not be left bereft of information. Lack of information leads to suspicion and antagonism, just as is happening, for example, at the Malta Drydocks.</p>

<p class="contents">The opening up of the services market will be positive for our economies; it will help in the fight against illegal labour and will guarantee better social protection for all European workers.

<p class="contents">Parliament and the Council have played their part and proved those who constantly demonise this text wrong.

<p class="contents">The document creates legal uncertainty. It is, for example, left unclear what legislation applies and to what extent Member States can impose national provisions. The possibility for upward harmonisation has not been included. Moreover, the review clause leaves the door open to the reintroduction of the country-of-origin principle and to the addition of services currently outside the directive’s scope. Services of general economic interest fall within the directive’s scope and since there is no framework directive for services of general interest, this directive is at risk of forming a horizontal framework for services of general economic interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I also regret the fact that the list of social services that fall outside of the directive’s scope has – having originally been indicative – been changed into a limitative list. In addition, the absence of any reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights is disappointing.

That is the only reason why we can support this compromise in today’s vote. The European Court of Justice will provide the litmus test for this Directive, as it will certainly, be called upon frequently to rule in disputes concerning the Directive’s contradictory contents.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, we have the stipulated freedom to provide services. On the other hand, this Directive does not apply to the fields of vaguely-defined public and social services and temporary work agencies. It has no influence in terms of regulating labour legislation and collective agreements and its scope is limited in terms of the work carried out by posted workers.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, no real barriers to the provision of services in the EU will be removed when this Services Directive is adopted. It is a compromise that has been achieved entirely at the cost of the new Member States, who have a competitive advantage on the European Union market, especially in the services sector. None of the social reasons put forward for introducing these above-mentioned exceptions and restrictions fulfil their declared social objectives. They are merely evidence of economic chauvinism on the part of the trade unions and other interest groups in the old Member States.</p>
