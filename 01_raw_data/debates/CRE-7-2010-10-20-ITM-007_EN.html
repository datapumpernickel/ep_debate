<p class="contents">Today was the first time post-Lisbon that we have voted on the budget. You all applauded yourselves and you think you have done a good job but, in fact, while countries across the European Union are having to cut public services and having to cut their public budgets, you wanted to increase yours.</p>
<p class="contents">You have increased your entertainment budget by EUR 2 million, an 85% increase. Is this the real message that you want to send to the people of Europe? You have also passed provisions on maternity pay that are going to have a severe impact on my constituents within the UK. This is going to cost jobs; this is going to affect public services. I hope you are proud of yourselves today. This is not the way to run Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This interinstitutional agreement between Parliament and the Commission satisfies – as far as is possible in a complex and continually evolving system like the European Union’s – some requests legitimately put forward by Parliament regarding the European Commission. It is therefore a good thing that Parliament’s scrutiny of the Commission is facilitated, as the latter is a technical body that cannot be the political brains of an entire continent and must answer for the substance, reasons and methods of its actions. It is also, without doubt, positive that the chance for yet greater involvement of the Commission in Parliament’s work is being sought, in particular, in plenary sittings, in order that it may respond to the requests of representatives of citizens of the European Union and answer for the position of the Commission on current political, economic, social and international issues in a timely fashion. What is certain is that if the EU wishes to move towards a democratic structure different from that of today, relations between the Commission and Parliament will have to improve and intensify.

The final version of the proposal is, according to the rapporteur, a balanced compromise between the views and positions of both institutional parties, whereas the trickiest negotiations were in the EU’s international relations.

The revised draft framework agreement on the relations between Parliament and the Commission is the fifth agreement of its kind to be signed between the two institutions. In terms of the legislative process and scheduling, it is important to point out the changes relating to the ‘Better Regulation’ approach and the announcement of a revision of the interinstitutional agreement on this issue, along with the new regulations regarding the impact assessments carried out by the Commission. Regarding the interinstitutional dimension of the EU’s international relations, Parliament’s aim is having the right to be informed so that it can give its approval with full knowledge of the facts, and prevent the non-agreement of international agreements when negotiations have already been completed. I would also like to point out the allocation of observer status to MEPs at international conferences, who can now also attend all the relevant meetings.

Until now, the European Commission has, on many occasions, taken no notice of the resolutions of the European Parliament. This, to my mind, is unacceptable. For example, the resolution of the European Parliament of 11 March 2004, in which the European Parliament recommends that the Republic of Latvia grants non-citizens the right to vote in local elections and simplifies the naturalisation process for elderly people has hitherto not been implemented. I should like to know why the relevant European commissioners have yet to address questions to the Latvian Government. Why is this resolution of the European Parliament being ignored? Perhaps as a result of the signature of the new agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the Commission, this type of inactivity on the part of the Commission will be appropriately judged by the European Parliament, and people who do not do their work properly will, on the next occasion, be excluded from membership of the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The draft of the amended text of the framework agreement is an expression of a more effective implementation of the changes arising from the treaty based on the relations between the two institutions. It introduces beneficial changes to legislative procedure, parliamentary scrutiny and the obligation to provide information. It represents major progress in relations with the Commission and is an important step towards closer cooperation. Exchanges of information and constructive dialogue will allow us to achieve more effective and transparent results, which is a key issue from the point of view of the EU citizens whose interests we represent. That is why I regard it as so important that priority is given in the agreement to the participation of members of the Commission in plenary sittings and other meetings related to Parliament’s activities. I am particularly pleased that the Commission has undertaken to cooperate closely with Parliament on motions for legislative initiatives proposed by citizens at an early stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to this, we in Parliament can be closer to our citizens, which will strengthen our democracy.

Particularly important are the amendments improving legal procedures and strengthening parliamentary scrutiny. I agree with all the amendments which contribute to improving information exchange and promoting the effectiveness of relations between the European Parliament and European Commission. It is important to ensure that this institutional partnership has as little red tape as possible. The new framework agreement on relations regulates the ‘special partnership’ between Parliament and the European Commission. We must not forget that the most important partnership of all is the partnership between the European Union and its citizens. The European Union must try harder to find common ground with its citizens and prove its importance in their daily lives.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur rightly indicated that this agreement represents a ‘new interinstitutional balance’, i.e. a healthy compromise. However, there are some issues on which the European Union cannot negotiate – fundamental human rights and freedoms. Greater powers mean greater responsibility. It is one thing to talk of common values, but implementing and defending these values is a different matter. Unless this is achieved, the various branches of the European Union institutional system will be unable to fully realise their potential. To be a cohesive force, the European Union must have credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, the recommendations in the European Parliament resolution of 11 March 2004 on the situation of non-citizens in Latvia have still not been implemented.

Indeed, notwithstanding the supplementary and application treaties and protocols, further legislation aimed at specifying and better defining some issues was required. In particular, I applaud the fact that the framework agreement clarifies the points relating to the political responsibility of both institutions, the circulation of information, external relations, enlargement and international agreements, the implementation of the budget, the political and legislative programme of the Commission and the European Union’s multiannual programme, the legislative competence of the Commission and the exercise of its specific powers, monitoring the implementation of EU law and the participation of the Commission in the work of Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The organisation and financing of this service do not include the necessary strict control over staffing and financing by the European Parliament, meaning that the EEAS is worryingly lacking in democracy and transparency. It is therefore no surprise that the proposed structure for the EEAS relegates the European Parliament to a secondary, irrelevant position in EU foreign policy, which my group and I firmly reject.

Of the 1 643 posts that the EEAS will start off with on 1 December, 50 are, believe it or not, director-general posts, and during the initial phases, there will be barely more than 30 members of staff under one director-general. When the final structure is complete there will not even be as many as 80. The aforementioned directors-general will, on average, earn EUR 17 000 per month. Below these directors-general, there is another level containing 224 directors and 235 heads of unit. In addition, we are still waiting for specific tasks and objectives to be defined for the EEAS staff. We want the EU to have a strong voice in the world, but this surely does not require a bloated administrative apparatus that will cost EU citizens billions as a result of duplicated structures and members of staff who will enjoy a very lucrative source of income.

My main concern was the lack of ambition of its wording on the principle of geographical balance within the employment policy and staff of the future European External Action Service (EEAS). The report failed to introduce a legally binding commitment to geographical balance in EEAS, thus relying only on political promises made by key EU decision makers on foreign affairs. This is why most new Member States do not feel reassured by the proper application of the principle of geographical balance in the future EEAS. It is regrettable that the rapporteur chose such a minimalist line, while the reluctance of the Council to explicitly accept this binding commitment raises even more concern. I am calling on the Council and the Commission to examine the voting result on this report closely and deliver on their promises of respecting the geographical balance principle while recruiting the future staff of the EEAS.

The organisation and financing of this service do not include the necessary strict control over staffing and financing by the European Parliament, meaning that the EEAS is worryingly lacking in democracy and transparency. It is therefore no surprise that the proposed structure for the EEAS relegates the European Parliament to a secondary, irrelevant position in EU foreign policy, which my group and I firmly reject.

A new Section X has to be created in the budget and the 2010 budget has to be modified in order to provide 100 additional posts in the EEAS establishment plan and a financial envelope for financing an additional 70 contract staff. The bulk of resources necessary will simply be transferred from the sections of the European Council, Council and Commission. The prevailing feeling in the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) is that the HR, Baroness Ashton, has not entirely lived up to the promises she made to the EP on the setting up of the EEAS. AFET considers that the EP should be consulted on staffing priorities within the service (e.g. when it comes to geographical balances) and that the issue of gender balance would be better addressed in the recruitment procedure for the EEAS. From a Green/EFA point of view, the fact that until now, Baroness Ashton has not transferred the Commission staff in DG RELEX dealing with peacebuilding and crisis response to the EEAS is considered a major shortcoming, especially as the HR has given messages of assurance to the EP on this transfer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When the Geneva Agreement was signed, which provides for this liberalisation, the EU committed to channelling EUR 200 million to ACP countries by way of compensation for the impact that this measure would have on their exports to the EU. We criticised this agreement at the time, as it will mainly benefit the US multinationals that dominate the global market in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Several ACP countries, as well as several banana producers in those countries, expressed their concern about the agreement’s consequences, believing that the sum of EUR 200 million will not offset all its effects. Now, the report provides for ‘an overall budget of EUR 190 million, with a potential supplementary EUR 10 million, if margins allow’. Furthermore, there were no proper warnings of the impact on the banana-producing countries and regions of the EU, such as the Autonomous Region of Madeira. For these reasons, we abstained from the vote on the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission proposal, made in fact without the involvement of any branch of the budget authority, provides for an appropriation of EUR 75 million to be entered into the reserve pending the adoption of the relevant amending regulation. I am bound to point out that Parliament and Council have failed to reach an agreement over this matter. Parliament had, in fact, considered using the flexibility instrument, which has proved excellent for dealing with similar situations, because the funds in question are ready for mobilisation and have a legal foundation. Council, on the other hand, had a different idea, due to the reluctance of Member States to use the flexibility instrument, which led to an increase in their contributions as a consequence For these very reasons, the Committee on Budgets acknowledged the impossibility of reaching an agreement over the 2010 budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the first time, Parliament is on an equal footing with the Council on these matters. This is the first budget following the Treaty of Lisbon. For this reason, and due to the crisis that Europe is experiencing, it is important that the reconciliation process is successful. It is vital that the EU is given a budget for the implementation of priority areas and the new powers that were bestowed upon it by the treaty. It is important to fight for our convictions and for a budget that is visionary in a time of crisis. Parliament’s proposal reflects this ambition. On the other hand, the values proposed by the Council mirror the austerity of budgets adopted at a national level within the EU. The EU, however, must have the ability to react to policy changes caused by major challenges. The EU has a duty to present an ambitious European budget which can assist economic recovery. Only by strengthening areas such as science and innovation, and by contributing to economic growth and to more and better jobs, can we make Europe a more attractive place to live and work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The expenditure for export refunds is determined by law and will therefore be paid regardless of what amount is specified in the budget. However, if the expenditure is not specified in the EU budget it will have to be paid out by the individual Member States. At a time when the national budgets are being cut back, it would be economically irresponsible to burden the Member States with this significant additional expenditure. The Danish Liberal Party is pleased about the considerable reduction in the EU’s export subsidies in recent years and will continue to work to bring about a change in the underlying legislation so that the phase-out can continue. The Danish Liberal Party also voted against a statement that prevents the payment of a special male bovine premium for bulls used for bullfighting.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why the Danish Liberal Party voted against this proposal is that this premium is only paid in Denmark, Sweden and Slovenia, where, as we know, bullfighting does not happen. Finally, the Danish Liberal Party voted against allocating DKK 300 million to a European dairy fund. Dairy prices have risen over the last year and, against that background, the Commission has concluded that, under the current rules, it will not be possible for money to be paid out from such a fund. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the field of regional development, there is an increase of about 3.2%, which is considered essential.

The EUR 300 million of exceptional funding given to the dairy sector in the 2010 budget was especially beneficial for dairy farmers, who were suffering greatly because of the crisis. We voted in favour of a new budget line, so that there would be a dairy fund to support innovation, diversification and restructuring and to increase the bargaining capacity of dairy farmers in order that imbalances in the food supply chain could be addressed. In addition, we welcome what the report says on the support being given to the School Milk Scheme, and the Commission’s proposal in relation to increasing the funding of this scheme and the funding of the School Fruit Scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the common agricultural policy is to ensure the security of the food supply, to protect the environment and biodiversity, and ensure a proper income for farmers. In this regard, we welcome what the report says about asking the Commission to include a cash buffer in the 2011 budget lest there be increased market volatility in 2011, to reduce red tape, and to improve and clarify access to funding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The pressure exerted on consumption by restricting it has not brought us out of the crisis, but has actually created unprecedented social pressure. I agree then with the EUR 300 million increase in the milk fund. I have adopted the same stance in support of additional financial allocations for this product throughout the entire period of the European crisis. I strongly support the idea of the European stabilisation mechanism and the need for the two new budgetary lines created to be specific, with figures provided and not blank, as is the case now, so that this European intervention instrument can become a reality rather than just a theory.

In this respect, I regret the fact that the proposal by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament for creating a line of ‘own resources’ funded by a tax on financial transactions was quite simply rejected by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). This inconsistency between what the right says and does is outrageous given that they have been saying for months to citizens and to the media that they support such a tax. However, when it comes to voting, and when the European Parliament has the power to make it happen, these are the very people who want to see this proposal buried. While the EU is expanding, and more and more powers are being entrusted to it, the resources at its disposal are dwindling.

In addition, the annual budgetary process is becoming a special legislative procedure with the budget approved through a regulation, which is liable to be seen as a special codecision procedure or, to avoid confusion, as a joint decision by Parliament and the Council. The 2011 budget which Parliament is proposing is ambitious, intelligent and respects the commitments which it has taken on in a rigorous and realistic way. We are making a priority of policies concerning young people, education, mobility, training, research, competitiveness and innovation. I would like to emphasise the preparatory action in which I was personally involved: ‘Your First Job Abroad’. This will boost the mobility of young people in the EU and help to combat unemployment. This EU budget continues to amount to about 1% of gross national income. This clearly demonstrates the need to revise the multiannual financial framework, given the tight margins for its headings, and particularly for headings 1A, 3B and 4. It is also clear that a debate urgently needs to take place on the necessity of new resources for the Union budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is all the more unacceptable as the sum agreed in the MFF is already an extremely small amount, which compromises any economic and social cohesion right from the start. Hence, it accentuates the damaging effects of the policies that the EU has been pursuing.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, therefore, also of the opinion that a substantial reassessment of the budget is absolutely necessary, along with an immediate review of the maximum limits of the current MFF. However, this criticism cannot lead us to accept the intention of ‘lisbonising’ the budget that is mentioned in the report which would keep it subservient to the Treaty of Lisbon’s fundamental pillars: neoliberalism, federalism and militarism. In other words, essentially keeping it subservient to the same policies that caused the profound crisis that the workers and peoples of Europe are currently facing. What is needed – starting with the necessary reinforcement of the Union budget, based on contributions from the Member States in proportion to their gross national income – is a break with these policies and a genuine commitment to cohesion, social progress and environmental conservation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It confers new powers on the European Union: hence, new opportunities for spending money. No one or hardly anyone here has the decency to highlight that there is something scandalous about asking for an increase in resources allocated to the European Union or the creation of a new tax when Member States are being ordered to practise austerity and to slash their social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In France, Europe has an enormous direct cost: EUR 8 billion per year, a figure that is increasing all the time. In other words, it accounts for a major part of the social security deficit, for example. The indirect cost is even greater, in terms of unemployment, weak growth, relocations, and so on, linked to European policies. The European budget is not complementary to national budgets; it competes with and raids them. With structural policy cofinancing systems, which are nothing other than a sprinkling of patronage, it is also an incitement to spending. An aggravating circumstance is this: for 15 years, the European Court of Auditors has been unable to approve the management by the Commission of these tens of billions of euro. I believe it is time to have done with all this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Large-scale European research projects are financially coupled to recoveries, the amount of which no one knows in advance.

I believe the EU budget is needed to provide long-term stability against the severe austerity measures which are being introduced by national governments in Europe. While national governments implement drastic cuts, in some cases, with a short-term vision, the EU budget can provide stability and long-term planning to help – through funds such as the structural funds and cohesion funds – create jobs, provide job training and boost European economies through the recovery, particularly by providing structural funds to deprived areas hit the hardest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These new powers presuppose a budget that will allow them to be put into practice and thus require all bodies with budgetary authority to be coherent and consistent with respect to their increased financial powers.

There is no longer a distinction to be made between mandatory and non-mandatory expenditure, for decisions on which both budgetary authorities are now jointly responsible, with the process being simplified accordingly.

<p class="contents">Some further steps to simplify the bureaucracy are also envisaged.

A tight budget, which is virtually identical to that proposed by the European Commission and adopted against a background of austerity. However, we all know that Europe cannot do more and better with less money.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I, along with several other Members and also the Commissioner for Financial Programming and Budget, Mr Lewandowski, am entering a plea for the European Union to award itself its own resources. A financial mechanism that would guarantee autonomy and room for manoeuvre with regard to the Member States which, crisis situation or no, have long since abandoned the idea of giving Europe the means for its ambitions. I see at least two reasons for not cutting back on the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The first derives from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the new powers for Europe in the fields of foreign policy, energy, financial supervision, to mention only a few. The second relates to the new 2020 strategy, which is intended to put Europe back on the track to sustainable growth, major projects and innovation. New challenges and powers which will need to be well funded. This leads us back to the one and only solution – direct financing of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The annual squabbling over the budgets between the European institutions leads to chaotic decision making and creates an acrimonious diversion, which could be so easily avoided through an own resources system, such as allocating part of the revenue from an EU financial transaction tax, a tax on aviation fuel or a carbon tax to fund the EU budget. Despite this, today’s vote broadly strikes a balance between responding to the extra demands created by the Lisbon Treaty, whilst limiting the growth in the EU budgets, in response to current budgetary difficulties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the basis of this new directive, the length of maternity leave will be extended from 14 to 20 weeks on full pay. Today, in order to solve as soon as possible the demographic problems we face due to the low birth rate and ageing society, we must share family commitments. Therefore, it is very important that this directive should lay down the right for men to take at least two weeks paternity leave. A child also has an undisputable right to bond with both parents. This proposal will allow us to create a better balance within families and will improve integration in the labour market. Parliament has shown that it can achieve the objectives laid down in the Europe 2020 strategy of enabling families to balance work and personal life better while striving for economic growth, welfare, competitiveness and gender equality.

Improving the provisions promoting a work-life balance is one of the ways which can be used to respond to this demographic decline. Gender stereotypes obviously persist in society, which pose an obstacle preventing women from accessing jobs, especially high quality jobs. Women are still regarded as being the principal carers of children and other dependants, which means that they are faced on many occasions with the need to choose between motherhood and a professional career.</p>
<p class="contents">Women are frequently seen as ‘high risk’, ‘second class’ or ‘unsuitable’ workers, given the strong likelihood of them getting pregnant and exercising the right to maternity leave. It is therefore fundamentally important that the new forms of leave do not reflect or confirm current stereotypes in society. Parents’ involvement in their children’s lives, from the very first months after they are born, is of paramount importance to the child’s healthy development from a physical, emotional and psychological perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the case in Portugal, for example, where I see it at close hand. However, like other EU countries, the birth rate is not high enough to ensure that generations are replaced, and this harsh situation is jeopardising the future. I believe that more flexible policies with regard to maternity and paternity leave can help to reverse these trends. It is therefore vital to send families a consistent message of support for motherhood and fatherhood, with concrete measures for the better reconciliation of professional, private and family life. Meeting this challenge is vital in order to achieve the economic and social objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy and as a way of trying to reverse demographic ageing on our continent. In Portugal, too, maternity leave is already paid at 100% of earnings for 120 days. I would therefore argue that women’s salaries should be assured during maternity leave in the manner described in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even though the Italian legal system is more innovative, the increase in the number of weeks of maternity leave at European level represents a strong boost in favour of family assistance to newborn babies. The support for paternity leave is also a step in the same direction even though making this compulsory is not perhaps the best way to pursue the laudable aim of ensuring the greater effective presence of both parents at the most demanding time for the new household and ensuring the father is more aware and involved. Support for and extension of the rights of adopted children allows a reinforcement and, it is to be hoped, also a simplification of the adoption process.

The impact assessment estimate for the UK, if maternity leave is extended to 20 weeks, is almost GBP 2.5 billion per year on average. This would result in the cost of maternity leave in the UK doubling. Evidence shows that women are currently benefiting considerably from the provisions already in force within the UK, 9 out of 10 women taking the 20 weeks maternity leave, as well as 3 in 4 women taking all their paid leave. With such a high uptake, it is clear that more European red tape on top of the current legislation is unnecessary in the UK.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the proposed requirement for 20 weeks’ full pay would result in social regression. This is due to the fact that women on the highest salaries will receive the highest compensation. I fully support the need for adequate, flexible maternity leave, but I believe it is for the elected UK Government to decide, with an input from parents and their employers, how much our own economy can afford to give and how a maternity package is to be delivered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully appreciate the need to ensure appropriate conditions for mothers who have recently given birth. However, in the long term, extending the minimum period of leave to 20 weeks would be disadvantageous for young women planning to have a family and a professional career. What is more, Member States will currently simply be unable to meet the additional costs from their budgets. Businesses have objected to a minimum 20-week period of maternity leave because it will cause additional costs that cannot be met in the current economic situation. There is therefore a risk that many employers will simply not hire young women. We can already see that it is difficult for young people to find jobs, and extending maternity leave will reduce women’s ability to compete with men in the job market still further. I believe that we must not allow this to happen, and that we must think for the long term. Fixing maternity leave at 20 weeks would mean billions in budgetary costs throughout Europe. Those are costs that neither national governments nor taxpayers can currently afford. Of course, we shall come under criticism from one part of society, but we are here to work and to make decisions that are as good as they can be and that are in the interests of all Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are of the opinion that the previously established minimum of 14 weeks is sufficient. Women who find that they are still unable to return to work at the end of their maternity leave can take leave under the provisions of their countries’ Sick Leave Act. This proposal would entail an extension of social security, which is a matter that Member States should be able to decide on themselves, certainly in times such as these, when all the Member States have to economise. There are other, less rigorous ways in which measures allowing a better balance between work and private life could be put in place. The proposal carries the risk that young, talented women might be left with fewer opportunities in the labour market, because employers will not want to run the risk of having to pay many months’ maternity leave to their female employees. Nor does an increase in birth numbers in the EU, which is the desired solution to the problem of an ageing population, have to be regulated at EU level. As far as the VVD is concerned, EU rules to regulate exemption from work for breastfeeding purposes are superfluous.

As all EU citizens have the right to live and work throughout the EU, it is vital we afford women a minimum entitlement to maternity leave wherever they are working at the time of having a baby. Decent maternity leave is part of a wider issue of female participation in the labour market and tackling the financial implications of an ageing society. The EU goal is for 75% labour participation by 2020, and a crucial element of this will be giving all mothers the ability to take maternity leave which they can afford and then return to work. In an ageing society, where the demand for social care is increasing and the number of people providing the care is decreasing, more realistic leave such as maternity leave is needed. Women should not feel that having children is incompatible with their work – our policies need to enable care for younger and older persons. The implementation of this will not come into force for at least 5 years. Furthermore, with an increase of just 1.04% of women’s participation in the labour market, the additional costs of extending maternity leave would be covered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A better work-life balance is also one of the six priority areas of action set out in the 2006-2010 ‘Road map for equality between women and men’.</p>
<p class="contents">Improving these provisions is therefore an integral part of European policy in response to the dwindling population recorded of late.

It is therefore to be hoped that the review of the directive in question will be to the advantage both of working women and men who wish to take responsibility for their families.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot separate respect for a better balance between the principle of protecting health and safety from that of equality of treatment. These and other aspects persuade me to support the need, however, to leave Member States plenty of room for flexibility in establishing rules on leave when necessary.

More importantly, this report has been approved even though it goes against the measures that have recently been adopted as a result of austerity policies which favour cuts in public spending and the reduction of social rights.

The amendment to the directive is, in fact, aimed at promoting gender equality in the world of work, promoting a better balance between women’s working and private lives. Women are frequently perceived to be ‘at risk’ or ‘second choice’ individuals given their high probability of becoming pregnant or taking maternity leave. It is important to support certain forms of leave to combat certain prejudices and stereotypes. We must not, however, forget that motherhood and fatherhood are essential rights if we are to ensure the possibility of achieving a work-life balance. There are clearly certain points connected with some amendments on which I have voiced a contrary opinion. I believe, in fact, that European law must establish a general framework that offers minimum guarantees and safeguards within which Member States can be left room to decide on the most suitable measures at their own discretion. There are, in fact, differences linked to culture, to welfare and to social security systems that must be taken into due consideration, and also by virtue of respect for the principle of subsidiarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Alongside 16 weeks of leave on full pay and an absolute ban on working, women also have the right to unwaged maternity leave with child benefit. The amount of child benefit drawn during unwaged maternity leave depends on its duration and the most recent level of income.

In Finland, there is a viable system for maternity and parental leave. A system like ours is not, however, available to everyone in Europe. For this reason, it is important to ensure that women do not have to suffer financially if they decide to have children. Businesses alone should not be saddled with the financial burden of maternity leave: the public sector must unquestionably share the costs. Small and medium­sized enterprises, in particular, are at risk of facing difficulties. Neither should the female dominated sectors have to bow to excessive economic pressure.

The outcome of the vote looks toward a society that places growth, training and education at the centre of political action.

Today’s victory in Parliament also represents a personal satisfaction due to the efforts I have personally made with the aim of ensuring that no breastfeeding workers have to carry out heavy or dangerous duties, exempting them from overtime and night work. Now we pass the baton to the Member States and I hope they will commit themselves to it to the full.

I did so after lobbying from supporters and opponents. I am well aware of the financial conditions in the UK, which will be further worsened by recent budget announcements of more spending cuts. Nevertheless, the European Parliament was in favour of 20 weeks’ maternity leave at full salary, and 2 weeks’ paternity leave, and I believe that this is a sensible investment in the economy, helping reach the EU target of 75% labour participation by 2020. It improves the health of babies and protects the health and welfare of mothers. It is a step to close the existing gender pay gap. On average, in the EU, women earn 17% less than men. If we do not guarantee decent wages during maternity leave, women are punished in their earnings for having children. It is also a positive encouragement to increase fathers' involvement in caring for children. Apart from death and taxes, birth is the only certainty in life. Our children are the future and the improvements voted through today will provide a better and more secure start to their lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, at a time of stiff international competition and budgetary stringency, we must therefore have the courage to take measures which invest in families and which take some of the pressure off the task of juggling work and family. Extending maternity leave is one of the means to that end. For this reason, I support an extension to maternity leave. However, at a time of budgetary difficulties, we have to be realistic. A twenty-week maternity leave period on full pay is not a feasible solution for our social security systems and government budgets. On those grounds, I have abstained from the final vote, even though I support an extension to maternity leave. On the other hand, I do support the Commission’s original proposal for an extension of maternity leave to 18 weeks, provided the current capped compensation scheme is enforced. I hope this proposal will stand a better chance in the second parliamentary reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that it is of paramount importance for workers on maternity leave to be paid their full salary and that the maternity allowance should be 100% of their last monthly salary or average salary, if the monthly salary is lower than this. This means that women will not be penalised for the period of maternity leave they have taken when it comes to their retirement pension.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the demographic trends in the EU, the birth rate needs a boost by means of specific legislation and measures aimed at contributing to a better balance between professional, private and family life. In order to help workers achieve their work-life balance, it is vital for longer periods of maternity and paternity leave to be provided, including for the adoption of children under the age of 12 months. Setting the statutory period of maternity leave to 20 weeks is in line with the recommendation made by the World Health Organisation on 16 April 2002 on a global strategy on infant and young child feeding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not simply an ethical question, but also a strategic one – the EU is currently experiencing demographic changes due to the low birth rate and greater numbers of elderly people. During these difficult times in particular, we must not frighten women away from the labour market. We need more working women if the EU wants to increase its competitiveness globally. The time has come to combat stereotypes that have taken root in society. Working women are often perceived to be ‘high risk’ or ‘second rate’ workers. It is essential, therefore, that the new leave arrangements presented in this report should help break these stereotypes. We should also offer more help to women who have been abandoned by society. EU statistics show that in Lithuania, single mothers face the greatest risk of poverty. The risk of poverty for working people in this group is 24%. It was a long road until the EU legally guaranteed gender equality. However, we must achieve even more and turn theoretical gender equality into real, tangible gender equality, which is applied in everyday life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would ask some questions of principle. First of all, is it really reasonable for us to impose, from our European ivory towers here, mandatory rules which would apply throughout the whole Union, including in Member States which, in economic terms, still have a long way to go?</p>
<p class="contents">Who is going to foot the bill for that? That brings me to my second fundamental comment: is it reasonable to impose the burden, so to speak, of these measures exclusively on the shoulders of employers? Will this ultimately not lead to a situation which is the precise opposite of that intended; that is, there will be fewer jobs available for young women, because employers will simply not be inclined to bear all on their own the consequences they risk entailing should their young female workers get pregnant?

We are well aware that in the current economic crisis, and with its increased difficulties, companies are increasingly struggling with liquidity problems, and that in many Member States, they are even exposed to an increased risk of bankruptcy. The directive which attempted to regulate this matter had a limited effect, and the proposal that we have now adopted represents an important step in setting and meeting deadlines for payment, not only in relations between the companies and public bodies, but also in the relationships that companies establish with one another. We will now have legislation that offers us greater effectiveness in meeting payment deadlines, with a clear system of penalties for late payment, and that also represents an effective improvement in counteracting the frequent abuse by the state and large companies of their dominant position over the SMEs. This directive must now be implemented quickly by the Member States, so that the serious problems caused by the establishment of long payment terms and the dragging out of payments are finally resolved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Being able to count on prompt payment means guaranteeing these enterprises stability, growth, job creation and investments.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, according to European Commission data, late payments represent a frequent occurrence in Europe and damage competitiveness. Public authorities are particularly to blame for creating difficulties, often due to incorrect management of their budgets and cash flow or as a result of too much red tape in their administrative machinery. Sometimes, a decision is also made to work on the basis of new expenditure structures, without taking into account undertakings made previously, which should be honoured within the contractually agreed terms.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore consider it our duty to adopt measures that make up for the shortcomings in the previous Directive 2000/35/EC, seeking in this way to discourage the phenomenon of late payment by adopting measures that induce debtors not to pay late and other measures that allow creditors to exercise their rights fully and effectively in the event of late payment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Through this measure, Europe can really give a hand to many small businesses that are permanently strangled by bank loans due to the crisis and may already be sailing through stormy waters due to unpaid receivables that are late in arriving. When this directive is applied, at least we will avoid many cases where companies are forced out of business due to debt caused by other public or private operators. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new regulations on late payments in commercial transactions, which Parliament and the Council agreed on, on 5 October, should facilitate and speed up the process for companies to recover the money they are due. It is small and medium-sized enterprises which keep the economy going, even during a crisis. This is the case in every European economy. The European Parliament has ensured that all parties will be on an equal footing and that the rules will apply to all, which will benefit many European SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to this agreement, SMEs will stop operating as banks for public enterprises or large companies. Along with the European Parliament’s recommendation for SMEs to be charged VAT only after invoices have been paid, setting a definite deadline for paying invoices will help those who are worried about their survival at a time when markets are in decline. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Approval of the new directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions represents a major innovation that will require appropriate preparation, above all, of the public sector, in both political and administrative terms. In political terms, so that financial and budgetary planning can take account not only of the impact of European Union rules on the Stability and Growth Pact, but now also of the impact of the new rules on late payments, which, if not satisfactorily managed, could have both a direct and reflex effect on the room for manoeuvre of governments at various levels. In administrative terms, appropriate preparation is required for the correct financial management of public bodies, beginning with the ratio between liabilities and expenditure, so that tax revenues and, hence, the people, are not weighed down by burdens such as interest payments which could have a significant effect on public finances. Finally, it seems important for there to be particular awareness and flexibility regarding several sectors, such as the health sector, in which the public authorities have run up significantly late payments owed to undertakings, for regular goods and services provided. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Measures are needed to rein in late payment in commercial transactions so as to protect the good health of the European economy, avoiding situations where production structures are financially stifled and there is overcharging on financing products, thus increasing dependence on the banking sector. I would like to highlight the particular case of agricultural producers, who often see settlements that are owed to them delayed by supermarkets and distributors. The maximum period of 30 days – which may be waived to up to 60 days – for payment after services have been rendered and billed is quite reasonable for the balance of commercial relations, and it will be key to fostering a culture of timely fulfilment of commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a truly important step because enterprises will be granted the automatic right to demand the payment of overdue interest and also obtain a fixed minimum amount of EUR 40 as compensation for the costs of recovering the debt. Enterprises will also, in any case, be able to demand reimbursement of all reasonable costs incurred for this purpose. I believe that this initiative will serve as a spur to Member States to draw up prompt payment codes. They may, in fact, maintain or introduce laws and regulations containing provisions that are more favourable to creditors than those established by the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Late payments have become a routine practice for public authorities in many countries (and this certainly includes Italy). If the European average is 180 days from the due date, we can only imagine the extremes of lateness in some cases and the consequences for those who manage small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">The paradox is that a State demands prompt payment of duties and taxes, handing out penalties and applying interest from the first day of lateness, but ignores its own commitments when it is the debtor. The amendment we are voting for is very important, above all, at this time of severe economic difficulty, but it will not be enough on its own to resolve the problem. If individual Member States do not amend their procedures for recovering debts from public authorities in order to make them shorter and more effective, the approved provisions will be ineffective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, all too often recently, we have seen situations of companies that are owed several millions by public authorities but are unfortunately forced to close down or declare bankruptcy due precisely to these late payments. I therefore hope that at the implementation stage, other factors are also considered, establishing a loosening of stability pact ties for public authorities and, at the same time, a gradual reduction in payment terms. This would bring both requirements together and the entire system of the country would benefit.

Of course, the adoption of this legislation will not solve the problem as if by magic, but it definitely represents a starting point to set off a virtuous cycle, above all, with regard to dealings with public authorities. The efficiency and immediacy of public authorities in paying invoices is an important step that will also have benefits for the European economy. I hope that the Member States, above all Italy, transpose the legislation very quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The initiative is aiming for greater liquidity among the European Union’s companies through harmonisation. The struggle against late payments is particularly welcome in the current period of crisis, since long delays have negative repercussions on companies’ activities. The measure aims to contribute to the smooth operation of the internal market by urgently reforming the deadline required and the penalties to apply where it is not respected.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I welcome the legislative proposal, whose stipulation of a general deadline of 30 days for paying for transactions between companies and between companies and public entities – with the latter able to benefit from 60 days in exceptional cases – garnered widespread support in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), of which I am a member.</p>
<p class="contents">I also view positively the establishment of an interest rate to be applied, where payment is late, based on the European Central Bank’s reference rate plus 8%. In my opinion, this measure equates to a strong boost for the economic activity of small and medium-sized enterprises, which often see their economic performance seriously damaged because of bureaucratic obstacles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have thrown the full weight of my support behind this agreement. Excessively long payment periods and, indeed, late payments, are a threat to healthy company management, they affect competitiveness and profitability and could ultimately jeopardise the company’s continued existence. As the current directive does not appear to be effective enough in discouraging late payments, I also support the strengthening of the existing rules. As far as maximum payment periods are concerned, we will be putting in place additional guarantees for companies because, in principle, payments have to be made within 30 days. This is of particular importance for payments between companies and government bodies. After all, from now on, Member States and governments will themselves have to lead by example. This is a question of credibility, that is, a question of European institutions in future being required to comply with the same legal deadlines as everybody else. The fact that the directive clearly stipulates that any contractual deviation from standard payment terms will only be possible for objective and fair reasons will be an important factor in its enforcement. To conclude, I hope that the fixed compensation in respect of recovery costs will force late payers onto the straight and narrow path and, better still, keep them there. That would be good for our companies and good for jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It needs to be at the forefront of our priorities, and it merits a collective response which ensures that those who find themselves in a situation of social vulnerability have a modicum of dignity. Poverty affects our young people and our elderly, but also, increasingly, our workers. 6 million jobs have been lost in the last two years alone, along with a worsening in the low level and instability of workers’ wages, even if they manage to stay in their jobs. We need a systemic approach that addresses and resolves the causes of the problems, nipping incipient problems in the bud. However, at the same time, we cannot currently provide immediate and urgent responses to their consequences. In view of this, ensuring that those who are vulnerable in our society receive a minimum income for living and are given immediate responses to enable them to get out of this situation is not only a necessity, but also a requirement that we should endorse, and one that must be achieved within a framework of responsibility and exigency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Considering the severity of the economic and social crisis and its impact on the increase in poverty and social exclusion, some vulnerable population groups such as women, children, old people and young people have experienced the negative effects of the situation more keenly.

<p class="contents">Because inequalities exist between wages and social levels in Europe, it is difficult to establish a minimum common income threshold.

The European Union must take more active measures to combat poverty and social exclusion, paying particular attention to people in precarious employment, the unemployed, families, elderly people, women, single mothers, disadvantaged children and people who are ill or who are able-bodied to varying degrees. Minimum income is one of the basic measures for combating poverty, helping to lift these people out of poverty and ensure their right to have a decent living. I would like to draw attention to the fact that minimum income will only achieve its objective in combating poverty if the Member States take concrete actions to guarantee minimum income and implement national programmes for combating poverty. Furthermore, in some Member States, minimum income schemes do not meet the relative poverty threshold. Therefore, the European Commission should address good and bad practices in the evaluation of national action plans. Hence, minimum income – the main element of social protection – is undoubtedly important in ensuring the protection of people facing poverty and their equal opportunities in society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Poverty and social exclusion have attained unacceptable levels: almost 80 million Europeans are living below the poverty line, 19 million of whom are children – the equivalent of almost two in 10 children – and many others are facing serious obstacles in terms of access to jobs, education, housing, and social and financial services. Unemployment has also reached unprecedented levels in all the Member States, with a European average of 21.4% in which one in five young people is unemployed. This situation is unacceptable and we need to do everything in our power to help resolve the tragedy that these people are living.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, 2010 has been designated the European year for combating this scourge with the purpose of strengthening the EU’s political commitment and taking measures that have a decisive impact on eradicating poverty.

Where there are differing interests, objectives will also diverge and it will be impossible to plan anything shared. Raising the living standards of those living beneath the poverty threshold is a priority. Public resources put to use in this context are, without doubt a medium-term investment since, if they are well distributed, they trigger instances of growth which feed themselves. Transferring fixed sums of money is always an uncertain business, if they are not part of a wider programme of incentives. Two situations require a different approach. The first situation, relating to social welfare, is where a worker is unable to earn enough to lead a dignified life due to physical or mental disabilities, or other related reasons. The second situation, relating to legal and economic issues, involves the rigidity of the labour market, which does not adequately equate productivity and salaries, or which does not allow you to work as much you would like or in proportion to how much you want to earn in order to lead a decent life. In these two situations, the public sector can and must intervene, leaving an incentive to hard work to be created in the others – and never the other way around. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proportion of poor employees is growing hand in hand with the proliferation of precarious, low paid jobs. In 10 Member States, the material deprivation rate affects at least a quarter of the population, with the proportion exceeding half of the population in the case of Romania and Bulgaria. All these factors add up to the EU facing a poverty problem exacerbated not only by the recession, but also by the anti-social policies implemented by right-wing governments. The minimum income can guarantee social protection for broad groups of the population who are now living in poverty. This minimum income has an absolutely paramount role to play in preventing tragic situations caused by poverty and in halting social exclusion. In order to combat poverty effectively, there is also a need to improve the quality of jobs and salaries, introduce the right to an income, as well as the wherewithal to provide social welfare benefits, pensions and allowances. 2010 is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, continuing the campaign for an inclusive society, adopted by the Treaty of Lisbon.

Work represents the greatest priority for the population. The solidarity on which the European model of social market economy is based and the coordination of national responses are vital. The initiatives undertaken by individual states will be ineffective unless we have coordinated action at EU level. It is therefore essential that the European Union speak with a single strong voice and have a common vision, subsequently allowing individual states a choice over the concrete application of measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. In the social market economy enshrined in and fostered by the treaty, the public authorities must implement settlement measures with the aim of accelerating and facilitating the achievement of balance in order to prevent difficulties for the public or at least minimise them. We need social policies to protect families, limiting inequality and the impact and the effects of the crisis. We need to improve systems of social protection by implementing long-term policies, also with regard to jobs, giving greater stability to employment while avoiding unsustainable burdens on our national budgets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This includes various different groups: children and young people up to the age of 17 have a higher risk of poverty, which, in specific terms, means that one in five children and young people are victims of poverty. Elderly people also face a higher risk of poverty than the general population. In 2008, the at-risk-of-poverty rate for people aged 65 years and over stood at 19%. However, the at-risk-of-poverty rate for those in employment was 8% on average in 2008 – the so-called ‘working poor’. The concept of a minimum income will contribute significantly to the social integration of groups that are at risk. However, in the drawing up of the directive, the greatest possible attention needs to be paid to maximum control and avoidance of any possible ‘exploitation’ of this social assistance. If we just look at the number of people receiving unemployment benefits, there are 23 million people who need to receive unemployment benefits in order to be able to live with dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, more in-depth work is still needed to reach an exchange with the national parliaments on this basis, to transform these recommendations into legislative proposals and to translate the resulting objectives into a programme of work. Putting a stop to work by this special committee would give the impression that the crisis had been overcome, when the financial market situation has not been stabilised and the economic and social effects of this huge crash are still unknown, with a profound, long-term impact. All the files opened or to be opened now, namely, the Europe 2020 strategy and new directives, economic governance, financial perspectives, regulation and supervision, reform of global governance and EU representation, should start by acknowledging the crisis of the current model. Among other things, such a continuation would allow this multiple agenda to be followed up in depth, and the analysis and political recommendations to be developed based on a programme of work to be defined, and on that basis, would allow a follow-up report to be drawn up for the second half of 2011. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The stand taken by Community officers and in the European Parliament resolution confirms that. The infighting between the imperialists cannot be overcome and will get progressively worse. The EU and G20 are making simple plans to slash grassroots incomes, to put grassroots property into the hands of big business and increase their profits, to increase the exploitation of the working class and to cut insurance and labour rights. The blanket measures decided strengthen the monopolies and shift the burden of the capitalist crisis on to the workers’ shoulders; at the same time, the EU and the plutocracy are trying to gild the pill by promoting new models of economic governance and green economies and are promising that there is light at the end of the tunnel in order to generate vain hope and wheedle assent out of society. The massive demonstrations in Greece, France, Italy and other countries are blatant proof that the choices made by the capitalist system are rejected by the workers.

In order to do so, Europe needs to overcome the problem of the ageing population. It must regulate, reorganise and supervise the Union’s financial market, improve its coordination, and use this strength to play an active role at global level. It must adopt measures to improve coordination between the different levels of governance, define a new model of economic growth that goes hand in hand with human and social development and focus on European solidarity, improving competitiveness, quality, improving education, innovation, new technologies, and on knowledge.

There is one thing, however, that is quite unconvincing: the real, deep-seated cause that unleashed the economic crisis we find ourselves in was not given adequate attention, although it is included in the recitals of the text. The cause was not contingent, but structural – and not just in economic terms. The financial crisis was caused, primarily, by the illusion, cultivated by the world’s financial and political elites, that in the third millennium, the economy and wealth could be based more on finance than on the production of goods, more on the astonishing creation of products of financial engineering than on that which is really created, produced, sold and marketed by hundreds and hundreds of millions of enterprises across the world. Unless we recognise the economic and political importance of restoring the real economy, rather than the virtual economy, the report runs the risk of making a fatal mistake: suggesting ways out of the crisis which would ultimately not be a real solution. Europe does not need further centralisation of economic powers at EU level. Europe needs enterprise and less bureaucracy.

It is our task to learn from these lessons and put them in practice in order to get going again. We need to avoid the mistakes that were made in the past and recognise the phenomena that had not been identified before, but, above all, we need to be thorough in establishing the relationships between the real economy and finance, protecting employment and general welfare from shocks of this kind. However, the European Union must do more. It must create added value, strengthen the instruments that have worked well (such as the currency), refine those that can be improved (such as the coordination of fiscal and budgetary policies), and create economies of scale for a rapid and long-lasting recovery.

In a large area that has borders open to free movement and an internal market, it has become unacceptable to allow the resistance of a system of mediation, monitoring and supervision based on the power of individual states, which is small and limited in scope given the situation in Europe and the rest of the world. The strengthening of economic governance, financial supervision and the power to coordinate policies and economic and monetary matters on the part of the EU institutions will ensure greater stability and a greater ability to act swiftly and efficiently. I would like to highlight the recognition of the importance of the Europe 2020 strategy, where research and innovation are central to the competitiveness of companies and job creation.

There is, however, a need for continued, detailed debate on one issue in particular, a CCCTB. I agree it is necessary to ensure that different corporate tax regimes do not enable companies to evade their responsibilities to support society by a share of their profits through a fair corporate tax regime. However, particular attention needs to be given to the negative impact that a CCCTB could have on small countries such as Ireland, whose prosperity and employment levels depend, to a large extent, on its capacity to attract foreign investment. I wish to note also that the Irish Labour Party does not support a CCCTB. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not need less Europe, we need more of it! Our national economies are closely intertwined – national egotisms will only intensify the crisis. This report calls for Europe to be unanimous on essential issues. Sustainable EU financial, economic and employment policy needs to be the cornerstone of our action. The recommendations for action show a clear way forward: in future, businesses must have their credit ratings assessed by an independent EU ratings agency. An end must be put to high risk speculation through a financial transactions tax. The Stability and Growth Pact needs to be better connected to the Europe 2020 strategy. We are unambiguous in calling on the Commission to create a balance between growth, equality of opportunity and financial market stability. There is a need to reduce the taxation on work in order to strengthen investment and thus, Europe’s competitiveness. Small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, need easier access to credit.</p>

The Member States of the EU and their populations have plenty of food for thought in connection with the resultant economic crisis, with its growing rate of unemployment and social service sector cuts. The rescue packages were only able to arrest the downward spiral in the short term. In the long term, they only displace the underlying problems.

It is also worth highlighting the proposal to establish a high-level policy group chaired by the Commission with a mandate to study potential institutional changes within the ongoing economic governance reforms, including the possibility of creating a European Common Treasury (ECT), with the objective of endowing the EU with its own financing resources and reducing its dependence on national transfers, as well as producing a feasibility assessment in order to establish, in the long run, a system under which Member States may participate in the issuance of common European obligations.

It is crucial for Member States to apply in full the rules and decisions agreed at EU level, such as the rules and instruments of the Stability and Growth Pact.

I voted in favour of it because I consider it of fundamental importance to improve the economic governance of the European Union. The financial crisis has indeed highlighted the lack of true political and economic coordination between Member States and the inefficacy of the various control instruments. It is now therefore time for Europe to set up a more reliable legal framework that observes the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy while also implementing greater control over debt and public income, fiscal incentives for SMEs, internal market development and integration of labour markets. In the light of recent agreements, I do not, however, support the introduction of numerical rules that could prove too mechanistic for some Member States and difficult to achieve. We should not forget that toxic assets and, to an even greater extent, excessive personal debt (sub-prime mortgages) lie at the root of the financial crisis. In other words, the crisis was caused by imbalance in the private and banking sector, not by state public debt. Lastly, I agree with recommendation 3 on enhancing state coordination by means of annual euro area surveillance reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All this, at a time when the workers in numerous countries in Europe have come out on to the streets in protest against becoming the victims of the crisis and the neoliberal counter-attack being launched by the EU, the ECB and the IMF. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main risk factor is associated not so much with matters of monetary technique, where the European Central Bank is doing an excellent job, but with economic cohesion and the link with the real economy. The problem really made itself felt during the crisis: the single currency makes less and less sense for a market that is still fragmentary and with fiscal policies that are not always sufficiently homogeneous. Considering these issues should not be, and must not be, a mere exercise or excuse for claiming legal sovereignty over matters that are currently the responsibility of individual nations. Instead, it is useful to apply consistency and a systematic approach to economic action in the face of increasingly complex situations, where currency challenges are not the same as in the past and require different instruments and objectives where the responsibilities shouldered by the technicians must be backed by ongoing and consistent monitoring as well as political direction based on a considered view of the future and an eye to resolving contingent problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thus, the Europe 2020 strategy should seek to promote economic growth and create jobs, as the sharp fall in GDP, the drop in industrial production and the high numbers of unemployed are a major social and economic challenge which can only be overcome by strong, harmonious and united governance. Mr Feio’s report points out ways and defines strategies towards a real strengthening of economic governance and the EU’s stability framework, with the main focus on the euro area. Examples of this include the establishment of a coherent and transparent framework for surveillance, the strengthening of the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and the strengthening of economic governance in the euro area, among others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the issues and solutions detailed in the report are extremely timely. The lack of information, distorted reporting and, occasionally, downright lies from EU states’ governments, has led to dreadful results. By fearfully concealing the glaring gaps in their budgets, Greece, Latvia and Hungary have shaken confidence in the euro. The European Commission and the European Parliament must strictly and effectively react to any distortion of the facts and concealment of the truth. It is essential to draw up measures in respect of dishonest politicians, on whose account the EU has ended up in crisis. In order to come out of this complicated economic situation, we must draw up not only regulations for supervision and statistics, but also a plan for overcoming the crisis. That means, firstly, clear criteria for fiscal policy, and deadlines and guarantees for taxpayers. We must also ensure that this tax legislation not be amended every day at a nod from investors. Unfortunately, today, the Latvian Government amends its regulations as the mood of the officials from the International Money Fund and the European Bank takes them. I hope that the Feio report will act as a signal to the European Commission that the time for getting down to work has come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not need mechanisms to tackle debt that are excessively automatic and pro-cyclical, which risk failing to meet the objective and, if anything, risk hindering actions to boost economic growth. Instead, I favour the adoption of surveillance mechanisms equipped with flexible, reasonable formulas, which can be easily implemented by the Member States. The results and benefits for the budget of important reforms in social and economic matters, above all, pensions reform, are not seen in the following financial year but, after a number of years in the medium and long term, in the sustainability of the public finances. In any case, these are the most important and necessary reforms. Therefore, we must give more and better consideration to the structural reforms required to stimulate competitiveness and economic growth in Europe. Competitiveness brings economic growth and growth brings more tax revenues and effective financial consolidation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recommendations provided in this report are a good start. The rapporteur is correct to observe that we need to proceed with structural reforms regarding social policy and the integration of labour markets, and fiscal incentives to small and medium-sized enterprises. The process of reducing long-term deficits must be combined with other efforts stimulating the economy, such as improved preconditions for investments and an improved internal market, providing increased competitiveness. I also welcome the fact that the rapporteur recognises that any new proposed measures should not have a disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable Member States, in particular, the Baltic countries. That would impede our efforts towards economic growth and cohesion. Last year, enthusiasm for the euro waned slightly in non-euro Member States, including Lithuania. Therefore, it is important for us to appreciate that decisions taken in the first half of the year to safeguard the stability of the euro are only temporary and will need to be supported by a better economic governance framework at EU level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The current economic crisis has demonstrated that the present economic governance model does not go far enough and cannot allow for progressive integration that will ensure the stability of EU economies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that I am voting to support the recommendations of the Feio report, which highlights the need to strengthen EU economic provisions and to review and improve them in the longer term. I understand that Europe needs to look critically at its current economic and financial stability plans in order to move forward together, towards a stronger, more closely intertwined economy that fulfils its potential as a global economic superpower. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
