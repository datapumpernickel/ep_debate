Perhaps we should have organised things a little better here in this Parliament and had an extensive debate on Russia and all the things going on there, in view of its needs and the great importance of the country, also from the European Union’s point of view, in an attempt to get some kind of grip on the situation. Once again, I would like to endorse what Mr Swoboda said on the matter. Having just discussed the financial vicissitudes of Russia we are now going to discuss the political stability of the country. Recent developments there give cause for concern, indeed I might say a great deal of cause for concern. Violent conflict in Dagestan, bomb attacks in Moscow, and all this in the midst of rumours about plots and all kinds of theories as to what is supposed to be behind it all, and all the different associations being made, for example with the forthcoming parliamentary elections and attempts by certain groups to undermine this process.</p>
<p class="contents">We lament the violence and the victims and we sympathise with the Russian authorities, who are trying to get the situation under control. We repudiate the violence in the severest terms. Russia has enough problems as it is. Even the political system is under pressure and political violence will only increase instability in the country. The negative consequences of this affect us too. The violence in Dagestan, the subject we are actually discussing, may spread further through the Caucasus, with all kinds of unpredictable consequences. No one is anticipating that either. Whilst it may be clear as to why it is in our interests to find a political solution, we only have a limited amount of influence over the internal situation in Russia. Indeed the debate we have just had demonstrated this and all we can do is encourage the Russian authorities to restore order with the minimum of violence. The Russian authorities must enter into political dialogue with the authorities of Chechnya, who must also take responsibility and stop supporting illegal groups in Dagestan. We believe, and this point is also made in the resolution, that the OSCE should be the one to bear this message. The EU should concern itself more with the socio-economic development of the region, another point made in our text. These are small steps which are unlikely to have a great deal of impact on Russia as a whole. But they are things we can do and which will also serve to convey that we have our reasons for wanting Russia to become stable, both in terms of the details we are discussing here and as a whole. We must be ready to deliver any humanitarian aid that is required. We must provide help wherever we are able to do so. But we do not have much of a grip on the situation. That is one of the greatest risks which Europe will have to face in coming years and I call upon Parliament, but also the Commission and the Council, to put the debate on Russia and its future in Europe on the agenda, and keep it there.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Right now it concerns the tragic fate of the people in Dagestan. Most news reports only give us a scant account of the drama taking place in this part of the world. We need humanitarian aid there urgently. The main thing would be above all for these people in Dagestan to be granted the same autonomy as they already have in neighbouring states. So what is happening? There is clearly a lack of objective information on the political situation there, but there is also a lack of respect for human rights. The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe must be commissioned to prepare a report for our Parliament, the Commission and the Council, and the task which faces us generally in our various Groups must be directed particularly at obtaining such information as quickly as possible and reliably. Regardless of where responsibility lies for the situation in Dagestan, the fact remains that it is a result of the dramatic developments following the fall of the iron curtain and that the countries in this region have only managed with great difficulty to liberate themselves. In addition, the political authorities responsible continue to attempt to regulate ethnic groups and to create divisions between them.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen this in direct proximity to us in Europe in the former Yugoslavia, and now we are observing similar developments further away. We must do all we can to extinguish the fire that has been kindled there, so that the people in this part of the world also have the possibility of developing in peace, establishing their own autonomy, and having a future, such as we have already secured for ourselves in Europe. We should not forget that a few decades ago we lived through a similar fate here in Europe. We were then reasonable and came to an understanding, and it is now our job to help people there in their development, which may perhaps run a similar course, but which can in any case offer them the possibility of a future, in which their existence is secure, and where they can take control of their own destiny. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, the conflict in Dagestan has to do not only with the conflict between the Russian army and militant Islamicists from Chechnya but also with Russia’s weakness, with oil in the Caspian Sea and with poverty in the northern Caucasus which is being increased by the lack of economic support from Moscow. There are perhaps 30 different peoples in Dagestan with just as many different languages. One small group consists of Chechens who are supporting the guerrilla leader Basayev in an attempt to incorporate Dagestan into Chechnya. On the other side there are these fundamentalist Wahabis who want to establish an Islamic state with support from Saudi Arabia and Osama bin Laden. So the scene is set and all the ingredients are there for a tragedy of inconceivable proportions over the next few years. The local population has so far not supported the Wahabis’ desire for an Islamic state, but things can change. They are one of the poorest republics in the Russian Federation. 80% of young people between the ages of 18 and 35 are unemployed, and the average wage is below the Russian minimum wage. And in Moscow there is not a lot of interest in the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the population is receiving a greeting from Moscow in the form of bombings. Moscow is supposed to be protecting the population, of course, but is instead perceived by many as the opposite of a protector, namely as the party which is bombing them. The problem is that journalists dare not travel to the place. They are kidnapped and taken hostage for cash. Nor do I think, therefore, that this Parliament is in a position to express a particularly precise opinion about this tragedy which is now unfolding. But the resolution says what needs to be said, and the most important thing is that we now promise each other to keep a sharp eye open for any means of helping, any means of contributing to stability in this unhappy part of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks to pressure from this European Parliament, decisive diplomatic steps were then taken. The risk of a major conflagration was already colossal, and they were successful, at the time, in damping things down. But there was no follow up action. In the action programme on Russia, which has already been mentioned today, this specific region is omitted and, in the dramatic poverty which predominates there, extremists of course have an easy job of it. If we have an interest in a concept of security embracing all of Europe, we cannot be indifferent to the situation in the Caucasus. As anyone familiar with the region knows, it is more difficult than ever for measures to be taken in the area, and therefore in our resolution we prescribed only a verification mission, to begin with. As we know, there is no one at the present time who is prepared to go there.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the people there are in real need of humanitarian aid, and this must take priority. But even the extension of the mandate of the OSCE mission in terms of finance and personnel should be checked seriously, and I request Mr Kinnock to assign Mr Patten to report to us in the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the results of this verification, so that we can reach further conclusions. I consider this to be urgent, and I consider it to be our important contribution towards achieving stability in these regions.</p>

Naturally we deeply regret the loss of many lives and the displacement of nearly 40,000 people from their homes as a result of military activity in the Caucasus region.</p>
<p class="contents">Current information is that Russian troops appear to have secured most, if not all, of the villages occupied by the invasion forces from Chechnya. As the House will know, this was the second major incursion from Chechnya since early August. Fighting still continues in the border region. According to reports available to the Commission, the invasions have not gained any general support amongst the population of Dagestan. At present it is not clear whether and to what extent Islamic extremists from outside the region have incited or financed the incursions.</p>
<p class="contents">For the moment, therefore, the Commission, in common with others in the international community, calls on the Russian authorities to use proportionate force both in fighting on the territory of Dagestan and in hot pursuit operations across the Chechen border. We also call on the Chechen authorities to prevent such incursions being launched from their territory.</p>
<p class="contents">We also share parliamentary and public concern about what realistically seems to be the terrorist bombings in Moscow and, as recently as this morning, in Volgadansk. The Commission joins with the Finnish presidency in expressing its sympathy to the Russian authorities. We await the results of the official Russian investigations into the blasts before attributing the blame for these atrocities to any particular group.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is reassured to note official statements from Moscow that neither the crisis in Dagestan nor the Moscow bombings will be treated as a cause for declaring a state of emergency and thus postponing the forthcoming <span class="italic">duma</span> elections. At all costs all parties must ensure that the current situation is not allowed to destabilise Dagestan, cause destabilisation in the longer term, or lead to greater political instability in Russia as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schroedter raised the question of a hearing with my colleague, Mr Patten, in the Foreign Affairs Committee. I will certainly pass on her comments. Knowing Mr Patten, I am sure he will respond with alacrity.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For there is a real danger that extremist forces may use this to bring about a state of emergency in Russia. No one knows exactly what the background to this aggression is. What is happening in Russia at present is extremely worrying. We naturally condemn any form of extremism, but we must ascertain the precise background. As regards Chechnya and Dagestan, this is the long-term damage left by a brutal colonial regime, which we will only get to grips with little by little.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore urge most strongly, firstly that Russia must respect its obligations resulting from the peace agreement with Chechnya and must resume reconstruction work there. Secondly action must be taken to prevent destabilisation of the ethnic balance in Dagestan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
