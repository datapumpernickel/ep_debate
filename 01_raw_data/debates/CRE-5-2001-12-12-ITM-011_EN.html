<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pérez Royo (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the Commission’s proposal on financial collateral arrangements establishes the European legislative framework for this type of arrangement and is an essential proposal in terms of the functioning of the financial market on a European level. This proposal is an essential element of the package of legislative proposals intended for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">The main objectives of the proposal, in a very summarised form, are to guarantee the existence of efficient and reasonably simple systems for the creation of collateral under either title transfer (including repo) or pledge structures. To this end, it is necessary to introduce certain modifications into the legislations of various Member States, especially in the field of the regulation of pledges and also in the field of insolvency law and tendering procedures. In summary, it is a question of creating a sound and efficient regime for limiting credit risk and thereby ensuring a reduction in its cost and, at the same time, improving the functioning and stability of the European financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">From the European Parliament’s point of view, the main problem raised by the proposal was that of the subjective scope of application of the Directive. The initial proposal consisted basically of reducing the scope of the Directive to financial institutions and to very large companies other than financial companies, that is, large commercial, industrial or service companies, whose capital base exceeds EUR 100 million or whose gross assets exceed EUR 1000 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, or at least the rapporteur, considered that this proposal raised two problems. Firstly, the removal from the scope of the Directive, and consequently from its benefits, of the majority of companies which are not strictly financial; not only small and medium ones, but also large companies which do not reach those very high quantitative thresholds which I have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the setting of quantitative thresholds raises the problem of their revision and updating. The proposed directive resolved this problem by means of the technique of delegating this updating within the Commission, assisted by the Securities Committee, the so-called ‘Lamfalussy Committee’. This is a legislative delegation, a delegation of powers which is unacceptable to Parliament, or at least to part of it, as is well known, since this is not the first time we have dealt with the Lamfalussy Committee, in this field and in others, with Commissioner Bolkestein himself.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment which Parliament intends to introduce in this field consists, essentially, of the following: removing the reference to quantitative limits and, instead, establishing the requirement that, in these cases of agreements with commercial or industrial companies, the other party to the agreement, normally the taker of the collateral of the creditor, should be a financial entity. This solution has the advantage of resolving, at the same time, the two problems I mentioned, that is, the problem of the exclusion of not very large companies and the problem of the delegation of powers – or of the Lamfalussy Committee, shall we say.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from this amendment, which in turn takes the form of several amendments, there are others relating to the formalisation of agreements and<span class="bold"> </span>evidence of the provision of collateral, the regulation of the right of use for pledge collateral and to other issues which I will not expand on.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I must end by pointing out – and this is very important – that, from the outset, I have tried to work in close contact with the Commission and with the Belgian Presidency, whose help, in both cases, I am very grateful for at this time. The purpose was to achieve a consensus which would make it possible to approve the proposed directive on first reading or at least to reduce the second reading to a mere formality.</p>
<p class="contents">We based our approach on this intention, since most of the actors, both the Member States and the actors within industry, agreed on its importance and on a basic consensus, except on certain points, in relation to this proposal. It appeared that this objective had been achieved, since it appeared that the Council’s working group had reached an agreement which also satisfied Parliament’s essential intentions. At the last moment the initial agreement in the Council’s working group has been broken and tomorrow, possibly, in Ecofin a different agreement will be approved, which includes other points which Parliament has not been able to consider in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore fear that the aim I referred to earlier of dispensing with the second reading, or at least reducing it to a mere formality, will not be possible, and we will have to continue working on this directive from next month. In this event, for tomorrow’s vote, I would ask you to vote for the amendments which were approved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with slight modifications and to vote against an amendment which has been introduced in Parliament at the last moment, since the lack of consensus in the Council, that is to say, between the Member States, has also led to a rupture in the consensus which had been expressed in this Parliament’s Committee on Economic Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have here another example of how lawmaking in this House is normally dealt with just before midnight, whilst we have during the day been largely occupied with more or less pointless resolutions on one summit or another, which are generally fruitless. I see it as desirable that we should in future deal with important legislative matters at a more appropriate time in the course of the part-session.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, I would also like to thank the rapporteur on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee for his very balanced report, which one can also call a proposal by the Commission and a consequence of the directive on settlement finality that was adopted in 1998. At that time, I was on the Legal Affairs Committee – which then had principal responsibility for the report – and was rapporteur for this directive. I can only say that the problems we faced, and which this report goes a long way towards solving, were the same as those we are dealing with today.</p>
<p class="contents">We must simply take care that there is a reasonable balance between the interest in having such credit security systems and keeping them stable, and the other interests that of course exist – those, perhaps, of creditors in insolvency cases – to which consideration must also be given, and that these interests are reconciled fairly.</p>
<p class="contents">For there can be no doubt that what is at issue here is not just the protection of these financial systems; there must also be guarantees that others affected by this regulation should not be put at an undue disadvantage. I think that we have found a just reconciliation of the two, and it is this point that is decisive.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has also mentioned a second angle of significance to us in the Legal Affairs Committee, namely the fact that the boundaries as regards preferential creditors have – I would say – been drawn relatively generously. We took the view that this category should either in fact be extended to include medium-sized enterprises, or, on the other hand, actually be restricted to banks and direct participants in financial markets. I believe that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has achieved a good result, and, in view of the lateness of the hour, I would also like to come to a conclusion. I can say on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee that we are in agreement with what the rapporteur has presented, and we will also, for our part, support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to start by apologising on behalf of Mrs Villiers, who has just, at the end of a vote in our Group's Conservative delegation, been appointed deputy leader of the delegation, on which I warmly congratulate her. As a lot has already been said, I would like to enlarge on just a few things.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the speakers on this item and its predecessor have set themselves a great goal. We want to do our utmost to ensure that the action plan for financial services – of which this directive is a part – is of high quality and can be adopted and implemented swiftly and in accordance with the timetable. We hope that, unlike on other occasions, the Council will not delay in producing its own position in response to the preparatory work done at least on this issue by Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lehne, who spoke before me, has already pointed out that it was the 1998 directive on settlement finality that set up the first milestone for Europe-wide financial policy. This has to date been the only piece of European legislation governing cross-frontier securities in connection with financial transactions. We need standardised regulation in this area in order to make the internal market efficient. We need to do away with the uncertainty as regards the law applicable to transactions across borders in negotiable securities. We need to do away with the increased administrative costs that stand in the way of an integrated EU market which is more attractive in terms of cost. We need to do away with the legal uncertainty that comes with 15 different legal systems, because these differing legal systems lead to risks when securities are utilised abroad. We also need to do away with the differing legislation on insolvency. There is, then, a need for a standard minimum regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is the only means by which these objectives can be achieved, and so we welcome it and support the rapporteur's report and that produced by Mr Lehne of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. Many thanks! We hope that it will be possible swiftly to implement this report by Parliament, together with the Commission's proposals, and thus turn them into a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking very much your rapporteur, Mr Pérez Royo, and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the excellent work and very constructive approach on the collateral proposal. This proposal, as was emphasised by Mr Karas just now, is a priority dossier in the Financial Services Action Plan and it is a crucial element for the timely delivery of the FSAP by 2003 for an integrated European Union securities market, and the year 2005 for the FSAP overall.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the value of outstanding contracts on the European REPO market alone exceeds EUR 1.8 billion, the expected benefits are extremely large. These contracts will, when the directive is implemented in the Member States, be governed by one legal regime, instead of 15 different ones. Such a uniform pan-EU legal framework for the use of collateral will contribute to the greater integration and cost-efficiency of European financial markets, by encouraging cross-border business and creating a more competitive European financial market.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I come to the tabled amendments. The Commission generally supports all the amendments except for Amendment Nos 16 and 21 which deal with extended protection of top-up collateral and the restriction of the scope respectively. We fully support Amendments Nos 1, 2, 18 and19 as they stand. In addition, and subject to some rewording, which we do not expect will cause any difficulties for Parliament, we can also accept in principle Amendment Nos 3 to 15, 17 and 20. But we may need some flexibility in finding a final agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">By supporting Amendment No 1, we are not abolishing protection of credit-related top-up collateral. But the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 16 which protects credit risk top-up collateral under the directive, and nor, we believe, can the Council. Nonetheless, as provided by Amendment No 1, it would be possible under national law to protect that kind of collateral.</p>
<p class="contents">To be more precise, Amendment No 16 is not acceptable to the Commission because it could strongly conflict with insolvency law policy which generally discourages improvement of a creditor’s position as a result of an insolvency-related event or at least in a context of deteriorating credit-worthiness.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 21 is not acceptable to the Commission because the Commission would like to see as many non-financial companies as possible benefiting from this directive. Those companies are already using these techniques in the market.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like once again to thank Members of Parliament for their sterling cooperation. I have also been apprised of what has occurred today in Coreper, as the rapporteur, Mr Pérez Royo, mentioned. Tomorrow, as he said, there will be an Ecofin meeting at which I myself will be present. I do not know what the discussion will lead to tomorrow. I regret the need for a second reading for obvious reasons, but I cannot help that. The Commission is in the hands of Council on the one hand and Parliament on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to say to Mr Lehne that I quite agree with him on the timing of this debate. It is an extremely important debate and yet it takes place at almost 11 p.m. and the public interest is very small. I assure you, Mr President, that if this debate could have taken place earlier today I would have been very happy. I am sure Members present would also have been very happy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
