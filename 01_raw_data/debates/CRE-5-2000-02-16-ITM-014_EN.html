<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Patten, today we are discussing a country that really has suffered hard times, a country that is, however, moving in a very promising direction, thanks to its own efforts and resolve and certainly also thanks to the support of the international community. So if the European Union, the Council and the Commission are proposing – and I assume that Parliament will support that proposal tomorrow – the first stabilisation and association agreement in south-eastern Europe, in the Balkan region – I am quite happy to use that term – it is primarily in gratitude for or acknowledgement of the fact that FYROM itself has worked its way into a good position, in economic and, of course, mainly in political terms, in face of the war in the neighbouring region and also in relation to its own minority. For it is no small thing to have a minority of 33% or even 35% in one’s own country. That country and its politicians – no doubt with some differences here and there – have always done very good work, and we should recognise that.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is proposing that we should conclude an agreement jointly with the Council. Let me make a few comments on aspects on which views may differ somewhat, although, even in this regard, I want to strongly emphasise and acknowledge Commissioner Patten’s activities and interest in relation to FYROM and the region as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the regional approach. I believe that if it is understood properly, the regional approach is both important and necessary. There has to be a willingness to cooperate. Provided it is not seen as some kind of constraint but as a willingness to cooperate, as an opportunity that each country should grasp, then this is the right approach. The problem is that, when we look at FYROM, we can see how very difficult it is to cooperate economically with some neighbouring countries, such as Kosovo and Albania, or to cooperate politically with, for instance, Yugoslavia. On the other hand, cooperation with Bulgaria, and in particular with Greece, has made good progress and I think we should acknowledge that too.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the European Union must consider, as it began to do early this week, how to include the neighbouring Yugoslavia in regional cooperation in spite of everything, i.e. without taking back any of our criticism of this terrible regime. Tomorrow morning I will therefore table an amendment urging that we concentrate the sanctions on the regime itself while easing them somewhat for the people and for the economy in a spirit of economic cooperation. </p>
<p class="contents">In that regard allow me to say, since I come from a country through which the Danube flows, that I am grateful that the Commission, i.e. Commissioner Patten and also Vice-President Palacio, with whom I was recently in Budapest, is considering opening the Danube to shipping again. That would provide for a modicum of economic recovery in this region too, which, of course, would be of particular importance to Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, this regional approach, provided it is understood correctly, i.e. as a method of contributing to economic recovery in the region itself, is in fact the right one to adopt. As I said, it must not be perceived as a constraint nor must it be set as a precondition.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, let me say quite clearly and plainly that we want to open the way to and offer FYROM accession to the European Union. In our view, it would be an illusion to think there was any point in FYROM applying for accession right now, but it would also be wrong to delay discussing it until some later date. FYROM wants to be told here and now that, in principle, accession will be possible when the time is right. This country is afraid it will be in a sense sidelined. It sees, in the whole readjustment of aid instruments, a risk that it will no longer be the last carriage of a train heading towards Europe but that this train will continue through Europe while leaving FYROM on a siding. I think Commissioner Patten understands that too. So I very strongly urge him to make it clear in the appropriate talks.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I believe that, so far at least, FYROM has shown that it is capable of using the various instruments properly. Even though there will of course be readjustments here, FYROM will continue to show that many of the tasks that are still being dealt with in Brussels today can in future be handled in Skopje, in the country itself. I hope that the honourable Members will agree to support these proposals as a sign of goodwill towards FYROM. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We would remind you of the proposals made by the governments of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time, which had non-violent liberalisation and a non-violent separation from the Yugoslav federal structure in view. </p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, our Macedonian friends have always played a very positive role and it is for this reason that it should be pointed out at this stage that Macedonia is not just a pawn in our so-called strive towards stability, but actually took the initiative. The former President, Mr Gligorov, can take special credit for this, and the current President too has already adopted the profile of President of all Macedonian citizens, so much so that the European Union should only be grateful to have him as interlocutor in the Balkans. </p>
<p class="contents">Despite the obvious reasons for any internal tension, both population groups have struck a reasonable <span class="italic">modus vivendi </span>and the outlook for reaching a sound solution to the remaining problems is good. It was, in fact, in Macedonia that I heard at the time about the Roma population actually not having too bad a time there. I was unaccustomed to hearing this type of comment about the Roma in Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the problems afflicting Macedonia, higher education for the Albanian-speaking citizens deserves our special attention. Accessible higher education, with which you have a certain affinity, is an important instrument in the emancipation of population groups. I am speaking from personal experience as someone who attended the Protestant university in Amsterdam. I might never have studied otherwise. </p>
<p class="contents">Such an affinity and this type of higher education is also important in the development of the constitutional state and for the aptly termed mainstream society which needs to be strengthened in countries like this. The agreement with Macedonia should partly compensate for the damage which this country incurred following the boycott we instituted against Serbia, which is at no cost to us but costs Serbia’s neighbouring states all the more. It would be beneficial if we could reorganise this, especially vis-à-vis the neighbouring states. It is only fair that we should regulate aid to Macedonia properly now. </p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore quite prepared to support the liberals’ amendment to keep aid independent from the donor states’ interests, for we need to give industry in Macedonia and the region the best possible opportunities with the aid money available for reconstruction. I am more than happy to include Bulgaria and Romania in this, as it seems to me a tactical and psychological error only to talk about the five countries of former Yugoslavia, plus Albania. It is important to us that the economies in the region can stand on their own two feet again, which can quite easily be done with the aid money. </p>
<p class="contents">The agreement with Macedonia should be seen as a door opening to the European Union, allowing this country to join, even though this will not be the case in the foreseeable future. In the meantime, we constantly need to start from the premise in our policy that it is desirable for Macedonian legislation to resemble that of the Member States, and our policy should reflect this, even in the naming of aid programmes for Macedonia. I would quote the PHARE programme as an example.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the name of the republic is still a problem on account of the Greek sensitivities surrounding it. I assume that the Member States will feel increasingly freer to use the name in their own language which fits the republic. If certain countries wish to use the words “former Yugoslavia”, then that is their business; others need not feel obliged to copy them. It will not do to keep us under constant pressure. Hence my support for the sound report by Mr Swoboda; we have come to expect nothing less of him, and hence also my words of appreciation for the respected Republic of Macedonia.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today we are expressing a positive opinion on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia. We do so in the awareness that this decision, the very first relating to that area, is actually set in the context of an entirely new phase of our relations with the Balkans. This new phase, or rather policy, identifies the prospect of integrating the region into Europe as the only option for settling its conflicts peacefully.</p>
<p class="contents">Our agreement to the negotiations, as set out in the rapporteur’s explanatory statement, is born of the conviction that it is right for Union policy to combine both a regional dimension and a more precise assessment of efforts made and results achieved by individual countries in moving towards the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the dual objective which I believe should be pursued. On the one hand, we must maintain programmes on, for example, infrastructure, preparations – still premature – for free trade, and encouragement of economic and commercial cooperation between the countries in the area, and on the other, it is now appropriate to create a model of closer integration with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an example of the policy.</p>
<p class="contents">And there are several reasons why our opinion can only be positive. As we were able to ascertain during our missions to Skopje, there has been considerable progress in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as regards the economy, movement towards democracy and – an area which is difficult and contentious enough in the Balkans – multi-ethnic coexistence. On the other hand, the price Macedonia has been paying for the war in neighbouring Kosovo is very high, both in terms of logistic availability of NATO forces and in terms of reduced exports to Northern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude, Mr President, by affirming that this progress is indeed difficult, fragile, and uncertain and it calls for constant vigilance on our part during the various stages of close and precise inspection that have long been advocated.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are extremely hopeful that, along the lines set out by the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, this agreement can represent an example to be rapidly extended to the other countries, especially Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Kosovo and, as soon as possible, Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced a rapid start to these negotiations and their speedy conclusion is the only way to achieve peace in the region – peace which did not automatically come with the end of the Kosovo war – thus avoiding the recurrence of further disintegration and a return to chaos and violence, with all the consequences of that in terms of continental, if not world, instability.</p>
<p class="contents">If the maintenance of peace and security is the basic motivation of the current courageous process of enlargement of the Union to the countries of Eastern Europe, that motivation must be present even more strongly in relations with Albania and the countries of former Yugoslavia. And that means decisively pursuing the kind of parallel enlargement to south-east Europe that the agreements we are discussing represent.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in that quasi-provocative spirit that we have presented an amendment suggesting the transfer of responsibility for south-east Europe from Foreign Affairs to Enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Very rapid and direct involvement of south-east Europe in the life of the European institutions has also led us to suggest that a limited number of observers invited from the national parliaments should be accepted into the European Parliament, and that staff from those countries could work in the Court of Justice and the Commission. But if the development in the region of a more democratic society and largely market-based economy is to be encouraged, we are convinced that immediate and concrete steps must be taken to intensify the struggle against corruption and to make international aid more effective for reconstruction and development.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, we have presented some amendments which I hope Parliament will accept. First, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be offered a customs tariff equal to zero for their exports to the European Union and compensation for the progressive reduction of customs duties applied by Macedonia to European products, on condition that the principle of joint customs control at the frontiers of Macedonia is accepted. Secondly, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be encouraged, with adequate financial support, to gradually link its currency to the euro as the first step towards the Europeanisation of the whole Macedonian economy, with the additional aim of eliminating any possible corruption in the banking system. Thirdly, world aid and assistance coming into the region, and hence into Macedonia as well, should be clearly multilateral, and should not subject the beneficiary country to direct obligations towards the donor country.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, we hope the agreement can achieve all its objectives but we cannot delude ourselves that peace, stability and prosperity in south-east Europe can be achieved without dealing with the very wide-ranging problems we are trying to eliminate. I am referring to the future constitutional state of Kosovo, the need to involve Serbia in the region’s reconciliation process and – why not? – new discussions on relations between the European Union, NATO and the UN, in the light of the new balance that needs to be found between humanitarian intervention and state sovereignty, which I think calls for a change in the existing UN Charter.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is certainly true for the relations between the European Union and the western Balkans. Since then, expectations have been high. This applies to them and us. This is true on their part because – whether we like it or not – they are asking us for direct aid and they are wondering what Europe wants from them at the end of the day? Is there any prospect of membership? This is very much on their minds. </p>
<p class="contents">But here too, within the European Union, expectations are high. If we do things properly, this may well be a first taster of a genuine common foreign and security policy. Will the Union manage to display a united front and develop a common policy, for the first time, concerning such a difficult regulation? It also remains to be seen whether the European Union has learnt any lessons from the bad experiences in Bosnia when it comes to providing aid and the slightly better experiences in Kosovo. Can we, based on the experiences in Macedonia and in four other countries, improve on this? </p>
<p class="contents">Against this background of extremely high expectations, I do not think that I am exaggerating if I say that this first step, namely the stability and association agreement with Macedonia, is vitally important. This is not the Union’s only contribution. The debate on the Stability Pact, the debate on the CARA programme and the financing arrangements in the short term are all pending. We are now dealing with the stabilisation and association agreements, that is to say a medium-term issue. This is why I think that this first agreement with Macedonia is so crucial, because it serves as a model. </p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the four other countries are wondering what is going to happen. What does the European Union intend to do with Macedonia? Will it do the same to us? This first step is so important because of this model function.</p>
<p class="contents">Macedonia also serves as a model for another reason. The rapporteur has already hinted at this in no uncertain terms, namely, the issue of interethnic relations. There is no need to paint too much of an idealistic picture. During the presidential elections, it appeared that things were not running too smoothly, but compared to the rest of the region, Macedonia could serve as a model. We would gain a great deal if we managed to export this model to the rest of the western Balkans with the help of the Macedonians. </p>
<p class="contents">This model function also applies to regional cooperation. I could not agree more with the rapporteur: a balance must be struck between promoting regional cooperation on the one hand and maintaining the openness towards Bulgaria and Greece, and not cutting them off on the other. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, if we manage this first step successfully, we will have gained a great deal. If we mess it up, then we will have lost a great deal more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I just want to point to one issue which in my view is not considered in the report and which raises a major problem in relation to Macedonia and the effectiveness of EU financial and other support. I am referring to the sanctions against Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">Do not misunderstand me: I too believe that we need to take effective action against the Milosevic regime. But firstly, these sanctions have a far-reaching and adverse impact on many of the neighbouring states too, including Macedonia, which find themselves in an extremely difficult economic situation as it is. Secondly, the entire population of Yugoslavia is being held accountable for the actions of Milosevic and his circle, which is wrong on humanitarian grounds and politically counterproductive. So I believe that we should take today’s debate as an opportunity to call for a rapid end to the policy of sanctions, as stated in Amendment No 10. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This strategy, which took shape in the Stability Pact adopted on 10 June 1999 in Cologne, considers south-east Europe as a whole, but simultaneously recognises the diversity and unequal development of the various countries that compose the region. The European Union’s contribution under the Stability Pact, now converted into what is called the “stabilisation and association process”, represents a development in the regional concept the European Community drew up in 1996 for the five countries of the region: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. Its most significant aspect was the establishment of political and economic conditions intended to support the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement, and it should therefore contribute to regional stability.</p>
<p class="contents">So establishing relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on a completely new basis, and offering that country the prospect of full integration into the structures of the European Union through the mechanism of the stabilisation and association process, constitutes an important contribution to stability in the Balkans. The assumption is that the countries are prepared to accept a certain set of conditions. The expectation is that we send them a politically relevant signal that it is possible for them to join us one day, maintaining respect for their sovereignty of course.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not deluding ourselves by believing that, once agreement is obtained, the mandate we are giving the Commission today could constitute a first major step towards peace and stability in that long-suffering region, where the people have already shown they have the right to seek membership of our area of freedom and development. They have suffered enough, first under the Soviet yoke and then from the high price they paid for being forced to become part of the communist bloc. </p>
<p class="contents">The evidence is that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is politically and economically capable of establishing new contractual relations with the European Union, going beyond the cooperation agreement in force since 1 June 1998, which in practice targets respect for the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, especially in key areas of the internal market. It is true that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia still has a long way to go, but, given the political and economic reforms already made in the context of the cooperation agreement, and with transitional periods accepted for certain domains, the country will be able to fulfil the conditions for a stabilisation and association agreement. We share the view that its development is a factor for stability in the region, we approve the terms of the negotiating mandate as proposed, emphasising that what is involved is a bilateral agreement with the European Union, and we agree with the rapporteur when he stresses that this is the first concrete application of an integrated long term strategy for south-east Europe, and that the issue is how the Balkans can be structured in the long term in order to guarantee peace and stability. The various references made to regional cooperation with the neighbouring countries in fact become politically relevant in this context. This agreement can and must become an example to the other countries in the region. That is why it is so important. The point is that underlying this whole process is an effective political will on the part of the European Union to draw closer to these countries. We are aware that some of them are already undergoing processes of democratic stabilisation, that others still need to affirm the democratic authority of their governments, and that equilibrium in others depends on the military presence in the zone, but they are all countries which now know that, once they have overcome their difficulties, a bridge is available to provide an effective link with the European Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think this report is a small masterpiece of hypocrisy. Paragraph 5 holds up this agreement as an example. We know there are 13 applicant countries, from Lithuania to Turkey, and just one black hole in Europe, the Balkans, but because these countries are denied the opportunity to become applicants, we want to make them believe that this agreement is a miracle. Paragraph 11 indicates that symbolic measures can replace the shared political outlook represented by applicant status.</p>
<p class="contents">But this is not just a masterpiece of hypocrisy, it is also an aberration, because, if negotiations begin tomorrow, this agreement will be signed in a year and will come into force in three years. And I defy you to imagine that there will not be membership applications in due form from Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia, amongst the Balkan countries, three years hence. A few days ago Mr Racan announced that Croatia’s formal membership application would be presented at the end of 2000. There are bound to be other applications and this great work, this fine intellectual architecture, will crumble, left behind by events just as we have been left behind by everything that has been happening in the former Yugoslavia for the past 20 years.</p>
<p class="contents">This would not be so serious if this region of Europe were not so beset by the problems we are all aware of, problems which are being addressed, but which have not yet been resolved, by the new government of Macedonia. There are the problems of coexistence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority, the connected problems of Kosovo, the notorious economic problems, the problems of being neighbour to a particularly developed mafia in Serbia, and then there is the problem of the Greek veto which must be condemned for what it is. After nearly 10 years, Greece continues to prevent this country being called by its own name, and I hope the interpreters have not used the term FYROM when I have been saying Macedonia. It is absolutely absurd. Apart from anything else it is offensive, in my opinion, to the Greek MEPs and the citizens of Greece. This question needs to be resolved urgently.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, by happy chance, a letter from Mr Georgievski, President of Macedonia to Mr Fischler, dated 8 March, has come into my hands. In it, referring to Article O, now Article 49 of the Treaty, he asks if Macedonia can join the European Union. Why has the Council not informed us of this? Why has the Commission not informed us of this formal request from Macedonia?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The decidedly positive developments in the Republic of Macedonia over the past critical years speak for themselves. </p>
<p class="contents">The gruesome escalation of ethnic violence in neighbouring Kosovo did not reach its territory. Paradoxically, but truly, the war in Kosovo Polje generated exactly the opposite effect: the perilous gap of confidence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority became decidedly smaller. </p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of the Macedonian majority, the Albanian minority behaved loyally towards the common state during the international explosion of the Kosovo conflict. In the eyes of the Albanian minority, the Macedonians and the Macedonian state have more than met their neighbourly obligations in respect of Kosovo’s Albanian majority who were persecuted to the extreme.</p>
<p class="contents">This remarkable upshot of the Kosovar war negotiations can therefore justifiably be seen as the internal, political establishment of the Republic of Macedonia the second time round. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Swoboda’s well-balanced and laudable report fits in with this unexpected and delightful upshot on a very practical level. In brief, the European Union knows what to do in Macedonia: to help this local port of refuge – recently used by scores of war refugees – to fulfil its role properly as a catalyst for the planned Stability Pact in the Balkans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we are doing here is not hypocritical. We have reached a propitious moment and I think the Macedonians are glad about it. Please stop being so unpleasant and pouring cold water on everything. I think we should take a more positive approach here.</p>
<p class="contents">Macedonia did not go through a war. But it suffered from the war in its vicinity and from the sanctions, as it is still suffering from the sanctions that were rightly imposed on the neighbouring countries. It suffered enormously from the influx of refugees during the Kosovo war. So we must admit that developments in Macedonia have followed surprisingly continuous democratic lines. This is a country that has difficult inter-ethnic problems to deal with at home, and is resolving them with increasing success. Let me emphasise that we can congratulate Macedonia on its exemplary legislation on ethnic minorities and the way it applies it and that the consistent policy of integrating the 30% of ethnic Albanians in government activity, in government policy and in society, is a precondition for peaceful coexistence in Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to see that the hope Mr Swoboda expressed in his report will be fulfilled early in March, i.e. that we will finally have an EU delegation there and that we, as the European Union, will finally have a greater role to play there. I believe that the opening of these negotiations on the stability and association process is the logical conclusion of a salutary and positive trend in that country. As a sign of our political commitment, we must finally show Macedonia in practice that we are indeed rewarding its own welcome regional cooperation by genuinely embarking on regional projects. Let me name just two small ones: the rapid resolution of the problem of the frontier crossing with Kosovo in Blace and the creation of Corridor 8, from Albania via Macedonia to Bulgaria. I think Mr Swoboda has drafted an excellent report, and it has my wholehearted support.</p>

I think it is a good thing that so many of us are expressing support for the approach he has adopted in it. </p>
<p class="contents">The report tackles stability in the region in a structural manner. This is also the purpose of the pending agreement with the Republic of Macedonia which we are debating today. Although the actual implementation of the Stability Pact has not yet started, the Commission has already developed the new instrument, entitled the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. This marks the beginning of the treaty-based stabilising process for the countries of the former Yugoslavia. These countries do not yet qualify for a pre-accession agreement. The present agreement is a kind of pre-pre-agreement, but with a view to joining in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The instrument of joining countries together by means of active treaties is excellent, provided that the agreements stipulated in them are implemented dynamically, so that the required stabilisation can actually be attained. Macedonia remains a potential minefield and has a history to match. It does, however, have the ambition to break free from this image. This requires internal stability.</p>
<p class="contents">The new government would like to tackle this matter and the agreement could be an agenda for reforms, including a direct role and equality for the Albanian minority. More than anything, the country needs peace and quiet now, in order to put its internal house in order and to find the road to greater prosperity. We, the social democrats, would urge the opposition to back these ideas. They need to help support the much-praised Macedonian model.</p>
<p class="contents">But the country also – and especially – needs external stability. What is the point of having internal stability if the surrounding environment is unstable? This stability is required in the relations with Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Albania and Bulgaria. The region should recognise that Macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist. External stability also means open borders and regional cooperation. Minorities and majorities need to be given room for human and cultural exchange. </p>
<p class="contents">Macedonia’s stability is very much linked with the developments in the neighbouring countries. The Kosovo problem is well-known and the international community is present there on a massive scale. It seems that the Albania factor is being underestimated. The Union considers it untimely to reach a stability and association agreement with this country. But what then instead? It is the very argument to conclude an agreement with Macedonia and not yet with Albania that cause us so much concern, so much so that a passive stance from the Union vis-à-vis Albania is really not acceptable. </p>
<p class="contents">What does the Commission intend to do regarding this issue? Yugoslavia is just as much a weak link in the stability process and, as such, a threat to Macedonia’s stability. We need to wait and see what happens there. The mood in Belgrade is becoming less predictable by the day. We, however, second the Council’s decision to give the sanctions a different focus. In this way, at least a serious attempt is being made to give the opposition, which is preparing for a new round of demonstrations, a shot in the arm. </p>
<p class="contents">What else will the Union undertake in this respect if the demand from the opposition – bringing forward elections – is met? What else can we do to support this opposition? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the USA and NATO and, finally, also the EU, reacted, it was already late, in fact very late. A great deal of suffering could have been avoided if the EU, among others, has acted earlier and more decisively. We, the European Union, therefore have a special responsibility to help, support and rebuild the Balkans now. Our absolute objective must be to create the prior conditions for all countries in south-east Europe to be integrated with other countries in the EU – economically, politically and in terms of trade. </p>
<p class="contents">Fertile soil for the growth of democracy in this war-ravaged part of Europe is best provided through trade and economic integration. We Liberals are prepared to go a long way and to do so quickly, just as Paolo Costa reported. It is therefore with great satisfaction that we welcome the proposal that is now being made for a stabilisation and association agreement with Macedonia, and we thank Mr Swoboda for a very good report. Macedonia deserves our support, especially in view of the self-sacrificial, disinterested work which the people and leaders of Macedonia undertook during the Kosovo war. Now that Macedonia is prising itself loose from the crushing embrace of Communism and nationalism, it is our duty to act and provide support in no uncertain terms. We should do exactly the same for the other countries in the Balkans. This is an urgent duty for the EU. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, allow me in this context to remind MEPs – especially in view of a discussion earlier this evening – of the fact that the man who is mainly responsible for war, human degradation, murder and driving innocent people from their homes is still governing what remains of Yugoslavia, namely Serbia. The man who is accused of genocide and who ought to be brought before the war crimes tribunal in the Hague still goes free. I am talking about Milosevic. As long as Milosevic is still there and Serbia is not pursuing a democratic path, Serbia constitutes a constant threat to peace throughout the Balkans, including in Macedonia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Its terms, which the Swoboda report accepts, are certainly not directed towards peace, but towards greater political and economic dominance of the country, and towards controlling its natural wealth, overexploiting its workforce and continuing to use that country as a springboard against the countries and peoples in the area who are resisting the new order. All this, in exchange for the promise of future accession to the European Union. The report accepts these attitudes along with the more general policy of the European Union on south-eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is characteristic that the report congratulates FYROM on the constructive stance it maintained during the NATO attack, eulogises its pacifist role because it allowed its territory to be used as a base for NATO forces, but, of course, remains silent about the indignation of its people, which was manifested by mass demonstrations during the NATO bombardments.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, because we consider that both the stability pact and the stabilisation and association process the European Union is implementing in countries in that area, will create new problems there, new tribulations for their peoples, and will reinforce the dominant role of the American and European imperialists, we will be voting against the report in an expression of our solidarity with the people of FYROM.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I shall not bother you with details of the problem concerning the name FYROM, which as you must know, is the subject of a difference of opinion with Greece and of negotiations between the two countries lasting over four years, under the aegis of the Secretary General of the UN in the context of related Security Council resolutions, but also the conventional obligation of the respective parties pursuant to Article 5 of the so-termed Intermediate Agreement of 1995.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, however, think it appropriate to say that, at the forthcoming negotiations and with the conclusion of the association agreement, the European side must point out to the Skopje government the need for it to show appropriate constructive political will, so that it may contribute positively to a successful outcome of the talks in New York. I should like to hope that such an appeal from Europe, with parallel emphasis on the difficulties that any further indecision would create for completing and implementing the association agreement, would be duly heeded and appraised accordingly by the Skopje government, so that it can respond appropriately, on the one hand, to Greece’s demonstrably conciliatory attitude concerning the specific issue, and, on the other hand, to the more general practical, declared intention and disposition of all the partners in the European Union, including Greece, to facilitate and support FYROM’s progress towards a United Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this is because I do not think that the harmonious day to day relations, contacts and communication between FYROM and Greece that have actually been achieved at both bipartite and multipartite level, and this mainly thanks to the practical arrangements of the intermediate agreement, I repeat, I do not think these sufficiently cover the conditions and criteria of good neighbourliness necessary, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, for negotiating and concluding an association agreement. On the contrary, I think that this demand can only be considered satisfied by a <span class="italic">de jure</span> full normalisation of FYROM’s relations with all its neighbours. That, combined with the essential improvement of certain aspects of the internal situation in that country, in the area of minorities and democratic institutions, would round off the image of political maturity which FYROM has, in fact, presented in other respects and which has made our European family welcome closer relations with it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is another small step, which is related to the recent partial lifting of the embargo decided by our 15 governments for Yugoslavia. For about 10 years, the situation in the area has been fluid. Both as an historical period and, in particular, as a political period, 10 years is a very long time. Under those conditions, then, there has been a real failure. In that sense, the agreement we will be voting on tomorrow, which contributes towards stability in the area, is <span class="italic">de facto</span> a move in the right direction. In essence, FYROM is a miniature version of the former Yugoslavia, regardless of where one or another minority holds supremacy. From that standpoint, the fact that so far it has resisted any influences from its wider environment is a very positive element and under no circumstances should any of us, any State, any policy or any view, impel that small republic towards external, disruptive movements in an effort to solve other problems, granted – let it be noted – that it has institutions which it can build upon still further and so become a real democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In that area, there have been various policies from time to time, and what the European Union should guard against is the risk that, for ultimately superficial reasons, it may help to create banana republics elsewhere. We must be sure that, in seeking allies in the area, we must not always choose anyone who offers. We must choose those which are moderate, which have breadth of vision and which have a perception of peace and stability in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope and wish, and am indeed certain, that the European Union, with maturity and with the measures it has begun to adopt, will little by little construct, in the wider area, the necessary environment which it needs itself. Let us not deceive ourselves: a Europe, one part of which is being held back because of frictions, misinterpretations and conflicts, and because of nationalistic clashes, will never be a Europe that has brought its own house to the level it wants.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, speaking now as a Greek, I want to tell some of the speakers I listened to earlier that much of what was said is fixated on other times and places. They have quite failed to grasp the new conditions created in the area; the new and positive conditions which have been created, in very many cases on Greece’s initiative. You should know that the country which cooperates most with FYROM and has the best relations with it, in the entire area, is Greece, and this has contributed greatly to the stability of the area. I say this just so that we know where we stand.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So I must say quite plainly that anyone who tries to tie the agreement with Macedonia to resolving the issue of the country’s name, as he does, will not only find Macedonia itself against him but all the other EU Member States too. Let me also say quite openly that he is thereby doing huge damage to his own country’s interests. It is in our interest to see stability and peace in the Balkans, and there is a chance of that, although the Stability Pact is in danger of becoming a stillborn entity. I hope that is not the case, but the risk is there. That is precisely why it is so urgent for the EU to take a bilateral approach to the individual states and for us to open up definite prospects of EU membership for Macedonia. So I welcome Mr Swoboda’s excellent report, especially paragraph 12, which quite clearly maps out a European, an EU, prospect for Macedonia. Without indulging in any illusions, I believe that is important, it has to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">We know it cannot happen overnight, but a definite statement to the effect that Macedonia is quite clearly a European country and therefore has the right to be a member of the European Union is a most important, confidence-building measure. In my view, this is a unique opportunity to strengthen a democracy that has not only established a unique multi-ethnic government in this region but is also strengthening the autonomy of the local authorities, reforming the judicial and economic systems, and doing so under the most difficult conditions, in the aftermath of nationalism, Communism and war.</p>
<p class="contents">A few years ago, I had the privilege of inviting the current President and Prime Minister here as private individuals. At the time they were still finding it very difficult to build on their various contacts here. I am very happy to see they have kept the promise they made at the time: to build up a profoundly European democracy. We must thank them for playing this important role in moving towards peace, stability and democracy, at a very critical time last year, as I said, and at a strategically crucial point. So we are not just the donors here, we were also the recipients, and we owe it to the Macedonians to thank them for fulfilling a crucial European mission at that time. That is why it is important to negotiate and ratify the agreement promptly, rapidly to upgrade the EU representation to official delegation status, for our Commissioner to visit Macedonia very soon, as I hear he will, and for us to open up a definite prospect of EU membership for this country, as the Swoboda report does. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was none the worse for that, but perhaps I will be forgiven for concentrating very largely on the report because there are some extremely important issues that I want to touch on.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted to be able to be able to set out the Commission's position on the report. It is very helpful. It is an excellent contribution by Mr Swoboda and his colleagues. We are very grateful for his leadership on this issue and for that of some of his colleagues, a number of whom are in the House this evening – Mrs Pack, Mr Lagendijk and others.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that at our overall relations with FYROM are in such a good state. Perhaps Mr Dupuis will forgive me for using that expression – both he and his interpreter – in the spirit of <span class="italic">entente cordiale</span>. That has been helped by our excellent European Union representative in the country. He has been a great friend to Parliament and a great servant of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The imminent commencement of negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement is the most powerful example of our good relations. So to is the cooperation of FYROM in the rebuilding of Kosovo. I am grateful to the authorities in Macedonia for their assistance in recent weeks in helping to cope with the considerable difficulties with the power supply in Kosovo. Like honourable Members I recognise the stabilising role that this country has played during the Balkan tragedy, in particular when it comes to integrating the Albanian minority into the political and social life of the country. I saw the newly-elected President Georgievski a few weeks ago and I was extremely impressed, as others have been, by his commitment to multi-ethnicity and pluralism.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me set out where matters now stand on these negotiations to which – as Mr Lagendijk said – other countries in the region are looking with very considerable interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council adopted on 24 January this year its negotiating directives for a stabilisation and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. This represents the most important step forward in the stabilisation and association process of the western Balkans region initiated by the Commission in May 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make clear the main elements of those draft directives. They cover the inclusion in the agreement of arrangements establishing a political dialogue with FYROM. They cover provisions for enhanced regional cooperation including the prospect of establishing free trade areas between the countries of the region, though I must make it clear that there is no question of any attempt to recreate the state of Yugoslavia. They cover the prospect of the establishment of a free trade area between the European Union and them within ten years of the entry into force of the agreement. They cover provisions on the movement of workers, freedom of establishment, supply of services, current payments and movement of capital. They cover a commitment by FYROM to approximate its legislation to that of the European Community, notably in key areas of the internal market; and they cover provisions on cooperation with FYROM in a wide range of fields, including justice and home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now making in the Commission the necessary preparations so that negotiations can start in March. I am due to visit FYROM in the second week in March. I hope to be able to set the process in motion then, although the formal negotiations will start very shortly thereafter. At the time of that visit I will also, as recommended by honourable Members and others, be upgrading our representation in FYROM.</p>
<p class="contents">The target date for concluding the negotiations is December this year but this will depend to a very large extent on the goodwill and determination of the negotiators. The agreement could enter into force in three to four years from now, given the time needed for ratification in Member States' parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment very briefly on a number of other points in the draft resolution. We accept that the agreement should to a certain extent serve as an example for other such agreements, although obviously we will also want to take account of the fact that we are dealing with different countries, each of which has its own identity and its own concerns. I share the wide-spread concern that we should treat each country on its merits and not shackle everyone to the pace of the slowest in the development of relations with the Union. That has never been the intention. The very fact that negotiations are beginning first with FYROM, before all the others, is evidence that we can and do differentiate.</p>
<p class="contents">On the provision of regional aid referred to in the report we agree that our technical and financial assistance should go in part to projects having a cross-border or regional dimension. We agree that there should be an evolutionary clause on the prospect of EU membership contained in the stabilisation and association agreement. It will reflect the European Union's position on its relations with the countries of the western Balkans as set out in the Cologne European Council conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">We strongly agree on the need to decentralise our assistance programmes to the maximum possible extent. As for the arrangements covering European Union assistance to the western Balkans, Members will be aware that we are drawing up a new regulation to simplify and streamline their management and to put everything under one regulation. I am aware that there is concern in FYROM and elsewhere at the end of the PHARE programme in these countries and, especially, at the loss of association with the PHARE name. I note with considerable concern what Members say on this score. I will take another look at the issue, although I should point out that having two PHARE programmes up and running risks real confusion. I want to stress, however, that whatever the programme is called, our commitment to the integration of FYROM and its neighbours into the European family is stronger than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">In general I trust that Members of this House will share my pleasure that Macedonia has reached this stage relatively rapidly. I hope that the other countries of the region will redouble their efforts to make similar progress. I look forward to many similar debates to this over the next few years marking, I hope, the success of what we are trying to do in the Balkans which, for me, remains the single most important litmus-test of what Europe is able to do on its own doorstep.</p>
