<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Evans, Robert J.E. (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, over the last few years scientific progress has transformed human organ transplants into a routine medical procedure with over a 99% success rate in western Europe. However, the serious shortage of donors means that many patients still die unnecessarily. To counter this shortage, sadly an abhorrent phenomenon has developed – the illicit trade in human organs.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several well-documented cases of EU citizens who have travelled to poorer countries in the world in search of vital remedies for their own failing health. This rise in so-called "transplant tourism", whereby rich EU citizens, rich EU patients, are purchasing organs from living donors in developing countries, is on the rise and is to me completely abhorrent.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate that anyone dying of kidney failure will be desperate. Indeed, they are themselves a victim of the current failing system. But it cannot be right or acceptable that someone with money is able to buy a better life for themselves at the expense of someone else's health. Make no mistake, while in many cases a living healthy donor may be alright after an operation, in many other cases the donor's health will be critically affected.</p>
<p class="contents">It is already illegal in 14 out of 15 EU countries for citizens to buy an organ from anyone else. So, if we outlaw it in our own countries, why can anyone think it acceptable to buy human organs from other countries? We do not permit, say, someone from the south of England to go to Scotland to purchase a kidney, nor is it legal for a Parisian to go to Marseilles for the same purpose. So why can it be acceptable for any European to go to India or Pakistan or indeed any European Union citizen to travel to Moldova or the Ukraine?</p>
<p class="contents">I know there may be considerable consensus tonight on this debate, but I also know that there are alternative views in my own country and indeed elsewhere. Furthermore, many of us have read reports in the international media suggesting that there are criminal gangs out there trafficking and murdering and even suggestions or allegations of children being bred in order to remove their organs later on. The Schengen system, which we applaud, makes it easier, however, for criminal gangs to move freely around the European Union where they can exploit the divergences between Member States' legislation. The very welcome accession of the new Member States of the European Union will make it possible to tackle cross-border issues such as trafficking more effectively. However, if the area of free movement is extended, common rules such as these are essential in order to ensure that criminal groups are not able to further exploit the differences in Member States' laws to their own benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">My report also calls on the Commission to evaluate the feasibility of a comprehensive European Union directive regulating the legal use of organs for transplant, including a database of legally available organs and the creation of an EU-wide database of patients in need of an organ transplant.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States may also wish to consider whether the current practice whereby citizens opt in to donate their organs in the event of their death should be changed to one where, unless they have opted out, their organs will be available for medical transplant. I will certainly be urging the British Government to consider this possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek proposal before us lays out common definitions of offences to be included in the scope of trafficking in human organs. It sets a minimum ten years' imprisonment for offences committed in aggravating circumstances and introduces a much needed element of extraterritoriality, whereby individuals who seek to purchase organs from third country nationals, even outside the EU, would be committing an offence under EU law.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the main aims and principles of the Greek proposal. I am suggesting, however, a few amendments. I would like to add to the title the words 'parts of organs and tissues', which removes any ambiguities. Also, adding the word 'illegal' would eliminate any suggestion that legitimate medical purposes might be adversely affected. If the title is modified to clarify that the proposal is concerned only with illegal trafficking, then reproductive and embryonic organs and tissues and blood should also be included in the scope of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I do not believe that living donors should be held criminally responsible. It is not appropriate for the EU to criminalise a donor who, in the vast majority of cases, will have been persuaded or coerced by criminal networks in the hope of escaping from extreme poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">With these remarks and the proposed amendments that I have put before you, I commend this report to colleagues and I hope that as many of you as possible will be able to support this report tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission shares the view of the rapporteur that trafficking in human organs and tissues is a serious violation of fundamental rights and in particular of human dignity and physical integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">The prevention and control of trafficking in human organs is a very complex issue, both ethically and technically, and requires careful consideration and debate. I believe that your contribution to this debate has been crucial. I would like very much to congratulate you not only for the report but also for the fact that this debate will definitely contribute to clarifying some of the key elements of this initiative taken by the Greek Government.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree in particular with three important major amendments. Firstly, the exclusion of the liability of the donor; secondly, the inclusion of a reference to intentional commission of offences; and, thirdly, that it should be made clear that financial gain also covers any comparable advantage and that certain types of payment are acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">But I would like to call you attention to the need for further reflection on two specific points. I note that it is proposed that the list of body parts excluded from the application of the initiative in the original text should be deleted. I can see that this is an issue which requires further consideration, particularly since similar exclusions apply under the Council of Europe protocol concerning transportation of organs and tissues of human origin. The exclusion of certain body parts is still under discussion, and the Commission will follow these up very carefully in the on-going discussion. I also consider that some of the wording proposed in relation to the issue of jurisdiction, particularly shared jurisdiction, might be better addressed in the context of a horizontal initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the broader context of this initiative, I note that the report calls, as the rapporteur has just said, for more action in respect of the legal use of organs for transplant, especially the shortage of organs. The Commission agrees that organ shortage is a major obstacle, and I am pleased to inform you that my colleague, David Byrne, is currently compiling information on the basis of a recent survey in respect of the current situation of organ transplantation in the Member States, acceding states and applicant countries. When complete, the Commission will be in a position to evaluate whether a further initiative is called for and to assess the legal base and scope of any such proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has addressed a very important issue, and the activities of the criminal gangs engaged in the trafficking of human organs are one of the worst examples of organised crime. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy supports the Greek initiative, and we have raised a number of additional points, the majority of which have been accepted by the lead committee. Our primary concern is to make the impacts on public health even clearer than in the proposal by the Greek Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in this context, we also see a connection with legislation which we are currently negotiating with the Commission and the Council, and which deals with the issue of quality and safety of cells and tissues. Here too, Parliament voted by a large majority to reject any trade in unmodified cells and tissues. Unlike the Commission and the Council, we believe that there is a legal basis here too so that we can discuss this issue, in part, in the codecision procedure. The committee made this very clear once again. I agree with the rapporteur and do not share the opinion of the Commissioner as regards the exceptions. We should not allow for any exceptions in this text. As a matter of principle, all types of trade in cells and tissues should be punishable by law. However, we need more precise provisions here, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy submitted a motion, which, unfortunately, the lead committee rejected. Nonetheless, we will table it on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats again tomorrow for a vote. We would like to make a clear distinction. We believe that whenever financial gain is involved, the trade in organs and unmodified cells and tissues should be banned. However, I emphasise the phrase ‘unmodified cells and tissues’, because if drugs are produced from cells and tissues, then of course the investments made by industry in these drugs have to be refinanced, and for this reason, we need to provide for the opportunity for these products to be sold. I would therefore ask you to support Amendment No 49 tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for the purposes of clarification. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In his report Mr Evans does this and adds useful points that complement those made by the Council in the initial proposal. I have however, along with my colleague Mr Liese, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, tabled supplementary amendments aimed at clarifying the text. The most important of these concerns penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">We felt it was necessary to send out the right signals both to traffickers and donors. It is for this reason that we have suggested the reinstatement of Article 2(2)(d). This paragraph states that it is a punishable offence to receive or demand money for organ removal. My committee deleted this proposal, but I feel that it should be included in the text so as to discourage unregulated organ donation whenever possible. In order to avoid penalising those who have already suffered enough through exploitive organ donation, we have suggested the insertion of a provision under which penalties may be reduced in certain circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Organised criminals should not take advantage of either naive or opportunistic people in order to create a market of unsafe and unregulated organs. It is far preferable to encourage legal and legitimate organ donation. It is for this reason that I wish to underline the importance of voluntary organ donation.</p>
<p class="contents">The underlying cause of organ trafficking is a lack of available organs. In the UK alone, 5700 people tonight are waiting for a transplant but less than 3000 transplants are carried out each year. Last year nearly 400 people died in the UK waiting for a transplant. An EU-wide crack-down on organ trafficking must go hand-in-hand with information campaigns on organ tissue and cell donation at European and national level. We should encourage European citizens to join national donor schemes and to make their wishes known to their families or their legal representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">I have carried my donor card for many years. I actively support the NHS organ donor campaign. I encourage others to support similar campaigns in their Member States. This is an area in which we really can cooperate with one another in order to achieve the most important result of all, the result of saving many lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the report drafted by Mr Evans, while supporting the basic objectives of the Greek proposal, at the same time supplements them and provides safety valves so as not to discourage donors.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that there has been a reduction in the number of transplants over recent years in the European Union. In Greece, the average waiting time for a kidney transplant is over 8 years. The biggest problem is mainly with liver and heart transplants. In this case, we know that many patients die waiting for a transplant. This situation, of course, is exploited by organised crime, which offers a way out in the form of transplant tourism and by dealing with complicated trafficking networks. It is an open secret that the biggest organ bazaars operate in India, Brazil, South Africa, China and Pakistan. Nonetheless, acute phenomena of speculation and violations of human dignity are also appearing in the European Union and in the candidate countries, where the exertion of economic pressure on financially impoverished groups contributes to the flourishing of illegal and repugnant action by dark networks.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, serious account also needs to be taken of the repercussions on public health, as the relevant amendment points out. I also agree with the amendment by the European Parliament that trafficking also affects citizens' rights to equal access to health services and undermines confidence in the legal transplant system. Without doubt, we need a common stand at European Union level on the approximation of criminal legislation, which varies from one Member State to another, strict sanctions and international cooperation to combat the repulsive phenomenon of trafficking in human organs.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, we need to develop action at the level of informing and raising the awareness of the public. There would certainly be no illegal trade in human organs if more citizens were willing to donate organs and tissues after their death. That is why information campaigns are needed at national and European level in a bid to persuade people to become donors and to make their wishes known to their families and close ones well in advance. The issuing of a Community directive will create the appropriate legal framework in order to put the problem of thousands of people on waiting lists for organs on a new basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is an important initiative of the Greek Presidency, as has been stated by various fellow MEPs. A shortage of donors lies at the heart of the problem. In my country, for example, there has for twenty years been a shortage of organ donors. Moreover, not every donor is suitable. A donor should, in most cases, be brain-dead, but their heart must still be beating. As a result, many donors do not qualify. For a long time, road victims were, and still are, a source of donors, but the numbers are decreasing, which only exacerbates the problem. This should never lead to the illegal trade in human organs. It is too dreadful for words to be faced with the trafficking of human beings, including women and children, with the intention of removing their organs. These are invariably poor and powerless people from poor countries, but also from China and India. Some have their organs removed in the hope of a better existence, and others are simply taken advantage of. It is a good thing that this will be regulated. In this context, it is actually a disgrace that the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine of 1997, which entered into force in 1999, has to date been ratified only by Denmark, Spain and Portugal. My country should take this to heart.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is of the opinion that it is only by adopting a coordinated and tailored approach to the illegal trade in organs that human dignity can be protected. We therefore hope that this proposal will contribute to this. It is for these reasons that we support the proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In future, the transplantation of cells, for example, will play an ever more important role in regular medicine. The transplantation of adult stem cells is a case in point.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, two aspects which the European Union should regulate in this framework. The first is the guarantee of quality and safety of donation and transplantation, and the second is the prevention of trade in organs, tissues and cells. The former is currently being dealt with in the Liese report, the latter in the report we are discussing today, which, to put it briefly, receives our unqualified support. It is good that these immoral practices are being tackled. It is good that the report asks for extra attention for the encouragement of voluntary donation. We cannot follow the report in one area: we think that – as is, in fact, mentioned in the Greek initiative – the offering and accepting of money for organs, tissues or cells should also be punishable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
