<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Keppelhoff-Wiechert (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to thank the Commission for this generally very positive proposal on additives for use in animal nutrition, which I welcome in principle. I would also like to thank the Danish Presidency and my colleagues on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal aims to consolidate existing rules on additives in feedingstuffs and clarifies certain procedural aspects related to dossier evaluation and the types of authorisation granted to feed additives, thus making them more transparent for producers and consumers alike.</p>
<p class="contents">An aspect of fundamental political significance in this proposal is the ban from 2006 on the four antibiotic growth promoters that are still authorised. This is not an arbitrary ban, but is based on reports by the Scientific Food Committee, and is consistent with the demands repeatedly voiced publicly by medical experts. As cross-resistance to drugs used in human medicine can also no longer be ruled out, there is a need for action in order to protect consumers. In this regard, pressure must be brought to bear by granting temporary authorisation only so that other methods, such as appropriate vaccines, are developed.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, I am in favour of the Commission's proposal. I too think it is inappropriate, on the antibiotic issue, to give what amounts to a blank cheque for unrestricted use of coccidiostats in the future. It is not plausible to ban antibiotics on health policy grounds if these health policy arguments then do not apply to the use of coccidiostats.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as the committee responsible, wants coccidiostats and histomonostats to continue to be authorised for use until 2008. The Commission should then submit a report, before 1 January 2008, on the use of these substances, together with a proposal on further use. Where, then, are the points of difference? First of all, Amendment No 2 regulates imports from third countries of additives for use in animal nutrition, and states that the rules governing imports must at least be as strict, in terms of application and monitoring, as those which the same Member States apply in order to safeguard human and animal health<span class="italic">. </span>In Amendments Nos 4, 7 and 9, I speak out very clearly in favour of guidelines for the authorisation of feed additives. I call on the Commission, in cooperation with the European Food Safety Authority, to establish and submit guidelines for the authorisation of feed additives. In its vote, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development clearly endorsed the adoption of guidelines in the interests of simplifying the authorisation of additives. Once an additive has been authorised, it is surely sufficient for the relevant dossier to be regularly updated, rather than being subject to a full review every time.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is calling for mixtures and premixtures containing flavouring and appetite stimulants to be exempt from the labelling requirement. It is stated explicitly that this will not apply to flavouring and appetite stimulants subject to a quantitative limitation when used in feed and drinking water.</p>
<p class="contents">There are of course now calls in this House for the use of coccidiostats to be permitted only when prescribed by veterinary surgeons. I myself take the view – and I speak from experience – that we must have preventive healthcare for animals as well. Some form of animal protection is required, and it is obvious that an animal which is already sick needs to be treated with far higher doses, so my own practical experience makes it difficult for me to understand the reasoning behind these calls. As regards the ban from 2006 on the four antibiotic growth promoters, I would like to say to Commissioner Byrne that my Amendment No 31 offers a sensible compromise here.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to reiterate my sincere thanks to everyone who worked so hard on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This underlines the importance that Parliament attaches to the sensitive issue of animal nutrition in relation to human and animal health.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like in particular to thank and congratulate Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for her hard work on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue is also a high priority for the Danish Presidency of the Council. I hope, therefore, that we can make rapid progress to show the outside world how important the EU considers human and animal health issues to be.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal represents a major streamlining of the current rules on safety evaluation and marketing authorisations for feed additives.</p>
<p class="contents">This overhaul is both timely and welcome. The current legislation has been revised over one hundred times. The new rules will be much simpler and clearer.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have a clear and transparent authorisation procedure. The European Food Safety Authority will be the first port of call and will be in charge of evaluating all feed additives.</p>
<p class="contents">In future, the validity of authorisations will be limited to ten years. The new system also includes an in-built review and re-evaluation process so as to allow new scientific information to be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Companies will be required to demonstrate the positive effect on the animal and the absence of any risk to human or animal health or the environment when applying for authorisation or re-authorisation of a feed additive.</p>
<p class="contents">Wherever required for the sake of public health, the European Food Safety Authority will propose to the Commission maximum residue limits to be laid down in legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, only four antibiotics are authorised for use in animal feed as growth promoters. The EU has already phased out the use in feedingstuffs of all antibiotics that are used in both human and veterinary medicine, in order to avoid cross-resistance.</p>
<p class="contents">The four antibiotics in question are not used for any human antibiotic drugs. The Commission announced its intention to phase out these remaining antibiotics in feedingstuffs in the White Paper on Food Safety. This reflected scientific advice that the use of antibiotics as growth promoters is undesirable for human and animal health, owing to concerns about increased resistance of diseases to treatment with antibiotics.</p>
<p class="contents">The Scientific Steering Committee has also recommended the progressive replacement of the remaining four antibiotics by non-antimicrobial alternative products. The Commission proposes to withdraw the authorisations for these four antibiotics on 1 January 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to coccidiostats – substances used to prevent coccidia infections – the proposal contains stricter rules for their authorisation and placing on the market. The reason for this is that hygiene precautions and improved husbandry practices are not sufficient to keep poultry free from such diseases. However, in order to ensure the safety of these substances, I propose that current authorisations be reviewed within four years of the entry into force of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">These are some of the major issues that Parliament has considered. I hope and expect that we will be able to reach constructive solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I will address the various amendments proposed by Parliament at the end of this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to be sure of how we are going to deal with these additives, especially in poultry. You do not find out that a chicken contains coccidiostats until it is dead and by then it is too late. The welfare problems of actually handling chicken also have to be considered. We need to be able to sort out this problem and look at it very practically.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very concerned in Europe that consumers should be protected, and rightly so, but what is the Commission going to do to protect European consumers from imports of poultry that have probably been fed growth promoters? Millions of chickens are imported from China and Thailand. The problem is that the poultry meat cannot be tested for growth promoters or, if it is, some time may have elapsed and the meat can no longer be tested for it. It will be impossible to determine whether growth promoters have been fed to the chickens, and so chicken producers in Europe will be at a complete economic disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">This will not protect consumers in Europe, because the meat will still be imported. We will find that European consumers are consuming meat from poultry produced in China and Thailand containing substances banned in Europe. I would like to ask Commissioner Byrne how he is going to stop this problem arising. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kindermann (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of animal nutrition has become something of a regular feature on this House's agenda. Over recent years, we have played a very successful part in shaping EU legislation on animal feedingstuffs. Let me remind you of some examples: the open declaration of feed ingredients, the establishment of a positive list, and the new regulations on the production and use of meal made from meat. Today, we are embarking on a new round which focusses on feed additives. The Group of the Party of European Socialists supports much of what the rapporteur has just mentioned, such as the ban on antibiotics, etc. She has done sterling work, and has been receptive to many of our proposals. I would like to express my sincere thanks to her for that. Overall, then, we are pleased with the report which was voted on in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two point which should be corrected, however, and which I would like to explain as follows. Coccidiostats and histomonostats should not be authorised for use as feed additives; instead, they should be authorised, in the long term, as veterinary medicinal drugs. We must be consistent here. If we impose a general ban on antibiotics in animal nutrition, we cannot immediately make an exception for one product category. This cannot be justified to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards coccidiostats, these must be subject to controlled use as prescribed by a veterinary surgeon who is familiar with the situation in the farm concerned and can respond appropriately. Otherwise, the general preventive use of these products, which are also antibiotics, could conceal possible hygiene problems on the farms. I strenuously refute any accusations that I am trying to generate a new source of income for veterinary surgeons. We have tabled amendments on this issue, and I would ask you to support them.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to the duration of authorisation. We support authorisation for an unlimited period, provided that this does not impact on product safety. A re-evaluation of the additives should therefore be carried out every ten years, taking account of new scientific information and research data. This ensures reliability for the applicant, on the one hand, and animal and consumer safety, on the other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The major issue in this report is a ban on the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in agricultural production. I ardently support the ban. In certain EU countries this has already been done voluntarily. The long-term use of antibiotics has serious adverse effects when microbes develop into mutations that are disease-resistant.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has drawn up a very balanced report, as I have already said. There are, however, different views in our group also. What should our attitude be towards coccidiostats as a remedy against parasites for use with poultry? It would be wrong if their use were not regulated at all and they remained a ‘grey area’. The aim must be to abandon the use of coccidiostats, but that cannot be done at once as they cannot yet be replaced by vaccination. A certain period of transition is therefore required. I enthusiastically support the rapporteur’s proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It puts right an unacceptable situation. It is clearly not a complete solution, but is a step in the right direction as it proposes a ban on the use of antibiotics as additives in animal feed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that in addition to killing bacteria that cause infectious diseases, antibiotics have another property discovered long ago. In the 1940s, it was found that antibiotics improve the capacity of animals to convert their food, so increasing the rate of growth of the animal. This means that when battery chickens receive antibiotics in their feed, they can reach a weight of 2.3 kilograms in seven weeks. At seven weeks, chickens who consume antibiotics in their feed are ready for slaughter, whereas those which do not, weigh barely one kilogram. It actually takes twice as long for these chickens to reach slaughter weight. The economic incentive for using antibiotics as a feed additive is obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">The practice of adding antibiotics in lower than therapeutic doses to the feed of farm animals became widespread with the development of intensive farming. This use was officially justified by the fact that, as well as resulting in faster growth, antibiotics protect animals from infectious diseases. It must be understood that the conditions in which animals are reared play an important role in the spread of infectious diseases. The practice was legalised in 1970 by Directive 70/524 EEC which at the time authorised the use of thirteen antibiotics as additives. We have however been aware of a potentially harmful consequence of the over–use of antibiotics since the 1950s. The over–use of antibiotics can produce resistant bacteria which render the antibiotic concerned ineffective.</p>
<p class="contents">Further work over the years confirmed these findings. I recall that in 1985 the Swedish Parliament voted to ban the use of antibiotics as feed additives for this very reason, in other words, 17 years before the Commission’s proposal! Even though it is unfortunate that we have waited so long, we must welcome the fact that the Commission has now decided to intervene on this issue. I agree with Mr Kindermann that we must also ban the use of coccidiostats as feed additives and only permit their use as medicines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This proposal is one of the measures provided for in the Commission's White Paper on Food Safety. I welcome it and largely agree with the assessment and authorisation procedures it proposes. The current directive has been amended five times since 1970 and has never been consolidated. It is a complex and very un-user-friendly piece of legislation regulation at the moment. In the current climate, it is right that we should do what we are proposing now.</p>
<p class="contents">We are amending or reviewing this directive in parallel with the veterinary medicines directive and they are related. However, I would caution against moving too quickly from a food additive definition to a veterinary medicine definition until alternatives have been put in place and we are ready to cope with them.</p>
<p class="contents">I, like others, have concerns about proper controls on third-country imports. There is one way to ensure peace of mind, not only for our farmers and poultry producers but also for consumers, and that is to increase the resources of the Food and Veterinary Office so that it can keep the situation under surveillance. To go to Taiwan, Hong Kong or South America once every five years is not sufficient and nobody is fooled by this any longer. This issue has come up under the Temporary Committee on Foot-and-Mouth Disease review. It is a major issue, along with exotic diseases and imports of diseases and problems. If we want to ensure that the regulations are there to create a level playing field within the EU, we have to see to it that our inspectors have sufficient resources to be able to meet our expectations. I would like the Commissioner to address that particular point.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much I welcome in this report and I would like to thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner again. Let us hasten slowly and be sure we have replacements, rather than moving at a pace which will drive people into veterinary medicines, away from their current practices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I always feel that reports of this kind are safe in her hands. I can broadly support the Commission’s proposal. From time to time there has to be a review of all the additives in animal feed. I think that this is entirely in keeping with the White Paper on Food Safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the ban on antibiotics in general in the year 2005. The ban on their prophylactic use can be supported. I have rather more problems with coccidiostatics, because, if we were to ban them too, what then is the alternative? I am told that if you were to do that, the next treatment of animals with antibiotics would have far more damaging consequences in general than if we were to leave things as they are. I can consent to this being evaluated as well and that we look at what must happen on the basis of the outcome. I would like to reiterate what Mr Peres had to say: we are imposing very strict demands on European farmers. How can we ensure that the same demands are imposed on farmers elsewhere in the world who want to sell to us, in order to prevent unfair competition? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In general terms, let me say that the debate about guidelines for a re-evaluation of additives should be viewed positively. In particular, additives which are authorised for an unlimited period and which the report describes as harmless would no longer be available for use in animal production if a complex and cost-intensive authorisation procedure were introduced. We have already seen this happen with a wide range of drugs after re-authorisation was required. Re-evaluation, rather than re-authorisation, may therefore prevent a thinning-out of the product range.</p>
<p class="contents">The key issue in all aspects of food safety legislation, however, is the principle of traceability and transparency, as well as risk assessment. There must also be genuine openness for us as consumers, and also for producers. If an additive proves to constitute a risk, its use must continue to be ruled out.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me stress that I am in favour of a central agency. In my view, the European Food Safety Authority would be the most suitable body to carry out this evaluation of additives. I also welcome a simplified authorisation procedure for additives which are already permitted in foods.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me touch on one further point, namely imports from third countries. The same stringent rules must apply to imports of meat and animal products from third countries as those which apply in the European Community. For us farmers, this is vitally important.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the Commission to submit a report to us on the use of antibiotic growth promoters by the end of 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Allow me to explain my position on the major points of this proposal and in particular the differences which in some cases still remain between our institutions. Concerning the date for the phasing out of antibiotics, I am happy to note that the Commission's approach has your broad support. But there are some slight differences concerning the date of withdrawal of authorisations. The scientific advice on which this risk management measure is taken mentions the need for a transitional period to allow for animal rearing practices to adapt and also for the development of alternative antibiotics.</p>
<p class="contents">For these practical reasons, I cannot accept the amendment which envisages the phasing out of antibiotics from 1 January 2005, despite my recognition of Parliament's desire to get rid of antibiotics in animal nutrition as soon as possible. I agree with that sentiment but would add that this should be in accordance with scientific opinion and should take account of possible effects on animal health and welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the external dimension of the phasing out process, let me clarify my position. This has been raised by a number of people, including Mr Parish and Mrs Doyle.</p>
<p class="contents">The prohibition of antibiotics will also apply to feed imports. With respect to the imports of food of animal origin, the residues testing system currently in place will be used to check for the use of banned substances. This testing system protects human health, since it is designed to reveal residues of medicines, additives and substances in food at levels that present an unacceptable risk to the consumer. It is not sufficient to verify whether forbidden substances were used in the feeding of animals in third countries, as the residues of such substances may not be present at the time of importation. I welcome any suggestion that may be made to increase the resources of the FVO and particularly welcome that observation from a member of the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the control of imported products and the condition of equivalency between EU rules and third country rules on the rearing of animals should be considered under horizontal legislation. The Commission will propose a regulation on feed and food controls that will impose rules on this issue. That proposal will take account of your concerns. The draft legislation we are discussing today aims only – and I stress only – to lay down rules for the authorisation of safe additives.</p>
<p class="contents">On the time limit of the authorisations, I repeat what I said in my introductory statement: I cannot accept anything other than time-limited authorisations for all feed additives.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the status of coccidiostats, I am aware that some take the view that coccidiostats should only be authorised as veterinary medicinal drugs and not as feed additives. I refer to the point made by Mr Kindermann in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">My position is that the rules imposed by this proposal will ensure that coccidiostats are used in a safe manner, respecting human and animal health.</p>
<p class="contents">Precipitate action, not allowing enough time for the authorisation of the same kind of substances as veterinary drugs, or the setting of a cut-off date without prior assessment, would have disastrous consequences for animal production, animal health and animal welfare. I am pleased that a number of you agreed with that proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I am willing for a report to be drawn up on this matter, but I cannot agree to a cut-off date for the authorisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the introduction of flexibility in the authorisation procedure, some amendments improve the Commission's proposal as they take account of the needs of minor species and non-food producing animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The setting of specific conditions for data protection when applying for authorisations for minor species is another welcome amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept these amendments. However, it is necessary to recognise the impossibility of making special rules for all types of additives and for all animal categories.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like again to thank the rapporteur and Members of Parliament for broadly supporting the policy initiated by the Commission which protects public health while taking proper account of animal health, animal welfare and agricultural production needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament's Secretariat is being provided with a full list of the Commission’s position on each of the amendments. I trust that this will be included in the record for this sitting<a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
