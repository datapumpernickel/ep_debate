<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Markov (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Lemierre, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by welcoming Mr Lemierre and his colleagues to the European Parliament, and take this opportunity to express my warm thanks to you and the Bank's staff for the extraordinarily positive cooperation which we were able to establish during the preparation of this report. The EBRD responded to me with great openness and willingness to cooperate, thus making my work on this report both interesting and informative. I was able to hold numerous discussions with representatives of the Bank as well as with project agencies from various countries, which gave me a detailed picture of the Bank's operations, its problems and successes, but also, and to a minor extent, its failures.</p>
<p class="contents">The EBRD is unique among development banks in having a political mandate. According to this mandate, its purpose is to foster the transition towards open market–oriented economies and to promote private and entrepreneurial initiative in the Central and Eastern European countries and CIS states committed to the principles of multiparty democracy, pluralism and market economics. It is also part of the Bank's political mandate to promote, across the full range of its activities, environmentally sound and sustainable development. In my view, political guidelines governing the activities of other development banks would be desirable as well. Having scrutinised its operations, we can attest that the EBRD performs well in fulfilling its current mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">In selecting the projects to be funded, the EBRD prefers to be involved in small and medium-sized projects rather than promoting large-scale prestige projects. It shows great willingness to take risks through its commitment to projects which other banks deem too risky, but it does not systematically seek the security of state guarantees. A key focus of its activities is developing small and medium-sized businesses. The EBRD's micro-financing projects deserve particular mention in this context. Yet its high willingness to take risks does not take place at the expense of sound business management, as is borne out by the fact that it has always received the highest rating (triple A) from international rating agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">In my capacity as rapporteur, I would like to make a number of recommendations to the Bank, notwithstanding the positive assessment of its work overall. Although its activities focus primarily on the transitional promotion of private and public enterprise, its operations undoubtedly have macroeconomic effects. For this reason, an analysis of its operations should include economic data, which has not been the case to date. I am thinking especially of factors such as trends in employment, wages and salaries, productivity, company turnover, and so on. This will allow comparisons to be drawn between regions where the EBRD operates and regions where it does not operate, so that the influence of EBRD activities on macroeconomic development can be assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it should also be a stated aim of the EBRD's operations to achieve synergy effects. Pursuing an integrated approach designed to help entire value–added chains in a region can contribute to promoting regional economic and social flows, thus facilitating sustainable development, which – as already mentioned – is one of the tasks defined in the Bank's mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also, in my view, important to encourage the Bank to tailor its policies to local circumstances. Each country in which it operates has taken different decisions on its economic structures throughout the transformation process, especially as regards the division between the public and private sectors. The Bank therefore should not attempt to operate in the same way in every country. It would be a misinterpretation of the Bank's political mandate, were it to set itself up as the herald of ultra-liberalism and set itself the sole goal of promoting privatisation and uncontrolled liberalisation. It does not do so, but I want to point out that this risk must be controlled from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">My report is a first for the European Parliament, since it is the first time that the operations of the EBRD have been subject to scrutiny and assessment by this House. This closes a gap which marked the EBRD out from other banks, such as the EIB, which has been subject to assessment by the EP for years. In future, a report on the EBRD will be presented to the European Parliament every two years. I think that with this own-initiative report, the foundation stone has been laid for positive and continuous cooperation between the Bank and the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes Mira,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I should first like to congratulate Mr Markov on his report on the activities of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, the report gives an accurate account of the nature of the Bank’s mandate and activities by identifying three features peculiar to it alone. Firstly, the Bank has both a political and an economic mandate. Secondly, it has implemented a policy of conditionality. In particular, this has affected the Bank’s involvement in environmental issues, as Mr Markov mentioned. Lastly, there is the commitment to both the additionality and profitability of the funds made available. This requires the Bank to take on risks private operators would decline.</p>
<p class="contents">The pragmatic approach the EBRD brings to the interpretation of its mandate also features prominently in the report. This pragmatism has allowed the Bank to resolve a number of potential contradictions by adapting its political and economic framework to suit the stage of economic, cultural and social development attained by each country. It has also made it possible for the Bank to reassess its operational priorities and gradually build the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises or local financial institutions into these priorities. In addition, support for strategic international investors has been enhanced.</p>
<p class="contents">This same pragmatic approach has enabled the Bank, with the support of its shareholders, to adjust some of the limits to its mandate. For instance, within its general strategy, more importance is now attached to reform of the regulatory framework and to how efficiently it is implemented by local administrations and judicial authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Markov’s report also rightly suggests placing additional emphasis on certain aspects of this pragmatic approach. One instance is more careful consideration of the social and political aspects of restructuring the productive sector. Another example is the reference to a more active role in the sustainable development of the energy sector. A further example is the reference to strengthening the Bank’s operations at municipal level.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to say a few words about the relationship between the Union and the Bank. First, this is an entirely innovative relationship at the institutional level, since the EBRD is the only international institution of which the European Commission is a shareholder. This is particularly evident in the Board of Governors. The Member States and the Union’s institutions together represent a majority when a vote is to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation between the Community and the Bank is another significant feature, and has developed considerably. I believe it is now extremely close, and takes many different forms. In particular, cooperation was strengthened through the Bank’s active involvement in the pre-accession strategy. A network of working relationships between the services of the Commission and the Bank in now firmly established. This has resulted in a significant increase in that part of the Community budget devoted to supporting or cofinancing the Bank’s projects. In the early 1990s it was estimated that this contribution amounted to approximately EUR 40 million. In recent years, however, it has increased to an average annual sum of EUR 300 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, from the point of view of political priorities, cooperation with the Bank is indeed cause for satisfaction. It has allowed us to draw on two fundamental assets for which we are indebted to the Bank, or to make use of them so as to enhance European policies. The first of these is the Bank’s competence in the region. This is due to its extensive knowledge of the current situation in the countries in question. The second is the Bank’s practice of conditionality, which has often made it possible for the Bank’s involvement to serve to promote compliance with European standards. This has been the case with regard to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should simply like to emphasise that on the basis of these findings, it appears that the relationship between the Union and the Bank is bound to become even closer in all countries. Clearly, there is scope for further development of the Bank’s activities in Russia, in other CIS States, and in the Balkans. It would also appear that there is scope for further involvement in the candidate countries following accession. In this connection, we endorse the view expressed in Mr Markov’s report. We certainly believe it would be wise to continue active cooperation with the EBRD following enlargement, whilst also working with the obvious partner, namely the European Investment Bank. This will enable us to continue to benefit from the EBRD’s experience after enlargement. It goes without saying that the degree of cooperation and the time periods involved will depend on the EBRD’s capacity to respond to the actual needs identified in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you have said, this is a first and it is very important for the institution that I have the honour to chair.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me to four brief and simple comments, since the report by Mr Markov and the proposals from Mr Solbes Mira have enlightened Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The first comment relates to the institution itself. The EBRD is an novel institution, first of all because it is recent and young; it has achieved some successes; it has also endured some failures and is always trying to learn. It is an institution in which the European states and the European Union have a large majority among the countries that operate the bank and many non-European countries – the United Sates, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Egypt, Israel and Turkey, among others. We are talking about an institution in which Europe plays a most essential role with many partners. What is the basic element binding them? I think that there are two types.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all there is a very firm commitment to ensuring transition in the East. That is a commitment for everyone. We saw this when our strategy was updated for the coming years, with the commitment made by the non-Europeans to support the transition process in the future throughout the region, including in Central Europe. The second element is the principles, which were recalled by Mr Markov: joint financing with the private sector, the capacity to take risks in order to encourage the private sector to move the market economy forward, and at the same time not competing with the private sector. These principles of additionality, conditionality and impact on transition are the real foundations of the institution. I must also mention a third dimension, which Mr Markov referred to just now, which is its political dimension. The EBRD has a political mandate. We are charged with ensuring the progression of the market economy, but also of democracy, which leads us, following internal debates in the Board of Directors, the conclusions of which are made public, to take decisions such as reducing and almost halting our contributions in countries such as Belarus and Turkmenistan.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns experience acquired and strategy, as Mr Markov described. Currently, the bank is achieving high levels of assistance. Last year, we invested EUR 3.9 billion, which is the bank’s highest level of assistance. Over a period of around ten years, we have helped to attract EUR 70 to 80 billion of investment to the East, which represents an extremely high proportion of the flow of investment in the East. We are also implementing the strategy adopted by the Bank’s shareholders, which is development towards the East.</p>
<p class="contents">We are maintaining a strong commitment in Central Europe. For obvious reasons, you are aware of the situation in Central Europe, and I had the opportunity to discuss it at length with Commissioner Solbes Mira; there is a considerable need for investment and, in particular, budgetary pressure can only be reduced through a high volume of investment. This is, of course, very important to the EBRD, as it is focused on priority objectives such as financing SMEs, financing medium-sized enterprises, industrial restructuring and regional development. We do of course largely consider ourselves as an agency for implementing projects for the Commission and the European Union, and we are currently developing our activities in the South East – the Balkans, the Caucasus, Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria, and particularly in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment regarding strategy concerns the importance we attach to the development of small enterprises, micro-enterprises and SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">This was an unknown concept in the East ten years ago and today we are seeing it develop. We are implementing it, I must stress, in particular thanks to the support of our shareholders and of the European Union, who play a most essential role. We act as a lever for implementing these measures and we ensure that we work with the banking sector to improve its competence by training bankers to develop these techniques. If we are not able to do that, we create our own institutions, in order to ensure that the development takes place within the necessary timescale.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, we are developing our efforts in terms of relations with all businesses in the East and in Japan. Why? First of all because it is taxpayers’ money that is involved and these companies have, through you, invested in the EBRD, so naturally we should at least inform them of what we might do with the Bank. In particular we are currently developing contacts with businesses, not only large businesses but also medium-sized businesses, in Europe, because we think that medium-sized enterprises in Europe could have an extremely significant role to play in the development of the economies of the East.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, when we work with large enterprises, we look at the structuring effect on the Eastern economies, and particularly on sub-contracting, the development of small enterprises through large enterprises. I think that the best example that I can give is the development of enterprises in the automobile sector, which attracts sub-contractors and enables the development of local sub-contractors.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is that we are currently doing a great deal to develop work with local enterprises, because we consider it to be absolutely essential; this is progressing all over Central Europe, obviously, but also in Russia and Central Asia. In the same way, we are starting to develop funding for municipalities and we plan to develop funding for municipalities in local currency, even if we take on the monetary risk ourselves, due to the development of the financial markets, so that local communities do not have to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth comment is concerning the proposals and comments made by your rapporteur. I would simply like to say that I share them. We agree, we take them on board and we will try to translate them into reality. I would just like to make two specific comments. First of all regarding the social dimension, always a key concern of the EBRD which, while being an institution designed to promote the market economy, considers that social cohesion is an important point. We pay particular attention to employment issues, and also, more specifically, to charging policies. Improving the quality of life of the population, drinking water, transport and municipal services as a whole are part of charging policies. You are aware that the Eastern countries are not used to charging policies. Implementing sound, sustainable charging policies is therefore absolutely necessary, and they must be acceptable to the population. From this point of view, I must thank the European Union for the contribution that it has given us, particularly through Community funds enabling the initial cost of projects to be reduced so that charging policies can be put in place that are acceptable to the populations and can maintain quality of service and of investment.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns the environment. The environment is at the heart of the institution’s mandate. There is a great deal to be done. There is a considerable legacy from the past in the Eastern countries, and I will just mention a particular dimension of our work, which is nuclear decommissioning, on which we are doing a lot of work with the European Union. We manage EUR 1.5 billion in funds allocated to nuclear cleaning-up projects in the countries that are soon going to join the European Union and others that are a little further off. We see this as a fundamental activity.</p>
<p class="contents">My last comment concerns relations with the European Union. The European Union is our great partner and our great support, particularly through your contribution, Mr Solbes. Mr Solbes is our governor and monitors us closely with the required level of firmness. We work with the services of the European Union and of all the Member States openly and under excellent conditions. As you said, Mr Solbes, not only do we receive political support, which is essential to us, but also financial support, and that role is currently being extended.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second partner is the EIB, which is an important partner for us. We welcome the necessary increase in its contributions, particularly to acceding countries. I work a great deal with Philippe Maystadt and we have a close relationship. You are aware that the EIB is a shareholder of the EBRD, like the Commission and the European Union. We therefore have a close, trusting relationship; our aim is certainly not to be redundant but to ensure that we complement each other as necessary. To be brief, I can simply bear witness to the fact that the quality of the relations that I personally have with Philippe Maystadt and with the EIB are the best guarantee for European taxpayers of the quality of use of the funds that are made available to the two institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry that my speech was a little long. I felt that it was useful, on the occasion of this first examination of the situation of the EBRD in the European Parliament, to make these few introductory comments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His speech gave us a feeling that there is a combination of idealism, and also very considerable practicality, in the way they approach their job.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate Mr Markov on his report. He has devoted much care, conscientious effort and good sense to assessing the role and performance of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. His comments are measured and are a positive contribution to the EBRD's future.</p>
<p class="contents">I recently read in the press the title 'The little-known EBRD'. Perhaps relative to its early days it is quite pleased to have that sobriquet, but if that is indeed the case, it is time that the EBRD became a lot better known. Perhaps this exposure in Parliament will help in that direction. This is the first time, as has already been said, that Parliament has reported on the bank, even though the majority of its capital and votes are held by EU Member States and EU institutions, even though it has played, and continues to play, a vital role in helping many of the accession states to develop their economies and political institutions to the standards which their people seek, and which will permit them a smooth entrance into the European Union family.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not all. The EBRD is also making a critical contribution to the countries which will border the enlarged European Union. It is of considerable interest that last November the EBRD announced a new strategy for its Russian operations which will extend its work into the regions of Russia, away from Moscow and St Petersburg, and help diversify the Russian economy so that it is no longer over-dependent on natural resources. The EBRD is the largest single foreign investor in Russia, and Russia is the largest country in its portfolio.</p>
<p class="contents">Also of concern to us in the European Union is the work done by the bank in Yugoslavia, and the former republics of Yugoslavia and the Balkans. It is critical to the peace and security of our continent that these countries be assisted to reach a state of economic and political stability from which they too can advance to membership of the European Union in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">In its objectives the EBRD is unique for such an institution, in that it not only aims to provide for economic progress, but also has a very specific duty to help its client countries develop a democratic culture and the necessary democratic institutions and procedures. The monitoring and measurement of its success must therefore take into account how far it has achieved its aims, both economic and democratic. It is difficult to be other than impressed by the EBRD's track record.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE-DE Group will be supporting Mr Markov's report as it stands. We will vote against all but two of the amendments which have been tabled, as they do nothing to enhance the report. The exceptions concern the newly launched public information policy, which we welcome. We will therefore support Amendments 2 and 4, which also welcome and encourage a more open and transparent approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Hopefully, the next time Parliament drafts a report on the EBRD, it will be to welcome the continuing success of a well-known and widely esteemed institution. I wish the EBRD, its President, Mr Lemierre, its staff and its clients continuing success in 2003 and in the longer-term future. Their success is vitally important to us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berès (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, President of the EBRD, I welcome the fact that for the first time in your presence, Parliament is examining a report on the EBRD, whose work, reputation and credibility have clearly been consolidated under your presidency. I would also like to thank our rapporteur, as he has shown how seriously Parliament has examined the work of the EBRD. Along with the rapporteur, we have co-signed two amendments which I hope Parliament will be able to adopt in order to further improve on the work of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of the EBRD deserves to be commended by Parliament, as it is an institution that is both original and exemplary. It is original because of the principles that drive it: support for the transition process, additionality, sound banking principles. I think that it shows exemplary qualities that we could be guided by in several other areas. It also has the capacity to combine economic and political criteria: another important element. You are neither a European bank nor an extension of the World Bank and nevertheless you have close links with us. There is also the capacity to take risks, to evolve in an unstable environment and to provide funding for essential projects, including during times of crisis, as you demonstrated during the Russian crisis. Finally, there is the capacity to constantly promote the activity of SMEs, which are particularly important to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to specifically highlight two points in Mr Markov’s report. The first point is that, although the EBRD is not an institution of the European Union and as it has a very specific relationship with it, we think it is important to be able to take advantage of this instrument in order to promote the principles and strategy that the European Union took on in Lisbon and Gothenburg outside of the Union, particularly in order to continue to promote employment, social policy, the environment, innovation and the knowledge-based economy to help sustainable development. My second point is the subject of the amendments which I hope will be adopted by Parliament. Their aim is to further increase the importance of the criterion of employment and taking trade unions into account when evaluating co-financing projects, even though I am aware that this is already the case. The EBRD should not advocate economic liberalism, it should also promote democratic and social values: you are not built on the model of the IMF.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress the importance, within the activities of the EBRD, of the contributions that you can make to the fight against corruption and promoting good practice; stressing the need to refuse to get involved with funding structures and individuals whose source of finance is questionable. You said that this led you to halt your work in Belarus. As you are aware, such practices exist elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to highlight the future of the EBRD, as although ten countries that you work in are going to join us from 1 May 2004, the transition period is far from completed and we still largely need assistance from the EBRD in order to facilitate transition funding in those countries, so that they can play a full role in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmidt, Olle (ELDR).</span></span>   <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lemierre, may I begin by congratulating Mr Markov on a sterling report. The EBRD has been, and will be, of great importance to the development of former Communist Europe. For many of the countries, the door is now open to membership of the EU. This is obviously the best way for them to secure a better social and economic future. There are, however, still many countries that are, and will be, outside the EU’s internal market. If the gulfs between countries and peoples are not to increase further, the EBRD’s efforts are perhaps needed now more than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not easy to transform Communist planned economies that have sucked the life out of societies and people and introduce a market economy philosophy. We can now see the huge costs for the former GDR. I am particularly pleased that the Markov report emphasises free competition and the opportunities provided by the market and highlights, for example, the great importance of small companies to an affluent society.</p>
<p class="contents">We Liberals have especially wanted to emphasise a matter also addressed by Mr Purvis, to the effect that the EBRD must step up its efforts in the EU’s new border countries, for example in Moldova and Ukraine. Obviously, this must also be done in Russia where the trend is, in spite of everything, in the right direction. That the former Soviet empire and its inhabitants should acquire a more secure economic foundation is, of course, of the greatest interest to us within the EU in terms of economics, security policy and also straightforward politics. That is apparent from an interesting article in today’s <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>,<span class="italic"> </span>quoting Mr Lemierre.</p>
<p class="contents">We also proposed more emphasis on projects that support democratic development. When it comes to Belarus, which is perhaps the worst remnant of the old Soviet period and which is without democracy, the EBRD should seek cooperation partners within non-governmental organisations. Human rights must always be guaranteed. It is therefore good that the EBRD should freeze assets and investments when human rights are threatened. Mr Purvis mentioned the Balkans and Serbia. There too, I believe that the EBRD’s efforts are especially important in a situation in which democracy is very shaky and needs support.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe it is important to emphasise that the EBRD should be managed in a professional and efficient way. The way in which it is organised must therefore be continually monitored, and unnecessary and costly bureaucracy prevented. We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party support Amendments Nos 2 and 4, just as Mr Purvis does, but also parts of Amendment No 5.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to conclude by saying that a number of the amendments concern the development of nuclear power. This is, in my opinion, a source of energy that is clean and reduces the increasing greenhouse effect. It reduces the risks of climate change if it is safe and properly managed. I wonder therefore what the Greens have against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can also welcome the political agreement of the French and German governments, which was crucial to completing the project. Now we have a great regional development bank and today we congratulate Mr Lemierre and the Bank’s staff. I am entirely in agreement with my colleague and friend Mr Markov, and will just raise some questions for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, should the original political objective not be renewed? For the CIS countries, this objective is still to promote transition to a market economy. However, in the case of the countries involved in enlargement, the transition is well underway and in some cases completed, and for them the objective is now catching up, development and cohesion, so that they can be fully integrated.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Bank does not operate as an ordinary commercial bank. It gives priority to SMEs, helps local banks, takes on responsibilities in terms of nuclear safety, takes risks, in short, it serves the public interest. Should these specific qualities not be consolidated at a time when the Union is working on a funding system focused on the internal market? Are there not risks of contradiction there? It is true that the Bank has a triple A rating, but that is linked to budgetary support, which we must guarantee. Are there not also problems in terms of achieving a balance between profit-making and loss-making projects? Finally, how can we consolidate the way that it complements public aid and the EIB?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, does the EBRD not have a particular role to play in order to promote social responsibility among companies and market operators? Its principle of additional funding is very good and provides it with a lever with which to encourage public/private partnerships.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the EBRD can make a genuine contribution to establishing good governance of the public institutions of the countries concerned, in particular by seeking to involve civil society and the needs of the populations. Could it not begin to evaluate that experience by country and group of countries and put its ideas for the future to us? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not the task of parliamentarians to pay tribute to banks' investment successes but to check whether this Bank, which is funded from the public purse, complies with the political rules in force in the European Union, namely the rules of transparency, the rules of sustainable development, and the rules of environmental compatibility. It is our task to demand that it does so.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to my points of criticism. Point 1: the support for investment in the BP pipeline for oil exploitation in the Caspian Sea. This, as everyone knows, is not necessarily intended to end hostilities in this region and bring peace. On the contrary, more than one million people have become refugees here over the last ten years. Admittedly, this is not an accusation that can be levelled at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development itself, but the Bank does have a commitment to political principles. The fact is that this project will not produce a peace agreement, but will simply let the conflict in the region simmer on. In effect, that means that the European Union will benefit substantially from the production of oil, but for local people, it will not create the desired peace or prosperity. It is also unclear who bears the risk in the event of accidents. There are certainly no opportunities for local economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">Transparency, too, must also be improved, especially transparency for the population.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is supporting dubious nuclear projects in Rovno and Khmelnitsky. We know that the European Parliament has spoken out against this, because it is not convinced that these reactors can be made safe. We also know that they are being built solely to supply cheap electricity to Western Europe, not to resolve the problems in Ukraine. This House has therefore opposed any such investment. I would therefore like to ask the President how, in that case, the Development Bank has still transferred EUR two billion to EURATOM to make these projects possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Markov report paints a very positive picture, particularly, of course, since it refers to the last few years. This is, in many ways, understandable, but in the past, even the recent past – with the Russian crisis and so on – problems have emerged that have led to unsatisfactory or even downright disastrous results, as in the case I have just mentioned of the Russian crisis, which affected the EBRD as well as many other international financial institutions. This is probably due to one of the major contradictions that exist in the EBRD’s institutional activities: the fact that it promotes market economics using a non-market instrument, that is a loan guaranteed by public funds, having the possibility – also mentioned in the Markov report – of taking risks that other institutions would not take.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me on to a rather sensitive aspect of the EBRD’s activity – an aspect of which the institutions’ top echelons are aware, as I well know – which is the risk that EBRD funding may squeeze out private risk capital and the development of endogenous credit in these countries. It is a difficult balance to strike, and one which I believe should be given careful attention. It is important not to let EBRD intervention end up penalising the growth of a private credit sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Two more points before I close: I think that attention should be focused more and more in future on neighbouring countries and less and less on the countries joining the European Union, precisely because the risk of squeezing out a nascent private market economy in these countries is greater. Lastly, I turn to the European Union as the majority EBRD shareholder. We invest in the Ukraine, for instance, through the EBRD. This is admirable, but we are giving with one hand and taking away with the other through trade restrictions which weigh very heavily on a country like the Ukraine. Our two hands need to work in harmony. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The balance-sheet is impressive. We are pleased that the balance-sheet which you have delivered today gives no cause for criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I endorse your priorities. Despite your specific role, I think it is very important, as you have said, that the Bank is also an agency for the implementation of the Commission's priorities, as well as for cooperation with the Commission and the Parliament. We must not spread ourselves too thinly. We must set priorities in order to be able to fulfil our political and economic responsibilities in the world – for the Member States, the accession countries, and the surrounding countries. We cannot adopt divergent priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the following points are important. I hope that next time round, you will also report on the impact of your operations in the transformation countries, since it enhances awareness of the Bank's strengths if we have not only a balance-sheet but also information about the macroeconomic effects of its activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I think it is important to continue and intensify your work on boosting small and medium-sized enterprises. We are all aware of the key role played by SMEs in creating and consolidating training places and jobs. Our expectation is that you will increase this commitment, especially by strengthening the focus on equity investment for SMEs and supporting the development of an SME infrastructure. I would simply point out that in Russia, only 10% of the workforce is employed in SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also very important that in a week when we have spoken a great deal about the Lisbon process, you are keeping the Lisbon strategy in mind when evaluating projects and enterprises and making this one of your criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, of course, we need a priority headed ‘accession countries’. However, EU enlargement will not be complete in 2004. The issue of the Balkans – i.e. the former Yugoslavia – is important for the European Union, as is the establishment of a security belt, and economic development on the European Union's borders is integral to this process.</p>

As the European Parliament, we attempted this from the outset during the Bank's start-up phase, and I must say it has not always been a success story; the Bank has also been through some very difficult times. Even in Parliament, opinions were divided as to whether we should indeed still have our own bank. This too must play a part in today's debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lemierre, you have described the Bank's task as being a ‘classical’ general interest service which, however, makes use of private-sector intervention instruments. This is undoubtedly an apt description and we must test its activities to determine to what extent this is actually being realised. You are undoubtedly in a difficult position because the development of the private sector, as an outcome of successful transformation processes in the states where you operate, fails above all because there is no fully functioning financial sector, which means that the financial conditions for business start-ups and operations are very difficult. For this reason, I welcome the fact that you have concentrated 30% of your resources on this sector. I also recognise that your activities in the promotion of small and medium-sized businesses are important to a functioning market economy and to the development of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what is also important is to see how stability can be achieved in these countries. How can we facilitate economic growth through investment? That is an issue which constantly occupies our minds in the European Union as well. In my view, it is especially important that you can take risks which others cannot take, and that this willingness to take risks does not conflict with sound and reliable management. This is reflected in the high rating the Bank has received from rating agencies. The Bank is unique among multilateral development banks in having a political mandate. Its task is to contribute to a social market economy, democracy, pluralism and the rule of law. In this context, you should focus even more strongly on ensuring respect for human rights and democratic principles. You should deny support, to an even greater extent than before, to states and companies which engage in unfair practices and in which there is corruption and mismanagement. This should also apply to failure to comply with the objectives of environmentally sound, socially compatible and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The EBRD is still operational in Central and Eastern Europe. These states' accession to the EU will open up many investment opportunities, which will not be available to other states. For this reason, it is worth considering whether the current division of responsibilities between the EBRD, the EIB and the World Bank should be reviewed, including in geographical terms, despite their clear mandates, for the future success of the transformations in the former CIS republics will contribute not only to economic and political stability in these countries, but will also have an impact on the European Union and other regions of the world. The transformation processes in all countries require further joint efforts and financial support, and this includes the accession countries as well. However, it is the most underdeveloped countries that pose the greatest risk of instability. In my view, Mr President, this is a fresh challenge for the EBRD! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been successful at investing – in nuclear safety, for example – in the candidate countries and in the former Soviet republics. As the President said, the Bank has done a great job of improving nuclear safety in these countries. That is also something for which there is certainly a need. The fact is that all these nuclear power stations are veritable time bombs. Think of the Chernobyl disaster. Safety is so appalling, it is a disgrace that all these power stations were not closed down long ago. The Bank is responsible for the fund to be used for decommissioning the Ignalina power station in Lithuania. It is a nuclear power station I have visited quite a few times, and safety is so poor there that, following these visits, I am glad that I shall not be having any more children.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Copenhagen Summit, Lithuania promised to shut down Ignalina in 2009. There is really something for the Bank to do in this connection. A proposal has just been put forward for an investment package that would put some order into the method used for storing nuclear waste. The present situation is completely unacceptable. It is a huge mess and, in the longer term, extremely dangerous. I would therefore call for the package to be adopted as quickly as possible. In the future, we should take a brief look at how the Bank’s funds are monitored. I should like to call upon the Bank’s president to post something on its web site in this connection. With regard to the Bank’s accounts, it should be noted that these are not audited by any external firm of auditors. There is apparently no independent institution that scrutinises the Bank’s activities. The Court of Auditors has not prepared a report for years. The Bank has an evaluation unit that carries out some quite excellent evaluations, but what is missing is an external audit. I should therefore like to hear the Commission say what it does to monitor the funds, and I should also like to hear the Bank’s president say whether the Bank is more willing to open its doors to external audits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The choice of economic activities must combine the local dimension with the international and requires a supply of credit not only to encourage the emergence of initiatives that are well established within a country but also to help them spread to other markets. It is certainly the job of the EBRD to do this, but it is even more important to try to do it in countries with little industrial development, which have a greater need for support and revitalisation. If, in order to achieve this objective, it needs to take risks and, in some cases, accept unexpected losses, it must not then cut out initiatives and planned investments but rather benefit from new experiences so that it can manage lending more attentively and read the risks more carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">This bank takes an ethical approach to credit management. Its institutional commitment is to invest in any country that is inspired by democratic principles and determined to promote a market economy. The first time, the bank asks clients for valid projects, with current market prices; it also requires that there should be no conflicts of interest or dominant positions in the operational area to be financed, and that the interests of the local community should always be respected. In the public sector, the EBRD calls for the greatest transparency to be employed in order to ensure competition and equal treatment for the market players. We welcome and support the rapporteur’s views when he urges the EBRD to support small local banks, which, in turn, should focus on small–scale lending.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, Mr President, allow me to sound an alarm: small bank lending is disappearing or is being considerably cut back. This is a matter for concern, because no economic or financial manoeuvre, however good it may be, could replace the support that small banks have always offered to small and medium–sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also note that small–scale lending in many Member States and particularly the accession states is being thoroughly neglected; that leads to a daily increase in financial exclusion, which is the existence of serious gaps in the supply of small–scale credit services in the countries with the weakest economies, where a form of discrimination based on geographical criteria arises: red–lining. It is up to the EBRD, which has already chosen to operate in countries such as Albania, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Moldova, to help to integrate these disadvantaged economies fully into the international economic order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, this Bank came into being as a result of the fall of the Berlin Wall and its primary aim is to assist the economies of Eastern European countries, which have since opened up to international competition, to overcome the natural difficulties arising from their embryonic development.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is not officially a Community institution, the Bank embodies the entire philosophy of action that characterises the EU’s cohesion and development policies. The forthcoming enlargement of the Union to encompass a significant number of countries from the East will deepen and highlight the importance of the financial and technical aid that the Bank has provided and granted to the candidate countries in the pre-accession phase. The EBRD’s actions must not, however, be cannibalised or cancelled out by the tasks determined and defined for the European Investment Bank. What is needed instead is for these two financial institutions to coordinate and collaborate whilst respecting their autonomy and their different origins, despite the very close financial relationship they enjoy. This should not, incidentally, be too difficult, given that many of their aims are common, as are the characteristics of the economic actors to which this aid must be directed.</p>
<p class="contents">The recommendations contained in this report, which are aimed at increasing financial and technical aid for small and medium-sized businesses and at prioritising the implementation of financial resources within partnerships, especially in the form of venture capital, and the call for an ongoing commitment to train staff in the bank which can help them better to perform their duties, are extremely positive aspects. The European Parliament should, therefore, support the main conclusions offered by Mr Markov, who is responsible for this own–initiative report. It is also significant that this debate is taking place in the presence of the President of the EBRD, to whom, ultimately, these recommendations are also addressed and on whose abilities the Bank’s success and policies largely depend. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lemierre,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the EBRD</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, I will be very brief and will just make three comments. The first is in response to Mr Blak. Not only am I prepared for increased transparency, but I must also say that we are monitored by external auditors and that, of course, the results are made public. We are not content with self–examination. We seek an outside opinion, we have auditors, their opinions are made public and our accounts are published every year.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, the Bank’s Board of Directors is particularly vigilant about its accounts and maintains a dialogue with the external auditors. I can also tell you that following various debates regarding certain private companies and the debates on the roles of auditors, we have tightened our rules and, I think, adopted the best practices in that area. In particular we have divided the responsibilities properly between the auditors and consultants and improved the discussion between the specialist Committee within the Board of Directors responsible for the accounts and the external auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment is addressed to Mrs Schröder. I think that the examples that were given, which concern two projects that pose extraordinary problems but also have positive aspects, about which the Bank has not yet made a decision, demonstrate quite well what the Bank can seek to contribute: more transparency, more impact on the population and, ultimately, a decision that must be made by the board of directors. Once again, the decisions have not been made and I have noted the comments. I would like to say that this is probably one of the measures that the Bank can operate: more nuclear safety, greater impact on the population, greater transparency, fighting corruption within projects. I think that it is absolutely necessary, and it is also the price of public intervention and what it should achieve if it is determined.</p>
<p class="contents">My third comment will simply be that I have listened to all of the speeches with a great deal of interest. I think that these speeches clearly reflect the depth and strength of the institution’s mandate, but also the challenges inherent in it. Several of you have spoken, fundamentally, about the historical mandate and whether it is up to date. My feeling is that it is entirely relevant today: it is very up to date, as long as it is kept going, and your comments will help us to further achieve this. That leads me on to a point that is very important to us, the dialogue with all of the governments and authorities in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">We are engaged in high–level political dialogue in each of the states in region. There is one challenge that I think is quite essential: applying the rule of law, not so much in expressing its legal regulations (fortunately) but rather in implementing them; improving the legal system and its operation in all the countries in the region remains an absolutely essential challenge. This leads me to recall a few of the EBRD’s convictions, which it has acquired over ten years of experience, that the market economy cannot work without democracy, that the market economy cannot work without social cohesion, that there cannot be social cohesion without a strong civil society and that there cannot be strong civil society without transparency and fighting corruption. These are the messages that we are of course regularly developing at political level, when we assess the situations of the various states with regard to Article 1 of the institution’s mandate, but also in the dialogue that we maintain.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to offer Mr Markov and each of you my own most sincere thanks and those of the institution for your comments. They will encourage us to be even more determined in implementing the mandate that we have and to come and explain to Mr Markov and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in two years time, how we have progressed.</p>
