<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, I am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of outlining to Parliament the main lines of the Commission's White Paper on food safety, adopted on Wednesday last, 12 January, in association with my colleague, Mr Liikanen.</p>
<p class="contents">At my hearing last September, I promised speedy delivery of this White Paper. I am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly. The White Paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new Commission was appointed last September. It takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the Commission's Green Paper on food law was published. Equally it reflects our experiences of recent food alerts in such areas as dioxin and sludge, as well as the BSE crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper also reflects the concerns of this Parliament which you have outlined to both President Prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this House since the Commission was appointed.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in Europe's food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and alerts of recent years and months. The Commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world. When I launched the White Paper last week I said that the shopping trolley is one of the most potent weapons on the face of the earth. The most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of Europe. If their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions. This in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers, producers and industry generally.</p>
<p class="contents">In an industry worth some EUR 600 billion annually, even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects. Between the agro-food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees. High levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">This crisis of confidence has also had the unfortunate but inevitable effect of eroding the trust of consumers in the systems and institutions at national and European level that should monitor and assure the highest standards of food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">In saying all of this, I would like to make it clear that Europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the safest food control systems. The challenge is to make the system the very best.</p>
<p class="contents">The overall objective therefore of the White Paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food. We are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change. The Commission will need the full support of Parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule. We will also need the fullest support from the Council and other key stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper on food safety outlines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernise existing EU food legislation. All of these measures are designed to make it more coherent, understandable and flexible. We want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The detailed action plan on food safety in the White Paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years. Over 80 measures are envisaged. Our objective is to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also envisaging the establishment of a European food authority by 2002 as an essential complement to the new food safety regime. This idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate. It has already attracted much comment, including reactions from Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The chapter of the White Paper devoted to the establishment of a European food authority is clearly designed to elicit views and comments. We are seeking views by the end of April on what we envisage. I will return to this process of consultation in a few moments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objectives of assuring the highest standard of food safety and restoring consumer confidence. Why should a European food authority be an essential part of that structure of change? The first key concern is independence. Key stakeholders, including consumers, are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also ensure excellence and transparency. We have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the BSE crisis. However, the Commission believes that we must go further. We must create a permanent and truly independent, excellent and transparent system of risk assessment. The key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety. We envisage that the work of the existing five Scientific Committees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority. They may not be transferred in their present form or structure – this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority's establishment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs, this would clearly not be enough. As the White Paper makes clear, the new authority must be a value-added structure.</p>
<p class="contents">I am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened. Within the authority I envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists. I am also envisaging that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime – anticipate rather than react, identify issues before they become crises. This proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority. To be proactive the White Paper identifies a number of new areas that would be embraced by the authority. These include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function, the coordination of scientific information in the EU, and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in Member States. As part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority. We believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the Commission, Parliament and Council. I make no apology for this approach; I firmly believe that it is the correct one. Certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law-making powers to such an authority. I do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion.</p>
<p class="contents">It was only last year that the Treaty was amended to give Parliament a much greater role in the legislative process. To give such a role to an authority at this stage would be, in my view, a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability. I will be very interested to hear the views of Parliament itself in relation to this matter. There are also those who argue that the Commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority. I also reject this line of argument. How could a Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety? Would this be in the interests of Europe's citizens? In my view, most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were soundly based, rationally argued and fully justified. It seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you here today that the Commission, in exercising its risk management functions, will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority. I have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the Member States. This is a major task.</p>
<p class="contents">We must develop greater certainty in the science that underpins food safety in the European Union. The authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues. This situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science. However, with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies, the authority will become pre-eminent on the European stage. I am also anxious to hear the views of Parliament in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">As an integral part of a value-added structure, the White Paper proposes that the authority would have a major role in risk communication: to disseminate complex scientific information in a consumer-friendly way; to be the obvious and indispensable port of call for the most up-to-the-minute data on risk; to be highly visible; to tell the good news story about food; to be proactive.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls. This is a hugely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that Member States and operators are complying with Community legislation. I want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena. In this context we are also proposing to strengthen significantly the control function carried out by the food and veterinary office located in Dublin.</p>
<p class="contents">This revised Community framework would have three core elements: operational criteria set up at Community level, Community control guidelines, and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control. As part of our proposals in this area – which I expect to bring forward at the end of this year – I will be examining whether additional powers in addition to infringement procedures need to be given to the Commission. These could include withholding Community financial support or recouping funding already committed to a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world, boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the proposals for a new European food authority and an enhanced control system at Community-level, the White Paper proposes an action plan with a wide range of measures to improve and bring coherence to the Community's legislation, covering all aspects of food products from farm to table.</p>
<p class="contents">It sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation. The new legal framework will cover animal feed, animal health and welfare, hygiene, contaminants and residues, novel food, additives, flavourings, packaging and irradiation. It will include a proposal on general food law which will embody the principles of food safety such as responsibility of feed manufacturers, farmers and food operators, traceability of feed, food and ingredients, proper risk analysis through, for instance, risk assessment – that is, scientific advice and information analysis – risk management – that is, regulation and control – risk communication, and application of the precautionary principle if and when appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the precautionary principle, I might add that the Commission is currently finalising a communication which I expect to be adopted very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the Members of Parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available. However, having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees, I recognise that this was not feasible. But I know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the White Paper's proposals on the authority. We now have a number of months to have the necessary debate on the Commission's ideas on the White Paper on the establishment of a European food authority. Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate. Parliament played a crucial role in Europe's response to the BSE crisis. It has especially active since then in bringing citizens' concerns about food safety issues to the fore. I expect that Parliament's contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive.</p>
<p class="contents">While we have a number of months to the end of April to debate the issue and garner our views, I recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe. I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible. It is essential that the Commission should have the benefit of Parliament's contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raising consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restoring consumer confidence in the European Union's food safety regime.</p>
<p class="contents">The European food authority will be a key ingredient in the EU's food safety regime in the years ahead. It is essential that we get the mix right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is very much the right approach. But there is one word that I have not heard you mention here tonight. I hope that we can thrash this out. We need a body of food law, as you have said, and we need to agree this together. It is very important that we include liability in that process. That is the one word I am talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong. That cannot continue. When we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem, those responsible are liable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think the lines that you have set up regarding the Food Safety Authority are a recognition of reality. The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency, so there is not very much point in your proposing one.</p>
<p class="contents">Some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs. However, as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years, I have to ask: if Europe has the safest food control system, as you have said, why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives? Secondly, will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from Brussels and under-implementation in the Member States? We look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding enlargement: what plans does the Commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws, given that the Commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the White Paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I find that encouraging and I look forward to further discussions with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issues that they raised. Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability. That of course is not specifically addressed in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions – and there are already some – relating to the issue of traceability. Once that is done, issues such as liability can be addressed. I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background, but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved. But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list. That is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation, and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material. At the moment the list is, as I say, a negative list and it is added to as required. The establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it, 2002 in fact.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation. Rapid alert is there for food but not for feed. This is unfortunate and it is wrong, and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done. The work in relation to BSE in Member States and the establishment of random testing to identify levels of infectivity in Member States is ongoing, I know that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has asked me this question before and I said I thought it was coming along quickly but I understand it is in inter-service consultation in the Commission and work is currently under way. I hope that the next time you ask me the question, I will be in a position to give you more detailed information.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over-regulation. I should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation. It is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation, although that is part of it, but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind. Standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that I have drawn to the attention of Mr Verheugen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather, publish and coordinate data, make recommendations for improved food safety, and – as you said – collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers. All this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union. I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to that, the food safety authority will have a board. You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board. This is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months.</p>
<p class="contents">I envisage that the board's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders. Its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September. We have not done that yet but it will be done in September. I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work. That would erode the independence of the scientific advice. But it would have an overall remit, particularly, for instance, in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that. That is an issue for consideration and discussion. There may be a number of views on that. Some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament – or indeed Parliament nominees – to be members of the board. Others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if Parliament, through nominees or even MEPs themselves, were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated. It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Florenz also raised the question of anonymity. I am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile. It must be visible. It must be known. Consumers in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority. The CEO of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known, who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food, particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition, diet and such issues, so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority. They will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncements from the authority. It is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous. It must be visible. I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth. I suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in Member States begin and end. There would have to be an interaction at scientific level. Quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for, or advising, the food safety authority at Community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at Member State level. That is an undesirable situation, we do not want that situation in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence – lack of information is one. But information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern. We must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists, that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at Community level has the opportunity and is mandated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all Member States and indeed maybe even beyond, where experts are to be found elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Over time, as I said a moment ago, not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise, its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation can be achieved over a period of time. You cannot legislate for consumer confidence. It is something that is earned over a period of time. However, the Commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the Authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the Commission, Parliament and Council. I realise that this is a somewhat time-consuming exercise but, nonetheless, the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the Authority is – I believe – the way forward. Any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way. One of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance. I hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to grants and subsidies: yes, consideration has been given to that issue. It will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought, particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with Community law pending a court ruling.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Mrs Lynne's question on interim payments: that is a matter that might very well be addressed by Parliament as it relates to budget issues. Mrs Myller then asked me about the location of the Authority. No decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the Authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery. I recognise that the FEO is located in Dublin and, although I come from that part of the world myself, I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe! But the FVO is in quite a different situation from the Food Safety Authority. The FVO is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport – quite clearly we have an airport in Dublin.</p>
<p class="contents">The Food Safety Authority's situation is quite different. It has to be close to the Commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the Food Safety Authority and those of us who are involved in the initiation of legislation. An important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean, what problems they have identified, what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise. Equally, the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process, to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located. Scientists will be employed in-house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on a consultative basis and, in those circumstances, as scientists will have to travel, it is probably better that they move to a central location, once again where the parliamentary structures and the Commission and Council are based. That is my judgement at the moment. It may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this Authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
