Despite the fact that the Commission's proposal was adopted in April 2003, I know that the work in Parliament only began last autumn and therefore I want to congratulate Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for her hard work on this report in such a short period of time. The absence of clear, enforceable rules for feed hygiene is one of the final major 'missing links' to complete our 'farm to fork' food safety approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall briefly refer to three main points of the proposal. First, it provided for the compulsory registration of all feed business establishments by the competent authorities within the Member States. Secondly, it aimed to raise hygiene standards through the introduction of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points – HACCP – principles for feed business operators at all levels other than that of primary production. The proposal also envisaged that feed business operators would provide financial guarantees to cover business-related risks such as the costs arising from withdrawing products from the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that there has been close cooperation between Parliament, Council and Commission to seek a workable compromise with a view to reaching a first reading agreement in relation to this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Keppelhoff-Wiechert (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur on the subject of feedingstuffs and hygiene, I closely followed the debate in two committees, not only in the lead committee – the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but also in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is advising it, and I would like to tell the House that, as rapporteur on feed hygiene, I basically welcome the Commission’s efforts to further improve food safety in the EU across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">From farm to table, the criteria for the production of our food should be very clearly defined. Quite apart from the harm to food, the food scandals over recent years – BSE, dioxin or nitrophene, for example – cost the European taxpayer a very great deal of money in terms of products recalled. That is why I very much welcome the fact that – as Commissioner Byrne has said – the cost of recalls will not, under the Regulation as submitted, be borne by the European Budget as a whole, but, and far more stringently, by the feed business operator, that it is to say the tax payers do not have to pay but the wrongdoers themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">That, I believe, is a reason why the regulation has to very precisely define what a ‘feed business operator’ is. I do not think there is any contention about the need for the requirement to take out insurance not to be imposed on farmers who produce cereals or other primary feedingstuffs. The recipients in the feed manufacturing industry are already able to analyse and categorise the barley, rye, maize, and so on with which they are supplied. On the basis of what I am constantly being told, I believe that the smallest growers of feedingstuffs, whether this be for supply to others or to feed their own farm animals, should be exempted from this Regulation, which would, however, come into effect if additives were to be mixed in, be it by the farmer himself, by the feed manufacturer, or by a mobile mill that comes to farms for that purpose. It cannot be acceptable for rules to be made, for the purpose of precautionary insurance cover, some of which it is in fact impossible to comply with. I still believe that what we demand politically should not ignore the realities of life, and that applies in particular to threshold values for undesirable substances when compounded, or transferred, and so on, which are increasingly based on what is analytically feasible. Let me reiterate that you have lost touch with the protection of health if you go about finding a lump of sugar in Lake Constance.</p>
<p class="contents">To an increasing extent, threshold values are being determined by reference to what modern analysis can do rather than to the potential risk, and we should concentrate on the actual danger posed to the consumers. Insurance companies have made it clear to a hearing with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that, in the absence of any clear definition of what is meant by ‘risk’, the costs involved in financial guarantees would become quite incalculable, and they would find it very difficult to estimate them. My appeal to the producers is that they should start with voluntary insurance. That is why, Commissioner, I, as rapporteur, have called in Article 8 for a feasibility study on binding and non-binding guarantees, and if we get one in 12 months’ time, then I am sure we will be able to look further ahead. This feasibility study should not only examine the national regulations currently in force, and the systems and practices relating to liability in the feed sector and similar areas at the national level, but should also set out recommendations for such a feasible and practicable guarantee system at EU level. So let me say once again, that we should demand politically only those things that are practically feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take this opportunity to extend warm thanks to all the Members of this House who have joined us in doing serious and constructive work on this topic, particularly, too, the representatives of the Commission, with whom we had really good discussions, and the Irish Presidency of the Council for its good cooperation and especially for its very realistic assessment of what is and is not feasible. I am on tenterhooks to see what happens next, and whether we will indeed be able to come to an agreement following first reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all recognise the need for feed to be safe. If animal feed is safe, then consumers feel safe when eating animal products.</p>
<p class="contents">While we recognise the need to be able to identify and isolate all those producers and feed businesses involved in the food production chain, I believe this should be done without adding another tier of registration. We recognise the need for a complete identification of all feed business operators, including farms, by adapting existing regulation systems in order to enable the competent authorities to inspect operators. However, national regulation systems which are already in place and functioning for other purposes should be utilised wherever possible to avoid unnecessary duplication and regulation. Currently, the majority of farms can be identified through their participation in these schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Commission's proposals whereby feed businesses, except those involved solely in primary production, will be required to adopt the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points principles. HACCP is a method of identifying potential hazards and ensuring that proper control strategies are in place, and I welcome that.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert mentioned, the area of most serious concern in the Commission's proposals is the use of financial guarantees. All feed businesses, including farms, would need to fulfil a new requirement of having financial guarantees in place to cover the cost of withdrawn products in the event of a feed safety incident. This would be restricted to the withdrawal, treatment and possible destruction of products. Having consulted with the farming industry, feed manufacturers and the insurance sector, we find that the consequences of introducing financial guarantees have not been sufficiently analysed. The feasibility of financial guarantees or insurance policies has not been properly developed with the industry and it is unclear whether such guarantees would be available from the insurance sector. The cost implications for feed manufacturers and farmers from such a guarantee scheme are also unclear. Therefore, we would like the Commission to look at this in more detail before bringing this in.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are very concerned that feed coming in from outside the European Union also meets these very strict criteria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A mass meeting of the railway workers who have recently been dismissed is taking place outside, and that was where I was.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry that we were unable to reach a full compromise agreement on the central issue here – the only one which I have time to address. Like Mr Parish, I have listened to, and paid reasonable attention to, the fears that we have not really made a market or tested out a market in terms of the provision of insurance. Nevertheless, I believe that at the last meeting of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, with reasonable compromises on both sides, we arrived at a position where a 12-month study could lead – and I believe will lead – to a proper assessment of how insurance provision is made. I know that pushes the Commission further than in an ideal world it would like to go. However, given that the vast majority of Member States and the Council take this view or a stronger one in terms of the proposals, if we are to achieve any kind of agreement at first reading here there has to be an indication – perhaps there already has been – that we will follow that line.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not personally in favour of a system that shifts to one of voluntarism on an ad hoc basis state by state, nor is my Group. We know all our lessons from the history of food problems. The provision of food and feed over the years since we first began to introduce a general food and feed law suggests that we need to have measures that apply right across the Community. It is no good saying that anyone can opt out of those measures. I hope the rapporteur will see that after a proper study and a reasonable length of time – and to me that means 12 months – we will arrive at that position. I hope, for its part, the Commission can also accept that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Based on the excellent work done and the informal trialogue between Parliament, Council and Commission, there is, I hope, sufficient agreement between the three institutions to reach resolution in first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand the view expressed in the House in favour of financial guarantees. However, I have also to take into account the view of the Council, where there is a qualified majority in favour of deleting the provision on guarantees. It is clear to me that if first reading agreement is to be reached, this House will need to support the amendment to delete the guarantees in line with the compromise proposed. The Commission could then come forward with a report on all aspects of the situation. This would enable full consultation of all economic actors and stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that a very persuasive factor is the fact that the insurance industry across the Community, including the enlarged Community, is not ready for mandatory financial guarantees across the board. There is little point in legislating if we cannot be assured of effective compliance. So I would strongly urge the House to support the amendment in relation to guarantees; otherwise a golden opportunity for first reading agreement will be lost.</p>
<p class="contents">Based on the compromise reached, I understand that the rapporteur has tabled amendments which the Commission can accept and thereby facilitate closure in first reading.</p>
