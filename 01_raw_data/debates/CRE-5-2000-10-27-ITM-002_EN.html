<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wieland (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has been unexpectedly called away and has asked me to stand in for her. I therefore only had a short time to prepare to present the position of the Committee on Legal Affairs. What is at issue here? It is not in fact language teachers. Many will perhaps say that the issue is far too detailed and far too complicated. But it is not about language teachers; it is all about an example, in this case about a citizens' Europe. It is about a story that was first brought before the European Court of Justice in 1989. An almost 12-year old story full of false hopes, stalling tactics, hopes and personal need, about placatory measures for those involved and tough defence of old rights against citizens seeking no more than their due. Let us name names, to coin a phrase: it is about the case of the Union citizens Allué and Coonan versus the University of Venice, it is about the case of the Union citizen Allué again versus the University of Venice and it is about the case of the Union citizen David Petri versus the University of Verona.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Court of Justice returned a clear verdict. The European Court of Justice handed down three judgements vindicating these citizens who, before the first of these judgments, were employed to lecture in Italian universities as <span class="italic">lettori</span>. The tenet of these judgments is unequivocal: the rights of the persons affected to the free movement of labour and the right not to be discriminated against on grounds of nationality had been violated in that Italy did not offer the <span class="italic">lettori </span>the same terms of employment and job security as Italian nationals lecturing at a similar level in universities.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, nothing was settled after the first judgement. The amendments made to the law in its wake in 1995 are still unable to guarantee full protection of the rights of <span class="italic">lettori </span>lecturing in universities. In the end even the ombudsman backed these citizens. I am not sure if this play on words works in the other languages. In German we say, “having a right is one thing, being allowed to exercise it is another”. The Committee on Legal Affairs has formulated a clear position here and thrown its weight behind the Union citizens whose rights have been restricted.</p>
<p class="contents">Now a number of proposed amendments have been tabled which, to put it mildly, I find somewhat irritating. I only intend to refer to two examples which are an attempt to improve or, in one case, to reverse Parliament's position at the eleventh hour: the original recital H proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs reads: “Whereas the persons affected, who are Union citizens, have suffered losses, stress and uncertainty over this period of several years, as the result of being involved in protracted and repetitive litigation in hundreds of court proceedings over 12 years and have had their legitimate expectation of being able to exercise their profession with reasonable career prospects has been dashed”. Now an amendment has been tabled, proposed Amendment No 8, which deletes a few words and adds a few, thereby not only watering down but almost reversing the meaning. The text would then read: “Whereas the persons affected, who are Union citizens, have been involved in protracted and repetitive litigation and have seen their legitimate expectations dashed.” It is not only in German that this makes a clear difference.</p>
<p class="contents">But now to what is, in my view, a much more serious process. Proposed Amendment No 9 suggests that “Whereas the Italian government takes the view that it has fully satisfied its obligations vis-à-vis the <span class="italic">lettori </span>pursuant to Law 236/95, which complies with the principles of the Treaty”. Apart from the fact that this was not discussed in the Committee on Legal Affairs, we would be maintaining here that the legal basis in Italian law corresponds to the principles of the Treaty and yet the Court of Justice said exactly the opposite! I consider this action to be dubious. If we take the view that these practices are legally acceptable and politically desirable then, as legislators, we should go ahead and change the principles, but if this is an attempt to use Parliament to conceal a position, then all I have to say is that the PPE wants no part of it! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Busquin,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the case of non-Italian foreign language assistants in Italian universities is well known in the Commission and in most European institutions. This affair has been ongoing for more than a decade and, as a result of intervention on the part of the European institutions, in particular the Commission, the situation of the assistants has improved.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the issue is very complex and concerns some seven hundred people working in more than 25 Italian universities. Throughout this decade, the Commission has worked assiduously to resolve the problem of foreign language assistants in Italy in respect of the free movement of workers, which is guaranteed by the Treaty. As you have highlighted, the Court of Justice has already delivered three judgments concerning language assistants and, with the case pending in Luxembourg, the Commission has taken action aimed at further improving the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">More particularly, following the decisions of the Court of Justice of 1989 and 1993 – the Allué case – which ruled that the limitations on the duration of employment contracts of foreign-language assistants imposed by the Italian government were discriminatory, the Commission took a number of steps. It initiated an infringement procedure, which was dropped in 1995 following an Italian law bringing the legislation into line with the Court ruling.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the language assistants' subsequent claims concerning their acquired rights, the Commission launched another infringement procedure on the grounds that, in a certain number of Italian universities, the assistants' acquired rights were not being duly safeguarded. In fact, the Commission mobilised a lot of its resources in order to examine this case. In fact, the services of the Commission put together hundreds of pages of documentation on specific cases in a number of universities. We exchanged a great deal of correspondence with the players concerned and went to a great deal of trouble to select from among piles of irrelevant documents the elements that proved conclusively that the former <span class="italic">lettori</span> had in fact been the victims of discrimination by certain Italian universities in respect of their financial acquired rights such as salaries and contributions to pension schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">In July 1999, the Commission brought this infringement procedure before the Court of Justice. It is now waiting for the Court to rule on this new infringement and on this new procedure, which was initiated by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The assistants not only invoked the lack of protection of their acquired rights, they also deplored the new legal system set up by the Italian legislation of 1995. They believed that the Italian state should have integrated them into the category of members of the academic teaching staff or, failing that, it should have created a specific category for them among the teaching staff. In the opinion of the assistants, this right would follow directly from the right of workers to free movement. On this point, however, the Commission was not in agreement with the assistants.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our view that freedom of movement enables European citizens not to be the victims of discrimination under national systems of law. It does not give them the right to a special legal status. Each Member State is fully within its right to establish the provisions governing its own public service. Community legislation cannot prevent Italy from amending the provisions governing the status of former <span class="italic">lettori</span> and from transforming them into linguistic experts with partially different attributions. If the Italian legal system is reformed and modified, as it was in respect of academic teaching staff, we do not think that the Commission can intervene given that every European citizen has equal access to all categories of professions. Indeed, any European citizen may become a permanent member of the teaching body by taking part in the appropriate <span class="italic">concorso</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the matter is a legal one, we should proceed along legal avenues and the Court should pass judgment; those who need to appeal should appeal and those who demand justice must have it. If the matter is of a political nature – and therefore a matter for Parliament – it is a pity that we do not approach matters of this kind with due caution. I fully appreciate the Commission's position and, indeed, as Parliament, we must be very careful. I am not defending my government out of solidarity – it is not my government, I belong to an opposition party – but I am trying to clarify the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">We make every endeavour to ensure that the citizens enjoy the same rights in all the States, but they also have to respect and face up to the same responsibilities in all the States. It is intolerable for European citizens to have some sort of privileged access in a State other than their own and not to have to undergo the same tests and bear the same burdens as the citizens of that country, in the case in the point the citizens of Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union, education and teaching is structured according to the principle of subsidiarity, with the result that the laws of the Member States differ. Under Italian law, you do not become a university lecturer automatically by virtue of experience, you have to pass a public examination. Therefore, until we manage to harmonise the laws – which we hope to do – respect for the principle of subsidiarity for the moment means that it is impossible on the grounds of discrimination to do away with something which is in all probability a request for a privilege. I repeat: there must be the same rights but also the same responsibilities for all. Otherwise, this problem, which is political, not legal in nature, will arise again and could occur in other States of the European Union where laws governing university career paths and education are different from elsewhere. I therefore advocate caution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has taken not one, not two but three court cases and it still has not been resolved. So why are we back here today debating this injustice in this Chamber? It is because of our failure to resolve the issue that we are back here. We have to continue to publicise this issue until it is resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">What is this injustice? Mr Wieland started to highlight it when he spoke on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs. The injustice is about two people doing the same job, working side by side, but on different pay and under different conditions. If we truly believe in the single market and the free movement of people, that should not happen.</p>
<p class="contents">I disagree with my colleague, Mr Lisi, who spoke earlier. He talked about these people wanting a "privileged" position. They are not asking for a privileged position, they are just asking for the same. Until they get the same as their equivalents in Italy this matter will rumble on.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened carefully to what Mr Busquin said on behalf of the Commission. Some people say there is a whiff of hypocrisy from the Commission. Some even go further and say there is a stench of hypocrisy from the Commission. I will go as far so to say there is a small smell of hypocrisy coming from the Commission. If the Commission were truly serious about resolving this issue it would have been resolved years ago. We can perhaps accept that the previous Commission under Mr Santer was not the best, so that is why it went. But I have to say we are looking at this Commission: the President of this Commission is fully aware of this case, is fully aware of the facts, and yet nothing has been done to resolve it. We have to ask why. That is why this Parliament today is again debating this issue, highlighting this issue, to put it back before the Commission and say: get this sorted out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Attwooll (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, politicians often have the difficult task of telling constituents that no matter how heartfelt their grievance, or how strong its moral base, there is no legal remedy. Sometimes they have the even more difficult task of having to admit that because of problems of access to justice or because of the law's own delays, the road to vindicating their legal rights will be long and arduous. Worst of all, I believe, is having to issue a warning that a court judgment in their favour may just be a set of comforting words and make no real difference in their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, in a democratic society this is rare. The rule of law means just that. No-one can place him or herself outside its ambit just because of who they are or what they do. The American jurist, Lon Fuller, warned us that one of the ways in which something can fail to be a legal system is if there is no congruence between legal rules and official action.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last eleven years we have seen three European Court of Justice judgments in favour of the <span class="italic">lettori</span>. On 13 September this year the European Ombudsman sustained a complaint by them and a number of individual cases have been upheld in the Italian courts.</p>
<p class="contents">I am well aware that the circumstances have not been easy for people on both sides of the argument. But if in this Parliament the rule of law is important to us, we must ensure that it is upheld. If in this Parliament we genuinely believe in a citizen's Europe, we must strive to secure one.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said, this is the third time that this issue has come before Parliament in the form of a motion for a resolution. I hope and trust that there will be no need for it ever to do so again, unless it is to thank all those involved for the fact that effective action has now been taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market from all over the Union and from all the parties have come together to say that it is no use talking about rights, advocating charters of rights if you do not, in real cases when people's rights are denied, take effective action to get them recognised and to get them enforced, and that is the problem in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">I was sorry to see, for example, one of the amendments taking out the reference not only to an appeal to the Ombudsman but the fact that the Ombudsman answered it affirmatively. That is a critical point because the Ombudsman said that the Commission acted wrongly in failing to communicate with the language <span class="italic">lettori </span>the fact that they were changing pleadings on an important and significant article, and the article on which the Commission changed its pleadings is the very point that Commissioner Busquin mentioned. The point is that the <span class="italic">lettori</span> claim the right to continue as teachers, not to be changed into something else.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody disputes that the Italian Republic is fully within its entitlement, in 1995 or at any other time, to say for the future we will not hire people as <span class="italic">lettori</span>, we will bring in people for a new kind of appointment. They can say that to anybody who applies in the future, but they cannot in respect of the past change the rights of people whose rights have upheld by the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">I remind the Commission that I hope it will reply to the point that in the Allué case the ruling of the Court is as follows: 'Hereby rules, it is contrary to Article 48(2) of the EEC Treaty for the legislation of a Member State to limit the duration of employment contracts of foreign-language assistants in any event to one year, with the possibility of renewal where in principle no such limit exists with regard to other teachers.'</p>
<p class="contents">If that is so, then the people whose representatives are in the gallery today, are entitled to be recognised as teachers in Italian universities of similar standing to those holding ten-year appointments in the university. We do not say they should be made Italian civil servants. We say Italy should make its law conform with the decision of the Court and give these teachers the right to be such. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This leaves them in a precarious legal position, and means that they receive lower pay than their Italian colleagues for the same work. This has already been established by the Court of Justice and the ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important is whether this came about by unhappy accident, or whether a quite deliberate decision was taken to maintain this distinction on a permanent basis. I assume that the Italian educational authorities are already fully appraised of the criticism, but the impression I am getting is that this has not convinced them of the need to do things differently from now on. Even though I am an advocate of national autonomy and the right to diversity, I endorse the motion for a resolution because there must never be discrimination on the basis of nationality.</p>
<p class="contents">If we adopt the proposed resolution, will it bring about any changes in the situation, or is there nothing the European Union can do about it at the end of the day? Is Italy to receive a fine by way of punishment? Are we going to carry on complaining, with our hands tied, or are other Member States going to follow suit and start discriminating against Italian teachers? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, some of my British constituents who wish to lecture and reside in Italy are not so fortunate as I am today. In 1989 foreign lecturers working there won a case before the ECJ requiring their contracts not to be limited to six years. After the Italian universities had responded by saying that the judgment did not specifically require them to offer open-ended contracts, a second judgment of the Court in 1993 spelt out clearly that the length of the contracts could not be fixed. The universities responded by downgrading the status of foreign lecturers to support staff and no longer members of the academic teaching staff.</p>
<p class="contents">These dismissed <span class="italic">lettori</span>, as they are known, took their employers to the Italian Supreme Court, which ruled in their favour and demanded their immediate reinstatement. The universities ignored the rulings, denying them the rights associated with teaching staff, including the twice-yearly pay rises so generous in the academic system in Italy. In a Kafkaesque style the universities even went as far as to remove their names from the internal telephone books, the doors and the university websites.</p>
<p class="contents">This is quite unacceptable in a modern Europe. Some of you will be aware of my support for the right of the male descendants of the exiled Italian royal family to return to their homeland. They are subject to a medieval article in the constitution of Italy which prevents all male descendants of the family from entering Italian territory, in clear violation in my view of the Treaty of Amsterdam. Shamefully, in this very House the left-wing and Liberal groups have conspired to block the two princes' access to the Court of Justice although a ruling is expected shortly from the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">Governments must understand that if they sign treaties then they must either abrogate them as sovereign states or abide by their terms in a rule of law. The Italian Government, which comprises left-wing parties who constantly extol the virtues of European laws, rights and treaties, must act soon on both these issues if its commitments to the values for which it claims to stand are not to generate widespread cynicism in other Member States about Italy's commitment to uphold European law.</p>
<p class="contents">So far the European Commission has proven unwilling to enforce the Treaties when the number of people affected are few. In the instance of my motion on the royal family this was even described by the Liberal rapporteur in this House on human rights as an exotic motion of no interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, I believe that these matters go to the very heart of the fundamental principles of the freedom associated with European law, particularly the freedom of movement, and no exceptions can be made to these principles. There must be non-discrimination for EU citizens wherever they come from and wherever they want to go to within the Union. These issues are vital to uphold European freedom and in my view there is no national issue of vital interest to the security of the Italian State which is being threatened by either the royal family or the Italian foreign lecturers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we refer in recital C of the resolution to the three judgments, which state that the rights of the persons affected under the freedom of movement of labour in the Union and their rights not to be exposed to discrimination on the basis of their nationality were violated by Italy's omissions and when the ombudsman and numerous speakers here confirm this, then the argument of one of the previous speakers, namely that the violation can be justified on the grounds of subsidiarity does not stand up.</p>
<p class="contents">When the European Court of Justice finds that European law has been violated, this cannot be countered by invoking the principle of subsidiarity. The second point is that this is, without doubt, a political debate because it is about the violation of the law. The legal status of the Treaties cannot be played off against politics; on the contrary, it is our duty, should this happen, to hold a political debate in the House on the violation of the law. I think that the saying “If you don't take yourself seriously, no-one else will” is most apt here. When there are three judgments in a case by the European Court of Justice and the country in question still fails to change its conduct, then we must intervene; we must make it public. We discussed the Charter of Fundamental Rights here in the House a few days ago. Surely compliance with current law is the very first fundamental right which can be demanded of us? Surely promoting the community based on law is the basis for the European community of values? You cannot play one off against the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously education still comes under subsidiarity but, within the framework of the Treaties, the freedom of movement of workers and the ban on discrimination apply to everyone, although we – and I in particular, coming as I do from a highly federalist state – support the principle of subsidiarity as a principle of order in our dealings with the European Union and do what we can so that powers are divided as quickly as possible between the levels in Europe in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. Italy's conduct in this matter runs counter to the objectives of the Community and runs counter to our desire to increase the mobility and flexibility of workers. The diversity of cultures, which we see as a fundamental element of Europe, finds expression first and foremost in the diversity of languages. Anyone who stands up for the diversity of cultures must do what they can so that we can maintain the diversity of languages and learn them everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the internal economic market. I say that also as a member of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport: the internal economic market needs the internal educational market. There are still many fetters and many obstacles to this internal market, as today's debate has shown, and not just in this case. We should do everything to remove these fetters as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, I think that I have already answered a certain number of the points raised. I would like to recall once again that these mechanisms contain a time factor and that we are talking about facts going back ten years, different aspects of which must be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the conformity of the Italian system to the decision of the Court in the Allué case, the Commission initiated an infringement procedure, which was dropped in 1995 when Italy adopted the law abolishing this restriction. Italy then adopted a new text in 1996 eliminating the discriminatory elements that existed before. But there is a second aspect to the problem: the question of acquired rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In this area, we analysed all the processes, as I have already explained and the Commission launched a new infringement procedure against Italy in July 1999. We are waiting for the European Court of Justice to rule on this aspect of the problem. There are thus two things, which I would not describe as being different, but which are linked together slightly differently over time. It is therefore necessary to make a distinction between the two elements. As regards the equal access of all European citizens to all professional categories, it is clear that each European citizen may become a member of the Italian teaching body by taking part in a competition intended for Italian teachers.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it can no longer be a question of discrimination. It is therefore necessary to look at the previous situation, which was manifestly discriminatory. The Commission did its job in bringing the infringement procedure before the European Court of Justice and the Italian State changed the law. It is clear that the entire problem of acquired rights still remains unsolved. We are once again in the middle of an infringement procedure and we hope that the Court of Justice will give its opinion as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the free movement of workers must not result in discrimination against nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming from a country whose active population is more than 50% non-Luxembourgeois, foreign residents or people who cross the border every day to work, I know what I am talking about. In my country, for secondary school teachers we have very strict and very hard recruitment competitions. We cannot, and I say this as a matter of principle, discriminate against nationals by making access to employment easier for non-nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">This said, I hope that our debate will go some way to promoting an equitable solution for language teachers in Italy.

He said that everyone working in Italian universities has to pass the same exams as Italian teachers have to pass. I do not see why that should be the case. We are supposed to have mutual recognition of qualifications across Europe so that you can qualify in your own country and then move to others. That is a basic issue in Mr Busquin's response which needs to be questioned and I am sorry to see that he has now left the Chamber. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
