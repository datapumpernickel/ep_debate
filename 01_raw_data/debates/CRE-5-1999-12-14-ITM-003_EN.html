<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to report to this House today that the Commission is highly satisfied with the overall results of the Helsinki European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me begin by congratulating you, Madam President, on the way you opened proceedings at this Summit. Your contribution was very well received and paved the way for a really constructive debate, especially on Parliament’s involvement in the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">There were three main topics of discussion at Helsinki: enlargement, defence and the IGC. Let me take these in order.</p>
<p class="contents">First, enlargement. I am very pleased that the European Council decided to open accession negotiations next year with the six candidate countries in the second wave. This means we will be preparing to welcome twelve new Member States, and we should be ready to conclude negotiations with the first of them by the end of 2002, provided we have successfully reformed our institutions and completed our revision of the Treaties. A successful IGC is indeed an essential precondition to any enlargement. I am also delighted that the Heads of State and Government took the historic step of recognising Turkey as an official candidate country. We want to help Turkey along the road towards full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria, and now that the European Council has given its green light, we shall be able to devise specific ways of doing so under a pre-accession strategy for Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, defence. I am very glad that the European Council has decided on the broad outlines of the new European Security and Defence Policy, particularly by developing the Union’s military and non-military rapid response capabilities. A rapid intervention force of 50 to 60 000 troops will enable us to deal effectively with brushfires in our own back yard, especially on occasions when our NATO allies do not wish to become involved. The need for security in Europe and for a wider European area of peace is amply illustrated by the situation in Chechnya, on which the European Council has adopted a detailed declaration. Among the specific measures recommended is the proposal that TACIS funds be redirected towards humanitarian efforts, and the Commission will be taking timely action to implement this proposal. It is a good example of an area in which the Commission has direct responsibility and can make a specific contribution to resolving the Chechnya crisis. </p>
<p class="contents">Chechnya was also the main topic of concern at the OSCE Summit in Istanbul in November. The political declaration signed at that Summit makes it clear that a political solution to the Chechnya dispute is essential, and some OSCE principles were reasserted despite very strong pressure, particularly from the Russian Federation, to water them down. These include the OSCE’s right to adopt positions on conflicts that undermine commitments entered into by all participating States on human rights and the rule of law. At the Istanbul Summit, I reaffirmed the European Union’s firm commitment to rebuilding south-east Europe and integrating it into the European mainstream. I also emphasised the substantial assistance we are already giving, and will continue to give, to the region. Istanbul also saw the signing of the revised Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, the adoption of the Vienna Document 1999 and the signing of the Charter for European Security. This sets out the common challenges and foundations for European security in the new millennium and proposes new instruments to enable the OSCE to tackle these challenges. President Ahtasaari and I signed the Charter on behalf of the European Union, and I am glad to say it enshrines the Platform for Cooperative Security proposed by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now return to Helsinki and to the third main item of discussion, the IGC. Very wisely, in my judgement, the European Council decided to launch this Conference as early as February next year, as we had repeatedly requested, with open minds regarding the agenda. We are all just beginning to realise what it will mean to have a Europe of more than 25 Member States, and it would certainly have been imprudent to close the agenda at this early stage. Fortunately, good sense has prevailed and the IGC will be tackling not only the issues left over from Amsterdam but also the corollaries of those issues – such as the redistribution of seats in this House after enlargement. It will also consider any other relevant institutional issues arising from enlargement, and the Commission has already made a few suggestions as to what these issues might be. I expect Parliament and the Commission to return to these matters in our formal opinions on the Conference, to be delivered next January. None of the items on the IGC’s agenda is simple, and others may have to be added as the Conference proceeds. It is therefore time for us to roll up our sleeves and get down to work, and I think that this work will need a lot of attention from us all.<span class="bold"> </span>However,<span class="bold"> </span>I am pleased to say that the Commission has been successful in its efforts to ensure that the European Parliament can play its proper part in the IGC: Parliament will have full observer status in the Group of Personal Representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, let me say how disappointed I am that Helsinki delivered no progress on the European tax package – beyond an agreement to work on it for a further six months. It was not one of the main items but it was nevertheless an important item, and above all, it has a high profile in European political journalism. This is indeed a feeble outcome after two whole years of intensive effort, and I want to stress how important it is that we reach a firm conclusion on the package soon. It is important that our citizens realise what this package is really for. It is not simply – although this is important – about preventing damaging tax competition or ensuring the smooth operation of the internal market – which, I repeat are important but which to most people must seem remote, bureaucratic concepts. It is, in fact, about something extremely relevant to everyday life in Europe: creating jobs. If there is indeed complete evasion of any form of capital tax, as occurred in the last decade, all taxes concerning labour will increase. And I do not consider this to be the best policy to fight unemployment. </p>
<p class="contents">There is another, much simpler fact: tax evasion is unfair and it is detrimental to employment and we must fight it with all the means at our disposal. If we cannot find effective ways of taxing return on capital, the entire tax burden will have to be borne by labour, and that will simply make the biggest problem we have even worse.</p>
<p class="contents">So I shall personally be following the tax package negotiations closely over the next six months, giving Commissioner Bolkestein, who has worked extremely positively over the last few months, every assistance possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, there is much to be done in the wake of the European Council. We must work at it together, and for the first time, we really have a<span class="bold"> </span>wide area to work on together. We shall do this with determination, in good faith and in a true spirit of cooperation, and I would like to thank you for this spirit that has developed between us. </p>

First, I will give an overview of the most important results the Finnish Presidency has achieved, focusing in particular on the decisions of the European Council at Helsinki. In accordance with the wishes of Parliament, I will also give an account of the Presidency’s views of the situation in Chechnya, and I will give an outline of the most important results of the OSCE Summit in Istanbul in November.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to warmly thank the President of Parliament, Mrs Fontaine, for the views of Parliament that she expressed at the start of the European Council. The discussions we had were fruitful. I would like to express my warm thanks, on behalf of both the Finnish government and the Council, to the whole of the European Parliament for its excellent and constructive cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The first decision of the European Council in Helsinki was to adopt the Millennium Declaration in the Friday morning session. The Declaration gives a concise account of the values that underpin the European Union and the challenges and aims of the start of the new millennium. Of the Declaration I would just like to mention here what must be done to meet the challenges of the millennium: only an open, democratic, effective Union will be able to succeed in realising these commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">The first sitting of the European Council concentrated on Union enlargement. These decisions are historic with regard to Europe, as the new phase of the enlargement process that began in Helsinki will in time lead to thirteen new Member States joining the Union. In Helsinki, we agreed to open accession talks with Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and Malta. As the Extraordinary European Council meeting in Tampere had been unanimous on the matter, hardly any further debate was needed. Intergovernmental Conferences are to commence in February of next year with the six countries invited to the talks. It was reconfirmed in this connection that each applicant country would progress towards membership on the basis of its own merits. There were no time limits imposed for accession. Instead, the Union set itself the goal that it must be ready to accept new members from the end of 2002. This is the time-scale we need before the next Intergovernmental Conference has brought its work to a conclusion and the amendments to the Treaties have been ratified in all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In its debate on enlargement, the European Council paid special attention to the importance of good levels of nuclear safety in Central and Eastern Europe. The European Council expressed its satisfaction with the fact that talks on Cyprus were to begin in New York on 3 December and said that a political solution would facilitate Cyprus’ accession to the Union. It should be pointed out, however, that this solution is not a precondition of Cyprus’ accession.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision the European Council took to approve candidate status in respect of Turkey can, in my opinion, be considered a historic one. The joint decision was made possible by the courageous and constructive efforts of the Greek Prime Minister, Costas Simitis, in particular, while the Presidency was trying to establish the chances of achieving a favourable decision. As soon as the European Council had approved the conclusions on Turkey, intense and illuminating negotiations with Turkey began. Relations were reinforced by a letter I wrote, as representative of the country holding the Presidency, to the Turkish Prime Minister, Bülent Ecevit. The European Council also sent a delegation to Ankara. The delegation included a representative of the Finnish Presidency, the Secretary-General, High Representative Javier Solana, and Commissioner Günter Verheugen. The delegation explained the substance of the decision taken at Helsinki to the Turkish Government.</p>
<p class="contents">The decisions of Helsinki made it possible for Turkey to attend a joint luncheon with the other applicant countries and Heads of State and Governments at the European Council meeting in Helsinki. I wish to stress that Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit clearly reconfirmed, at Helsinki, Turkey’s commitment to reform and meet the Copenhagen criteria. With the decisions of Helsinki, Turkey is to be treated in the same way as the other applicant countries. But it will not be possible to open accession negotiations with Turkey before she meets the Copenhagen political criteria. The biggest problem is the defects in Turkey’s internal situation: shortcomings in the democratic system and violations of human rights, including those of minorities. With Turkey we are embarking on a sort of preparatory and advisory phase in a process in which the country’s progress will be examined with regard to complying with the acquis. In our political dialogue with Turkey, we are stressing the importance of making progress, especially in matters of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Helsinki conclusions urge all candidate countries to resolve outstanding border disputes and other related matters. Otherwise they should bring the dispute, within a reasonable period of time, to the International Court of Justice to decide. The European Council will have re-examined the situation by the end of 2004 with regard to any unsolved disputes. The European Council will examine any special consequences of disputes for the accession process and try to push for disputes to be solved in the International Court of Justice. The decision to acknowledge Turkey’s status as a candidate State and closer dialogue between the Union and that country are important for regional stability and for a solution to the Cyprus question. In inviting Turkey to make an even firmer bond of cooperation the Union is acting in accordance with its basic function of establishing peace and promoting human rights. </p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the European Council responded with profound concern to events in Chechnya. To persuade Russia of the benefits of a political solution, the European Council issued a separate declaration on the situation in Chechnya and its effects on relations between the European Union and Russia. Only a political solution can end the crisis in Chechnya. Russian efforts to find a solution have thus far been inadequate. In these circumstances the European Union and the international community must continue to exert political pressure. The declaration condemns the bombing, the ultimatum to the inhabitants of Grozny, and the treatment of internal refugees. Russian territorial integrity is not being questioned, nor its entitlement to combat terrorism. The action Russia has taken is, however, contrary to international humanitarian law and is in violation of the obligations that Russia, as a member of the OSCE and the Council of Europe, agreed to honour regarding human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The declaration also notes that there is a danger of the crisis spreading in the region, and it also poses a special risk to Georgia’s territorial integrity. The European Council concluded that the situation would affect the implementation of the joint strategy for Russia, and that that strategy would have to be re-examined. Discussions on this will start this week. The declaration adopted on Saturday in Helsinki was made known to the Russian Government the same day by means of a letter from the President of the European Council and the High Representative.</p>
<p class="contents">It was the European Council’s opinion that parts of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement should be suspended and those parts to do with trade policy should be rigorously applied. The Presidency is asking the legal departments of the Commission and the Council to report on the legal aspects of the issue in a Working Group this week. The year is nearly over. After the Union’s internal decisions have been taken, the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement will move on in accordance with the regulations. It was also decided at Helsinki that we should ask for a proportion of TACIS funds to be set aside for humanitarian aid. But that should only affect Russia. TACIS concerns the whole of the Confederation of Independent States area, and the Union has thus no cause to sanction any CIS States or Mongolia.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say here that the Union must not undermine the long-term programme of cooperation we are putting into effect, which we must do to support democratic and stable development in Russia. This would not be to the Union’s advantage. The European Council underlined this by saying it was vital to continue with projects to support human rights, the rule of law and civil society as well as nuclear safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council is at the same time asking, in line with the common strategy on Russia, the OSCE and the Council of Europe to examine the shape their strategy on cooperation with Russia takes in their different areas. The visit by the Chairman of the OSCE to the area this week, right now, in fact, will show whether there are any changes in the Russian position. We must focus particular attention on this visit and its outcome. We have to discover whether the Council of Europe can intensify efforts relating to Russia in the areas of human rights and civil society. The aim is not to exclude Russia from the work of the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not in Russia’s interests, so I believe, to isolate itself from Europe and the rest of the world, particularly if that scenario were extended beyond the time of the Russian elections for quite a long time into the future. We must hope that a realistic attitude will soon take shape in Moscow. Neither is Russian isolation in the interests of the European Union nor anyone else in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the European Council approved the Presidency’s report on the Intergovernmental Conference. The Intergovernmental Conference will start in February next year and would end in December 2000. The agenda covers the issues left unresolved at Amsterdam; that is, the size and composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council, and the possible increase in qualified majority decisions in the Council as well as other issues relating to the Union institutions in connection with these matters. The next country to hold the Presidency, Portugal, will give the European Council a report on progress in the IGC arrangements and the addition to the agenda of any other issues. The General Affairs Council has the overall political responsibility for the IGC. Responsibility for preparations lies with a Working Group made up of a representative of each Member State’s government. There will also be a representative from the Commission at the political and preparatory levels.</p>
<p class="contents">We are expecting good levels of cooperation with Parliament as the reforms are drafted. The position of the European Parliament will be strengthened compared to the previous Intergovernmental Conference as two observers from Parliament will be invited to attend the meetings of the preparatory Working Group. Each meeting at ministerial level will be preceded, in accordance with earlier practices, by talks with the President of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the European Council also debated the development of the European common security and defence policy, with particular reference to crisis management. The development of facilities to cope with both civil and military crisis management was discussed, on the basis of reports produced by the Presidency. The conclusions remind us that the on-going process does not mean the creation of a European army.</p>
<p class="contents">A common objective was agreed in Helsinki on all the military resources needed for rapid deployment to implement the Petersberg tasks with regard to crisis management. Common resources are rapidly being developed for the Union in the areas of systems of command, intelligence and strategic transport. In developing civil resources for crisis management it is especially urgent to improve police facilities and arrangements for prompt funding arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">In the conclusions of the Presidency, it was stated that the first progress report on the document now adopted would be presented at the European Council in Lisbon. We should be satisfied that the Member States have been able to make rapid progress in improving the Union’s readiness for crisis management during the Finnish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council noted with satisfaction that the recovery in the economies of the Member States has gathered pace and is spreading all the time. The basics of a healthy economy – good opportunities for investment, low inflation and improved public finances are the basis of this recovery. The introduction of the euro has helped to make the outlook favourable. Our challenges include changes in the population structure and increased competition as a result of globalisation and the need it creates for the encouragement of innovation and structural adaptation. The European Council said that the coordination of economic, employment and structural policy must be enhanced in accordance with the recommendations in the Council’s report. In the Union we must focus on the effective application and streamlining of current processes and arrangements. The general objectives and trends in policy will be determined through broad guidelines drawn up for economic policy. The debate on these issues will continue at the Extraordinary meeting of the European Council in Lisbon in March. In my view, it could turn out to be a very important meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">As is well known – and the President of the Commission referred to this in his speech – Helsinki also failed to achieve progress in one area. We were unable to reach consensus on the taxation package. In the conclusions on taxation, however, it was reconfirmed that people residing in the Member States of the Union would have to pay tax on all income from savings. A High Level Working Group is examining how this principle can be put most effectively into practice. The tax package is thus holding together, and it cannot be said that anyone got away scot-free in this matter. This, along with items in the tax package, will be reported to the European Council no later than June 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">In environmental policy the European Council stressed the need to intensify the work being done in this area in the next few years. The European Council decided to attempt to make it possible for the Member States to ratify the Kyoto Protocol before the year 2002. In addition, the conclusions ask the Commission to draft a proposal for a sixth Environmental Action Programme by the end of 2000. Similarly, we are asking the Commission to draft a proposal for the European Council convening in June 2001 for a long-term strategy, in which policies for economically, socially and ecologically sustainable development are dovetailed.</p>
<p class="contents">The main event of the Finnish Presidency in the context of the work of the OSCE was the Summit held in Istanbul on 18 and 19 November. The European Union is mainly satisfied with the outcome of the Summit meeting. At the meeting a Charter for European Security was signed. The Charter is founded on earlier commitments and reinforces the establishment of democracy, peace and human rights. The Charter will also strengthen the OSCE’s ability to fulfil its functions attend to its duties. The Charter also includes the EU proposal for a Platform for Cooperative Security between international organisations, especially in conflict prevention and crisis management, and reinforces the rapid-deployment civilian crisis management capabilities of the Organisation. It is particularly important – given, also, Russia’s action in Chechnya – for the Charter to reinforce the notion that commitments also have to be complied with in internal conflicts of States.</p>
<p class="contents">At the meeting we also approved a declaration on topical political issues. In the declaration a stand is taken on the situation in Chechnya and Kosovo. In addition, the parties to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, the so-called CFE, also signed an adapted Treaty at the Istanbul Summit. That agreement ensures there are limits to conventional armed forces on a country-by-country basis, corresponding to the post-Cold War situation.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I should like first on behalf of the Group for the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats to extend my warmest thanks to the Finnish Presidency of the Council for its work and its good intentions. Mr President of the Council, your work and the work of your foreign secretary and your minister Kimmo Sasi demonstrate that smaller Member States are also capable of excellent work and we would like to extend our special thanks for that work, especially as this is the first time that the Republic of Finland has taken over the Council Presidency. So please accept our thanks and our recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">Participants at the Summit and you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, have spoken of historic decisions. I find this description somewhat premature. Time will tell if the decisions taken at Helsinki were in fact historic in the positive sense or, possibly, historic in a negative sense. Only historians will be able to say if Helsinki was a Summit of enlargement fever and mini reforms or if it really helped to strengthen the European Union and give Europe the power to act in the 21st century. We hope that it will be the latter and that the Helsinki Summit will become a symbol of Europe’s strength and power to act in the 21st century. That is our hope, but it will depend on action, not the words in the presidency’s conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that enlargement negotiations are to commence with Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and Malta. This has always been the policy of the PPE-DE Group. Europe needs to grow together now.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the question of the reform of the European Union is concerned, we welcome the fact that the way has been opened for further reform beyond the three Amsterdam leftovers<span class="italic"> </span>and we hope that the Portuguese Presidency of the Council will also do the right thing. But we are concerned, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to read in point 16 of the Council’s conclusions that the question of the possible extension of qualified majority voting in the Council will be examined. The possibility! No, we do not need to examine the possibility; we need to extend majority voting so that the European Union can continue to expand. We say this quite clearly in the run-up to the intergovernmental conference.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are also waiting for the European Union to be given a legal personality. We are also waiting for the European Parliament to be given codecision powers on all legislative matters. We are also waiting for the European Parliament to be given the right to vote on amendments to the Treaty and we agree with the proposals by Dehaene, Weizsäcker and Lord Simon that the right thing to do would be to create a basic treaty and an enlarged treaty, so that the citizens of Europe also know which level is responsible and what the European Union will look like in the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">On Turkey: The President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, rightly says that we need a debate on the geographical borders of the Union. We would have welcomed such a discussion before the decision to grant Turkey candidate status, rather than starting it now.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As far as Turkey’s status as a candidate country is concerned, we do not wholly agree with the majority of our group. The same applies in the other groups. It is an important question, and there is no harm in having differences of opinion. But the great majority of our group is sceptical because we know that Turkey’s membership will change the political, economic and cultural face of the European Union. We hope, because we regard Turkey as a friend, that it will succeed in building up a real civil society, that it will succeed in giving the ethnic Kurds a real identity, as part of the Turkish federation and the Turkish nation, and we hope that the Turkish military, which is allied with the west – and that is the real tragedy, will moderate its action in relation to the Kurdish question and stop using military intervention rather than dialogue in order to overcome problems which arise with the Kurds. In other words, we hope that Turkey will succeed in building up a real civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns foreign, security and defence policy. We congratulate the Finnish Presidency, as a traditionally non-aligned country, on having taken a courageous step. But actions speak louder than words. It would be a sorry day for the European Union if we were to talk of European defence without giving the European Union the means to implement European defence and if we were to end up driving a wedge between us and our American partners in NATO. Words must now be backed up by action to strengthen the European Union as a whole and give it the power to act. It must be given a really democratic, human rights-orientated policy so that the European Union can be a stabilising factor, a factor for peace, development, human rights and democracy in the Europe of the 21st century. This is the real task ahead of us and we hope that Helsinki has laid the foundations for it and that words will now be backed up by action.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to offer my heartfelt congratulations to the Finnish Presidency on the success of their debut. It has been a fine debut, because you have been able, at this historic and symbolic moment, at the dawn of the new millennium, to draw up a creative approach for the European Union in the light of the challenges it is facing. I believe that Prime Minister Lipponen and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mrs Halonen, who is absent today due to other work commitments, have truly worked effectively and seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Our fundamental criticism of the Finnish Presidency and the Summit is that, clearly, and in the eyes of our citizens, their substance has been more impressive than appearances would suggest. I think this concern should be expressed through our comments and criticisms here in the European Parliament. Why? Because, with regard to enlargement, an open and political principle has been displayed by offering all countries the possibility of acceding, of competing with us, with a desire to emulate us and of participating in our adventure. It is also clear that a significant and genuine step forward has been taken in relation to Turkey. I have to say, on behalf of my group – where we have debated the issue at length – that our positive attitude towards Turkey is unanimous. And now, at a time when this step has been taken – and we must remember that relations with Turkey did not start yesterday, but in 1963 –, we hope that Turkey will also respond in a positive manner, both with regard to its internal process of democratisation as well as its relations, not only with the Community, but essentially with the country which has taken the most important step and which I think should be congratulated: Greece and its government.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, with regard to the Intergovernmental Conference, which is the preliminary step we have to take in preparing our shared Community for enlargement, I believe that we are moving forward significantly, but I am extremely aware that the Council systematically tries to undervalue what it does. There is always talk about the leftovers of Amsterdam; leftovers are normally thrown in the bin. These are very important decisions. Confirming the principle of majority voting as a general rule in the Community, as the basis for the political functioning of the Union (which is very important for the Parliament insofar as we can make codecisions), being granted legal personality, which includes, in the Conference, decisions which the Council has taken, such as, for example, drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights... What is the point of all this if it is not included in the Treaties?</p>
<p class="contents">A significant step has been taken with regard to security and defence policy, and in this sense I would like to underline the fact that the Community spirit is winning us all over. Who would have said a year ago that Finland would be the country which would preside over the European Union at a time when it was taking such a decisive step in terms of security and defence identity? I believe this shows that, together, we are doing things and taking positive steps.</p>
<p class="contents">Curiously though, we do not explain them and we do not sell them. And nor do we accept an important task in this Parliament which is, in the name of transparency and through clarification, to try to create Treaties which are comprehensible to the citizens. I would remind you that this appears in the Treaty of Amsterdam, but has not been mentioned since. This opportunity, which is so important, has never been taken. I must also say that the Summit statement with regard to the European Parliament’s participation may well be positive to an extent, but we do not like to be described as parliamentary observers. We want to have ‘representatives’ of this Parliament, because that is the role of our institution.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">And remembering what happened at the Seattle Summit, I believe that we have to make a considerable effort to explain to the citizens what we are doing. Otherwise, we run the risk of producing unwanted reactions.</p>
<p class="contents">A final word, Madam President, regarding an issue which concerns my group very much. It seems to us absolutely essential that we are able to move forward in relation to capital-gains tax. The European process cannot be seen as a process in which there is less and less capital gains tax and more and more tax on wages. If we continue along these lines, we may find that those in work will react against the European process, especially within a framework of financial globalisation which lacks rules. Therefore, Madam President, I believe that the Finnish Presidency has taken an enormous step forward. What is now required is a sustained, hard, arduous and persistent effort to keep things moving forward. But, above all, we have to carry out the task of explaining the process to our citizens, and I believe that that is our principal mission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have completed a very successful first presidency for Finland but you have done it with a capacity that does enormous credit to the tasks which you addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Summit has produced a result which is worthy of the times. We are at the end of a century, we are contemplating a new millennium and it is a time of review, a time of outlook and a time of new optimism. I believe, in a certain way, the Summit has captured that. I believe that the major decisions that have been made in respect of enlargement, reform and defence show that there is a sustained vitality in our common European vocation. That is an important message and the central message that has emerged from your successful presidency and on that you deserve rich and proper congratulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say, in respect of enlargement, that my group, as the others too have expressed here today, is extremely pleased to see that negotiations will open soon with the six additional States of Central and Eastern Europe. It is important that we inject a new political dynamic into the enlargement process. The enlargement process itself is essentially a political process and we must not lose sight of that, notwithstanding the many technical dimensions that attend it.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of Turkey: my group welcomes the decision to extend candidate status to Turkey and regards it as positive. We hope that the modernising influences within Turkish politics and society will now take hold of this opportunity and build on it in a positive way. But in welcoming the decision as we do, we insist that those modernising forces must make determined progress towards European norms of respect for human rights and of the relationship between civil and military society; towards the abolition of the death penalty; towards a clear respect for minorities, especially the Kurdish minority in Turkey. The European Union has also made through your presidency a wise choice in insisting that the reform process in the Treaties must be over and operational by the year 2002 so that it will facilitate early accession because it is important to ensure that the reform process should not become the enemy of the enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">The IGC has the opportunity to enhance efficiency and effectiveness and to deepen the democratic character of the European Union. However, we are disappointed that the IGC agenda which has been contemplated at Helsinki has been limited to what has been described as the Amsterdam leftovers. I accept that these are not merely crumbs on the table, they are significant slices of reform but we must grasp this opportunity to do more. My group, through this House, will work with other parliamentarians and with the Commission to try to convince the incoming Portuguese Presidency to be more ambitious in the reform, all the while respecting the timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the view of other colleagues that it is unfortunate to describe the role that this House can play as one merely of observer. I welcome the fact that we will participate but we participate as equals and not merely as observers.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of defence, we warmly welcome the establishment of the rapid reaction force and its significant and necessary progress – Kosovo has taught us dearly the need for that. My group, however, again wishes to stress the importance that this should be seen in the context of a strong Atlantic Alliance. We must not give any succour to the forces in US politics who show a tendency towards isolationism, many of whose voices are now raised in the current US Presidential election.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, one suggestion is that we contemplate the establishment of a political and security committee and military committee. Could the Defence Minister of the incoming Presidency come to this House at an early date and make a statement to us? We need to clarify a number of things such as the role of EU non-NATO members in such a force and the role of non-EU NATO members in respect of such a force if they wish to participate. This and other issues should have a democratic airing and this is the place to do so at a European level.</p>
<p class="contents">A final comment: I could not sit down without mentioning our deep concern about Chechnya. We welcome the fact that this is occupying the attention of Helsinki. We would urge the IMF also to act vigorously in this regard because, although each State has a right to defend itself against terrorism, what we observe in Chechnya is grossly disproportionate to the scale of the perceived threat and we have to deplore and condemn it at every opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Finnish Presidency has kept us better informed than former presidencies, which is obviously important, as it strengthens relations between the European Parliament and the Council with reference to the Treaty of Amsterdam. The conclusions of the Summit meeting declare, quite satisfactorily, that the Commission at last intends to issue a proposal in January regarding the conditions on which the public will be able to access the documents of the institutions. I would like to tell you that this draft regulation has been leaked to the public, and that is worrying. That does not make for a spirit of transparency; on the contrary, it might even weaken it, so I would ask you to give this matter your attention. The final proposal can surely yet be amended in such a way that it would really increase transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding enlargement, I wish to say that we are very satisfied that the Council has now finally agreed that each candidate country must be assessed on their own merits. This is exactly the strategy we proposed from the outset. Now we have to ensure that we also achieve a balance in the progress we make in negotiations and that candidate countries give sufficient consideration to the issues of social security, equality between men and women, employment and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Turkey, our opinion is that the European Council should mean what it says, in other words, that the same criteria should apply to Turkey as with the other countries that have been accorded candidate status. We call on you to look seriously into the question relating to the status of the Kurds. Islam is obviously already a European tradition, and so we have no fears of the European Union becoming more religiously diverse. We were not inclined to agree with those in the European Parliament who have been keen to narrowly define the borders of Europe in the belief that Islam is somehow non-European. On the contrary, we think it can indeed be a part of European culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Th majority of our group would seem to agree that the European Union should also develop a system for military crisis management, to prevent humanitarian catastrophes. We are very dissatisfied with the way in which the European Council and preparatory discussions have paid little heed to public debate and public opinion. We want to point out that foreign and security policy, as any other, must be democratic, and you must open up this debate, so the public know what the next phases of the process are to be. We do not want the European Union to become NATO’s European military pillar. We want you to strengthen civil crisis management, because, as we all know, it is the wisest thing to do. The non-military prevention of conflicts is always more important, and for every euro invested in military crisis management at least as much must be spent on civil crisis management.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, your position on Chechnya was a step in the right direction. I am certain the European Parliament’s calls to put economic cooperation on ice have had an effect, and we believe that you will remain firm in your opinion that this is not a situation in which we can act as if nothing has happened.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now it is a spirit of European militarisation. At the Helsinki Summit, the EU expanded its role to include the militarisation of the Union. We are to establish our own European army for the EU, although it will not be called that officially. The Member States committed themselves to releasing troops from their own authority to form a fifty thousand strong European army and assigned troops equivalent to a whole corps for the joint deployment of the EU. In addition, they are going to create rapid deployment forces for wars lasting no more than a year.</p>
<p class="contents">At Amsterdam a common foreign and security policy was referred to. At Cologne it was already a common security and defence policy that was mentioned. Since then, many, following the lead of the Commission, have started talking about a common defence. The ideas expressed speak for themselves. The EU has started to become a war alliance and a military alliance. At Helsinki, the attendance of defence ministers at meetings of the General Affairs Council was officially approved. The EU will thus acquire a Council of Ministers of War. In Helsinki a standing committee on political and security matters was set up. Since Helsinki, the commanders of the defence forces of the various countries have formed an EU Military Committee, which is free of any kind of democratic scrutiny. It was also decided at Helsinki to establish a Military Staff, which will be an EU military planning body for spying operations and mobilisation. Consequently, talk has begun of the need to increase military appropriations. Via the new institutions, a new defence dimension is being created, despite the fact that no agreement has been made in the Treaties that joint military operations fall within the scope of the EU. These decisions should be taken to the EU Court of Justice. Can Heads of State and Government extend the role of the EU without the approval of Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">The NATO countries doubtless intend to put the decisions of the fiftieth anniversary conference of the “Alliance” into effect. Since the decisions taken at Washington the NATO countries have been able to act outside the territories of their Member States. They have assumed the right to attack other countries without a mandate from either the UN or the OSCE. In NATO this is called humanitarian intervention, as it has no mandate under international law. In the EU, it is called crisis management, which also includes forcible peace-making. There was no decision at Helsinki to mandate crisis management or forcible peace-making. As the EU is being militarised, it would seem to be happening with a mandate from NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">The Finnish Presidency has ended wretchedly from the point of view of preserving the non-alignment of a non-aligned State. If the meeting were historic this was mainly in the sense that the EU is being militarised. There were no surprises at Helsinki as far as EU enlargement and the Intergovernmental Conference were concerned. In the opinion of our group, the Russian attack on civilians in Chechnya is to be strongly condemned, and it was at Helsinki. In the fight against unemployment, we wish Portugal better success that Finland had.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, the Helsinki Summit of EU leaders has been quite accurately billed as the European Union's enlargement Summit, and there can be no doubt that this European Council meeting has lived up to this particular expectation.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU leaders reaffirmed the inclusive nature of the accession process which now comprises 13 candidate States within a single framework. In essence what this means is that the countries, including Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and Malta, will now open negotiations on membership of the European Union in March of next year. These new countries join with the original six that are already engaged in extensive talks with the Union covering 38 different chapters of negotiations concerning the enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">All the countries seeking to accede to the EU regard the prospect of membership of the Union as an essential ingredient in achieving the transformation of their economic and political structures. The leaders of the 15 countries presently comprising membership of the EU believe that there will have to be substantial changes to the internal decision-making processes within the EU if the enlargement process is to take place in a structured and streamlined fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">EU leaders have agreed to set the end of the year 2002 as the deadline for the EU's internal preparations, notably the ratification of any institutional changes which are agreed at the future IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the enlargement process cannot take place unless there is some reform in the decision-making procedures within the European Union itself. However, the deadline being set down for the next intergovernmental conference is very ambitious indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">I support working towards reaching an agreement by the end of next year, but equally we must not and should not hurry possible fundamental reforms to existing treaties without due consideration and evaluation. Certainly it would be extremely difficult and impracticable to secure the support of the European public to introduce unanimity for tax harmonisation changes or for decisions concerning foreign and security matters at European Council level. We must tread carefully on the matter of treaty reform for the simple reason that we have to guarantee that we can carry the support of the 340 million citizens in the EU for any such changes.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey has also been designated as having candidate status for membership of the EU although it will have to meet the political criteria laid down for prospective accession, which of course will include proving that respect for human rights is an intrinsic part of Turkish life.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of Chechnya the European Union leaders were right to bring home to Russia the force of their anger at the brutality of Russian behaviour in the region. A negotiated settlement is still the only real long-term solution for the securing of a peace settlement in Chechnya. The European Union must continue to use every diplomatic avenue open to it to help halt the war in Chechnya. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst acknowledging that Turkey must indeed be accorded respect as an important and culturally-rich nation and friendly neighbouring country with which we want to remain on the best of terms, Turkey still does not belong in Europe. That is only logical historically, geographically-speaking and from the point of view of common sense. We must pluck up the courage to tell this friendly neighbouring country as much. For historical, cultural, religious and political reasons, Turkey has never been part of European civilisation. Quite the opposite in fact. In Helsinki, the European countries bent over backwards yet again for American geo-political interests and for nothing else. Do I need to produce a map to remind you that only three percent of Turkey is on European soil? How can people undermine Europe in this way and strip it of its historical identity by continuing even to consider extending candidate status to a country that lies in a different part of the world. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would just like to say something about the logic of common sense, for a number of Member States are already struggling with a massive, almost unmanageable immigration problem. If Turkey accedes to the European Union then the problem will grow to gigantic proportions. This will result in an invasion of the kind that the French President Valérie Giscard d’Estaing once warned about. That is why my party, the Flemish Block, will continue to oppose any possibility of Turkey acceding to the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU is to get its own military rapid reaction corps. The world’s largest trading power is to begin establishing its own military force, and the world is on the way to acquiring a new superstate in addition to the USA. To be sure, it has been agreed that the EU army is not really an EU army at all because it is not on a permanent basis, but then nor are NATO armed forces or a Eurocorps on a permanent basis either. The EU army is the same, in having a command structure of troops and hardware to be deployed on a variety of tasks. Let us call a spade a spade and an EU army an EU army. With its own currency, police force and military, the EU is to dispose of the resources normally pertaining to a Nation State. The EU already has more legislative power than other federations, and the essence of the next treaty will be more majority decision making. We are on the way from a confederation to a federal State, but this is still only the last but one treaty before the drafting of a constitution for just such a federal State, for no-one is going to give up the right of veto in regard to the amendment of the Treaties, the levying of new taxes and the sending of soldiers off to war. </p>
<p class="contents">The next treaty too will contain familiar echoes of the nation States of old. France and Britain will not be submitting their nuclear weapons to EU control. We are to get a quasi-federal confederation dominated by the three biggest countries, Europe’s former great powers. Enlargement will not take the form of negotiations concerned with creating a common, democratic Europe. The first requirement of enlargement is that the Eastern and Central European countries discard everything they themselves have decided and replace it with the European Union’s common legislation, the sacred and universal <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. Their newly won right to deliberate on new laws in elected parliaments is to be transferred to negotiators behind more closed doors in Brussels. Their electors and elected representatives are to surrender power to officials and ministers. Democracy, for them, is to become the exception rather than the rule, as has also happened in our own case. </p>
<p class="contents">Matters need not reach this pass. We must hope that there are people who dare to say no to the penultimate treaty before the drafting of an actual constitution and who dare to prepare the ground for replacing regimentation and centralism with a Europe of democracies and diversites. Following this criticism, I should just like to commend the Finnish Presidency for having promoted the cause of openness by means of the Presidency’s new home pages. These have been very useful, and I hope that the Portuguese Presidency will take its cue from this initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What struck me first as I studied the final document last weekend was its order of priority. I understand perfectly well that the enlargement of the Union must be given priority in the wake of the upbeat tempo adopted by the Commission for the new accession strategy. However, I would have considered it wiser for an enlargement Summit to give precedence to the matters facing the intergovernmental conference, thereby emphasising that even the tiniest enlargement will not work unless outstanding institutional questions are solved.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I was pleased to see that Helsinki resisted both the temptation and the intensive lobbying of the Commission and Parliament and basically concentrated the agenda of the intergovernmental conference on the famous Amsterdam leftovers. This should ensure that other topics will not be dealt with until these have been wrapped up. Improvements on Amsterdam in the institutional area not only concern fundamental matters, they also call for tremendous effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether or not the decision on Turkey was for the greater good of the Union and Turkey, only time will tell. We very much doubt it. By contrast, the progress made with the CFSP was extremely positive, even if it failed to answer a number of fundamental questions, including some of significance to Austria. The current situation shows how vital progress is in this area. The Union may well be seething inwardly, but in truth it stands paralysed and helpless in the face of events in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as employment policy is concerned, I expect more from the promised economic recovery, from the upswing, than from the action plans on paper.</p>
<p class="contents">But, all in all, Helsinki achieved an interesting result! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although I am therefore satisfied with the Finnish Government’s strong grasp of leadership and the fact that either considerable progress was made with the key issues or they were finally resolved, it is clear that the good results of the Presidency stem from the desire by the whole of the Union to develop a common European structure. If I also mention various disappointments, I am not blaming the Finnish Presidency for them: certain matters simply need more consideration; along the same tracks run trains of varying speed, and the heaviest loads are often the slowest.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very satisfied with the progress made on a common dimension for crisis management and defence. The bases for the security of people in a democratic Union that is committed to a market economy and respect for the principle of the rule of law are economic growth, increased employment, internal security to combat crime, and a common foreign, political and military security system.</p>
<p class="contents">The extension of Union enlargement to all thirteen countries ended the artificial split between the applicant countries. I would say that the decision on Turkish candidacy for membership will furthermore induce this large and important country to determine for itself whether it will ever achieve membership.</p>
<p class="contents">The northern dimension was overshadowed by the open crises in Kosovo and Chechnya. I share with Mr Lipponen’s hope that Russia will become a more successful member of the global community, which would make cross-border cooperation possible on Russia’s northern border with the Union and thus give substance to the northern dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision to promote all the possibilities of information technology to improve the Union’s competitiveness and the aim to take Europe to the number one position in the world as an information society player are both essential ingredients in the promotion of economic security. In this area, Commissioner Liikanen will have both an interesting and mighty task ahead of him.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the disappointments we must once again include certain important issues with regard to the development of the single market and the Union’s decision-making system. The tax package, even a nodding glance at the harmonisation of taxes, failed. The idea of a European limited company could not be taken forward, and the illegal beef war in Europe continues.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to raise a small but, in my own area, important matter. Where did WADA (the World Anti Doping Agency) disappear to, beyond the reach of the Union, and the watchdog on sports-related illness and the doctor, which Commissioner Viviane Reding reported on 1 December, and in which the Union was to have a key role? Do the Member States not fear the present and future skeletons in their own cupboards in wishing to keep the main responsibility for themselves within the territory of the Union?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The meeting showed the way for development in Europe far into the future. The European Union will move beyond its borders once and for all at the start of the next millennium. The progress made from the start of talks with the six new candidates for membership, and the acceptance of Turkey as a candidate for membership has been an inevitable part of the European policy to reinforce stability and strengthen prosperity in our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time we have to give yet more consideration to how ready the EU itself is for enlargement and what sort of timetable might be involved. The pace of enlargement has to be in accordance with how prepared both the applicant countries and the EU itself are. Otherwise, we will all be sorely disappointed. The future challenges of an enlarged EU, or even one the present size, will not be solved at the next IGC. We have to prepare for a wider agenda now. However, it was important to decide on a new IGC to resolve the questions which were unresolved at Amsterdam. The Helsinki meeting also bore witness to the fact that there is a need for a broader adoption of the rules for qualified majority voting.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite failures at Helsinki, we have to move on quickly to find a solution to the tax issue. We will not be able to prevent even greater inequality in societies and among people unless profits from capital are subject to a minimum rate of taxation within the entire single market area. The European Parliament has continually called for greater transparency for all the EU institutions. A lack of transparency has been a particular source of trouble for decision making in the Council, and Finland, as the country holding the Presidency, has initiated new practices to increase transparency, practices which we would hope will become established before proper rules are drafted. We also made headway on environmental matters. The integration of environmental policy with all policy areas and making it feasible to sign the Kyoto Agreement more quickly were important steps forward. But one disappointment has to be recorded for this autumn: the failure to review the rules for Members and assistants. I know, of course, that the Presidency is not to blame for this. The Presidency has been active and willing to find compromises; the problems and guilty parties are unfortunately to be found in this Chamber.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Now, I am wondering, President Prodi, how you can be so happy when the Commission is practically being reduced to the role of report-provider on the most varied subjects, and clearly does not have a central role in the decisions or initiatives, in respect of both the Intergovernmental Conference and the CFSP. I am also very surprised that as someone who has been speaking to us since September about the importance of a comprehensive reform and his willingness on this matter with regard to the Council, today you are pleased that a comprehensive agenda has not been drawn up. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my wish that the Members think carefully before accepting Parliament’s opinion on the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference – which is the only, extremely weak tool we have – and that they try, in all ways possible, to convince the Commission that it is necessary to agree to have clear discussions with the Council and its members – including Italian, Belgian and French members, whose speeches on this subject have been, so to speak, a little modest – in order to take the decisions on the future of the European Union out of the hands of diplomats and national governments. I think that pretending everything is going well, when the choice that has been made goes decidedly in the direction of enlarging the Union without deepening it, is profoundly wrong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At any rate, his Ministry of Truth or the principles behind it have survived him. Now, we no longer talk about war; we talk about humanitarian campaigns. And an army is not called an army; 60 000 armed soldiers are a humanitarian rapid reaction corps. In spite of the fact that the Finnish Presidency has been genuinely enthusiastic in its efforts to promote openness, the Commission has produced a document containing its own, Orwellian, notions of openness. Openness applies only to a very limited extent and not if you ask for it too often, for example as a journalist, and intend to publish the information in question and thus actually sell newspapers. In that case, openness does not apply.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey has also been processed by the Ministry of Truth. It has now become more democratic, even if the Kurds and Turks continue to be oppressed. Yesterday’s debate here in the Chamber concerning European culture was quite a disagreeable experience. It was the debate which arose out of Turkey’s status as an applicant country. What is our common European culture? I want to say at once that I have very little in common culturally with Jörg Haider in Austria or Mr Le Pen in France or, for that matter, with my own countryman, Mogens Camre in Denmark. I feel I have much stronger cultural ties with progressive Turks and Kurds who are fighting for justice, freedom and democracy, and I am looking forward to the day when they can be welcomed into a European working partnership. I am looking forward to Europe’s beginning to take its multi-ethnic culture seriously, but as long as the death sentence against Mr Öçalan<span class="italic"> </span>is still in force, this is quite the wrong moment to send the Turkish Government a signal to the effect that Turkey is welcome as an applicant country </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this respect, we would point out moreover, that the issue of dangerous and obsolete nuclear power plants is still unresolved. Moreover, Parliament has already taken a position on this. It is just as obvious though, that enlargement in the envisaged timeframe does not allow either for the immediate creation of a common foreign policy or the drawing-up of an economic policy programme, even though the latter is very urgent, especially in the light of the recovery of the dollar against the euro and the disappointing results of Seattle. </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is with regret that we must tailor our former hopes to current requirements, and the only solution seems to be to undertake a new type of agreement, within the Union and before it accepts new members, countries which have the same interest in a Common Foreign and Defence Policy, in common laws that will guarantee the fight against crime, drugs, uncontrolled immigration, countries that want to regain their common right to campaign against violations of human rights by taking active steps to combat cruelty and genocide. </p>
<p class="contents">The choice made at Helsinki to set up one of the first units of a European army is heading in the right direction and must be supported by Parliament, in the hope that the initiative will not stop at this first step. This hypothesis, which we are putting forward in the hope that those who agree with the same objectives are finally starting to discuss possible new agreements, must not be confused with the notion of a multi-speed Europe, but should instead be thought of as a two-tiered Union. We are proposing a political level for the current Member States which choose to make a great leap forward in this sector, and a second, economic level for the fifteen current Member States and the new members. </p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, with time, anyone who makes the request and meets the requirements will be able to take their place at the political level, but today, if we do not proceed quickly in this direction and consider enlarging by almost doubling the number of Member States without well thought out and tested institutional reforms – there is no time left to test them out – we are sounding the death knoll for the dream of a political Union which is able to respect identities, cultures and traditions, but nevertheless contributes to the creation of a new model of European citizen. It is clear that for some, enlargement does not mean strengthening the Union but watering it down, marking the end of the hopes of our founding fathers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to extend an invitation to the Commission so that it avoids continuing to propose measures on asparagus and lupins and instead seeks to give us a political and economic plan before it becomes a laughing stock. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel the matter of the status that the two Members of Parliament will have at the Intergovernmental Conference is quite intolerable. We cannot accept it, and our President should make this known. This is the status of NGO. Do we wish to be and to continue to be an NGO? We would be, like the NGOs, mere observers. I think it high time that Parliament knew how to say no to this state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, I find your memory rather selective, ladies and gentlemen. At Amsterdam, the conference concluded with the fact that if we were to number more than 20 members, we should have to implement at least three reforms. This is no longer the scenario. The current scenario envisages 27 Member States and yet more in the years to come, requiring much, much more far-reaching reforms. By accepting these conclusions, we are making ourselves, Council and Parliament, accessories to a policy which will prove to be extremely serious in the years to come, and which will bring the entire European Union to a halt.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament cannot pretend it does not understand or that it is not aware of this policy. We cannot, as some of my fellow Members have said, consider that we can discuss matters with the Portuguese Presidency when we already know there is a majority in the Council ready to oppose adding items to the agenda. We must use the only weapon available to us, and if Mr Barnier does not agree to call it an all out strike, then let us call it resistance. In any case, we cannot defer until June the battle that we must wage in January.</p>
<p class="contents">Our problem is the opinion which we must deliver prior to the start of the Intergovernmental Conference, i.e. as early as January. We could, of course, act complacently, we could pretend to close our eyes and to believe that we might convince the Portuguese Presidency, which in turn may convince the other Member States. We can delude ourselves. We have already done so often enough. Now, perhaps, it is time for Parliament to wake up.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards enlargement, I think we are insulting a number of countries, without even being aware of it. We extended candidacy to Turkey. This is fine, even if, as always, it was done too late. But we are abandoning countries such as Albania, Macedonia and Croatia, even though there is no reason to abandon them, since we decided that each country might enter the Union when it has implemented the necessary reforms. We must extend candidacy to these countries as a matter of urgency, just as, as a matter of urgency, we must recognise that Chechnya is not located somewhere on the moon, but in a region of Europe, in the Transcaucasus. It is a matter of urgency that Europe should have a policy worthy of the name in this region, otherwise, just like the Balkans over the last ten years, we shall see it becoming a region of war and destruction, as is already the case in Chechnya today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council together with the Commission or the applicant themselves? The diplomatic urgent mission undertaken by Messrs Solana and Verheugen points towards an interesting answer to this question.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is a state of affairs that indicates very clearly how strained mutual relations between Athens and Ankara still are. Indeed it was above all Greek pre-conditions in respect of Turkey’s candidacy – think of the Cyprus question and border disputes in the Aegean Sea in particular – that prompted Messrs Solana and Verheugen to hurriedly take to the air in the direction of Prime Minister Ecevit. And rumour has it that it was only because of American intervention that the Turkish coalition government eventually accepted the European promotion.</p>
<p class="contents">Who in Europe actually has cause to be pleased at this odd approach? Particularly now that Prime Minister Ecevit is going to stick to his guns regarding the political division of Cyprus, not to mention one of the most crucial, implicit accession requirements for Turkey: voluntary renunciation on the part of the country’s formidable military apparatus of its considerable political power.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyhow, it is characteristic of the situation that Prime Minister Ecevit rightly pointed to the great geo-strategic importance of his fatherland vis-à-vis the West. An argument that certainly gains force in the light of Russia’s barbaric, imperial pacification tactics in Chechnya. However, it is for NATO alone, not the European Union, to secure military balance and counterbalance in the turbulent Caucasus region.</p>
<p class="contents">We count amongst the positive results of the Summit the fact that candidate status for membership of the EU was accepted for five more Eastern European States and the Council’s statement, or rather its clear exhortation to Russia’s political leaders. Sadly enough, ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, ten years after the spectacular revolution in Central and Eastern Europe, fear of Moscow continues to cause the nations of this region to seek security <span class="italic">and</span> economic prosperity in the West. This state of affairs is every bit as deserving of Mr Solana and a European Commissioner undertaking an urgent mission to the Kremlin. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, European security policy must be seen as one of the failures of the European Community in the light of its reaction to the centres of conflict in Chechnya and Grozny. We as a European Union will only gain credibility with the outside world and with our own people once we stop making too much of a distinction between various centres of conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the problems as I see it, however, is in relation to the human rights of the various minorities within the Union, especially with regard to freedom of worship. There are still huge differences within the European Member States as far as the recognition of religious minorities is concerned. For example, it is at present practically impossible for Orthodox Jewish communities in Germany to set themselves up as an independent community.

I am not going to repeat them. But, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you also said that the Helsinki Summit did not deliver the goods. I thought that was a very apt way of characterising the situation. I shall just cite three disappointing outcomes.</p>
<p class="contents">My first example is the IGC. Mr Poettering has rightly already pointed out that the three Amsterdam leftovers do in fact represent a very minimal package, and in particular, that the question of qualified majority decision making is still a major point of discussion in the Council. The door is already slightly ajar, but on no account must we lose sight of the fact that the Helsinki Summit failed to adopt the recommendations of the Committee of Wise Men under the direction of Mr Dehaene following the excellent proposals prepared by the European Commission under the direction of Commissioner Barnier. This was a very disappointing development in my view and so I really hope that the Commission and Parliament are in a position to convince the Portuguese Council Presidency that we need to go a little further than is the case at present.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course security is another area that still needs to be properly resolved. What exactly is Mr Solana’s role and what is the European Commission’s role? If you take a look at the annexes then what you will see are numerous questions relating to the whole issue of democratic control. What does the European Parliament intend to do? What do the national parliaments intend to do?</p>
<p class="contents">The taxation package certainly was not a key issue but then how can you face the citizens with the news that after so many years the slight increase in taxation of capital that we need is still outstanding. Three thousand jobs are given priority in one Member State but not in others. That is not what solidarity is all about and neither is it something we can defend. I therefore hope that Mr Prodi will take the lead during the next Presidency, so as to ensure that the Member States get the message at long last. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a cheque made out to the future and, to be frank, neither you nor we know how we can honour it. After the unanimous vote on the enlargement process, no further doubt can or will be cast on the seriousness of our intentions and of Turkey’s intention to meet the Copenhagen criteria as quickly as possible. It is the will of the Helsinki Summit that the European Union should number 28 Member States in a few years’ time. However, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, a number of questions then arise as to the scope of the decisions which have been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Do you really believe that, once the Amsterdam leftovers have been cleared up, our Union will still have the power to act and will still be transparent and democratic with 27 or 28 Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">Do you really believe that we can maintain the present language rules in our institutions with 15, 16, 17 or 18 languages? Do you believe that we can maintain the present internal modus operandi of our institutions, of the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission and the balance between them with 27 or 28 Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">Do you really believe that Turkey, the European country with the largest population and a long history its own, will merely join the European Union as its 28th Member State rather than changing the very nature of it? Do we not need a plan for moving the Schengen borders to the Euphrates and Tigris? Do we not need a plan for dealing with accession applications received by the European Union from the States of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus in the wake of the Helsinki decision? And for dealing with Russia if we receive accession applications from the States of that region? I trust that we will find the flexibility within the European Union, the flexibility which has so far completely eluded us – what we previously described as flexibility notwithstanding – in order to safeguard the cohesion of the European Union. I trust that we shall, over coming years, find the strength and the courage to answer these questions and to find answers of our own before others find them for us.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why we intervened in Kosovo where an odious regime was in the process of driving out a whole people; and that is why we were delighted when Indonesia’s atrocities in East Timor were eventually brought to an end. But now we are seeing, in Chechnya, ruthless state terror directed against an entire population. We see an army combating terrorism by razing towns to the ground and causing hundreds of thousands of people to flee. We see a government and a presidential candidate courting popularity by pounding what they perceive as the Chechen enemy into the ground, and we see how, in the election campaign in Russia, there is almost no opposition to this cruel strategy. </p>
<p class="contents">In the EU, we have been too weak in our protests and with our sanctions and, in that way, have betrayed the liberal and democratic forces in Russia. Thanks are due to the Council for the fact that it is now finally speaking plainly about Russia’s flagrant breach of a whole range of international obligations. It is now a question of the Council’s honouring its words. Everything must be done to enable us to help bring this barbarism to an end and to ensure that vital humanitarian aid is provided to hundreds of thousands of civilians. This century has been terrible enough, but the end of the century has also been full of promise. The issue where Chechnya is concerned is really one of whether this is to be the last tragic convulsion of an unhappy century or the start of a new century which is just as tragic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much attention has been paid in the discussion to the Intergovernmental Conference and the need to reform the Treaties. At the European Council in Helsinki it was the Council’s opinion that a decision on the Intergovernmental Conference should be arrived at quite quickly, and, if possible, by the end of next year, so that there will be time to ratify the agreements and enlargement can get under way.</p>

But that too is a huge question of principle, and after we have drafted this agenda it will then be met with the differing opinions of Member States. However, the door has been left open a crack and at the Intergovernmental Conference the discussion will turn to whether we need to raise other important matters relating to amendments to Treaties, so that the European Council can debate this issue again.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention another consideration here: do we believe that enlargement should be postponed? As I understand it, we are facing such constitutional questions with regard to Treaty changes that, as national parliaments ratify these sorts of decisions, we will have to have sufficient time to debate the issues in the Member States and we will have to involve national parliaments in these reforms. That will not be an easy task. I fully acknowledge this and I would like to thank Romano Prodi, the President of the Commission, for having had the courage to raise these matters. They are important for the future of Europe. They have to be discussed in the near future but we cannot do everything at once, and that is the problem here. The issue of language is an example of something that must be discussed with maturity and courage. As a representative of a small country I can say that we have to be prepared.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been much discussion here on security and defence policy. To the question of whether defence ministers should come here, I cannot say no, but I would point out that the General Affairs Council handles these matters, and so defence ministers can participate if need be. It is quite understandable and necessary that the European Parliament should wish to focus attention on these matters, and I agree with Mr Poettering that we should not dilly-dally in this. For that reason, in Finland we are most satisfied that we were able, during the Finnish Presidency, to have a decision on this in such a ready state that we will have a policy on the matter from now on. Perhaps Mr Seppänen has not read the Treaty of Amsterdam. We are acting within the framework of the Treaty of Amsterdam in this matter. The Helsinki conclusions state that there is no question of a European army, and we are not really creating any sort of crisis management capability or crisis management force that would go out warmongering.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Suominen raised the issue of the northern dimension. In this matter we achieved Finland’s goal, as the country to hold the presidency, which was that agreed by the Member States and the partnership countries at a conference in Helsinki on a previous occasion for the drafting of an action programme. The European Council in Helsinki reconfirmed this. In Finland, we are obviously satisfied with this, but once again I would like to stress that in Europe we have a southern, eastern and western dimension, just as much as a northern one. They are all issues we have in common. The northern dimension is very much about long-term effective cooperation with Russia, which is a great advantage for us both and absolutely irrespective of what is happening in Russia and Chechnya at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject of sport has been raised here. Where did sport get to at the Summit? Sport is without doubt socially significant and an important thing for millions of Europeans. I consider it necessary to return to this subject. It is obviously a question of competence and the fact that here issues are discussed from many points of view. There is the point of view of the single market – we will recall the Bosman case – and there is the point of view of health, which is related to the issue of dope testing. On the whole this matter should be prepared for debate, and the European Council, for that reason, did not want to adopt a position on this in the conclusions, as the necessary preparatory work and debate were lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as a sort of legacy of the Finnish Presidency, I hope that all the institutions of the Union will take the issue of transparency and good governance seriously. I understand that we are dealing with different cultures. No country can say that they do things best. We must understand one another, but the direction must clearly be towards greater transparency. When we were putting the Treaty of Amsterdam together, Finland’s idea and suggestion, which was accepted, was that transparency should be the first principle, and there should be exceptions made to it and not the other way round. It is also in this spirit that we should prepare matters for debate in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Interinstitutional balance is very important. We Finns, in discharging our duties as President, gained a lot of experience of this, and I would hope that instead of the institutions competing with one another regarding who has achieved what and who was first, we can concentrate more on cooperation, because that is what we need. Each institution has a very important job to do. From the point of view of a small country we need a strong Commission. We should have the sort of Council that functions well and in which the main objective is the common interest. The European Parliament then has to oversee all this. Here new ideas can be put forward. This is a forum in which Europeans meet to discuss the important issues of the future. On behalf of Finland, I would again like to thank everyone for all the support we have been given by all the institutions and all the Member States of the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">I can see that there is an almost unanimous feeling of disappointment over the failed agreement on tax matters, and I believe that the reasons for this are broadly shared. There was also almost universal agreement about Chechnya and the need for us not to have double standards in our foreign policy, but to reassert the principles which are the cornerstone of the European Union. Moreover, there is a generally favourable opinion of the European Union’s rapid intervention force, even if there were some who disagreed over this. It has always been the tradition to disagree, not only in the European Parliament but also in many national parliaments, when it comes to issues relating in some way to military matters, and the possibility of having a European army. </p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to comment briefly on the more controversial subject of the Intergovernmental Conference. I have to say that the Commission is not in any way being excluded from decisions on the Intergovernmental Conference, and I also have to say that Parliament’s role has been increased, with respect to Amsterdam, even if the progress is less than stated by the Commission and the President of Parliament during the Helsinki debate. But some progress has been made, and we can analyse it objectively: two representatives of the European Parliament will participate in all the talks and will be able to intervene at the beginning and end of each meeting at the Intergovernmental Conference; in addition, in each meeting of this type there will be talks between the President of Parliament and the Heads of State and Government. This is minimal progress, but I assure you – and this is the important message I want to give you – that in this area, the Commission and the President of Parliament have taken the same line on increasing the presence of Parliament itself. I think that this is a route we should pursue. We must therefore say that the direction we have been heading in is the right one, even though the pace is extremely slow compared with the pace we had set ourselves. However, we must not only look to the past: this is some advice, a lesson with a view what we have to do in the coming six months. </p>
<p class="contents">Leaving the door open as regards the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference also provides an opportunity for the Commission and Parliament to cooperate in bringing in the reforms that we want via that door. Before the Helsinki Conference, the door was closed; its opening is not, of course, a particularly significant result, but it is a lot more than we had expected and a lot more than was going to be allowed before the start of the Conference. We must therefore learn a lesson as regards working together over the coming months. We need to cooperate closely, precisely because it is through this door that the necessary reforms can come. </p>
<p class="contents">As for the rest, I will conclude with an observation on enlargement. It is true, as Mr<span class="bold"> </span>Poettering said, that time will tell whether or not it will be historic, but the decision is an important one. As a consequence of this decision, we shall have to change a large number of our rules and current points of reference; we shall have to change a lot about our life, our culture, our budgets, our positions – everything we are doing.<span class="bold"> </span>It is a decision which has yet to be implemented. On the other hand, it is clear that it will take years and a thorough analysis, because we need to reassure the public in the countries that are joining the Union, by showing them the real situation here, and making an accurate and serious comparison of legal, economic, political and transparency issues. In short, we have started a process that will take us to an historic conclusion. We have not yet reached it, but what we decided at Helsinki will have an enormous bearing on the work of Parliament and the work of the European Commission. This is another area we must work on together so that a virtuous circle will come of it, and so that politics as well as the economy – both ours and of the countries that have applied for membership – can grow together and expand in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
