<p class="contents">Question No 18 by <span class="bold">Brian Crowley </span>(H−0032/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Sustaining European cities</span></p>
<p class="contents">Following the holding of an EU‐supported international congress on energy and sustainability for European cities of the future (17 to 19 January 1999), will the Council outline the ways in which the conclusions of this congress may be used for the benefit of EU citizens generally, and does it intend to propose new policies as a result of the work of the congress and, if so, what are these policies and how, specifically, will citizens in Cork in Ireland benefit from them?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Conference referred to by the honourable Member on energy and sustainability for European cities of the future was organised by the Commission between 17 and 19 January 1999 in Athens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the first in a series of information awareness events initiated by the Commission following the adoption, in December last year, of the 5th Research Framework Programme of the EC. As such, it aims at enhancing knowledge of policy makers and research actors in selected areas and is not intended to give rise to new policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member will be aware that the specific programme ‘Energy, environment and sustainable development' adopted under the 5th Framework Programme contains a key action ‘City of tomorrow and cultural heritage' which provides for rational management of resources, including energy efficiency and conservation, for new technologies of the built environment, for new strategies for transport systems and for the protection and conservation of cultural heritage in an urban context. </p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<p class="contents">Question No 48 by <span class="bold">Konstantinos Hatzidakis </span>(H−0010/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Fourth EU‐Cyprus financial protocol</span></p>
<p class="contents">One of the objectives of the fourth EU‐Cyprus financial protocol is to support initiatives aimed at a settlement of the political problem in Cyprus by funding programmes which will benefit both communities. Unfortunately, however, the intransigence so far displayed by the Turkish Cypriots and the terms they have laid down (a freeze on the application for EU membership and recognition of the self‐styled ‘state') have not made it possible to use the appropriations concerned. In view of the fact that the fourth financial protocol is due to be extended for a year, does the Commission not think that the time has come to approve proposals for projects such as setting up a bicommunal radio station, the construction of a desalination plant and funding of a bicommunal, bilingual magazine (Khate/Hade), which will in fact benefit both communities and do not require the consent of the Turkish Cypriot side?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission is well aware of the delays in using the appropriations under the fourth financial protocol with Cyprus, and regrets the lack of support for initiatives aimed at settling the conflict in Cyprus and for the implementation of bicommunal projects making it possible to bring together the two Cypriot communities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission thanks the honourable Member for his proposals on what action to take and, of course, confirms its support for projects which will bring the two communities together, such as the publication of the bicommunal, bilingual magazine, Hade.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it draws Parliament"s attention to the fact that there are no plans to put the fourth financial protocol on ice; on the contrary, it has been decided to extend it until the end of 1999, for the very reason that this will allow the funds set aside in the Community budget to be used for the purpose of bringing together the two communities living on the island.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wishes to emphasise that, subject to the agreement of the Cypriot authorities, it is willing to back a programme in support of civil society in Cyprus, which will help to fund initiatives run by non‐governmental organisations in both communities seeking to integrate them within a bicommunal and bizonal federation. Moreover, it has decided to support the restoration of the Tekke mosque in Larnaca. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 49 by <span class="bold">Niall Andrews </span>(H−0041/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Charter of Fundamental Rights</span></p>
<p class="contents">The German Presidency has indicated its wish to establish an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">How does the Commission envisage the objectives, application, scope and enforcement of such a Charter?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">For the past 20 years, the European Commission has regarded the definition of the values which are at the very heart of European integration as a priority issue. It therefore warmly welcomes the initiative taken by the German Presidency of the Council which seeks to establish a European Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considered the option of a European Charter as long ago as 1979, when doubts were expressed as to the democratic legitimacy of the Community legal order on the grounds of the lack of explicit references to human rights and democracy. At that time, the Commission presented two options: the establishment of a separate Charter or accession to the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The second option was selected, on the grounds that accession would pose fewer problems and that it could be achieved over a shorter period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">That attempt came to naught because the Communication, presented by the Commission to the Council in November 1990, in which it sought a negotiating mandate defining the procedures for such accession, was not approved by the Council. In April 1994, the Council sought the opinion of the Court of Justice. In March 1996, the Court ruled on the compatibility of accession to that Convention with the Treaty establishing the European Community, finding that the Community did not have the power to accede to that Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the aforegoing, the Commission takes the view that the German Presidency's wish to establish a <span class="italic">European Charter of Fundamental Rights</span> is very interesting because it bears in mind not only past experience but also future prospects, in that it takes account of</p>
<p class="contents">‐ the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which enshrines respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms among the principles on which the European Union is founded and refers explicitly to the European Convention on that subject, and</p>
<p class="contents">‐ the Vienna Strategy for Europe, set out in the Conclusions of the Presidency of the Vienna European Council (11‐12 December 1998), which includes firmer European action in the field of human rights among the ‘four issues of primary concern to European citizens where rapid and efficient action is necessary'.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to cooperate fully with a view to facilitating progress on this initiative in its various stages of more detailed consideration of the definition of the objectives and, in due course, of its implementation. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 50 by <span class="bold">Anna Karamanou </span>(H−0046/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Pollution of the River Nestos by radioactive waste from Bulgaria</span></p>
<p class="contents">Those responsible for the implementation of the PHARE programme in Bulgaria estimate that there is a risk that twelve million cubic metres of radioactive waste from mining activity in the now disused uranium mines in the Eleznitsa region some 90 kilometres from the Greek‐Bulgarian border may leak into the bed of the River Nestos and reach the Greek coast. Although mining ceased some eight years ago, the small dams of the artificial lakes containing the radioactive waste could collapse in the event of a natural disaster, polluting the water of the river and contaminating the groundwater in the surrounding region and eventually reaching the Mediterranean. Will the Commission say how it intends to intervene to avert the threat of pollution of the region and protect the groundwater and the ecological balance of the natural environment of this EU region?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been tackling the problems with former uranium mines in all the Central and Eastern European countries concerned for several years now, using multinational PHARE funding and, more specifically in Bulgaria, as part of the national PHARE programmes. The overall objective is to create a database on the subject and promote remediation projects.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, a study on the measures which need to be taken to remediate the Eleznitsa site, in the south of Bulgaria, has just been completed. The Eleznitsa site consisted of a mine and a processing site, which are no longer used. The conclusions of the study have been the subject of an in‐depth debate between the Bulgarian and Greek authorities, in particular within the joint planning and monitoring committee, in the context of Bulgaria‐Greece cross‐border cooperation programmes (PHARE CBC‐Interreg programmes). These conclusions recommend that work should be carried out to limit the risk, in the event of a natural disaster, of the dam holding back the mine tailings bursting, and releasing them into the Mesta (Nestos) basin.</p>
<p class="contents">At its last meeting, which was held on 11 and 12 January 1999 in Sofia, the joint planning and monitoring committee proposed funding this project in 1999; the costs are estimated at around EUR 12 million.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the committee proposal, the Bulgarian authorities have started preparing a project which will be examined as part of the 1999 PHARE cross‐border cooperation financing proposal. Subject to a favourable decision from the Commission on the funding, the Bulgarian authorities think that work would be able to start as early as the year 2000. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 51 by <span class="bold">Maj Theorin </span>(H−0062/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Environmental brigades</span></p>
<p class="contents">The end of the Cold War has profoundly changed the security situation in the world. Serious new threats to our security have arisen in the form of environmental dangers, streams of refugees, ethnic conflicts, terrorism and international crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission intend to conduct a study of environmental threats which have implications for security in Europe and to develop plans for European protection teams from the military sector to be deployed in environmental emergencies?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission has no competence in military affairs. For this reason it has not developed plans for the use of military forces in an environmental crisis situation nor does it plan to carry out a study on such an eventuality.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would look favourably upon suggestions leading to increased cooperation with member states or international organisations which are competent in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of an emergency and as part of the Petersberg tasks, military units of WEU member states, acting under the authority of the WEU, could be employed for humanitarian and rescue tasks. Naturally such an arrangement would require a WEU Council decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally a series of expert information contacts between the Commission and NATO have been initiated recently. One of the subjects to be initially covered is reaction to civil emergencies. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 52 by <span class="bold">Marialiese Flemming </span>(H−0068/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Possible Euratom loans for two Ukrainian nuclear power stations</span></p>
<p class="contents">The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is currently processing an application for loans to the Ukrainian power undertaking Energoatom for the completion of two nuclear power stations, at Khmelnitsky (No 2 reactor) and Rovno (No 4 reactor) – K2/R4 for short.</p>
<p class="contents">What stage has the procedure reached?</p>
<p class="contents">How does the Commission assess the safety of K2/R4, and should not the granting of EU funds to the Ukraine be dependent on the same nuclear safety standards as apply to the countries applying for EU membership?</p>
<p class="contents">On what criteria will these loans be granted or refused?</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission agree that these funds could be better spent in improving the economic and social situation in the Ukraine?</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Ukraine receiving aid to renovate and upgrade its fossil fuel power stations, with environmental and emission considerations in mind? If not, would it not be wise to give it such aid?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) agreed between the G7 countries, the EC and Ukraine (Ottawa, 20.12.1995) develops a comprehensive programme to support the decision of Ukraine to close Chernobyl by the year 2000. The MOU addresses the restructuring of the power sector, an energy investment programme, nuclear safety and social issues related to the closure of Chernobyl. The K24R project is part of this wide action plan intimately linked to the closure of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The challenge with this project is therefore to close dangerous reactors and to replace them by two new reactors upgraded to a safety level equivalent to that in the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worthwhile to recall here the major effort the Community is undertaking to rebuild the sarcophagus around the destroyed unit 4.</p>
<p class="contents">1. The application for a Euratom loan for the completion and upgrading of the two reactors at Khmelnitsky and Rovno is under consideration by the Commission since 1994. At present all the necessary studies and consultations concerning nuclear safety, environmental impact, economic and financial aspects have practically been completed, so that the decision can be taken in the near future (April). This will be done in parallel with the EBRD which also has to decide on a loan for the same project.</p>
<p class="contents">2. On the basis of relevant assessments made in the framework of the loan application, in particular by a Member States Expert Group, the Commission considers that the safety upgrading programme as envisaged for these reactors will contribute to achieve the overall objective of a safety level in accordance with international standards.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as applicant countries are concerned, the Commission applies the same principle to any project for which a Euratom loan application is received.</p>
<p class="contents">3. The criteria to be applied by the Commission when deciding on a Euratom loan are defined in the Council Decision 94/179/Euratom of 21 March 1994. For a project to be eligible, it must have received all the necessary authorisation by the competent national authority, of Ukraine in this case, and a favourable opinion from the Commission in economic and technical terms.</p>
<p class="contents">4. The Commission considers that the completion of K2R4 complements other efforts undertaken by the international community to improve the restructuring of the energy sector and, hence, more generally the economic and social situation of Ukraine. Through the closure of Chernobyl, this project will also increase nuclear safety in the country and in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">5. There is a substantial support already provided to Ukraine for the modernisation of its fossil power plants as part of the comprehensive plan agreed in the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the G7 countries and the Commission and Ukraine. This includes loans of the World Bank, the EBRD and bilateral programmes (USD 1.1 billion under implementation, USD 1 billion under preparation). The Community has supported this effort through technical assistance under the TACIS programme (EUR 70 million of grant money).</p>
<p class="contents">6. The Commission will supply shortly a detailed file to the EP in order to keep it fully informed on this project.</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 53 by <span class="bold">Joan Vallvé </span>(H−0069/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: The PHARE‐CBC Programme</span></p>
<p class="contents">Under Article B7‐502 of the 1999 budget relating to the PHARE‐CBC Programme, two‐thirds of the appropriation involved will be applied at the external borders of the EU and one‐third at the other borders of the applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The need to make the external borders of the EU more watertight is essential if the integration of the CEECs is to be facilitated.</p>
<p class="contents">When a programme for cross‐border cooperation under the PHARE programmes is next implemented, will the same proportions apply?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The new regulation concerning the PHARE cross‐border cooperation (CBC) programme, adopted by the Commission on 18 December 1998, aims at consolidating and updating the PHARE CBC programme initiated in 1994, and seeks to take better account of the enhanced pre‐accession strategy. It will bring PHARE CBC closer to Interreg, notably through: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ the set up of joint programming structures involving partners from both sides of the border, </p>
<p class="contents">‐ the elaboration of joint programming documents, and</p>
<p class="contents">‐ the extension of the geographical scope of the programme: besides regions bordering the Community, borders between applicant states will also become eligible to the programme, and will thus also be given the possibility to prepare themselves for their future involvement in Interreg; furthermore, this allows also the inclusion of Romania in the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The new regulation is thus well in line with Parliament's budgetary comment, which provides that 2/3 of the budgetary appropriation will be allocated to borders between applicant states and the Community and 1/3 to the other borders of the applicant countries. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 54 by <span class="bold">Elisabeth Schroedter </span>(H−0101/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: New PHARE‐CBC regulation</span></p>
<p class="contents">In early January 1999, on a proposal from the Commission, the Council adopted a new PHARE‐CBC regulation which contains far‐reaching changes to the underlying objective of this instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is the Commission using this line for measures which could be financed with other PHARE money, and why was Parliament not consulted in the process of amending the regulation?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">A programme for cross‐border cooperation between border regions in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and adjacent regions of the Community was established in 1994 in the framework of PHARE, on the basis of Commission Regulation No 1628/94 of 4 July 1994.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this programme produced a number of positive results, further improvements became necessary. Therefore, the Commission adopted a new regulation on 18 December 1998 (Commission Regulation (EC) No 2760/98 of 18 December 1998), with the aim of consolidating and updating the programme, of taking better into account the enhanced pre‐accession strategy, and of bring PHARE CBC closer to the Structural Funds, in particular Interreg.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important changes in this regulation concern the following: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ the geographical scope of the programme has been extended, in order to also comprise, besides the borders with the Community, the borders between applicant countries themselves; this will allow these new borders to prepare themselves for their future involvement in Interreg, and Romania, as the only applicant state without a common border with the Community to become also part of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ joint programming institutions will be established and joint programming documents will be produced, involving partners from both sides of the border, on equal footing; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ local actors will become better involved in the programme, notably through the establishment of small project funds.</p>
<p class="contents">These changes will allow more genuine cross‐border cooperation, and will make the programme more balanced and effective. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 56 by <span class="bold">Agnes Schierhuber </span>(H−0098/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Nuclear power stations in the Slovak Republic</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication on the environment and enlargement to the east stipulates that the Bohunice nuclear power station in the Slovak Republic, which is obsolete and hence extremely hazardous for the people of Europe, must be decommissioned in the event of that country joining the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">What action has the Commission so far taken concerning this problem? Does it already have a specific strategy for carrying out this political pledge? Can it rule out any possibility of the shut‐down of Bohunice entailing further expansion of the hazardous reactor in Mochovce and/or of the latter being financed from Community funds?</p>
<p class="contents">What is the nature of its initiatives to expand the use of renewable energy sources in the applicant countries in general terms and, more specifically, in the Slovak Republic?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has repeatedly underlined that nuclear safety is of utmost importance in the pre‐accession process.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context the Commission has reminded the Slovak Government that the implementation of a realistic programme for the closure of the Bohunice plant is part of the Accession Partnership. On the occasion of the 5th Association Committee on 28 January 1999, the Community side emphasised again to the Slovak authorities the need to determine a realistic time frame including a date for the closure of the two WR 440‐230 reactors and the Slovak side undertook to continue discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Mochovce: In Agenda 2000 and in the Accession Partnership for Slovakia, the Commission emphasised the need for the completion of the Mochovce nuclear power plant to be according to international safety principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless the Commission has emphasised to the Slovak authorities the need to maintain very close cooperation with neighbouring countries, the Community and the IAEA in this question.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has no indications that this request is denied by Slovakia.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, in the Accession Partnership, the development and implementation of a comprehensive long‐term energy strategy based on efficiency and diversification and alignment to the <span class="italic">acquis</span> is a priority. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 61 by <span class="bold">Mary Banotti </span>(H−0043/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Ireland and CITES</span></p>
<p class="contents">Until Ireland has ratified the CITES Treaty on international trade in wildlife, the EU cannot fully implement its provisions, since Ireland is a potential loophole as an easy point of entry into the EU for illegal trade in CITES species.</p>
<p class="contents">What measures does the Commission propose to take in order to ensure full EU implementation of this Treaty?</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission press the Irish Government for a specific timetable for its ratification of the CITES Treaty?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The question of Commission action against Ireland for non‐ratification of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) does not arise for a number of reasons. In the first place, the Commission has no power or basis to compel Ireland to ratify CITES. Indeed, the Community is not itself a party to the convention. In the second place, notwithstanding the fact that, formally speaking, the Community is not a party to CITES, the Community has adopted binding regulations which mirror the CITES controls on trade in endangered species. The current regulation is Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> . The effect of these regulations is that, since January 1984, Ireland has been bound by requirements equivalent to or stronger than those of CITES. The regulations therefore ensure that Ireland's non‐ratification of CITES does not open up a potential loophole to trade in endangered species in the Community. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 62 by <span class="bold">Hugh McMahon </span>(H−0048/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Nuclear reactor shutdown at Hunterston, Scotland, in December 1998</span></p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission been informed by the Nuclear Industry Inspectorate about the failure of the electricity supply and the shutdown of the reactor at the Hunterston nuclear power station in the west of Scotland that occurred shortly after Christmas last year?</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission assure the local residents in the west of Scotland that the highest possible standards of safety are being applied at the Hunterston site, and will it give a further assurance that the nuclear industry will be encouraged to employ sufficient numbers of experienced staff capable of reacting promptly when such emergencies occur?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not received official information related to the event at Hunterston from organisations in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, inquiries have shown that the event (loss of power supplies at Hunterston power station) has been rated provisionally as level 2 ('incident') on the seven‐level International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) established at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The event was given a level 2 rating on the grounds that some safety systems did not perform their intended functions, but this did not have any on‐site or off‐site impact. There was therefore no obligation to inform the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The British Safety Authorities are responsible for licensing of nuclear power installations and the respect of safety practices existing in the United Kingdom, including the availability of required human resources and expertise. The Euratom Treaty does not give the Community responsibility for the safe operation of nuclear power plants. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 63 by <span class="bold">Paul Lannoye </span>(H−0056/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Proposed re‐opening of Boliden mine in Doñana</span></p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission share the concerns of environmental NGOs about the re‐opening of the Boliden mine in Spain, which contaminated large parts of the Coto Doñana protected wetlands last year?</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission share the view that a full risk assessment and management strategy of the mining operation and waste management plan should be prepared, together with an associated environmental statement, before re‐opening of the Boliden‐Apirsa mine is allowed? Is the Commission aware that Boliden has not satisfactorily demonstrated the safety of the old pit in terms of a new use for toxic waste when the mining recommences, or the safety of the proposed method of covering the old tailings lagoon?</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission recommend to the Spanish authorities that no approval be given for the re‐opening of the mine until a full risk assessment is completed concerning the mining operations and the associated toxic waste storage?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">Following the accident in April 1998 in the Aznalcóllar mine, worked by the company Boliden, the Commission is following any developments on this dossier closely.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the follow‐up work on the accident, regular meetings have been held between the Commission and the Spanish authorities. The latter have provided the Commission with detailed information on developments relating to this dossier. Furthermore, the Commission has asked the Spanish authorities for additional information on Boliden"s intentions regarding a possible resumption of mining. As yet, the Spanish authorities have not responded to this request for information.</p>
<p class="contents">Once it has analysed the information sent by the Spanish authorities on the possibility of mining resuming, the Commission will see to it that the relevant Community legislation on the environment is fully complied with by the Spanish authorities. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 64 by <span class="bold">Laura González Álvarez </span>(H−0073/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: EU measures to prevent accidents involving toxic waste</span></p>
<p class="contents">The disastrous spillage of toxic waste at the Boliden mine in the Doñana reserve last year was followed in January of this year by another accident involving waste in Spain, a mere 50 kilometres from Huelva, when a rupture in a pond of acidic water caused large quantities of toxic acid to spill into the sea near the River Tinto.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the impact of these spillages on the environment could have been avoided, had tighter safety measures been in place, does the Commission intend to close the legal loopholes and propose new Community legislation establishing technical standards to govern the storage of such waste? Does it intend to set up services offering technical advice on the sites, storage methods and management techniques required for toxic waste deposits?</p>
<p class="contents">At present, no central register is kept of the sites used to store waste from mining activity. Does the Commission envisage drawing up an inventory of the storage tanks located in the European Union? How does it intend to evaluate the vulnerability of the local environment, with a view to taking preventive measures to protect Nature 2000 areas and other valuable sites?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">As far as the accident in the Aznalcóllar mine, worked by the company Boliden, is concerned, the Commission refers the honourable Member to its answer to question H−0056/99, tabled by Paul Lannoye.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the recent incident of a dike bursting and releasing acidic waters in the Huelva region, the Commission is also carefully monitoring the dossier on the condition of waste depositories located near the Rincón wetlands and has recently asked the Spanish authorities for information on this accident. It is awaiting the Spanish authorities" response.</p>
<p class="contents">Waste from mines and quarries falls within the scope of Directive 75/442/EEC on waste and Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste. Under these provisions, the Member States are obliged to take the necessary measures to ensure that this waste is recycled or disposed of without endangering human health and without the use of processes or methods liable to damage the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recently began an analysis of the technical provisions and the risks associated with disposing of this waste within the Community. In the light of this analysis, the Commission will consider whether it is appropriate to launch a specific Community initiative on managing this waste from mines and quarries.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards taking preventive measures to protect Natura 2000 areas, mentioned by the honourable Member in his oral question, it should be noted that Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild flora and fauna provides that the impact of any plan or project likely to have a significant effect on the sites in the Natura 2000 network must be the subject of an appropriate assessment. The competent national authorities are under an obligation not to approve the project until they have ascertained that it will not adversely affect the integrity of the site concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 65 by <span class="bold">Mihail Papayannakis </span>(H−0063/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Community environment law</span></p>
<p class="contents">Following the welter of reasoned opinions and cases brought before the Court of Justice by the Commission against almost all the Member States for infringements of many directives or other obligations to comply with Community environment law – on which I congratulate the Commissioner responsible – will the Commission say: </p>
<p class="contents">what stage has been reached in proceedings against Greece pursuant to Article 169 of the Treaty and in which cases, </p>
<p class="contents">whether there are any specific instances in which the Court has ruled that there was failure to comply with obligations, and</p>
<p class="contents">what financial penalties it will impose on Member States which have not complied with previous rulings of the Court of Justice, e.g. Greece, which has not complied with two rulings of the Court of 11 June 1998 (cases C−232/95 and C−233/95) concerning failure to comply with Article 7 of Directive 464/76 on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment of the Community?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to thank the honourable Member for his support on the initiatives taken by the Commission over the last months in order to ensure the implementation of Community legislation in the environmental field.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission set down in its two Communications<a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> the principles concerning financial penalties to be imposed on the Member States in order to ensure implementation of court judgments.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Greece, there are in fact three infringement procedures on the basis of Article 171 of the EC Treaty: </p>
<p class="contents">a) On 17 November 1997, the Commission referred Greece to the Court of Justice, for failing to comply with the Court's judgment of 7 April 1992 concerning the lack of management plan for the Chanea region and the illegal tip at Kouroupitos<a href="#def_1_3" name="ref_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> (incorrect implementation of Directives 75/442/EEC<a href="#def_1_4" name="ref_1_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> and 78/319<a href="#def_1_5" name="ref_1_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> ). The daily penalties proposed to the Court are 24 600 Euro. These penalties would apply to each day of non‐compliance with the second judgment of the Court under Article 171.<br />b) As Greece has not taken measures to comply with the Court's judgment of 26 June 1997 (case C‐ 96/329) concerning the failure to transpose the Community's Habitats Directive<a href="#def_1_6" name="ref_1_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> , the Commission sent a reasoned opinion under Article 171 against Greece on 25.9.98.<br />c) Greece has also failed to comply with the Court's judgment of 11 June 1998 (joined cases C−232/95 and C−233/95) concerning the lack of pollution reduction programmes set up for List II substances under Article 7 of Directive 76/464/EEC<a href="#def_1_7" name="ref_1_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> for certain waters in the area of Lake Vegoritis, Soulos River and Gulf of Pagasatikos. The Commission sent a letter of formal notice under Article 171 against Greece on this issue on 18.12.98.</p>
<p class="contents">In the environmental field, in 1997 the Commission took Greece to the Court of Justice on the basis of Article 169 of the EC Treaty for failure to establish programmes for reduction of pollution by List II substances under Article 7 of Directive 76/464/EEC (case C−97/384). In addition during 1998, the Commission referred Greece to the Court for failure to transpose Directives 94/67/EC<a href="#def_1_8" name="ref_1_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a> (case C−98/338) and 91/157/EC<a href="#def_1_9" name="ref_1_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a> (case C−98/215). The Commission decided also to refer Greece to the Court for failure to transpose Directives 94/62/EC<a href="#def_1_10" name="ref_1_10"><sup>(10)</sup></a> and 97/35/EC<a href="#def_1_11" name="ref_1_11"><sup>(11)</sup></a> . </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 66 by <span class="bold">Jens‐Peter Bonde </span>(H−0079/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Risk assessment of chemicals</span></p>
<p class="contents">When does the Commission expect all chemicals to be risk assessed?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">'Existing' chemicals are chemicals which were on the Community market before 18 September 1981. Data provided by European Industry shows that there are approximately 2, 500 ‘existing' chemicals on the Community market in quantities greater than 1, 000 tonnes, representing some 90 % of the chemicals traded. These chemicals are prioritised for an assessment of their risks to human health and the environment, with the most dangerous ones being assessed first. Industry, Member States and the Commission are currently working to achieve a target of assessing 1000 of these chemicals by the year 2005. A successful outcome is, of course, dependent on the Commission having the necessary staffing resources to undertake this work.</p>
<p class="contents">All ‘new' chemicals are assessed for their risks to human health and the environment before they are placed on the Community market. Since 1993 some 600 chemicals have been assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has commenced stock‐taking of the main Community legislation on industrial chemicals to see whether improvement is necessary. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 67 by <span class="bold">Graham Watson </span>(H−0085/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Cap de la Hague power station</span></p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware of the inquiry launched by the investigating magistrate in Cherbourg into the French nuclear power company Cogema on suspicion of the company endangering life by violating security obligations at the Cap de la Hague nuclear power generating plant?</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission believe that the high incidence of leukaemia identified by French scientists around Cap de la Hague could be related to emissions of the gas Krypton 85 or to illegal dumping of waste materials?</p>
<p class="contents">Since even low‐level emissions of radioactivity could affect the citizens of both England and France, will the Commission launch its own investigation into this matter?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the inquiry by the investigating magistrate at Cherbourg. It awaits the outcome of that inquiry with interest but has no role to play at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the incidence of leukaemia in the region of Cap de la Hague, the available scientific evidence does not lead the Commission to conclude that there is a relationship between krypton−85 discharges or other wastes originating from Cap de la Hague.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community Basic Safety Standards for the health protection of the general public and workers against the dangers of ionising radiation establish limits for public exposure to radiation and all of the evidence available to the Commission indicates that these limits have been fully respected. It has no basis, therefore, for undertaking an investigation into these matters. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 68 by <span class="bold">Anita Pollack </span>(H−0089/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Greening EU policies</span></p>
<p class="contents">What progress has the Commission made in implementing the Cardiff Council idea that concern for the environment should be a major consideration in all decisions relating to the Structural Funds, overseas aid and trade, implementation of single market, and agriculture?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">As the follow‐up to the Commission Communication on a strategy for integration put to the Cardiff European Council in May 1998 calling for environmental appraisals for all key policy proposals, the Commission is currently taking stock of progress in this field. The Commission is invited by the Vienna European Council to submit a progress report in time for the Cologne European Council in June 1999. In this context the Commission is currently reviewing its internal measures on integrating environment issues in other policies which were adopted in July 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to progress on integration in the particular policy areas mentioned by the honourable Member of Parliament, the following can be mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to agriculture and structural funds, the Parliament and the Council are currently discussing the proposals included in the Agenda 2000 package. In preparing these proposals, the Commission ensured that the environmental dimension was integrated into the ‘regulatory provisions' and this interface was explained in the ‘explanatory memorandum' of these proposals. In January this year the Commission presented a major Communication on the relationship between agriculture and environment ‘Directions towards sustainable agriculture'<a href="#def_1_12" name="ref_1_12"><sup>(12)</sup></a> . The purpose of this Communication is to elaborate on the approach taken by the Commission to the integration of environment in agriculture in its Agenda 2000 proposals. The Communication shows how environmental considerations have become a major concern for the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the structural funds on 3 February the Commission has adopted a working document setting out indicative guidance for programmes for the period 2000‐06, which addresses the integration of environment into the programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the implementation of the Internal Market, the Commission will present in the near future a Communication on the Internal Market and the Environment. It is also elaborating interpretative communication in the field of public procurement which should show which possibilities exist on the basis of the current legislation on public procurement to take on board environmental aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to trade, the Commission announced in November last year that the Commission will be making a sustainable impact assessment of the proposed WTO New Round. The Commission has now begun the process of identifying an independent contractor to carry out this work, the results of which will be made available to the European Parliament and the Council as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also be carrying out an environmental impact assessment of any bilateral sectoral agreements which are negotiated within the framework of the Transatlantic Economic Partnership (TEP) which was agreed last year between the Community and the US.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning development aid, the Commission has developed general guidelines and sectoral guidelines for the environmental assessment of projects which are submitted for financial support. They are currently considering how to submit strategic and programmatic work to similar assessment. In the context of the new Framework Agreement between the Community and the ACP countries, an environmental section has been included in the negotiating mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Helsinki European Council in December 1999 will take stock on the issue of integration on the basis of sectoral strategies on the above‐mentioned policy areas as well as on the industry, transport and energy sectors, to be developed by the various formations of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">It will also discuss a coordinated report on indicators presented by the Commission. Experience so far shows that it is not easy to measure progress on integration. That is why currently many efforts are being made by the Commission, the Council, Member States and international bodies such as OECD and UN‐CSD to identify suitable indicators to monitor progress in this field. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 69 by <span class="bold">Inger Schörling </span>(H−0102/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Statistics on animal experiments</span></p>
<p class="contents">At Question Time in March 1996, I put a question to the Commission concerning statistics on the use of laboratory animals in the EU. The Commission regretted that there were no reliable statistics available but said that efforts had been made, and would be continued, to produce such statistics. It referred amongst other things to a new model for collecting statistics which, it hoped, would yield better results. It also said that, if reliable statistics still proved impossible to obtain, it would seek to amend Directive 86/609<a href="#def_1_13" name="ref_1_13"><sup>(13)</sup></a> so that Member States could be required to compile statistics on the use of laboratory animals.</p>
<p class="contents">Are statistics on the use of laboratory animals in the EU now available, almost three years after the Commission gave its answer? If not, has the Commission made a start on amending the aforementioned Directive with the aim of obtaining such statistics?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">As provided by Article 26 of Directive 86/609/EEC<a href="#def_1_14" name="ref_1_14"><sup>(14)</sup></a> on the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes, the Commission requested Member States to provide data on the use of laboratory animals in 1996. This data collection took place in 1997. It is important to note that these data are not yet standardised and that therefore compilation of the data for this report requires additional administrative efforts. The draft report should be finalised shortly and be adopted by the Commission as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the format and the level of detail of statistical information, the finalisation of this work was set as a priority for 1997. At the meeting of Competent Authorities in April 1997 a ‘gentlemen's agreement' was reached after 7 years of discussions. The Member States committed themselves to implement the agreed format during 1998 for the collection of data in 1999. The third Commission report on the statistics on the use of laboratory animals will therefore be based on this agreed set of statistical tables. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 70 by <span class="bold">Hans Lindqvist </span>(H−1255/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: The situation in Swedish agriculture</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is a long time since Swedish agriculture experienced such a serious situation. Farms are being abandoned at the rate of three a day in Sweden. EU membership was meant to help farming, but things have turned out differently. Farmers are paid less and less for what they produce, and subsidies have recently been reduced, too. The calf subsidy ended on 1 December, just as calf prices fell sharply. And the subsidies are not paid out until the year‐end, as a result of which many farmers are forced to borrow money to tide them over. The current trend is unacceptable. Can the Commission provide any glimmer of hope for hard‐pressed Swedish farmers? Will the SKr 5 billion or so Sweden gets back from its annual SKr 21 bn contribution decrease or increase in the future?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with the honourable Member about the extent of the difficulties facing beef and veal producers in Sweden. They are consistent with the problems on the beef and veal markets throughout the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">After the mad cow disease crisis, 1998 was marked by a net recovery in prices. Thus, until as late as the 35th week, prices of adult bovine animals in Sweden increased. But the sharp decline in exports, linked to the Russian crisis, brought prices down. During the second half of 1998, no applications were made for export certificates from Sweden to Russia, whereas 300 tonnes had been exported during the second half of 1997. However, since the beginning of the year, prices do seem to have shown signs of a slight upturn.</p>
<p class="contents">Conditions in the beef and veal sector at the present time are unsatisfactory. That is why the Commission has not only presented a proposal to the Council, as part of Agenda 2000, for a reform of the common organisation of the market, but has also spoken out in favour of the need for a significant drop in institutional prices, as being the preferred way to win back markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not, however, in a position to predict how the net balance of Sweden"s budget contributions to the Community might evolve. The subject of financing Community policies are now part and parcel of the negotiations currently being held on Agenda 2000. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 71 by <span class="bold">James Provan </span>(H−0005/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Humanitarian aid to the Russian people</span></p>
<p class="contents">In the resolution on humanitarian aid to the Russian people, adopted by Parliament on 19 November 1998<a href="#def_1_15" name="ref_1_15"><sup>(15)</sup></a> , attention was drawn to the outbreak of tuberculosis in Russian prisons, where up to 15 % of the prison population are carriers of the disease.</p>
<p class="contents">How is the European Commission proposing to react to this crisis?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares Parliament's concern, expressed in its resolution of 19 November 1998, for the alarming rise in tuberculosis cases which has been observed in the Russian Federation in recent years. As the Russian penitentiary system is – like many public institutions – currently subject to a lack of funding and basic material inputs (food, drugs, medical equipment), prisons – often overcrowded and poorly maintained – have virtually become ‘incubators' of tuberculosis. As medical treatment locally available is often not in accordance with modern standards, a rise in multi‐drug resistant forms of the disease can be noted as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been addressing this issue already since the mid−1990s: Anti‐tuberculosis programmes – mainly consisting in implementing the WHO recommended standard treatment (DOTS scheme) and training of local staff – have been carried out by a number of European NGOs in Russian prisons for some time now.</p>
<p class="contents">In its most recent decision on humanitarian assistance to the Russian Federation (5, 435 MEURO), the Commission has again provided funding for anti‐tuberculosis programmes in a number of specially affected prison colonies (located in the St Petersburg region and in the regions of Tomsk and Kemerovo in Western Siberia). </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 72 by <span class="bold">José Salafranca Sánchez‐Neyra </span>(H−0009/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: New US government measures regarding the embargo on Cuba</span></p>
<p class="contents">The US Government has just relaxed the terms of the embargo on Cuba by permitting exports of foodstuffs and agricultural produce to family firms and NGOs, increasing the number of direct flights, reinstating the direct postal service, and giving permission for private individuals to send money to Cuba. These measures follow on from the initial steps taken by the Clinton Administration in March 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind their far‐reaching implications, what is the Commission's assessment of the measures recently announced by the US Government?</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission think that the measures can be seen in the context of the agreements concluded at the Transatlantic Summit on 15 May 1998?</p>
<p class="contents">Does it believe that this new departure in US policy towards Cuba will alter the Union's attitude to laws with extraterritorial effect?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the recent developments in US policy towards Cuba. It is to be hoped that these developments might signal a gradual change from a policy of isolation towards a policy of engagement.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, recently the US Administration announced a number of measures that seem to be intended to reach out to the people of Cuba. At the same time, however, the Administration declined to form a bipartisan Commission on Cuba as proposed by certain Senators.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the European Community is concerned, its policy remains as set out in the common position adopted by the Council on 2 December 1996 which explains the EU's support for a peaceful transition to democracy, the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as sustainable economic recovery and improvements in the living standards of the Cuban people. The EU has spent considerable time and energy to monitor the implementation of this policy. Evaluation reports have led to the extension of the position for six months each time.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the recent US moves do not represent a fundamental change in its general policy towards Cuba, the Commission nevertheless welcomes the recent limited moves by the US Administration and would encourage further steps in the same direction.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of US extra‐territorial legislation, on 15 January 1999 the US President issued another Title III waiver under the Helms‐Burton Act. This is in line with the agreements reached with the US on the Helms‐Burton and ILSA legislation at the London Summit in May last year. These agreements represented important progress in the dispute with the US on the issue raised by the Helms‐Burton Act and ILSA and the Commission continues to work towards a full implementation of these agreements. In this regard, the ball is with the US but the EU side stands ready to implement them once the US grants a waiver under Title IV of the Helms‐Burton Act as foreseen in the London agreements. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 73 by <span class="bold">Nikitas Kaklamanis </span>(H−0011/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Athens Underground</span></p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission say what was the original budget for the completion of the Athens Underground, how much has been spent so far and whether spending has overshot the target and, if so, in which precise sector?</p>
<p class="contents">Will it also say when the project as a whole is due to be completed and made available, as a fully operational transport system, to the people of Athens?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission has received from the competent national authorities the following information concerning the sum of the current contract for the Athens Underground project: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ the initial contract signed in June 1991 provided for a total budget of GRD 63 934 billion or DM 1 357 billion, at 1988 prices; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ in 1994 the Greek Parliament ratified a modification to the initial contract, including a financial increase equivalent to 14.64 %: 11.64 % for work to improve the quality of the project and 3 % for measures to accelerate the construction of the project and to compensate for delays due to archaeological excavations; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ the contract as revised is still in force. This contract makes provision for a reserve for unforeseen expenses. An agreement has recently been reached between the consortium building the project and the awarding authority ‘Attiko Metro" on additional expenditure of 6 %, which is to be charged to the reserve in question: 5 % is being used for additional safety measures in the city during construction of the project, including construction of the test tunnels, and the remaining 1 % has been allocated for improvements, particularly in the stations.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to completion of the project, the forecasts made by the awarding authority and the contracting consortium are as follows: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ partial operation of the new Syntagma‐Pentagonon and Syntagma‐Sepolia lines by the end of 1999; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ operation of Syntagma‐Monastiraki by the end of 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 74 by <span class="bold">Gerard Collins </span>(H−0013/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Consumer protection against anti‐competitive behaviour in the oil industry</span></p>
<p class="contents">The price of crude oil is at its lowest in real terms since before the oil crises of the 1970s. European consumers have a right to expect some of the benefits to be passed on, yet this is not happening. There is no significant change in end prices for petrol for private vehicles, heating oil or energy. What investigations is the Commission undertaking of the industries concerned in order to ensure that the lowest possible prices are being made available to consumers?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not share the opinion of the honourable Member according to which the fall in the price of crude oil has not yet had an effect on the price of sales to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the information available to the Commission, the final tax‐free prices of petroleum products fell considerably throughout the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, between January 1998 and January 1999, the final tax‐free price of unleaded petrol (95 octane) dropped by an average 22 %, the price of heating gasoil fell by 23 % and the price of residual LSC fuel oil fell by 21 %. During the same period, the average price of crude oil in the Community fell by approximately 30 %.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, it must be taken into account that the final tax‐free prices of petroleum products include costs which are independent of the crude oil price, such as the costs for transport, storage, refining and distribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, certain Member States consistently increase taxes, particularly at the beginning of each year. Consequently, consumer prices only partially reflect a fall in the price of crude oil and oil products.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shall continue to monitor the developments of the price of petroleum products, but the Commission is not aware at present of any grounds which could warrant an investigation of the petroleum industry. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 75 by <span class="bold">José Valverde López </span>(H−0022/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Food inspectors in the EU Member States</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has undertaken to carry out an evaluation of the food inspection services in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Food safety in the EU would be a reality if management and coordination structures were established via a European food safety agency. In the meantime, it is essential that the public should be informed on the organisational structures and food inspection and monitoring capacities existing in the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission carried out its evaluation of the national food inspection systems? What are its views on their structure?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">Article 5 of Council Directive 93/99/EEC on the subject of additional measures concerning the official control of foodstuffs requires the Commission to monitor and evaluate the equivalence and effectiveness of official food control systems operated by the competent authorities in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Inspections were carried out between February 1995 and June 1997, lasting a week in each Member State. They were carried out by two Commission officials, accompanied in most cases by a national expert from a Member State other than the one visited, chosen from the lists provided by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">These inspections were the first phase of the checks designed to enable the official control systems to be understood and evaluated. Each inspection led to an individual report on each Member State (15). All these reports were published on the Internet website of Directorate‐General XXIV <span class="italic">(http: //europa.eu.int/comm/dg24/index.html)</span> .</p>
<p class="contents">The reports indicate that foodstuffs produced in the Community are subject to official control to guarantee public health protection and consumer protection as well as fair competition. Foodstuffs in the Member States are checked, independently of their origin, at the production, storage and distribution phases. Nevertheless, the Member States must improve on certain points, such as extending the HACCP system throughout the food industry, training inspectors in this area, accrediting laboratories, monitoring foodstuffs on import – an area that is currently being examined in situ by the Commission – and improving coordination between the different services involved. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 79 by <span class="bold">Bernie Malone </span>(H−0029/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Free travel for the disabled</span></p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the ongoing coordination of Member States' social security schemes, does the Commission have any plans for legislation on the extension of free travel rights held by people with disabilities in their own Member State so that this right to free travel is recognised in other Member States?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member raises a question of entitlement to free travel rights for disabled persons within the Community system for the coordination of social security rights. Free travel rights for disabled persons do not fall under the notion of ‘social security' as defined by Regulation 1408/71 on the coordination of social security.</p>
<p class="contents">The granting of social, fiscal or tariff advantages to disabled persons is a matter that falls within the competence of the Member States. The measures introduced differ appreciably from one Member State to another, in terms both of content and beneficiaries. The mutual recognition of cards establishing such advantages is a matter for each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member should also be aware of the Council Recommendation<a href="#def_1_16" name="ref_1_16"><sup>(16)</sup></a> of 4 June 1998 on a Community model parking card for people with disabilities. This provides for the introduction of a standardised Community model parking card by 1 January 2000 at the latest. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 80 by <span class="bold">Brian Crowley </span>(H−0033/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: The future of housing and the construction industry in the EU</span></p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission outline what prospects it sees for a more positive role for the EU with regard to housing, including tackling the problems of homelessness, poverty and reviving inner city and urban areas, and, given the importance of employment and the construction industry in general, will it make a statement on the outcome of the informal meeting of EU Housing Ministers held on 22‐23 October 1998?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The European treaties do not provide any competencies to the Community to act directly in the housing domain. However, some European policies indirectly relate to housing, for example, regional policy, transport, energy, environment, employment, training and construction materials. In the internal market, in turn, housing is a major economic activity with direct social and economic impact.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission attends the annual informal meetings of Housing Ministers. At the last one in October 1998 in Graz the Ministers recognised that <span class="italic">the housing industry – and to a large extent, housing construction – is one of the major providers of employment in the EU (8.8 million persons, or 7 % of the total work force)<a href="#def_1_17" name="ref_1_17"><sup>(17)</sup></a> . The Ministers also reiterated a wish that the European Community should support the cooperation of the MS and the exchange of information in the field of housing policy, e.g. under the title of ‘The fight against social exclusion", to the extent that such cooperation and exchange of information is permitted by the Amsterdam Treaty</span> .</p>
<p class="contents">The new Treaty will open new opportunities for such cooperation and information exchange at Community level through the implementation of the new Article 137. This Article offers the possibility of adopting <span class="italic">measures designed to encourage cooperation between Member States through initiatives aimed at improving knowledge, developing exchanges of information and best practices, promoting innovative approaches and evaluating experiences in order to combat social exclusion.</span></p>
<p class="contents">Homelessness is one dimension of social exclusion and will be taken into account by the Commission in the activities it carries out in this field. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 81 by <span class="bold">Liam Hyland </span>(H−0037/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: The European rail network and the peripheral regions</span></p>
<p class="contents">As regards transport policy, in its document dated 2 December 1998 the German Presidency sets out the creation of an effective European rail network as a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">How does the Commission intend to respond to this priority objective, with particular regard to the need to ensure that all new measures fully respond to the needs of peripheral island regions, including the rail transport needs of the Leinster Province in Ireland?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">Economic and social cohesion is a prime objective of transport infrastructure policy at Community level and the EC Treaty stipulates that the purposes of the trans‐European networks (TENs) include the linking of island, landlocked and peripheral regions with the central regions of the Community. The European Parliament and the Council took this into account when they adopted Community guidelines for the development of the trans‐European transport network in 1996<a href="#def_1_18" name="ref_1_18"><sup>(18)</sup></a> .</p>
<p class="contents">The provisions of TENs' Budget funds to assist with infrastructure networks development can only be provided when national governments in Member States submit or specifically support applications for help when paying for essential studies, or subsidising interest rate payments on borrowing and other purposes set down in Article 129 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The political support for the TENs activities that comes from successive presidencies is, of course greatly valued.</p>
<p class="contents">In Ireland and, in particular, Leinster, one of the major rail projects relates to the improvement of the Cork‐Dublin‐Belfast‐(Stranraer) railway line which is one of the 14 specific TENs projects endorsed by the Essen Council in December 1994.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Member will know, the improvements to the Cork‐Dublin section were completed in 1997, and the new Enterprise service on the Dublin‐Belfast section was introduced in 1998. Community funds continue to support a complementary programme of resignalling and other work on other parts of the rail TEN, to ensure the creation of an effective rail network in the Republic.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's 1996 railway White Paper<a href="#def_1_19" name="ref_1_19"><sup>(19)</sup></a> set out a work programme to establish better conditions for the provision of rail services in the Community. The Commission has been steadily carrying out that programme and, in July 1998, it adopted a package of proposals which would enhance the use of railway infrastructure<a href="#def_1_20" name="ref_1_20"><sup>(20)</sup></a> . </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 82 by <span class="bold">Pat Gallagher </span>(H−0039/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Mackerel as food aid</span></p>
<p class="contents">In view of the amendment adopted during the December 1998 part‐session, the purpose of which was to include mackerel as part of the food aid programme, will the Commission outline the steps it is taking to put the necessary arrangements in place, bearing in mind the demand in Russia for mackerel, a food product which is high in protein but low in price?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission explained during the December plenary session, when the proposal concerning the food supply programme to Russia was discussed, that the Commission was not in a position to adopt the proposed amendments relating to fishery products.</p>
<p class="contents">It explained that the reason for this was that the Russian request for food aid from the European Community did not include fishery products and the Russian side has never mentioned that there were food shortages for fishery products in Russia. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 83 by <span class="bold">Carlos Pimenta </span>(H−0047/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Agreement on humane‐trapping standards</span></p>
<p class="contents">In December 1997, an agreement on international humane‐trapping standards was signed by the European Community, Canada and the Russian Federation. Subsequently, the USA endorsed this agreement through an agreed Minute and side letter. As of January 1999, only the European Community has ratified the Agreement and, therefore, it is not in force and the phasing‐out period for the cruel steel‐jawed leghold trap has not yet commenced. Would the Commission agree that one year is long enough for ratification and that the import restrictions laid down in Regulation 3254/91<a href="#def_1_21" name="ref_1_21"><sup>(21)</sup></a> should now be implemented with respect to Canada, USA and the Russian Federation? If the Commission does not agree, then how long a period would it consider to be reasonable for ratification, bearing in mind that the cruel steel‐jawed leghold trap is still in widespread use and causing great animal suffering?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The international agreement on humane trapping standards between the European Community, Canada and the Russian Federation was signed by the European Community and Canada on 15 December 1997 and by the Russian Federation on 24 April 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the agreement, in the form of agreed minutes, between the European Community and the United States of America, was signed by the two parties on 18 December 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community ratified these agreements on 26 January and 13 July 1998 respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not able to give an opinion in response to the honourable Member"s question on how long a period would be sufficient to ratify these agreements. This is because the ratification procedure is determined by the internal legislation of each of the parties concerned, and it is not for the Commission to take a stance on a sovereign country"s internal ratification procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Commission shares the concerns expressed by the honourable Member and is aware of the suffering which conventional metal‐jawed traps are liable to inflict on animals caught in them.</p>
<p class="contents">In an effort to have traps of this kind forbidden as soon as possible, in accordance with the agreements which have been signed, the Commission has therefore contacted the competent authorities in the countries concerned several times to find out what progress has been made on the ratification procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the information received by the Commission so far, the ratification procedures have been opened. This being the case, the Commission considers that implementing the embargo would go against the provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, in particular Article 18 thereof, which makes it obligatory for parties which have signed an international agreement to refrain from taking any action which might jeopardise the purpose and aim of that agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore continues to believe that the agreements concerned – being sound and ambitious – are the best way to guarantee the Community"s external credibility and to make its concerns known at international level. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 84 by <span class="bold">Mark Watts </span>(H−0050/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: The future of duty‐free sales</span></p>
<p class="contents">In a recent statement, the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, claimed that the Commission proposals relating to a successor regime were not acceptable. Other Member States have also expressed their concerns in relation to the proposals. As there is currently no agreement on a workable replacement fiscal regime, does the Commission agree that the proposed abolition date of 30 June 1999 is not realistic and that a further extension of the current transitional arrangements is necessary so that a permanent solution may be found?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not made any proposal relating to a successor regime. Instead, the tax regime that will be applied to sales on board aircraft and ferries after the abolition of intra‐Community duty‐free sales is based on existing Community VAT and excise legislation. The practical application of these rules has already been discussed and agreed between representatives of Member States and the Commission on several occasions. It is now a matter for individual Member States to discuss the detailed application of these arrangements with economic operators. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 85 by <span class="bold">Jonas Sjöstedt </span>(H−0053/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Public information on the euro</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is setting aside funds for the public to be informed about the various advantages of the euro. What amounts are currently being used in Sweden to this end? Is the Commission planning further information and campaigns on the euro to encourage a more positive attitude to the common currency in Sweden?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission has indeed, in cooperation with the European Parliament, developed since 1996 a priority information action to inform European citizens about Economic and Monetary Union and the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">The action is not at all designed as a tool to promote the advantages of the euro or to attempt to influence the judgment of citizens regarding the interest for their Member State of adopting the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Its purpose is only to make available to citizens information regarding the EMU and the single currency. Both in Member States having adopted the euro and in those which have not adopted it, the absence of such information could lead to practical difficulties for citizens and businesses, in particular regarding the existence and the operation of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission has not itself launched directly national communication plans on the euro but has offered Member States the opportunity, if they consider it appropriate, to develop such programmes and to cofinance them in partnership. This is currently the case with 11 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Until recently, the Government of Sweden has decided against establishing such a partnership. But, following the launching of the single currency in eleven Member States, and the needs, in particular, for economic operators to be well informed about the practical issues related to the euro within the single market, the Government of Sweden has opened discussions with the Commission with a view to running a joint information programme. This programme would mainly aim at providing information to businesses and citizens about the effect of the introduction of the euro in 11 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">These discussions are well advanced and, if confirmed, the Community would contribute to its financing at a scale similar to its intervention in other Member States of comparative population size; that is, at a level of about 600 or 700 000 euros for 1999. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 86 by <span class="bold">Anne McIntosh </span>(H−0055/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Subsidies to pig farmers</span></p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission intend to seek evidence that direct subsidies have been paid to French and German pig farmers, as is reported in the British press?</p>
<p class="contents">Does it agree that such subsidies distort the market for pigmeat in the EU and should be eradicated in the interests of fair competition?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission replied to a question tabled by Mr Nicholson on this matter at the November part‐session (No H−939/98).</p>
<p class="contents">Subsequent to that answer, the Commission has decided to launch a formal investigation into certain aids granted by the French Government to pig producers. The Commission's letter to the French Government will be published shortly in the Official Journal in order to allow interested parties to submit their observations. If at the end of that investigation, the Commission finds that aids which are incompatible with the Treaty have been granted to French pig producers, the Commission will make full use of its power to order repayment of that aid.</p>
<p class="contents">For Germany, the new government has officially informed the Commission that it does not intend to proceed with the package of aid measures for the pig sector announced before the Federal elections. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 87 by <span class="bold">Pedro Marset Campos </span>(H−0097/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Aid to the pigmeat sector</span></p>
<p class="contents">Prices are continuously falling in the pigmeat sector throughout Europe and, in particular, in Spain, especially in the Murcia region, largely as a result of the ongoing financial crisis in Russia. The measures adopted by the EU in this connection have not as yet been implemented. Does the Commission not consider that action is required, immediately and as a matter of urgency, to assist the pigmeat sector?</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission not consider that it is essential to introduce immediate aid measures, in the form of humanitarian assistance, for the people of Russia, who are now suffering one of the harshest winters in their history?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Aid to the pigmeat sector</span></p>
<p class="contents">The prices for pigmeat are currently low as a result of the large oversupply of pork on the market. Pig farmers have expanded their herds, especially in 1998, after two very profitable years. It is therefore not a surprise that the prices have decreased, when the production increased.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's Aid for Private Storage scheme has brought some alleviation to the situation, into which already 190, 000 tonnes of pigmeat has been taken since September 1998. Export refunds are available for most products and the level has been increased on several occasions since May 1998. In particular, the special high refund (Euro 70/100 kg) for certain cuts to Russia has been successful. 100, 000 tonnes have been destined to Russia during a time period of two months.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also organised a special working group in November with the Member States in order to discuss possible solutions to the current market crisis. The next meeting of this group will be held on 10 February.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would, however, like to remind the honourable Member that a sustainable solution to the crisis in the pigmeat sector cannot simply be achieved by the Commission's intervention, but only after production has come down to a balanced level with consumption. Therefore, farmers must face their responsibility and reduce the production.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Pigmeat as food aid</span></p>
<p class="contents">Following a request for food aid from the Russian Government on 12 November 1998, the European Community has decided to grant a Euro 400 million food aid programme to the Russian Federation. The aim of the programme is to improve the food supply situation in the Russian regions where there are major food shortages. The programme includes 100, 000 tonnes of pigmeat and, in addition, wheat, rye, rice, skimmed milk powder and beef. The first deliveries are expected to reach the regions in need at the end of February. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 88 by <span class="bold">James Nicholson </span>(H−0099/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: European pig industry</span></p>
<p class="contents">With the pig industry throughout the European Union in a continuing state of crisis, has the Commission any proposals to offer assistance to Europe's pig producers?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Community pig industry is currently in a crisis because pig farmers throughout Europe have expanded their herds, probably encouraged by the exceptionally high market prices in 1996 and 1997. Therefore, it should not be a surprise to anyone that prices are now exceptionally low, as the production is exceptionally high.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has, however, realised the gravity of the current situation and has supported the pigmeat market quite substantially. Already on 14 May 1998 the Commission reintroduced export refunds for fresh and frozen pigmeat and has since increased the level of refunds on several occasions. In September 1998 the Commission opened an Aid for Private Storage scheme, into which nearly 190 000 tons of pigmeat had been taken until end of January 1999 with a cost of more than 70 million euros. Since the start of this GATT year in July 1998 more than 380 000 tons of pigmeat have been exported with refunds totalling 160 million euros. In addition a food supply program for the Russian Federation will include 100 000 tons of pigmeat and the deliveries of the first 30 000 tons is due to start soon.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also organised a special working group in November 1998 with the Member States in order to discuss possible solutions to the current market crisis. The next meeting of this group will be held on 10th of this month.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it must be underlined that it has been largely due to the liberal market organisation that the European pig industry has been able to regulate itself and has become rather efficient and competitive over the years. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 89 by <span class="bold">Clive Needle </span>(H−0057/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Exposure to engine fumes in aircraft</span></p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware of concern that dangerous engine fumes may be entering cabins of passenger aircraft on routes within the EU?</p>
<p class="contents">What steps are being taken to ensure cabin crew and passenger health and safety?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The issue of engine fumes in aircraft cabins, is addressed in the common standards for certification of aircraft defined under Council Regulation (EEC) 3922/91 which require a minimum level of fresh air for each passenger and crew member. A maximum dioxide level of harmful and hazardous elements is defined as is a minimum ventilation rate. These rates are currently being revised at expert level and any change will be incorporated into Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">Toward the end of this year the Commission will publish a Communication on passenger protection which is now in preparation. Matters relating to air quality and fumes in aircraft will be further addressed in that document. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 90 by <span class="bold">Karin Riis‐Jørgensen </span>(H−0058/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Possibility of self‐employed Danish taxi‐cab owners taking part in public invitations to tender</span></p>
<p class="contents">Under Danish law, a licence is required to run a business as a taxi‐cab owner. The business must be run as a personal firm and may not operate in company form.</p>
<p class="contents">An owner may have several licences and, therefore, several cabs in his business. The owners employ drivers and have employers' responsibilities. The owners' business must be affiliated to a bookings office authorised by the relevant local authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Under Danish law, owners may not drive the cabs or submit tenders to do so except through the bookings office. Some taxi‐cab owners in the Community are, therefore, prevented from responding to invitations to tender for driving contracts issued by public institutions, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission's view, is this situation consistent with the EU's directives on the award of public contracts?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">Provided that the estimated value of a contract for taxicab services is equal to or higher than the relevant thresholds, all such contracts awarded by a contracting authority are subject to the provisions of Council Directive of 18 June 1992 relating to the coordination of procedures for the award of public service contracts (92/50/EEC). However, the directive clearly presupposes that national legislation may subject the exercise of specific activities to authorisations or membership of particular organisations. Article 30(1) of the directive explicitly provides that ‘in so far as candidates for a public contract or tenderers have to possess a particular authorisation or to be members of a particular organisation in their home country in order to be able to perform the service concerned, the contracting authority may require them to prove that they hold such authorisation or membership'.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also clarified through the sixth recital of the directive ‘whereas obstacles to the free movement of services need to be avoided; whereas, therefore, service providers may be either natural or legal persons; whereas this directive shall not, however, prejudice the application, at national level, of rules concerning the conditions for the pursuit of an activity or a profession provided that they are compatible with Community law'.</p>
<p class="contents">Provided that it is in conformity with Community law, the Danish legislation on access to and exercise of taxicab business is thus not contrary to the public procurement directives.</p>
<p class="contents">It can be added that, in the absence of any cross‐border elements in the situation described in the question, Articles 52 and 59 of the Treaty are not applicable. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 91 by <span class="bold">Jaime Valdivielso de Cué </span>(H−0064/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Industry</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has instituted proceedings against Spain on account of irregularities in State aid to publicly owned shipyards in the form of tax deductions in the years 1997 and 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">Could it say on what grounds it has taken this decision, bearing in mind that in 1997 Spanish shipyards formed part of the SEP II group and were consequently entitled, under the regulations in force, to offset losses with other companies in the same consortium?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission's investigation relates not to tax credits received in 1997 and 1998 under general tax consolidation rules in Spain, which the Commission accepts would not necessarily constitute state aids, but to a special tax credit of 18.451 billion pesetas paid in 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has doubts whether this special tax credit payment was compatible with a 1997 decision approving restructuring aids for the yards. The package of aids exceptionally approved at the time included special tax credits on the assumption that the yards would be unable to receive tax credits under general measures. However, the 1998 payment was made despite the fact that the yards have, since their absorption into the state holding Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (SEPI) in 1997, in addition also received tax credits under general measures. The Commission is concerned that consequently the yards may have received more aid than they should. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 92 by <span class="bold">Caroline Jackson </span>(H−0065/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Leonardo Programme: Fornew Project</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Fornew Leonardo Project was completed in May 1998, and the technical and financial reports were submitted in June 1998. By January 1999, despite approving the technical report, BAT Leonardo had not begun the financial assessment of the project on which final payments were contingent. Can the Commission state why this delay has taken place and whether, by the date of this question, it will have made the payment?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The evaluation of the final report of the project concerned, which was received on 13 July 1998, has been undertaken from a dual perspective. On one side the content of the report and the final product of the project was considered satisfactory, whereas on the other the initial financial evaluation carried out showed up a number of deficiencies in the information provided on the part of the project promoter. This concerns particularly partners of the project in France, Italy and Spain. The Commission (through its technical assistance office) has requested additional information in order to finalise the financial evaluation and determine the amount of the balance of the subsidy to be paid. Once all the relevant explanations have been provided to the Commission's satisfaction, the balance will be paid.</p>
<p class="contents">The delay in dealing with the finalisation of this project is due in part to the thorough nature of the evaluation process concerned, and the need to ensure that the final payment of the Community subsidy is justified in the light of the eligible costs which have to be clearly demonstrated by the project promoter. The Commission has put in train measures to improve the handling of such files by the technical assistance office in order to minimise such delays in the future. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 93 by <span class="bold">Alexandros Alavanos </span>(H−0067/99/rev. 1)<span class="italic"> Subject: Steep rise in exports of Turkish steel to the European Union</span></p>
<p class="contents">The ECSC Convention with Turkey and the free trade agreement liberalised trade in steel by abolishing tariffs. This has resulted in a huge volume of imports of steel products from Turkey into the European Union which has burgeoned following the crisis in Asia. The percentage rise in Turkish exports to the Member States stands at 105 %, while 68 % of exports of steel bars for use in reinforced concrete is bound for the Greek market, accounting for 20 % of domestic consumption as opposed to 1.2 % in 1995. The threat to Greek production, in particular, is immediate as the Greek market is close to Turkey and transport costs are low compared with exporting to the markets of northern Europe. Given that there are serious allegations that Turkey is subsidising exports, will the Commission say what measures it will take to combat the huge volume of imports into the Member States, particularly Greece, and whether it will investigate the allegations concerning subsidies?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Community has traditionally enjoyed a trade surplus with Turkey in both finished and total steel products. The entry into force of the bilateral ECSC free trade agreement in August 1996 has led to the development of closer bilateral relations in the steel sector as well as an intensification of bilateral trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Sine the emergence of the financial crisis in S.E. Asia, steel trade flows have been disturbed in most regions of the world, not least in the Community, where total steel imports in the year to September 1998 increased by 6.6 million tonnes (+56 %) compared with the same period of 1997, while exports fell by 2.7 million tonnes (−13 %). As a result, the Community became a net importer of steel for the first time.</p>
<p class="contents">Total steel imports from Turkey increased by around 560 000 tonnes (+73 %) in the first nine months of 1998, including a 58 000 tonne (+42 %) increase in imports of reinforcing bars. Rebars account for around 15 % of Community steel imports from Turkey. According to the latest figures, around 80 % of Community imports of Turkish reinforcing bars enter Greece, although this does not necessarily mean that this is their final Community destination.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has regular dialogue with a wide range of third countries, including Turkey, to discuss developments in the steel sector. Recent bilateral meetings have focused on the effects of the ongoing turbulence in international steel trade flows.</p>
<p class="contents">Increased competitive pressures on the Community steel sector do not necessarily mean that the Community trading partners are engaging in unfair trading practices. The Commission is prepared to apply the Community trade policy instruments, such as anti‐dumping or anti‐subsidy provisions, where the necessary conditions are met, and in accordance with the relevant WTO agreements. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 94 by <span class="bold">Anne Van Lancker </span>(H−0070/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Evaluation of the results of the follow‐up to the International Conference on Population and Development (Cairo 1994)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations have taken the initiative of carrying out an interim evaluation of the ICPD Action Plan which was the outcome of the International Conference on Population and Development (Cairo 1994). To this end, the UN Population Fund is holding an International Forum in The Hague from 8 to 12 February 1999. The Commission is preparing a report on the initiatives and projects it has undertaken or funded in the past 5 years; this report apparently relates to the developing countries. However, the Action Plan of the Cairo Conference does not only apply to developing countries but also to the European Union and the countries which are candidates for accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission submit a follow‐up report on public health in Europe? What initiatives has the Commission taken to follow up the Cairo Conference in the European Union itself and in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and what are its future policy options? How much money has been allocated to projects on sexual and reproductive health in Europe? Who were the beneficiaries of the specific projects?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The European Community attends the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) and will be actively participating in the International Forum in The Hague, the Commission on Population and Development and the UNGASS.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in the process of preparing a report of EC support on population, reproductive health and HIV/AIDS in developing countries in line with the ICPD Programme of Action. This report will be finalised and released before the UNGASS.</p>
<p class="contents">A Communication from the Commission on population and reproductive health in developing countries, in line with the objectives agreed at the ICPD, is also in preparation and will be finalised in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Each year the Commission publishes a report on the state of health in the European Community. The last one concerned the state of health of women, and the next, which will focus on the state of health of migrants, is in the final stages of preparation. Moreover, the Commission supports the drawing‐up by the Regional Office of the World Health Organisation of health profiles for the countries in the European Region, including the enlargement candidates. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 95 by <span class="bold">Mark Killilea </span>(H−0072/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Seals</span></p>
<p class="contents">In April 1997, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Irish Sea Fisheries Board, submitted to DG XIV a report on the physical interaction between grey seals and fishing gear. Research at the Dingle Summer Hake Fishery and the North Mayo Spring Cod Fishery showed conclusive evidence of damage to fish stocks and equipment by seals.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission inform me whether it has requested any follow‐up study as a result of this report? Given the considerable scientific evidence presented in this report, would the Commission now acknowledge that there is conclusive evidence that seals have a significant detrimental impact on fisheries? Would it also agree that preventive measures are justifiable, particularly where a proven case existed, as for example in the two studies in question? Would the Commission be willing to financially assist responsible national organisations such as BIM, to carry out further such studies in order to scientifically assess such a need?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission is fully cognisant of the existence of the report by the Irish Sea Fisheries Board. The honourable MEP reaches the conclusion that the report show ‘conclusive evidence of damage to fish stocks by seals'. However, any ‘damage' to the fish stocks themselves is caused by the fixed gear fisheries. The seals then take the already‐dead or moribund fish from the nets.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect the report does show and confirm the existence of economic damage to fishermen caused by seals feeding on fish caught in fixed gears. The Commission acknowledges that the fishermen involved may have cause for concern here.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not specifically requested any follow‐up study to the report by the Irish Sea Fisheries Board but is currently funding a study, 'Grey seal interactions with fisheries in Irish coastal waters', which focuses on the same geographical area as the report from the Irish Sea Fisheries Board.</p>
<p class="contents">It will consider the need for any Community level measures in the light of these studies. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 96 by <span class="bold">Luis Marinho </span>(H−0077/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Criteria for redistributing tomato quotas</span></p>
<p class="contents">On what criteria does the Commission intend to redistribute the quotas for the 1999 tomato harvest, given the data supplied by the individual Member States but also the legitimate suspicions which exist as to the reliability of certain of those data?</p>
<p class="contents">What procedure does the Commission intend to adopt should it emerge following the redistribution that it was based on incorrect statistical data?</p>
<p class="contents">What measures would then be taken to compensate producers in the Member States for any prejudice suffered from the decision, especially as regards the fixing of their quotas?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">With regard to the reliability of some of the data used to calculate the distribution of quotas between the Member States for the 1999/2000 crop year, which has been called into question by the honourable Member, the Commission was aware only of the fact that a judicial enquiry is under way in one Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will calculate these quotas on the basis of the official information provided by the Member States, which it is obliged to respect, for as long as that information is not invalidated by precise and indisputable findings (in particular judicial ones).</p>
<p class="contents">Should the honourable Member have any information of this kind, he is kindly requested to make it available to the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 97 by <span class="bold">María Izquierdo Rojo </span>(H−0078/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: The right to life in Algeria</span></p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind the Commission's competence with regard to human rights and Algeria's close proximity to the European Union, can the Commissioner responsible say how many people have been killed in terrorist violence since 1995? How many of them belonged to the army, what authority did they hold and for what tasks were they responsible? What steps have been taken to date to protect the rural population?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission was not able to restore its diplomatic presence in Algiers until last November. It does not have any direct information concerning the victims of violence in Algeria since 1995.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of victims of terrorism among the civilian population up to 1998, as identified by the Algerian authorities, is 26 000. Specialised non‐governmental organisations estimate that in reality the figure is three or four times higher.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of terrorists killed has not been clearly established. According to the Algerian authorities, however, there were still approximately 3 600 terrorists in the country in July 1998; this tallies with reports by the group of eminent persons set up by the United Nations about the situation in Algeria.</p>
<p class="contents">The main groups responsible for the terrorist attacks to date have been the Armed Islamic Group and the Islamic Salvation Army. The latter, however, declared last September that it had ceased terrorist activity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Algerian authorities have entrusted the national police service and the local police force with the task of protecting the rural population. For isolated villages or hamlets, self‐defence groups have been set up by decree and placed under the authority of the prefecture. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 98 by <span class="bold">Fernando Pérez Royo </span>(H−0081/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Controversial remarks by the Commission's Director‐General for Energy</span></p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission believe that certain remarks made by its Director‐General for Energy, a Spanish national, during a debate organised by the European Energy Foundation on ‘the implementation of the energy directive in Spain' can be considered consistent with the principles of transparency and neutrality of the Community institutions and the parliamentary traditions of the Member States and the Union (the Director‐General took the liberty of speaking of ‘exhibitionism' and ‘discussion in the marketplace' in relation to the fact that certain political groups in both the Spanish Cortes and the European Parliament have raised the subject of certain subsidies to the electricity sector in Spain (paid for by the consumer) which have been perceived as highly controversial, proclaiming the need for ‘confidentiality' and ‘discretion', while at the same time praising developments in the Spanish electricity sector which, in his view, deserve to win it the Community's endorsement of the so‐called ‘costs of the transition to competition')?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">In reply to the honourable Member"s question, the Commission would point out that the Director‐General for Energy has assured it that the articles published about the statements he made during the meeting organised by the European Energy Foundation with industry representatives took his remarks out of context.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, the Commission considers that the neutrality of the Director‐General for Energy is not in question.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the substance of the statements, the Commission would point out the following facts: <br />1. The ‘costs of the transition to competition" in Spain and in the other Member States which raised the issue are currently being analysed by the Commission services under Article 24 of the directive on the internal market in electricity.<br />2. The Commission has not for the moment taken an official position on the possibility of allowing such costs as derogations to Article 24 of the directive on the internal market in electricity or as possible state aid.<br />3. Under the terms of the directive and as specifically decided by the Member States, the Commission must carry out this analysis in the strictest confidentiality.</p>
<p class="contents">In Spain, the process of transposing the directive on the internal market in electricity has so far been satisfactory (the level of opening‐up of the market, the number of eligible customers, the creation of a market operator and an independent system operator, the decree on producing combined heat and power and on renewable energies).</p>
<p class="contents">The statements made by the Director‐General for Energy to which the honourable Member refers must be interpreted in this context. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 99 by <span class="bold">Vassilis Ephremidis </span>(H−0087/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Turmoil in Greek education system and society caused by attempt to introduce educational reform</span></p>
<p class="contents">The education law adopted by the Greek Parliament has triggered a storm of protest. The reform of education has met with root and branch opposition from the Greek people in the form of long‐standing occupations of schools by pupils, strikes by teachers' trade unions and those of public and private‐sector workers in higher education as well as daily demonstrations.</p>
<p class="contents">Is this ‘reform' in keeping with the EU's general guidelines and plans for education, training and employment? Does the Commission intend to allow Community funding to be redirected in support of comprehensive, twelve‐year, basic compulsory education and free, public education for all young people capable of satisfying the wide range of needs of children and adolescents for knowledge, social activity, sport and culture?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The responsibility for the conception and implementation of national policies in the areas of education, training and employment lies with the Member States. It is therefore not for the Commission to express an opinion about reform in Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, as a member of the Monitoring Committee of the Operational Programme ‘Education and Initial Training', discusses with the Greek authorities proposals submitted by them for co‐funding by the structural funds. In order to be approved, actions must: respect the priorities set out in the above‐mentioned programme and the European Employment Guidelines; fall within the scope of the ESF and ERDF regulations (2084/93 and 2083/93 respectively) and other rules agreed in the framework of the CSF implementation in Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the current programming period expires on 31 December 1999, the Commission is willing to examine any realistic proposal from the Greek authorities which meets the above requirements. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 100 by <span class="bold">Niels Sindal </span>(H−0090/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Joint sea rescue service</span></p>
<p class="contents">In recent years Europe has witnessed a growing number of disasters at sea such as supertankers running aground, oil spillages from vessels in international waters and, most recently, an abandoned burning ship, the ‘Pallas Athene', in the North Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission therefore state whether there are plans to establish a joint sea rescue service comprising those countries that have access to a specific area of sea, e.g. the North Sea? Is it planning during the first half of this year to forward the proposal for a directive concerning the setting up of a European Vessel Reporting System in the maritime zones of Community Member States (COM(93)647<a href="#def_1_22" name="ref_1_22"><sup>(22)</sup></a> and COM(94)220<a href="#def_1_23" name="ref_1_23"><sup>(23)</sup></a> )?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The first question raised by the honourable Member concerns the existence of possible plans to establish joint maritime emergency services in maritime areas of the Community, for example in the North Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">The answer is that the maritime areas of the Community are covered by regional agreements – to which the Community is a signatory – for cooperation in the case of accidental pollution at sea. For example, among North Sea states, the Bonn Agreement offers mutual assistance and cooperation in combatting pollution. In recent years the emphasis in the Bonn Agreement Working Group has been mainly on the coordination of surveillance activities, including the opportunities offered by satellite surveillance. The results of such surveillance activities are assessed annually and published.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to such regional agreements, in 1978 the Council set up an action programme with the aim of supporting Member States' efforts to improve their capabilities for response in the case of major pollution incidents at sea and creating the conditions for efficient mutual assistance and cooperation. More recently, in December 1998, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council decision setting up a Community framework for cooperation in incidents of accidental marine pollution which should contribute to further improvements in the efficiency of response in the event of disasters at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question raised by the honourable Member deals with the current status of a proposal for a Council directive adopted in December 1993 concerning the setting‐up of a European vessel reporting system, known as EUROREP. The purpose of this proposal was to complement the existing system set up by Council Directive 93/75/EEC which lays down notification requirements on vessels carrying hazardous goods.</p>
<p class="contents">Due to a number of political, legal and technical reasons, a political agreement on this proposal could not be reached in Council. The proposal is, however, still on the table of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1993, there have been a number of significant changes in the international legal context and several technological developments in maritime communications. The Commission is currently examining the implications of these changes which could make the initial EUROREP proposal obsolete.</p>
<p class="contents">An important meeting with Member States' experts is scheduled in March 1999 and should be rapidly followed by a decision of the Commission on the possible withdrawal of the EUROREP proposal and its replacement by a new proposal which would enable full use to be made of the latest technologies. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 101 by <span class="bold">Ioannis Theonas </span>(H−0092/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Infringement of individuals' privacy</span></p>
<p class="contents">Numerous press reports and official studies carried out by organisations and committees into the surveillance of the private lives of individuals have given cause for great concern. Tapping of telephones, faxes and conversations and the exchange of information concerning the social, trade union and political activities of individuals has assumed alarming proportions. In Italy last year, legal authorisation for surveillance was granted in 44 000 cases, while the French national commission for surveillance and security monitoring estimates that illegal surveillance by private companies exceeds 100 000 instances with, in many cases, the State authorities themselves instigating the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light, moreover, of the confidential Parliament report (September 1998) into the Echelon system, its alarming revelations about economic and political espionage and its basic reservations about the non‐transparent operation and the objectives of the Schengen system, will the Commission say what information it has available about the abovementioned matters and what practical measures it will take to put an end to any flagrant infringement and to uphold the inviolability of the privacy of individual citizens, which is a fundamental principle in any country governed by the rule of law?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">On 24 October 1995 the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. On 15 December 1997 the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 97/66/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector. The implementation period of both directives has expired on 24 October 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">Both directives have as their aim to ensure the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, and in particular their right to privacy, in order to ensure the free flow of personal data in the Community. As such these directives are relevant to the matters dealt with in the honourable Member's question. By their nature the scope of the directives is limited to the issues which come within the framework of the EC Treaty. In addition both directives allow exemptions to safeguard particular interests such as public security or the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences. Any citizen who feels that his privacy interests are prejudiced can either complain to the national supervisory data protection authorities or address a national court.</p>
<p class="contents">For the aspects regarding the ECHELON system the honourable Member is referred to the answers to written questions E−1039/98 from Ms van Dijk, E−1040/98 from Ms van Dijk, E−1306/98 from Ms Muscardini and others, E−1429/98 from Ms Raschhofer, E−1776/98 from Mr Manisco, E−1987/98 from Mr Kaklamanis, H−1067/98 from Ms McKenna and H−1237/98 from Mr Schörling. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 102 by <span class="bold">Hadar Cars </span>(H−0095/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Financing by the EU of an advertising campaign for tulips and lemons</span></p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the Commission is financing an advertising campaign for tulips and lemons has recently been in the news in Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is taxpayers' money being used for this purpose?</p>
<p class="contents">Why have these products been singled out for such treatment?</p>
<p class="contents">What is the campaign costing?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission would inform the honourable Member that in Regulation (EEC) No 1201/90 and Regulation (EC) No 2275/96 the Council decided to make provision for a Community financial contribution towards advertising campaigns to promote the consumption of citrus fruits and of live plants and floricultural products produced in the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the example of decisions made regarding other products – such as dairy products, apples, olive oil and quality beef – the Council deemed it appropriate to use promotional campaigns to encourage the consumption of citrus fruits, plants and floricultural products, in order to help to restore the balance between supply and demand in the relevant sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that the budget set aside by the Community for this promotion, for the period 1998/99, is EUR 2.7 million for citrus fruits and EUR 15 million for plants and floricultural products, for the whole Community. The budgets for Sweden are EUR 198 000 and EUR 247 886 respectively. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 103 by <span class="bold">Ulf Holm </span>(H−0100/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Human rights</span></p>
<p class="contents">In light of the Human Rights Agenda for the European Union for the Year 2000 taken up by the Committee of the Wise Men, would the Commission state its position on the drawing up of an action plan and a draft directive on equal treatment so as to bring an end to the widespread discrimination in the EU based on sexual orientation?</p>
<p class="contents">What actions does it plan to take, with regard to Article 13, once the Treaty of Amsterdam comes into force?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">In its Social Action Programme 1998‐2000<a href="#def_1_24" name="ref_1_24"><sup>(24)</sup></a> , the Commission announced its intention of exploring the new scope for action against discrimination on a range of bases including sexual orientation, opened by Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">A major European conference was held in Vienna on 3 and 4 December 1998 on the implementation of Article 13. The aim of the conference was to launch a debate with the key actors on anti‐discrimination policies at European and national level (European institutions, Member States, NGOs, Social Partners, Academics, etc.) with a view to identifying the way forward on this article.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the main conclusions of the conference was the need for Community action to supplement what Member States are doing to fight discrimination. Most views favoured a dual approach based on binding legislation accompanied and reinforced by an action programme. At the end of the conference the Commission announced its intention of presenting, after the coming into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, an Article 13 anti‐discrimination package, involving both legislation and an action programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is at present working on the preparation of this package. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 104 by <span class="bold">Angela Billingham </span>(H−0103/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Slaughter of animals in Austria</span></p>
<p class="contents">Is the European Commission aware that animals are being killed in a castle in the Province of Lower Austria in the name of art? This ritualistic practice has been going on for 35 years: the animals are publicly slaughtered, crucified and disembowelled, and their blood is then drank by members of the audience.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the European Commission make representations to the Austrian authorities and call on them to put an end to this cruel practice which fails to respect animals as sentient beings in the way outlined in the Treaty?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">Directive 93/119/EC laying down certain requirements for the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing does not apply to the killing of animals for cultural traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach is in line with the Animal Welfare Protocol to the Treaty as adopted in the Treaty of Amsterdam in June 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, the Commission is of the opinion that the national authorities are responsible for the welfare of the animals concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">As a matter of interest and concern, the Commission contacted the competent veterinary department in Austria, and was assured that the following measures had been taken in order to ensure that the intended slaughter was carried out in conformity with animal welfare and hygiene regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Only three bulls were slaughtered. The animals were properly stunned and bled in accordance with the provisions of Directive 93/119/EC. An official veterinarian was present to verify that the animal welfare regulations were applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Experienced butchers carried out the slaughter of the three bulls.</p>
<p class="contents">Any additional carcasses were brought from other abattoirs and commercial places.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the information provided by the honourable Member, the meat and blood was for those people who attended the meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Commission is concerned, it does not lay within the competence of the Commission to define the borderline of cultural traditions, regional heritage and art. </p>
