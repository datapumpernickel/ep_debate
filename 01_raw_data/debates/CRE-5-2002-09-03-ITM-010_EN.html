<p class="contents">One of the few points I wish to comment on is the plan to allow below cost selling. What is the point of this clause? Who does it benefit, except a handful of large retail outlets which you can count on the fingers of one hand? Absolutely no-one! But for over 20 million small and medium-sized enterprises, it spells mortal danger from unfair trading by large retailers who, by selling below cost, could wipe out thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises and minimise any possible competition.</p>
<p class="contents">For tens of millions of workers, unemployment will be the result. And more unemployment is the last thing the European economy needs in its present parlous state. Nor will it benefit consumers, because short-term bargains will rapidly be replaced by massive price increases once a few companies have cornered the market.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, if we want to say that we represent the millions of workers and businesses in the European Union, if we want to maintain that small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the European economy and society, if we want to carry on claiming that we are in touch with reality, then we need to vote against below cost selling in tomorrow's vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that the legislative work of this House is not properly reflected in the order of business and that we are still prone to the resolutionitis which we suffered from in 1979. The PPE group had a really hard time with this Commission proposal, in part due to the fact that the Member States have very different approaches to competition law. We took great pains to broker a compromise, including with the rapporteur in committee, and I should like to report to plenary today that the PPE group firmly backs this compromise, which is identical to the report by the rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. I think this is a remarkable announcement to plenary by so big a group. There was not one dissenting voice within the group.</p>
<p class="contents">This compromise includes a statement to the effect that we agree with the compromise and that we agree with the Commission's idea of using a regulation. We believe that, in principle, a regulation is the right way to tackle the problems addressed here. However, the Member States will need time to adapt, so we have suggested a later starting date, namely 1 January 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Folias has addressed the problem of small and medium-sized businesses. They were in fact a crucial factor in our debate. To give just two examples: numerous Member States have banned below cost selling in their fair trading legislation, partly in order to protect their small and medium-sized enterprises. We have amended the Commission proposal by expressly allowing for such an eventuality. We have also ensured that tariffs for fees for the liberal professions can be maintained without restriction. On the other hand, we have achieved the required degree of harmonisation. I think that excesses in competition law such as we saw at the start of the year in Germany, when a firm wanting to offer a 20% discount was prohibited from doing so by a court order, will be a thing of the past. Thank you for listening. I am afraid I must leave now. I have another meeting at 9 p.m. and trust that the honourable Members and the Commission will excuse me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that it was a good idea to present the proposal in the form of a regulation, for I feel that a regulation is genuinely the most suitable vehicle for laying down uniform rules on specific, clearly-defined issues, for guaranteeing price transparency and for increasing legal certainty, and that it is the best way to meet the need for uniform rules now the euro has been introduced. Above all, the regulatory approach makes it possible to create a legal framework on the basis of which the consumer and other market actors can obtain sufficient information to be able to make informed decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The text before us, which we are to vote on tomorrow, is, in any case, the result of thorough analysis in committee and in the committees responsible for drawing up opinions. It amends and improves many important aspects of the original proposal relating to the provision of protection and guarantees for consumers, minors, small and medium-sized enterprises and healthy competition, and the introduction of the subsidiarity mechanism. Indeed, an amendment introduces the principle of subsidiarity, on the basis of which the Member States can partially limit trade communications on grounds of consumer protection, safeguarding competition or the protection of providers.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that the provision adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market – increasing protection for minors, particularly as regards personal data and potentially dangerous free samples and premiums – is especially important. In addition, the consumer is also safeguarded as regards the court or out-of-court settlement of claims.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, I feel this is a well-balanced proposal which takes into account both the need to make the international market fully functional and the need to protect the consumer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most serious, as numerous honourable Members have already said, is that it allows below cost selling, which national authorities will be unable to restrict or ban.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think this will help foster healthy competition; what it will help foster are unfair trading practices by very large companies; smaller businesses and consumers will be the ones to suffer because, once the competition in the vicinity has been wiped out, one or, at most, a few companies will corner the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the intervention by the Committee on Legal Affairs and its amendments allowing each Member State to introduce or probably maintain bans on below cost selling in their legislation. Five countries in the European Union already have this sort of legislation, including Greece, where law 2941, adopted in 2001, basically guarantees trading standards and bans below cost selling. Under the Commission text, this law would violate Community legislation. If the amendment by Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs is adopted, there should be no problem, and it is therefore vital for us to support these amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that the Commission has presented us with a well-balanced text which will provide an appropriate solution to the problem of the absence of a genuine internal market for promotions and promotional sales and of the market being governed by a variety of different laws which ban in some countries behaviour which is permitted in others.</p>
<p class="contents">I fear that some of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market are in danger of diminishing the effectiveness of this text. I refer, in particular, to Amendments Nos 29 and 32, which, although intended to safeguard the principle of subsidiarity, are, in actual fact, in danger of rendering the regulation’s provisions and proposals on the specific case of discounts ineffective. I believe there is one thing that must be made clear first of all: competition authorities exist at both Community and Member State level. Competition laws and laws on all cases which can be classed as unfair competition exist, and so cases of discounts which would appear to be an example of fair competition are prosecuted via this channel too. Competition authorities do exist but, in all other cases, not only are discounts not negative, they are positive. They are clearly positive for the consumer, who can buy goods and services at a very advantageous price, and it does not matter whether for a limited period of time or not. It is not true, in my opinion, that discounts are necessarily harmful for small businesses: quite the opposite, small businesses often offer discounts to launch a product or a commercial activity, not having a great deal of financial resources available for large-scale or even, often, small-scale promotional campaigns. I feel we are in danger of doing consumers and businesses a bad turn here.</p>
<p class="contents">Another brief point: the issue of inflation. I am thinking of Italy, but other countries are in the same situation: penalising discounts until it is impossible to offer them in practice, as has happened in Italy, has contributed in equal measure to the creation of the conditions for a less competitive market and, therefore, a market which is at greater risk from price inflation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Harbour (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I warmly welcome, on behalf of my colleagues in the United Kingdom Conservative Party, this very elegant and simple proposal for reform of the single market. It will perhaps surprise colleagues that the regulatory content of this regulation before us occupies eight clauses and three pages and yet we had 200 amendments. Part of the problem – I say this particularly to the Commissioner because I know he is sympathetic to this – is that despite the fact that the single market is at the centre of economic reform of the Lisbon goals, when a simple proposal for reform is put forward we are in the extraordinary position that a significant number of Member States oppose it and, indeed, Members seek to change and dilute it.</p>
<p class="contents">We have reached an acceptable compromise, thanks to the heroic efforts of Mr Beysen. I am confident we will get a strong majority for this tomorrow and it is absolutely right that we should. How can we justify in the single market today a position where people shopping in Antwerp will get entirely different deals, offers and conditions to people who shop in Rotterdam, only a few miles away? That story is repeated across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of this regulation is to empower consumers to make choices in the single market, by giving them information and allowing them to exercise their choice. A lot of the proposals and a lot of the amendments by the Socialist Group, which I am sure we will reject tomorrow, reflect the old mentality of trying to tell consumers what is best for them. That world has gone! We are talking about an Internet world where people can shop all over the European Union and where businesses can put out offers to them. This is a crucial measure.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to thank the Commissioner for the remarks he made in the commercial communication, where he said Parliament comes to rescue the internal market. This side of the House and this committee shall continue to do that. We shall also rescue Europe's consumers from the over-interference that some colleagues are proposing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, no fine intention to improve the functioning of the internal market and to make best use of competition rules – as the Commission would like to see, and rightly so – can hide the irrationality of allowing sales below cost. As has already been said in this debate, no one gives anything away for nothing and there is no such thing as a free lunch. Nevertheless, selling below cost is a commercial stratagem which will, sooner or later, be tolerated by consumers. The fairness of commercial practices is an essential and absolute value for the construction and development of a healthier, fairer and more cohesive economy. The predatory practice of pricing below cost is incompatible with these values.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, when this practice is widespread, it imposes unacceptable pressures on the production system in a field with a dominant position, destroying legitimate profit margins to an unimaginable level and, consequently, the survival of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are thereby bound to make all types of concession and are subject to every type of moral pressure. This practice is also responsible for promoting impulse purchases, which obviously present no advantages for consumers, and instead threaten their interests and change their scale of priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The ban on irresponsible selling must, therefore, be maintained as a principle crucial to fair commercial practice. Furthermore, we have seen that the commercial strategy of predatory pricing is not controllable simply by applying the general rules on unfair competition. The European Parliament must, therefore, table amendments to the Commission regulation, respecting the principles that I have mentioned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The text approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is the result of skill and a spirit of dialogue, which has allowed broadly accepted compromises to be reached. The result is a text which has been rebalanced in order to increase consumer protection, especially with regard to the information they are to be provided with, complaint procedures and the situation of minors, amongst others.</p>
<p class="contents">Also excluded are practices which are not of a commercial promotional nature, such as the operation of games of chance in the apparent form of sales promotion operations or sales at a loss or below cost. I repeat that the latter is not a genuinely promotional practice, since its aim is not so much to protect the consumer as to eliminate market competitors, which at the end of the day benefits neither consumers, competition nor the good operation of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, it is considered an illegal practice in the majority – not in the minority – of Member States. Furthermore, several of them – since the competition rules are insufficient – have had to reintroduce these provisions. And this, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, must be taken into account when the Commission produces its article 7 report and when we try – as we are trying – to implement the common market. Because the common market cannot be a means for extending practices which the majority of Member States consider to be prejudicial, for good reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The impact of a liberalisation cannot be measured in purely economic terms, but we have to take account of all the factors that affect the common good, and consumer protection is something which cannot simply be left to the predatory practices of certain large companies.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore feel that the solution adopted is appropriate and consequently the enormous majority of our Group – which is not ultra-liberal but rather is in favour of a social market economy – is going to support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have worked hard on this regulation, and the number of amendments cited by my colleagues and the debate in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market too are evidence of the importance of what we consider to be a road that Europe must take without fail and which we want to build.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal market needs rules, and the rules must be evaluated in the context of everyday life. The regulation broaches a number of extremely important issues. I will not go back over those which have already been mentioned by my colleagues. There is one point, for example, on which we would like there to be greater reflection and that is the settlement of disputes. We would also like to try experimenting with self-regulation in this new world in which consumers enter into dialogue with the market. Still on the subject of the disputes which are never absent from commercial relations, we call upon the Commission to expand this pilot stage of the European Extra-judicial Network.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, once again as my colleagues have recommended, we would like to see an increase in the activity of the Expert Group on Commercial Communications. This group, set up in the dim and distant past in 1998, now needs to be adapted to deal with the increasingly urgent development of the internal market. Then there are a whole series of points already mentioned which we fully support.</p>

He gave our group sufficient opportunity to express the essence of our views in the report. As a consequence, not only did we gain the support of 90% of the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, but we were also able to ensure that the proposal as a whole is now more balanced and shows the human face of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two questions for the Commissioner. I should like to hear the Commissioner's opinion on the amendment in which we want to maintain the national provisions banning sales below cost, or in any case giving the Member States the opportunity to do so. I wonder whether the Commissioner understands our preference for preventive action over ex-post appeals to national or other competition authorities. I wonder whether the Commissioner is fully aware that not all Member States have a legal culture that facilitates appeals to the competition authorities in order to resolve such problems. I wonder whether the Commissioner comprehends that sales below cost are an instrument that can not only be abused by a dominant player to vanquish its rivals within competition law, but that it also enables an integrated distribution company to exploit its stronger financial position vis-à-vis specialised SMEs that have less financial clout.</p>
<p class="contents">The other question I should like to put to the Commissioner relates to consumer protection, on which a number of announcements have been made. Are we to expect anything more? If so, what? What else does the Commission have up its sleeve? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was thanks to our excellent working relationship that we were able to put what started out as a highly disputed Commission proposal on sales promotions to bed.</p>
<p class="contents">Advertising in the individual Member States and, more to the point, cross-border advertising in Europe, is a difficult and tricky business nowadays. One hardly dares launch an advertisement nowadays without checking with a lawyer first. There are all sorts of restrictions and bans on advertisers in the Member States. To bring you up to date on what is happening in Germany, which Mr Lehne also used as an example, the euro discount offered by a clothing chain at the beginning of the year was prohibited by the courts, early riser price discounts have been prohibited by the courts and classic customer loyalty schemes such as Air Miles have been banned under German law.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers are treated like ignorant, uninformed children. We have to put a stop to this, which is why I and my honourable friends in our group welcome in principle the Commission proposal to help out here. With the amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs, it will certainly do a great deal to help the cross-border marketing of goods and services in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Legal Affairs has proposed important amendments to the scope of the regulation. A number of sensitive areas need to be exempted, especially national advertising bans for members of regulated professions such as lawyers and notaries, and bans on the advertising of pharmaceuticals. In addition, national rules on aggressive advertising practices or the exertion of psychological buying pressure need to stay in place. Seasonal and clearance sales are also exempted from the regulation, as are fixed-prices for books and, last but not least – and this has already been addressed – the thorny issue of below cost selling. We were right not to include this in the scope of the regulation.</p>

I therefore believe that the proposal is very appropriate in order to humanise the national provisions on the communication of sales promotions.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal has given rise to a very important debate in this Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on a very specific aspect, namely, once again, sales at a loss. I am glad to see that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has included the views of the Environment Committee in its amendments, and I therefore congratulate Mr Beysen, rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and Mrs Patrie, draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is reasonable that sales at a loss should be regulated at national level. At the moment, the majority of Member States prohibit this practice: Germany, Austria, France, Ireland, Greece and Spain, amongst others, and it is not an arbitrary prohibition. I am going to be the last speaker to say that sales and re-sales at a loss cannot be considered commercial promotion practices, because these practices distort the principles of fair competition and in particular prejudice small retailers, who do not have the margins to compete in such a situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, they create a false alarm in terms of consumer information, harm the image of the brand and seriously alter the planning of manufacturers and suppliers. Specifically I support Amendments Nos 27, 28, 29, 30 and 32 and I trust that the majority of this House will approve them and that the Commission will accept them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, in my introductory remarks this morning I explained that the objections of this Parliament and of other groups in society concentrated on four different sectors, four different aspects of this subject. On behalf of the Commission I should now like to address those four aspects. Almost all MEPs who took the floor this morning and this evening have mentioned sale below cost. In discussing national provisions banning sale below cost, Mr Beysen, Mr Langen, Mrs Fourtou, Mrs McCarthy, Mr MacCormick and many others expressed concern at how SMEs would be affected if these national provisions were to be abolished. I think the resolution before us offers an acceptable solution as it asks the Commission to undertake further investigation before proposing a Community-wide solution to this problem. The authors of the resolution agree with the Commission that varying national rules in this area make cross-border purchasing and price strategies more difficult, and that action at European level is necessary for this reason. The Commission finds the compromise acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to emphasise that the Commission does not agree that such prohibitions on sale below cost are needed to maintain clearance sales. After all, seasonal clearance sales of this kind operate well in the seven Member States that do not have such provisions. It is for this reason that the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 30 tabled by Mrs Thyssen. I am happy to clarify, though, that the study which the Commission has promised to carry out into selling below cost will take proper account of the consequences of deregulation for SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to the second topic which I mentioned this morning. With regard to the comments made by Mrs Patrie on consumer protection and the link between this initiative and our activities on fair trading practices, Mr Beysen's report fortunately does not take the view that this proposal will have a negative impact on our ongoing study into the need for an initiative on fair trading practices. That confirms the statements made by my fellow MEP Mr Byrne and myself on a number of occasions, namely that these two initiatives are entirely complementary. The Commission therefore regrets that it is unable to accept Amendment No 28 tabled by Mrs Ghilardotti and the second part of Amendment No 12 tabled by Mrs Niebler. The information requirements in the proposal offer a high level of consumer protection, which is why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 41 and 50, which would undermine the level of consumer protection. On the issue of alcohol, the Commission does not consider Amendment No 80 to be proportional since the Member States restrict the sale of alcoholic products to minors.</p>
<p class="contents">On the third point, promotional games, I can tell you that in view of Parliament's strong opposition to the Commission's present approach to this subject, the Commission accepts the compromise solution put forward in Mr Beysen's report. For that reason the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 8 as it is currently worded. Amendments Nos 20, 21 and 22 tabled by Mrs Patrie and Mr Lehne are now redundant since the link between taking part in a promotional game and the sale of a product is no longer possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I should like to address the issue of mutual recognition. I should like to point out that this principle serves to allow free movement in sales promotion activities even without excessive harmonisation. As Mrs McCarthy and Mrs Fourtou have clearly indicated, the principle of mutual recognition is the cornerstone of all our work in the area of the internal market. As we already know, this applies to the Internet as well. Amendments designed to remove this principle from the proposal, such as Amendment No 72 tabled by Mrs Patrie or Amendment No 79 tabled by Mr MacCormick and Mrs Hautala, are therefore unacceptable to the Commission. The same applies to Amendment No 73 tabled by Mrs Patrie which makes the application of this principle dependent on further cumbersome notification procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also rejects amendments that undermine the internal market, such as Amendments Nos 28 and 12, and amendments that aim to exclude certain sectors from their advantages, such as the first part of Amendment No 13 tabled by Mrs Niebler. The Commission is also unable to accept Amendment No 39 on language requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to inform Mr Fiori that the Commission certainly agrees that the opportunity to obtain redress must be used as quickly as possible, but the Commission thinks that in most cases this is best done by the promoter itself. The Commission will propose a certain number of rules ensuring that the promoter acts in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, those are my replies to the questions and comments presented this morning and this evening. The only task remaining to me is the pleasant one of thanking Mr Beysen and his shadow rapporteur for the outstandingly positive contribution they have made as rapporteurs to our discussions on this important topic, which has aroused such lively interest. The Commission knows that Mr Beysen has devoted a great deal of time and effort to this task, which presented many difficulties to him and his committee. The Commission is very grateful that we have finally managed to reach a satisfactory compromise, and hopes and expects that it will be passed when it is put to the vote, which I believe will take place tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
