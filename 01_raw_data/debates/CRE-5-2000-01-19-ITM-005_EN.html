My only regret is that my own commitment to open the European Reconstruction Agency on Monday meant that I could not take part myself in that trip to the Middle East, even though, as I mentioned earlier in the day – which is another story – events conspired to maroon me at Munich airport rather than transport me to Thessaloniki. Such is life.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that honourable Members will excuse me if I am not able to stay to the end of the debate as I would, in all normal circumstances, wish to do. The debate was fixed for this morning and on that basis I had arranged to see visitors from the Balkans this evening. So I hope I can count on the understanding of the House on this occasion. It is not something, I assure you, which I would wish to make a practice of.</p>
<p class="contents">Like honourable Members, I welcome the United States’ efforts that have relaunched the Syrian/Israeli negotiations, despite the Syrian decision that they needed more time before resuming the talks that were scheduled to start again today. There is reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future. I also hope that progress in the Syrian track will pave the way for an early resumption of Lebanese/Israeli talks which could then advance in parallel towards an overall deal on Israel's relations with its northern neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track. The situation of the Palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict. A fair and, indeed, generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the Middle East. Israelis and Palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum. Although there has been some slippage, I trust that the remaining Israeli troop redeployments will materialise soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, despite the indication the day before yesterday that the timetable for the Framework Agreement on permanent status has been pushed beyond the mid-February deadline, I very much hope that the much more important September deadline for the final agreement on permanent status will be reached. I was reassured that this was also the view of Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat, when they met on Monday.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members will know that one particular concern of ours has been that there should be a resumption of progress on the multilateral track. This is far from straightforward but we will do what we can to make this possible, in close liaison with the US and Russian co-sponsors as well as the regional parties. We are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">The beginning of the talks with Syria paved the way for a convening of the multilateral steering group in Moscow at the end of the month. I look forward to attending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push things forward again.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has an important role to play in the peace process, as all sides – Palestinians, Israelis, their Arab neighbours and the United States – have acknowledged.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is our role confined to that of banker. We must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region. But we should not kid ourselves: a comprehensive Middle East peace deal comes with a hefty price tag.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is already considering the implications for the European Union of the recent encouraging developments. We intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with Parliament and Council soon. But let me remind honourable Members that the European Union is no slouch when it comes to financial support for the peace process. We are the largest of all donors to the Palestinians. We have also offered very substantial support to Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt. With the Israelis we have established closer cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community contribution of over EUR 600 million in grants and loans between 1994 and 1998 effectively underpinned the Palestinian authority and contributed substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza. European Union Member States together contributed another EUR 860 million during that crucial period.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, let me applaud the important steps that the Palestinian authority has recently taken to improve budgetary transparency. President Arafat will be meeting the Council of Ministers next week. This will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous steps to improve the Palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law. The Commission is actively involved in those efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs. We committed more than EUR 20 million for such projects last year. This package included renewed assistance for people-to-people activities and cross-border cooperation where Israelis and Arabs meet on non-governmental and expert levels. Members will recall that the European Union is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of issues naturally emerge as additional potential targets of Community support in the coming phase of the peace process – among them, helping to consolidate a Golan settlement both in terms of contributing to security arrangements and supporting demining and the rebuilding of communities in the Golan Heights. Syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a wartime to a peace economy. Reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern Lebanon, the only Middle Eastern area with an ongoing military conflict, will also demand considerable efforts. We also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in Lebanon as a whole. A solution is needed to the Palestinian refugee problem – these are the largest group of refugees in the world, numbering nearly 5 million people – an indication of the enormous challenges ahead. We must support initiatives increasing the availability and improving the distribution and management of the region's very scarce water resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, but maybe most importantly, we are encouraging closer regional cooperation in a number of areas, bringing all the countries concerned together in a joint endeavour to address their common problems.</p>
<p class="contents">It is already apparent that the financial resources currently available for Community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the magnitude of support that will be required in the event of permanent peace. I want to underline that point. I wish insistently to remind the Council and, should it be necessary, Parliament, that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat that a change in the politics of the Middle East will require a gear change in the support that we shall be asked and expected to provide. I hope I can add that we will want to provide that.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made progress in recent months and weeks, as Mr Gama mentioned earlier. But it is inevitably going to be a tough process with difficulties and disappointments on the way. We will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligations and challenges that will be created by that outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I will repeat for some who have entered the Chamber in the last few minutes, what I said at the outset of my remarks: that I will not be able to stay until the end of the debate, largely as a result of having assumed that the debate was taking place this morning and having fixed a meeting on the Balkans for this evening. I hope the House will understand that.</p>

I would like to tell him that communications with Madrid are usually more fluid and, therefore, I hope to see him there soon.</p>
<p class="contents">The statements we have heard today on the Middle East peace process are very opportune at the moment because of the hurried tour which Minister Gama – whose absence from this debate I also regret – has made of the region, accompanied by other Council representatives. The tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a pessimistic view of the situation. I honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation. In this sense, I share Commissioner Patten’s positive attitude. Let me explain: it is true that the Israeli Government has delayed the third hand-over of West Bank territory to the Palestinian authorities. It is also true, however, that, since the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreements, 39% of the territory of the West Bank has been handed over to the Palestinian National Authority, together with two thirds of the Gaza Strip and, more importantly, this agreement has so far been scrupulously complied with, since, under the terms laid down in Sharm el-Sheikh, the Israeli Government has the right to delay that handover. This is naturally on the condition that the delay does not exceed three weeks, as Prime Minister Barak has promised.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the decision to delay the second round of talks, initiated in Shepherdstown by the Syrian Arab Republic, is undoubtedly significant, but I am convinced that the hopes which were raised on 3 January in that town will not be dashed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the fact that the different groups in this Parliament are tabling a motion for a resolution, in this ever controversial debate, which is the result of a broad consensus, seems to me to demonstrate the clear political will to decisively support open peace processes. I would therefore like, equally firmly, to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve differences, which are still no doubt profound, between the parties.</p>
<p class="contents">In my judgement, this constitutes a guarantee to both sides, both from a political and a financial point of view, of the commitment they can expect from the European Union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for. It is clear to everyone that this is essential to guaranteeing security in the area and to cooperating in the development which is needed to heal the serious social differences which exist. But this also serves to make a claim, on the part of the European Union, for a degree of political participation in the process which is consistent with its economic contribution – we do not have aspirations to be bankers – and which will be suitably visible to the public. There is absolutely no doubt that the forthcoming trip by the President of the European Parliament to the region will contribute to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to say that I agree with the tone which Galeote Quecedo’s speech set here. We in Parliament strongly support the Middle East peace process. It is, of course, a peace process which is finally under way. If we think of how the process was looking a year ago, the difference between then and now is like that between night and day, despite difficulties and delays. </p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise four points. First of all, the Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement contains, as everyone knows, a concrete timetable for the implementation of Israel’s commitments. This applies both to the interim agreement and to the Hebron and Wye Agreements. While the negotiations on the final peace settlement have begun, I think it is important to keep the two processes apart. A lack of progress in the final status negotiations should not jeopardise implementation of the three above-mentioned interim agreements. What we need to look out for in this context is how matters develop in connection with the harbours in Gaza, the northern transit route between Gaza and the West Bank, further releases of political prisoners and implementation of the financial commitments. </p>
<p class="contents">The second point relates to Syria. There, the border question is obviously central. How negotiations are proceeding there, we still do not know. What is important, however, is that they have begun. An important question in this context is the future distribution of water. As things are at present, the Golan Heights account for between a third and a sixth of Israel's water supply. </p>
<p class="contents">The third aspect is the peace negotiations in Syria which are closely linked to the issue of Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon. According to UNIFIL, there are now concrete signs that Israel is preparing to withdraw, which is something we welcome. There too, of course, outstanding matters in dispute are the water problem and the situation of the Lebanese Palestinian refugees. </p>
<p class="contents">My last point concerns the future Palestinian State. This may be proclaimed in the course of this year, with or without Israel’s support. The Barak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party. Even if negotiations are not completed by September of this year, there is nothing in the relevant treaties to prevent a Palestinian state from being proclaimed after that date. In this context, it is important for those of us who support the idea of a Palestinian state that the latter should be as Commissioner Patten said, namely a state subject to public control, and that it should be a democratic state. This is something to which we all want to contribute. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My Group has made a contribution to this resolution and, needless to say, approves of it. More specifically, however, I would like to express our delight at the fact that, after such a long time, Israel and Syria are on speaking terms again to resolve their differences of opinion. The recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East. It is, therefore, regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being. </p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, both parties will need to make huge efforts. Lasting peace in the region can only be achieved by means of an agreement which guarantees the security of the Israeli borders, as well as Syria’s integrity. It is also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relations and to establish constant dialogue. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the bilateral meetings with Syria, I hope that Israel will also enter into negotiations with Lebanon within the foreseeable future and that, in the framework of economic and regional cooperation, a multilateral approach will appear possible. </p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it is still regrettable that the European Union, one of the most important financial donors, is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process. This peace process in the Middle East is one of the priorities of the European Union’s common foreign and security policy. This is where Mr Solana, the High Representative to the Council, could come into his own. The Commission and Member States also have to be encouraged to support projects which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nations in the region. </p>
<p class="contents">I should also draw your attention to the significance of the Barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation. In this respect, we support Libya’s participation, provided that it recognises human rights, renounces support for terrorists and fully supports the peace process. There are still, needless to say, many unresolved problems and unanswered questions, also involving the Palestinians. Everyone knows that the peace process is a protracted and difficult affair but we are convinced that, with the necessary trust, perseverance and indispensable political will, our common goal, namely a peaceful and prosperous Middle East, will be achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The moment of truth is approaching. Is Israel prepared to comply with the UN’s resolutions and, in exchange for peace and security, hand back the Arab areas which were conquered in 1967? Will Israel let Palestinian refugees return or be given compensation? Will Israel share Jerusalem and the water of the River Jordan? Will a free Palestine be a truly democratic state and, therefore, reliable as a partner in peace? Will Syria fully accept Israel’s existence and introduce democracy and the rule of law? </p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lies with the occupying country, Israel, does not prevent the Arab partners from also having a considerable share of the responsibility. Peace in the Middle East concerns us all, however. It is therefore good that the EU should act as a godparent to the Palestinian state. </p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, I want to conclude with a remarkable story from Sweden where an international Intergovernmental Conference on Hitler’s extermination of the Jews is being held, which is obviously a welcome initiative. Of 47 states invited from all corners of the world, not one of them, however, is an Arab state included in the EU’s Barcelona process. This has been interpreted as indicating that the Arab attitude towards Israel should be regarded by Europeans as being similar to the Nazis’ anti-Semitism, which of course is completely incorrect. The Arab world’s criticism of Israel has been founded upon the same sort of anti-colonialism as, for example, Algeria’s fight for freedom against France. But today, Egypt, Jordan and Palestine have peace treaties with Israel. I therefore wonder whether Commissioner Patten does not agree with me that it would have been only right and proper to have invited at least one Arab state to the holocaust conference in Stockholm. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is high time there was peace in the Middle East. It is time to end the era which began with the Balfour declaration in 1917 and the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. It is time there were secure borders and political, social and economic rights in every country in this region, and that human rights were recognised and upheld in Syria, Palestine, Israel and everywhere else. This is an exercise in sovereignty, and in democracy for each population and every individual, but to this end it is vital for all parties in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and rights, and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concessions must be given. I refer principally to the Palestine-Israel question, but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the Golan since 1967 and in southern Lebanon since 1982. Israel has to accept its responsibilities, withdraw from the occupied territories and share its water resources but, at the same time, it has to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in terms of economic and political relations with all the countries in the area. However, Israel is not the only country concerned with security. The same goes for the other countries, especially for the Palestinians, who are still living under military occupation and whose land even today is still confiscated in areas B and C, despite the Oslo Agreement and subsequent agreements. Between the period when the Oslo Agreement was signed and 17 October 1999, 174 000 dunams of land were confiscated, 8 462 of which have been taken under Mr Barak’s Government. Trees have been uprooted, houses are still being demolished and, above all, water supplies have been reduced or refused, especially in East Jerusalem, while the settlements continue and are growing constantly. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that with the election of the new government, positive steps have been taken: negotiations, at least, have resumed. But in the Middle East, there can be no stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state, if they cannot move freely within their own territory. All the international community has to do is implement<span class="bold"> </span>Resolutions 332, 248, 245 and 194. </p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned by the deferment of the building of relations with Syria, as well as Mr Barak’s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the Israeli army and the Sharm el­-Sheikh agreements. We feel it is extremely important for the European Union to play a political role in negotiations which matches its economic aid. We cannot be content with a role backstage. We must be leading protagonists while staying off a collision course with the United States, as Minister Gama said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, firstly my thanks and appreciation to Commissioner Patten for his comments here today, particularly in relation to the role of the European Union in the peace process, and for reaffirming that our role is not only that of "banker" for the entire operation.</p>
<p class="contents">I was deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talks between Israel and Syria had been suspended. I very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date. Nevertheless, we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the Middle East of late. The fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister were recently sitting around the same table in America for the first time in their respective histories is an indication that old hatreds and animosities can be overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Political leaders must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to an overall peace settlement within the Middle East. I know that if agreement can be reached between Syria and Israel, the Israeli Prime Minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with Syria in any future referendum. The settlers at the Golan Heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security. If Syria would be willing to offer concessions on the security question then the prospects of a successful resolution to the Israel/Syria question might be promising.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of Palestine, I recognise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspects of the Wye Agreement. The key problem areas at the moment include the difficulties of redeployment, as well as the transfer of territories. The low level of releases of Palestinian prisoners and the fact that the Israeli Government appears to intend halting implementation of building permits already granted, as well as not approving new ones, pose further obstacles. These issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations, although, I believe, these talks will not be held up indefinitely.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, the main difficulty in approaching the negotiations seems to be that the Palestinians are insisting that the border issue must be agreed upon first, while the Israeli Government says that it should be settled only if a solution is reached on the issue of settlements and security. Currently, both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, while other countries in the Middle East have had reservations about the overall direction of the peace process, now that the Syrian Government has been brought into the peace process, Egypt and other countries in the region are willing to move forward. I sincerely hope that, in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the Middle East, all the key protagonists will move forward quickly, in the very near future, so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are those who are in favour of new agreements between Israel and Syria, but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the Middle East issue. Indeed, the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability. The time has come for Israel to fulfil its promises of old and definitively withdraw from the occupied territories, at last recognising once and for all the authority of Palestine, whose resumed diplomatic activity will have a secure future while it is under the wise leadership of Yasser Arafat. It is equally important not to lose sight of the Iraq question, which no one discusses anymore, thereby relegating the problems of millions of women, elderly people and children, the victims of an embargo as arrogant as it is wicked, to oblivion. I do not know what Syria and Israel will want or be able to do in reality, but I do know that our institution can do a lot and it is time that it attached the same importance to peoples’ lives as it does to the ballasts of the cold, colourless, artificial neon bulbs in our lamps, which can illuminate houses but not the world in the third millennium. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He was under the impression that the Syrians thought that, in exchange for the Golan Heights, all they had to do was to fax the Israelis a receipt. </p>
<p class="contents">Oz’s impression is also echoed in the Israeli press. It contrasts Prime Minister Barak’s personal peace efforts and the distant attitude, even physical absence, of the strong man of Damascus, President Assad, at the negotiations in the United States. Surely Assad would be Barak’s ideal negotiating partner and not the Foreign Affairs Minister. And the Israelis were certainly not impressed by the discourteous behaviour of Minister Farouk al-Shara in Shepherdstown. His behaviour towards Prime Minister Ehud Barak was plainly insulting.</p>
<p class="contents">But why pay attention to such detail as basic diplomatic niceties in the face of a tough negotiation process over territory? Well, the Syrians are quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face. At the end of the day, Israeli voters can still express an opinion on the return of the Golan.</p>
<p class="contents">All the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater European involvement in the peace process. It is, however, very much in doubt whether Brussels can make available the billions of dollars which the Israeli and Syrian authorities require from their peace patron, the United States, not to mention the heavy, equally costly, security guarantees in case of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish off by asking the European Council and Commission a question. How accurate are the press reports which state that the Portuguese Presidency has already pledged troops as a peacekeeping force in the Golan? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is clear that, for once, the United States has not been able to secure progress on the restarting of these negotiations, and it is true that the obstacles are difficult to overcome: the Syrians wish to regain sovereignty and jurisdiction over the Golan Heights and re-establish the borders which existed before 4 June 1967, while the Israelis wish, since they consider that it suits their situation better, to have the borders which were set in 1923.</p>
<p class="contents">The suspension of the talks between Syria and Israel is not the only delay affecting the peace process in the Middle East. The application of the framework agreement between the Palestinian authorities and Israel is also suspended at the moment. After the talks which took place the day before yesterday between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Leader of the Palestinian Authority, the Israeli Prime Minister requested a delay of two months as from 13 February, the deadline for the implementation of the framework agreement on the situation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p class="contents">What can the European Union do in these circumstances? Unfortunately, very little. It naturally has to support these negotiations, sponsored by the United States; contacts have to be increased; the presence of the European Union envoy, Ambassador Moratinos, who has fulfilled his mission with great diligence and efficiency, within the powers of the European Union, is positive. But none of this hides the fact that there is a certain sense of impotence, because when the negotiators from each side fly back to the United States this weekend, we will have to remember that, for every 100 dollars spent on the peace process in the region, 60 are contributed by the European Union. When we consider that a conference will soon be held in Moscow, it becomes clear that the European Union’s presence in this peace process is somewhat pitiful.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to insist to the Portuguese Presidency that we must play a greater role, that it is time to take over and to secure greater participation for the European Union in this process. I hope that the forthcoming visit by the President of the European Parliament to the region, as well as the presidents of the relevant interparliamentary delegations, will begin an era of greater initiative and a greater presence for the European Union in this complicated and difficult peace process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should just like to make three comments which Commissioner Patten will perhaps see as similar but which, for various reasons, a Member can formulate more openly.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I believe that we can welcome the agreement between Israel and the Palestinian authorities. But we have enough agreements now: Oslo, Wye Plantation, Sharm el-Sheikh. We have enough agreements; they just need to be implemented. However, in this regard I share Mr Salafranca’s scepticism when he says that there has been bad news from Israel this week, namely that the Sharm el-Sheikh<span class="italic"> </span>Memorandum cannot be implemented within the set timeframe.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between Syria and Israel. I consider this to be very encouraging news. But we have also learned this week that Mr Barak will not be travelling to Washington and that the negotiations cannot therefore be continued. I should like to make it quite clear: if the Golan Heights are returned to Syria, the problem in this region will be solved. On the question of the referendum which various Members have referred to: we must consider if a referendum always needs to be held in order to honour obligations under international law and under the law of nations. In Germany, there would probably be dancing in the streets if we were to say that we were holding a referendum on payments to the European Union and we shall pay if the German people are prepared to pay. That would be a similar situation.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and last point concerns the role of the European Union. I should really like to stress the excellent role which Mr Moratinos’ special mission has played in the region and the funding which we have provided there, Commissioner Patten. You know that you will always have our support here in Parliament, and that includes your proposal, and we shall be behind you when the time comes to finance it. But we must also play a political role and Mr Moratinos cannot play that role in this region on his own; the Presidency of the Council must take action, the EU High Representative for common foreign and security policy must travel to the region and we must do as the Russians did and invite the protagonists of the peace process ourselves. Then we will have played the role which is commensurate with our participation and our contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has taken fifty years to reach this point, which will involve some particularly difficult negotiations. There will be no meeting today in Shepherdstown but we must hope, as Mr Patten said just now, that this postponement of the negotiations due to Syrian requirements will only represent one more step on the road to a peace agreement which will change the face of the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">This hope is contained in our motion for a resolution. We hope for a fair and balanced agreement based on respect for sovereignties and the right to live securely within safe and recognised borders. All the foreign troops, including therefore the Syrian forces, must withdraw from Lebanon in accordance with Resolution 520 of the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Dare we hope for an Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon by July 2000, the date promised by Ehud Barak? Dare we hope for a dual peace agreement between Israel and its neighbours to the north? We really hope and believe so. Never have the parties been so determined.</p>
<p class="contents">One fundamental point to be stressed is the balance which must be expressed in the message from Europe and which must exist between the people. There must also be a political balance between the participants in the negotiations. Following the attack in Hadera on Monday, we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism. In terms of balance, or should I say imbalance, I must add that it is to be regretted that Europe is still playing a minor political role in resolving this conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">At midday, Mr Gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by Europe to the region. Despite everything, we are being forced to recognise that the resumption of the peace process is largely due to the work of Washington. Like other Arab countries before them, the Syrians chose the Americans to sponsor the negotiations. This was the choice also made by Israel where Europe suffers from a partisan public image, and this is a fact, not a judgement. This is now the opportunity to reiterate to Mr Patten, Mr Solana and Mr Moratinos how much we are relying on their efforts to include Europe in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict. Although it is difficult for Europe to speak with one voice about the peace process, it can and must speak in the same spirit of confidence and solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the few seconds available to me, I would like to stress the point raised by almost all the speakers concerning the minimal and politically weak role of Europe. Europe is being called upon to have greater involvement, not just so that it is seen to be having some part to play or so that it can steal some of the limelight from the United States but because, in my opinion, there is a pathological dimension to the US intervention, not only in the one-sided view it takes on issues concerning the Middle East and countries such as Iraq, Libya and Syria, but also in the policies it has adopted which give very little consideration to the basic principles of international law – policies which the European Union could promote much more fundamentally, aggressively and forcefully based on UN decisions adopted thus far. </p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, I believe that certain issues, such as that of Israel’s withdrawal from the territories it has occupied since 1967, are key issues in which Europe could play its part in generating a more positive driving force.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stenzel (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, the Israeli peace process has stalled before it even got started. More’s the pity! This is hardly surprising and no reason for concern but it does show how important it is for the European Union and the European Parliament to support the peace process between Israel and Syria which came to a standstill four years ago and which is fundamental to peace in the Near East. With regard to the security policy dimension of this peace process, patience is called for. That President Clinton would like another foreign policy success at the end of his term of office is understandable but should not result in any hasty outcome to the negotiations. If the European Union is one of the key donors in this region and wants to be taken seriously politically, it needs not only one voice, but also, and above all, a balance. It must avoid a reputation for partiality, which it has not always managed to do in the past and which is why it has a low profile in the Near East.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I wonder just how coordinated the European Union’s foreign policy really is. This question does not only apply to the division of roles between the Commissioner for External Relations, Chris Patten, and the European Union High Representative for common foreign and security policy, Javier Solana; it also applies to the invitation to the Libyan Head of State, Colonel Gaddafi, by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi. I am reminded of the former Austrian Chancellor Kreisky, who was so highly active in the Near East; he caused more harm than good with his invitation to Gaddafi all that time ago. As regards the security policy dimension of the return of the Golan Heights, the EU must make it clear that such a step can only take place at the end of a peace process with Syria, not at the beginning. The quid pro quo on the part of Syria must go beyond normalisation of diplomatic relations with Israel. Even in an era of rockets which can overfly everything, the risk that the Golan Heights might be used to shoot into Israeli territory as in 1967 must be eliminated. This calls for an efficient monitoring system.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, peace with Syria must also result in peace with the Lebanon. The objective of the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Barak, to withdraw Israeli troops from the safety zone in the South of Lebanon by July 2000 must be supported. But Syria, which still has a considerable military presence in the Bekaa valley and influence on terrorist organisations in Lebanon, must take similar steps. It is up to Syria to mop up at least part of this terrorist scene in Lebanon. The latest terrorist attack in Northern Israel demonstrates just how urgently this is needed. The time is right for peace between Israel and Syria; given his age, Head of State Assad wants to put his own house in order before handing over to his son. One basic requirement is missing, however, namely a democratic constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from this, the EU can offer the following: its model for achieving peace through economic interpenetration, open borders and no customs barriers must be presented as an attractive model throughout the Near East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having said that, we are confident that the desire for peace shown by the populations in the region will prevail in the end, and we would ask the European Union to contribute by taking the initiative again. We acknowledge that the Union has played a role in all this – we were reminded of Ambassador Moratinos’ work, the visit by the Portuguese Presidency and the forthcoming meeting in Moscow – but we want this to be more incisive. Despite the problems that have arisen over the last few days, the resumed talks between Syria and Israel have opened up new horizons in the right direction, and it will be important for the actions to respect the deadlines set at Sharm el-Sheikh.</p>
<p class="contents">In our joint resolution, we point out that there are a large number of unresolved, complex issues, maybe the most complex of all – as previous speakers have already mentioned – and, in addition, there is the fact that the Lebanon is still not represented at the negotiating table. The European Union must therefore take its place next to the United States as an active party in the negotiations, and it must do so by means of a major political investment, by looking to the future of the whole Mediterranean region and the unbreakable<span class="bold"> </span>link between its destiny and Europe. The Union must intervene to the effect that the instability, war and poverty in that area reflect back on us and increasingly condition our own political, economic and social plans. </p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission and the Council will also act in a more consistent way, and realise that the Mediterranean region is now a major priority for the European Union. Nevertheless, if we make an honest assessment of the progress of the Barcelona process, we have to admit that the focus of Europe on enlargement now risks banishing politics in that region to the level of the bureaucratic routine of ongoing programmes and bilateral agreements. And yet, progress in the peace process, political progress in many of these countries and the attempt to revitalise regional organisations, such as the Arab Maghreb Union, show that the time is ripe for a new dynamic in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. </p>
<p class="contents">To be extremely brief, our message to you, dear friends of the Commission and the Council, is that, despite its financial commitment, which is still important, Europe’s political role is not yet equal to current and possible future developments, either in the Middle East or in the whole Mediterranean area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the tangible result of the unshakeable desire of Ehud Barak and his government to ensure peace and security. However, everyone knows deep down that nothing is ever easy and that nothing has yet been settled in this respect. Whatever the state of the negotiations, the best and the worst scenarios are still possible.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, with regard to Europe, I have three suggestions to make. Firstly, we Europeans must try to stop harping on about certain things, making criticisms or marking aspects as good or bad. Secondly, we should not over-exploit the lightning tours of the Middle East which often occur in the wake of Madeleine Albright. Finally, we must engage in comprehensive discussions with each of the partners, particularly the Israelis, to properly gauge their margins for manoeuvre and to determine the precise points which we can push forward. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to do this, we must personally meet Ehud Barak because he has the keys to peace in his hands. I am sure that our Palestinian friends would prefer a Europe which is more understanding with regard to Israel but which, at the same time, would be capable, like the USA, of exerting pressure to break any stalemates. It is time to stop lamenting our lack of political weight. If we want to move from being observers to being participants, we must know how to pay the political price for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that, in the future, there can be a new way forward for Europe’s role in the Middle East. It must be possible for Europe, in the same way as the United States, to be credible, to win respect and to obtain broad popular support among citizens and voters in the Middle East’s only democracy, Israel. We have progressively to win the confidence of Israel’s citizens. We can look at a country outside the EU, for example Norway, which, through its prime minister Kjell Magne Bondevik and its foreign minister Knut Vollebaek, has continued to have good relations with both Israel and the Arab side, and in a way which creates confidence. These good relations are enjoyed not only with Israel’s Government but also with its people. </p>
<p class="contents">We can also learn from the Netherlands and its water project. I believe that Portugal, as the country holding the Presidency of the EU, has everything to gain by working, on behalf of the EU, on the water supply issues as one of the EU’s absolutely central tasks in the Middle East. </p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying the following. Israel is the Middle East’s only democracy. Let us never forget in our fight for democracy, political pluralism and human rights that Israel is a model and that Syria with Hafez el-Assad is one of the region’s very worst dictatorships. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For decades – almost as many decades as the conflict in the region has lasted – broad sections of European public opinion have mobilised themselves with the intention of contributing to a situation where hate and senselessness may give way to rationality, harmony and simple common sense amongst the parties involved. Nevertheless, such public resolve has not been proportionately reflected in the European institutions. There have certainly been notable declarations on the matter, such as the Venice declaration, but they have languished over the years. Such a political absence, the lack of genuine political will to act and the simultaneous existence of too many discordant national voices not only damages the Union in terms of the common European project, but also disappoints the expectations of many non-Europeans who would be happy to see us acquire greater responsibility and suitable coordination between external policy and other policies.</p>
