The Council is fully in agreement with Parliament’s positive assessment of the significance of the European social dialogue and notes the good progress and the encouraging results that have been achieved in connection with the informal summits to date, despite the lack of a formalised institutional framework for these meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">Close contact based on reciprocal trust between the public authorities and the parties of the labour market at European, national and local level is of crucial importance for strengthening economic progress, prosperity and social integration in Europe. The parties stated in the declaration of the European Council in Laeken that the Standing Committee on Employment was not living up to its aims and that the parties would like to see the committee replaced by an established practice of holding tripartite social summits. The Laeken European Council and the Barcelona European Council concluded that such a social summit should be held prior to each spring summit. On 26 June this year the Commission submitted a proposal for a decision by the Council on the establishment of a tripartite social summit together with the abolition of the Standing Committee on Employment. The Danish Presidency gave the proposal high priority and worked towards a rapid resolution. However, during the initial work in the Council it emerged that the proposal gave rise to a number of issues and legal and institutional problems which could not be resolved immediately. The Presidency wishes to work towards a position being taken at the Council summit on 3 December on how the efforts towards establishing the social summit are to continue. Should it be decided to continue working on a proposal for a formal decision, then devising the further details will not be possible until during the Greek Presidency. However, there is nothing to prevent the social summits being held on an informal basis without the basis of a decision, as has been the case to date.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this answers the question of what the Council intends to do to establish the social summit. The issue of consultation with Parliament has not yet been discussed by the Council. Once the Council has decided the details of how the social summit is to be established there will be a basis for discussing how Parliament can be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by thanking Parliament for having raised the issue of social dialogue and the tripartite social summit. Indeed, it provides a good opportunity to discuss various aspects of this important issue. I hope that we will have a good discussion and I can assure you that the Danish Presidency will take care to include the points of view put forward today in its further deliberations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This proposal was not isolated; it was within the framework of the need to change and modernise the European social dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this proposal is to formalise the social dialogue summits held in Stockholm in March 2001 and Barcelona in March 2002. There is nothing to stop us from holding another informal meeting but, as the President-in-Office has already said, it is very important to formalise this tripartite social summit, because the social partners agreed to it at the European Summit at Laeken. In any case, it will be a summit on growth and employment and it will replace the existing Standing Committee on Employment.</p>
<p class="contents">This forum will play a very important role as far as the implementation of the Lisbon process is concerned, because it is the proper forum for the social partners to submit their proposals and their common agenda for the implementation of the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission chose Article 202 as the legal basis for the establishment of the tripartite social summit, since that was the legal basis for the Standing Committee on Employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there is no provision for consultation of the European Parliament under that article, the Commission anticipated in its proposal that Parliament would be consulted on the introduction of a tripartite social summit because it is a very sensitive and important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The prerogative as to whether to follow this suggestion or not rests with the Council. The Commission considers it of the utmost importance for the proposal to be rapidly adopted. As I have already said, this view is strongly endorsed by the European interprofessional social partners. It will ensure greater consistency between the different dialogues in which the social partners are involved.</p>
<p class="contents">We held informal discussions in the Council and a large majority of Member States agreed on this issue. We believe we will overcome some of the problems – legal or not – which exist in some Member States. I hope that this proposal will receive political support in the Social Affairs Council on 3 December, which would allow it to be adopted at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 9 and 10 December, so that we can have a formal tripartite social summit during the Greek Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very pleased that the response has been given in this way, but I have to say that the answer is rather unsatisfactory. We have before us a proposal on which, as far as the objective is concerned, everyone is actually probably agreed. This objective is of course the holding of such a tripartite meeting. This is where all the problems start, however.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is making reference to Article 202; the Council evidently does not agree with this, because it is deliberating about it. In anticipation of the result of these deliberations there is no wish to seek an opinion from the European Parliament, in particular the opinion that is being prepared by Mr Ettl. We consider this a totally unacceptable situation. As coordinators of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs we have also spoken about it and it is our view that if things go on this way we shall have to seriously consider going to the European Court of Justice, because the rights of the European Parliament are being violated. I also think, Commissioner, that even if Article 202 is used as a basis, you are not applying the Article correctly. You must read the second part of 202, which states that there are indeed cases in which an opinion is not sought from the European Parliament, but that the matter must then have been determined in advance and with an opinion from the European Parliament or that a kind of mandate must have been given. Now, to the best of our knowledge, no mandate has been given here. In any event, everything requires full investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, and this goes for the Council as well, that a lot of trouble could have been saved if the European Parliament had been asked for an opinion. Failure to do so gives this whole affair a rather sinister undertone. We are ourselves currently in the process of consulting Parliament’s Legal Affairs Department on this matter. It is of course possible to use a different legal basis, but I am sure that it will be extraordinarily difficult for the Council and the Commission to find a legal basis where no opinion from the European Parliament is required. After all, that is what this is all about and we are standing up for our rights. The rights of Parliament are already relatively limited when it comes to matters of this kind. That is partly perhaps with good reason, partly also it arises from the Treaty itself, but we cannot in any event accept further erosion of the already limited rights of Parliament in this way. That is the message I would like to give the Council and the Commission in their future deliberations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have one further question. If you indeed proceed to act on the basis of Article 202, should the costs of this operation not be covered by the Council rather than the Commission, as has been the case to date? Perhaps it will be possible to give an answer to this question as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the Commissioner for her clear statement about the arrangements for the tripartite social summit, and to thank the Danish Presidency for attempting to accommodate us.</p>
<p class="contents">What I do not understand as the nominated rapporteur, however, is that at a moment when we are anxious to tackle employment policy and growth in an active way, we are wasting time. The intention was to begin making arrangements for this standing tripartite social summit now, before the spring summit, so that the social partners could start work straight away. The approach we have now adopted means that we are wasting time again, possibly a whole year, at a point when we want to play an active role on employment issues. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has virtually been neutralised – we do not have an appropriate mechanism here. This means that the social dialogue will not be particularly mobilised as a fundamental mechanism for the social partners to be able to – or in fact be obliged to – achieve something practice-related.</p>
<p class="contents">At a point when the term ‘social dimension’ and thus all the mechanism that involves – notably the social dialogue – are constantly on everyone's lips, and when we are talking about deepening social issues in Europe, we are wasting time. I just cannot understand that.</p>
<p class="contents">One more point: today we stand on the threshold of the enlargement of the European Union. I have discussed these issues with many partner states and they all want a properly functioning mechanism in this field, and one that would help all the new Member States. However, I do not believe that it will be easier, if the mechanism does not become operational under the Greek Presidency, to sort matters out later on, once the new Member States have joined us. Things can only get more difficult then, because the existing social partnerships, industrial relations that is, are not so robust. That is the problem we face.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not need to use all my speaking time; I have already expressed my indignation about the fact that Article 202 is constantly referred to as a soft option. Parliament's Legal Service will give us its opinion on this next week, and I hope that will help us somewhat.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Danish Presidency and Commissioner Diamantopoulou once again for their support. I hope that 3 December will be a productive day in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this particular week, however, I agree with Mr Ettl that it is appropriate to add something about the need for early involvement of the prospective new members in the tripartite social summit and the state of dialogue within those countries. The way in which trade unions and employers' organisations are organised varies considerably from one country to another, as does the manner and extent of collective bargaining. The development of employers' organisations is recent and sporadic and their activities are not always coordinated. Where confederations of trade unions and employers' organisations exist, they vary in the extent to which they participate in their equivalents at European level. Much therefore still needs to be done to develop the basis for social dialogue. I know that this issue is one that the Commission has already begun to address through a variety of measures. Its work is of major importance, since cooperation between the authorities, trade unions and employers' organisations is vital for economic and social development and thus for increased employment.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Danish Presidency has recently said, tripartite cooperation and the social dialogue need to be strengthened if the new Member States are to be able to participate in the work on equal terms with all the other Member States.</p>

On the one hand it claims to be interested but on the other, it continues to obstruct its implementation, as is clear from its postponement of the formal creation of the Tripartite Social Summit. The Commissioner has already provided important information, for which I thank her and which allows us to draw this conclusion. Unfortunately, this demonstrates the little importance attached to social issues by most Member State governments. I would emphasise the case of Portugal, with which, being Portuguese, I am most familiar.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the questions that other speakers have already raised about Parliament’s participation and also about the significance of postponing the creation of the Tripartite Social Summit, I should also like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council the following: what measures are you planning to adopt in order at least to increase the participation of women in the social dialogue, in terms of the decision-making bodies, in terms of legal bases and also in terms of the content to be addressed in this entire process? What measures are you intending to adopt to ensure that priority is given to social issues, specifically in the field of employment, social inclusion, equal rights and opportunities and compliance with the social agenda in general? What measures are you planning to take in order to effectively protect social and labour rights and to ensure that they are complied with in practice? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are well aware of the importance that Denmark itself attaches to the work of the social partners in that 80% of Danish workers are covered by collective agreements, but we are also aware that, as we have been hearing, a number of Member States do not share this view.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is beginning to feel a sense of urgency about the need to give greater coherence to the work of the social partners. As has been said, this becomes crucial as we look towards enlargement. We would be interested to hear what involvement is foreseen, and at what point, for the social partners from the accession countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also aware that there are many areas where such consultation is already being advocated, in the temporary agency work directive for example, and in a whole range of other areas relating to family-friendly work, quality of work, modernisation of work, organisation, active ageing policies and so on. So we are also hoping that this new approach will be able to look at the qualitative aspects of growth and employment, which are all too often forgotten, and the social repercussions as a whole. I would echo much of what Mrs Figueiredo has already said.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of funding, I find myself agreeing with Mr Pronk as to the source of funding and again this is going to have to take particular account of the enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the role of the European Parliament is concerned, we are beginning to find an increasing number of forms and areas of cooperation in which Parliament is not fully involved. Open coordination is one area where we are still getting no clear response as to where Parliament actually fits into the whole process.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also aware that certain governments do not want to see any extension of parliamentary powers in the convention process. Some of them seem to be starting early in looking at issues such as the tripartite summit and Parliament's involvement there. Whilst we are looking at questions on the legal basis, this is not the only issue where the question of Parliament's involvement arises. I am thinking of the coordination of social security for third country nationals. We look forward to the legal opinion and we look forward to greater involvement for Parliament so that in future this will not be an issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haarder,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, we make no secret of the fact that there is a certain amount of disagreement concerning the legal basis for these activities. However, first I would like to emphasise that nobody has raised any objection to the idea of holding tripartite summits. Indeed, it was supported by everyone both in Laeken and in Barcelona, so there is no disagreement on that. Nonetheless, there are certain legal problems which are fairly involved. In brief, I can say that the Commission proposes to use Article 202 as the legal basis. The Legal Service of the Council is however of the opinion that this provision cannot be used because it does not give the Council unrestricted decision-making competence. It merely refers to the articles in the Treaty that specify the measures which the Council can take. And according to the Council’s Legal Service, that does not provide a legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">And when the Commission proposes that the summit should consist of the Council’s presidency at Head of State and Government level, the Council’s Legal Service believes that the Council (employment, social policy and health and consumer protection) is not able to make a decision on the introduction of a summit at Head of State and Government level. This might be able to be solved somehow or other if there is a will to do so. Neither does the Council’s Legal Service agree with the Commission’s proposal that the results of the summit – which is to take place the day before the European Council – are to be presented to the European Council in the form of a report. It points out that this would contravene the rules on the organisation of the work of the European Council which the Council itself adopted in Seville in June and that it would be contrary to Article 2 of the Council’s Rules of Procedure, which oblige the Council to prepare the European Councils, including the necessary coordination of all the preparatory work. Moreover, Article 2 sets out time periods for drawing up the provisional agenda of the European Council and the submission of contributions to the discussions and these time periods are not complied with under the proposal. However, concerning this point I would like to say that it can probably be solved with the right will. It simply requires some further discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the first problem I mentioned, namely the use of Article 202 as the legal basis, is the biggest. But let us see whether we can make any progress with it. I have now given an open and honest account of where the disagreement lies. Sometimes you want to ask the lawyers if they cannot try to reach agreement before letting us politicians know, but that is probably easier said than done. Perhaps the Treaty basis is not always equally clear, in which case we have to find a political solution which allows us to do what we want to without it being claimed that we are breaking the rules which form the basis of our work.</p>
<p class="contents">These were a couple of issues. I can assure Mr Ettl that we are not wasting time. However, until we find a correct formal solution we may have to continue with informal summits, that is, follow the informal procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to Mrs Figueiredo that I am fully aware of what she mentioned concerning the representativeness of the parties, but this has not yet been discussed in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to start a major legal debate here in Parliament. I simply felt that I had a duty to state the reasons why the Council is not yet ready to start a formal dialogue as requested. However, we are prepared to continue the more informal dialogue until a solution can be found. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question is why the Commission proposed this. I would ask the Commissioner whether it is feasible for the Commission to propose another legal basis. Under Article 308, for instance, which is very often used in situations like these, Parliament has a direct right to give its advice. Was that why the Commission did not specify Article 308? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some of the legal aspects of the proposal have already been referred to. We believe that these can be overcome with cooperation between the Councils, if from the Employment Council we go to the General Affairs Council and a final paragraph is inserted into the conclusions of the General Affairs Council. I completely agree that, with political will, we can overcome these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is responsible for the budget, but it is a very small one. That is because it only allows for the invitation of eight or ten representatives of the social partners. Since I have the opportunity, I would like to say a few words on the participation of the applicant countries. These countries will, of course, become members of the European partners, the ETUC and UNICE, and they will participate in the social summit through their European institutions and organisations. In any case, we are working closely with governments and social partners in all the applicant countries because some of them are having to start from scratch and there are great problems with the functioning of social dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
