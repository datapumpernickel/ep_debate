It was scheduled to be debated before twelve noon. It has overrun. There is nothing that can be done about this, for that is how it is in this House. It is a report in the framework of the codecision procedure on employees’ rights and insolvency. I, as rapporteur, have nothing against the fact that we are debating it now, but I do disagree with the fact that we would subsequently vote on it during a very vague gathering of votes later on this afternoon. I should therefore like to request – and I have already discussed this with the larger groups – to decide beforehand that we will debate the report now but that we will postpone the vote to the brief part-session in Brussels and possibly to a later date, although I am very much opposed to this. That also gives us the opportunity of tabling a number of amendments and changes as a whole. It seemed a totally uncontroversial report, but nevertheless, there are a number of elements which require further discussion. That is why I would ask to postpone the vote until the next part-session. I do not know whether you can respond to this now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This might well be a Pyrrhic victory, but we shall have to wait and see. I wanted to raise the following matter. We have here a document on employees’ rights in the event of insolvency, that is to say when a business is no longer able to meet its financial obligations. It is a revision of Council Directive 80/987EEC with a number of improvements on what was in there before. A directive such as this aims to give a minimum level of protection in the event of insolvency.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost at the same time that I was appointed rapporteur for this dossier, a group of people turned up from the Sintel company in Spain – a company that was split off from Telefonica, sold by them, in fact. They had been campaigning in Madrid for months because they had not been paid for months. In other words, in addition to what I already knew at the time, this realistic description was sufficient to show me at first-hand how significant this report, concealed behind a mass of insolvency terminology, is. The old document, of course, dates back to 1980. A great deal has changed since then, especially within the labour markets, in terms of types of employees and descriptions of the same, the economy has become more globalised and internationalised, there are more businesses that operate both within a certain country and outside it. In addition, there are still cases where it is unclear which country ought to pay out social security benefits. Of course, there have been a number of procedures for the Court of Justice to deal with, and all these aspects combined have led to the Commission presenting a proposal to change the existing directive. The three main problems at the time were: the concept of insolvency, the placing of a time-limit on the guarantee and, particularly, insolvency cases with a cross-border dimension. I have great admiration for those who have submitted the Commission proposals and who have tabled a few amendments following detailed discussions. These mainly pertain to the new legal basis following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the clarification of the scope and the possible scrapping of the annexes in which quite a few groups are mentioned which can be excluded or not, as the case may be, the new definition of the term ‘intervention’ and especially the new provisions establishing the guarantee fund that covers cross-border cases. In my view, it is important to revisit what I describe as the scope as a whole, for the question as to which categories could still be exempt is still subject to possible debate, especially in the field of domestic staff and the so-called share fishermen. If I had my way, I would scrap this as a whole, as I have also said during the debate. I think that the Commission would also be in favour of this, but a number of countries provide for exemption provisions, and we do not want to make life too difficult for them. What we do consider important is that the Commission has meanwhile included a number of elements which were already being developed within this labour market, where, for example, part-time workers, workers with a temporary agency employment relationship, or workers with fixed-term contracts, are concerned via existing directives in these intervention directives. Since we are as yet unsure about the implications of this, we have to point out – as have many, as will be clear in a moment – that these days, there are an ever increasing number of categories of self-employed, including the quasi self-employed as they are referred to by some, without staff, with staff who would or would not qualify, and then especially those without staff. Those with staff are, in fact, employers. In addition, we still have categories of home workers – mind the translation in this case – because it literally means those working from home, and this could well be the topic of a number of discussions. In fact, it would also be very useful if some progress were made in the legislative work in line with the discussion in the framework of the social dialogue on modernising labour relations, and that is why we made a number of proposals that are now before you. In this connection, I would therefore ask my fellow MEPs to back amendments which pertain to the self-employed without staff, so as to open the debate with the Council in any case. I should like to point out that what is at issue is a codecision procedure and that we will be entering into negotiations after second reading in order to be able to take a step forward in the field of social security and social policy in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can, in fact, be relatively brief about the opinion. Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has particularly attempted to underline the legal aspects of this directive. A number of elements have been adopted, while a number of other elements have not been adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. In any case, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market deems it extremely important for the opinion to be thought-out well. That is why it is also important to return it to the committee, so that it can re-examined very carefully. That also – and perhaps mainly – applies to the position of the self-employed. Indeed, I welcome the fact that the self-employed fall within its scope, at least the self-employed who can be compared to employees. However, there is, of course, the risk that we give people who we actually do not want to fall within the scope of this definition at all, a tremendous opportunity, turning them into a kind of preferred creditor in a bankruptcy. I am not certain whether in the texts as they are worded now, sufficient distinction is being drawn between the two situations, in fact. That is a problem that will require further examination, also in terms of the position of the self-employed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, several months ago the Spanish Government took on the responsibility of making backdated wage payments to Sintel’s employees, relocating or finding other such solutions for all those affected. I say this so that you may be fully informed, Mr Bouwman.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I will move on to my speech on this report. The document we are debating refers to the proposal for amending Directive 80/987/EEC on the approximation of national laws relating to the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer. Mr Bouwman has, in fact, given a very clear example of this situation. The amendment aims to take into account changes to insolvency law in Member States and the need for consistency with other Community directives on labour law already adopted. All of this should be based on a political will to provide employees with a minimum degree of protection under Community law in the event of their employer becoming insolvent.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficulties involved in achieving the intended objective of the Directive are, in my opinion, threefold: firstly, the concept of insolvency; secondly, the complexity of the arrangement introduced to allow a time and quantity limits to be placed on the guarantee; thirdly, insolvency cases with a cross-border dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">With the aim of clarifying the situation, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has once again tabled two amendments: No 16, which includes cases of externalisation or similar, subcontracts, the ‘fake self-employed’, etc., all of which could conceal a true employment contract. In our opinion, we need to reveal the truth before protective methods are implemented, to protect the salaried employee. To not do this would be to open the floodgates which would quickly exhaust the fund in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 17 clarifies the notion of protectable earnings from the corresponding national fund and prevents fraud. All of this is inherent to the protective nature of labour legislation and is inspired by the desire to clearly define the concepts needed for the fund to serve its purpose. This is a clarification of ideas which aids progress towards legal certainty and harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, this is a case which, as we have recently witnessed with another Belgian company, is taking place in large companies, due to the restructuring of these companies and the relations which currently exist in the economic world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If it is, congratulations. I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur on his exceptionally good report and sound preparations for this dossier. I fear that in the current climate, the report is indeed very topical and that this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. All the more reason for ensuring that we protect those employees who are faced with bankruptcy and suspension of payment. That is the rationale underlying the preparations for this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that we in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have reached overwhelming agreement. There are a few loose ends that need tying up, a few points on which we do not yet see eye to eye completely. A moment ago, I heard Mr Pronk say that it is indeed possible that there are still a number of misunderstandings concerning amendments. I am thinking in particular of the point he made, namely the fact that on the one hand, we also want a number of self-employed, notably self-employed who are very much like employees, to fall within the scope of the regulation, but on the other hand, this should not open the floodgates to mutual aid between employers and service providers who would be able to use those funds. We are agreed on the intention. We should use the time we now have until the actual vote to consider whether those misunderstandings can be removed and whether this joint intention can be expressed in a compromise amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the point about the self-employed is a very important one, particularly in this dossier. However, it also crops up in a number of other dossiers. That is why I should like to draw the Commissioner’s attention to this point and ask him whether the Commission could show some more initiative both on this matter and on the matter of defining which categories should in fact be comparable with employees. This is not only of paramount importance for the issue of insolvency, of course, but also for a lot of other aspects of employment protection and labour law. Those definitions in European law are still left for the Member States to deal with. We have noticed that there are rather considerable discrepancies between them. As cross-border employment increases, and this will become ever more popular in the European Union, it will mean that we will be increasingly faced with different definitions and different groups which will cause disruption to labour market relations. Enlargement in particular is a huge cause for concern, as we have already witnessed in the past and are witnessing at the moment in the EU’s border regions. I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner what initiatives she intends to take on this score and urge her to adopt a pro-active stance on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The amendments to this directive follow on from amendments to two other directives relating to mass redundancies and company transfers, the common objective of all of which is to protect workers' interests when companies are restructured and we must not forget this. They therefore <span class="italic">ipso facto </span>raise the question of coordinating the common concepts used and I think that we need to pay attention to this when the amendments are finalised.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this directive also fails to address the question of communitising the definition of salaries. Despite the difficulties inherent in this endeavour, the Fifteen need to adopt a minimum common definition of the concept of employee if the directive is to be applied uniformly. Otherwise, every country, depending on whether it has a broader or narrower understanding of the concept, will differentiate the scope of the directive as it sees fit. We need to tread carefully on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed amendments, which I too support, include extending the scope of the directive to employees under what qualify as "implied" contracts in national legislation. If we are not mature enough to extend the directive to the self-employed, we could at least extend the scope of the directive to employees who are self-employed but who are treated as employees under special legislation. Secondly, this amendment is an inclusion in the sense of covered claims and severance pay, as provided for in International Labour Convention No. 173, and I fail to see why we cannot cover them in Europe. Thirdly, it is the clearest redefinition of the meaning of insolvency so as to include any collective insolvency proceedings and not just traditional bankruptcy proceedings. In any case it is also in the objectives of the directive and has not approximated any formulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The House would be well advised to approve these three amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Insolvency Directive has proved to be an invaluable instrument for protecting employees in cases of economic downturns and it will be a key legislative instrument to respond to the present climate of closures and redundancies. Although the basic structure of the directive should be retained, specific points of the directive need to be revised.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Amendment No 2 which aims to prevent the introduction of new restrictions beyond those currently in place in the Member States, and also Amendment No 9 which proposes to prohibit threshold provisions in order to qualify for claims under the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also in favour of Amendment No 4 which proposes to extend the protection of workers of employers in other insolvency situations beyond those situations covered by the definition of insolvency proposed by the Commission. Firstly, the broadening of the definition is fully acceptable. However, on Amendment No 6, the extension to any other procedure or even to "de facto" situations of insolvency can only be accepted as an option for the Member States and not as an obligation.</p>
<p class="contents">I can also accept Amendment No 11, which proposes to add severance pay on termination of the employment relationship, with the addition of the term "where appropriate". The term "pay" should continue to be defined in the national law of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 14, which proposes the abolition of a ceiling, is not acceptable in its entirety but I share your concerns on this point and I could accept a provision which allows ceilings which are compatible with the social purpose of the directive in order to avoid a level which is unacceptable for workers. I am also ready to supplement this provision with a non-regression clause which impedes Member States from lowering the protection already provided when implementing the amended directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I can accept the reintroduction of the old Article 5 of the directive – Amendment No 15 – but this only in the old unchanged version of this article in the 1980 directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I am unable to accept the remaining amendments, in particular Amendment No 13 which aims to increase the minimum period for pay to six months. Such an increase would seriously reduce the chance of the directive being adopted and would place a further considerable financial burden on the public purse and employers which would in turn cast doubt on the system of pay guarantees as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot accept Amendment No 1, which aims to prevent employees from being "converted" to self-employed persons; Amendment No 7 which proposes the introduction of a Community definition of "employee"; nor Amendments Nos 8 and 16 which propose to add categories of workers who may not be excluded from the scope of the directive. Efforts to combat illegal "conversion" must be made at national level. A Community definition of an employed person should not be included in a particular directive, and self-employed workers cannot be covered because they do not have an employer who could be insolvent.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with your comments I agree that there are different types of self-employed people. There are some self-employed people who are economically dependent. This issue was raised in 2000 when we had consultation with the social partners. The responses of the social partners emphasised the need to clarify and analyse the situation in all Member States because there is a diversity of situations, there are many different kinds of self-employed people. This was the reason why we have already launched a study which will provide us with an overview of the nature of the phenomenon across the European Union. Once we have the results of the study, the Commission will analyse it and after a consultation with the social partners we will present the appropriate way to deal with this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The other categories – home-workers and those in similar categories – are covered to the extent that they are considered to be employees under national law. There is, therefore, no need to mention them specifically.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, some amendments should be rejected because they would not help to achieve the underlying objective of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I can accept, subject to some minor redrafting, Amendments Nos 2, 4, 6, 9, and 11, and parts of Amendments Nos 14 and 15. I reject Amendments Nos 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17 and 18.</p>
