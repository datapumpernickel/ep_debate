<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Elena Espinosa Mangana, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, I stand in Parliament today in order to share with you my views on the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit and the challenges that arise from it, both for the European Union and for the rotating Presidency that Spain holds for the first half of 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union Environment Ministers discussed these matters at length last weekend. I should point out that we broadly agree on our desire to continue moving forward, on three issues in particular: building on the results of the summit, with a view to making them operational as soon as possible; strengthening their elements within the United Nations; and working to fulfil our goals to reduce overall emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have shared goals and strategies. As a result, our most immediate tasks will be to complete the process of formally announcing our commitment; to consolidate an action framework comparable to that of other industrialised and emerging nations; and to make use of all the tools we have available, both within the European Union and in our relationships with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The December summit – an extremely complicated conference characterised by arduous discussions on procedure – was brought to a conclusion in the so-called Copenhagen Accord. A large number of Heads of State or Government and leaders of regional groups were personally involved in producing the document that was adopted, which represents the will of countries whose emissions total more than 80% of those produced globally. Participants included all the industrialised countries, major emerging economies, and a significant number of especially vulnerable countries. This should also help us to respond to the many doubts that continue to clog up the formal process which should lead us towards legally binding solutions, within the United Nations framework and preferably in Mexico.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the content of the Accord, I think it is important to stress that we have clear support for not allowing the temperature to rise by more than two degrees centigrade. This is surely one of its strongest elements with the greatest potential for results: the commitment of all industrialised countries to establish a target for reduction that can be applied right across their economies.</p>
<p class="contents">Emerging nations, for their part, will take concrete, verifiable action that will allow them to make a substantial reduction in their emissions growth: financing based on solidarity and aimed at supporting immediate and medium-term action in the fight against climate change; elements intended to steer new models of governance; and mechanisms that foster technological development and a reduction in emissions caused by deforestation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Copenhagen Summit has shown that we are moving within a new international context, one that requires improvements if we want to provide solutions to global problems. The decision-making rules in place need to be changed so that they can adapt properly to these new times and necessities.</p>
<p class="contents">We do have the tools we need in order to act: a legislative package already in place at Community level; the very highest commitment to furthering a reduction in emissions, international solidarity and technological innovation and cooperation; and the correct institutional structure within the Union, which we must use intelligently, taking full advantage of its complementarity.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have to combine the leadership of the Environment Council when negotiating and planning climate change policies with greater capacity for external action. Furthermore, we should link the environmental task ahead with our experts’ opinions on policies relating to the economy and innovation; we should also improve consistency between our climate goals and our model of development and well-being. All of this must be done without losing sight of the need – both inside and outside the European Union – to consolidate the role of public opinion and of legislators who are committed to investing in a better future and to protecting public interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us bring to bear our collective European experience. Firstly, we have to push for a proper response before 31 January. The Copenhagen Accord, by bringing together all those who have to reduce their emissions, thus enables a comparison of efforts to be made, a comparison that the European Union has demanded; yet we are still not sure how strong other countries’ commitments really are. If they prove to be insufficient, we must continue working to further our collective reductions.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also have to bring about conditions which allow those elements that make up the accord to be applied swiftly. It is vital for the European Union and its Member States to be at the forefront of those countries that keep their promises. For this reason, we will need to carry out the transfer of funds as soon as possible, planned for the period 2010-2012.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to develop a financial framework that can sustain our solidarity commitments with third countries in the Copenhagen Green Climate Fund and, at the same time, foster improvements in accounting rules and our response in terms of both reductions in emissions caused by deforestation and technological cooperation. The following elements need to be added to this: our own policies, aimed at fulfilling our emissions reduction targets at both national and Community level; the boost provided by innovation and intelligent energy use; the incorporation of adaptation measures for sectoral policies; and consistent external action.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to work closely with the Commission and Parliament on all of this, seeking to establish the world region that stands at the forefront of the fight against climate change, that has the lowest carbon emissions, that is the best prepared to face the challenges presented by climate change and is the most efficient at transforming this into a powerful force for innovation and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Our policy on climate change is one of the key identifying characteristics of the European model. We have been pioneers when integrating that principle into our proposals for a fairer and more sustainable development, not only economic, but also social and environmental, knowing that we are strengthening international security in the process. This fact has enabled major players, such as China and the United States, to come together at the same negotiating table and to identify and share decisive elements for cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, a staunch defender of the United Nations’ role in resolving global issues, will also have work to do in other areas, both bilateral and multilateral, formal and informal, helping everyone to correctly identify opportunities, listening to our partners, and working on consolidating sectoral responses that are consistent with what is needed to fight climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take full advantage of the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon and the entry into force of the new institutions, systematically incorporating the main messages on the fight against climate change into our relations with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This is no small task we are facing. The government of Spain is aware of the magnitude of the challenge and wishes to show here that it is committed to making as much progress as possible on those elements that may facilitate an ambitious, binding agreement in Mexico.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot waste the political opportunity that was created in Copenhagen, nor lower our expectations or those of the international community. Our credibility is at stake. We have to stand our ground. The new, greater powers of the European Parliament, which bring it even closer to the citizens, will enable closer, more fruitful cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to conclude my speech by congratulating everyone on that point and reminding you all that, now more than ever, we need your hard work and support over the vital six-month period that lies ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My colleague, Stavros Dimas, has asked me to apologise on his behalf for not being able to be here himself because he is ill, which is particularly regrettable as this would probably have been his last plenary appearance. I volunteered to substitute for Stavros in this very important debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to express our appreciation for the active and supportive role the European Parliament played before the conference and at the conference itself. The contacts with your delegation throughout the conference proved most useful. In particular, you have played a crucial role in order to enhance our outreach with key players in other countries and other regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we share the view that the result of Copenhagen falls badly short of our goal of an ambitious and legally binding agreement, which would be necessary to limit climate change to below 2° C. This is extremely disappointing for all of us who have fought for years and years for concrete policy decisions to reverse climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons for the failure were many and I will come back to them in a moment. Still, one may also conclude that the Accord is better than no outcome at all, which would have been the worst-case scenario.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand – to find something positive – the Copenhagen Accord at least recognises the need to limit climate change to below 2° C. It also invites the developed countries to list economy-wide emission targets by 31 January 2010 and calls for the developing countries to list mitigation actions by the same date. Furthermore, the Accord sets the basis for a rather substantial financial package of USD 30 billion for the coming three years and recognises the need for USD 100 billion annually by 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the Accord has serious weaknesses. It contains no reference to mid-term or long-term mitigation targets. The reduction pledges announced so far are not sufficient to stay within the target of 2° C. There is unfortunately, in my view, little cause for optimism that we will see improved offers by 31 January – rather the opposite. Last, but certainly not least, the Accord is not legally binding and, perhaps even more worrying, it does not provide for the conclusion of a legally binding agreement this year, which was one of our key goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking ahead, the next step will be to ensure that this Accord will at least become operational and will pave the way for a new climate treaty, which must be agreed on urgently in the course of this year. As a very first step, it will be crucial to ensure that all key parties now endorse the Accord and notify their targets or actions by 31 January. Adequate financing also needs to be provided. In this respect, we need to explore ways of setting up a Copenhagen Green Climate Fund. We must also strengthen alliances with countries and regions who share our vision of a successful outcome in the international climate negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we have huge challenges before us to ensure unity at the European level, to engage strategically with key external partners and to maintain our full commitment to multilateral climate action, but there are many lessons to be learned from COP 15. One striking lesson certainly is that we must learn to speak with one voice. In Copenhagen, China, India, the United States and other major powers each spoke with one voice, while Europe spoke with many different voices. The same goes for global economic governance and international security. We are indeed at a crossroads today. Either we take determined and united action for Europe’s ecological, economic and political revival, or we risk economic stagnation and political irrelevance.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take Copenhagen as an alarming warning of that scenario. We must do better than that and we can do. Only by standing united can we succeed, and I look forward to working with you to achieve this objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Naturally, we, too, are disappointed by the results of the climate-change summit, but it is important not to forget that historic steps have indeed been taken with regard to certain elements, for example climate financing, deforestation and the two-degree target; even though this is imperfect, as you rightly pointed out. Naturally, we would have preferred something much more ambitious – see our resolution – but these are initial steps on which we must now build.</p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely important that we carry out an in-depth analysis of Europe’s contribution to this summit, as Europe was absent at the crucial time. The summit may have been well prepared by Europe from a content and technical point of view, but politically speaking it was a disaster. Europe’s political performance was simply poor. You are right in saying that Europe must speak with one voice, but that is easier said than done. We really must now make use of the opportunities offered by the new Treaty of Lisbon, too. Two new women will – we hope – soon be in the front line: Mrs Hedegaard and Mrs Ashton. They must bring in the rest of the world, paving the road to Mexico with strong climate diplomacy. Mr President, the PPE Group sees it as a given that we must retain the 30% target expressed in our November resolution, and must combine this target with not only European but also global ambition. We must revise our strategy, as it was not endorsed; a number of the key players did not endorse a global target. We must revise our strategy, but we must also retain our ambition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, we definitely need to change our strategy – we need a new strategy. This strategy must be firm, dynamic and innovative.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it must be firm because it is essential that we not only maintain our targets but increase them, going as far as a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. We must accelerate our industrial switchover to a green economy based on energy efficiency, clean and efficient processes, renewable energies, and new syntheses between information and environmental technologies, because the battle that started in Copenhagen is also that of industry and the industrial leaders of the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to have a dynamic strategy without in any way delegitimising the UN process. We must take initiatives with regard to the United States and China in order to be able to establish a potential basis for an agreement for Mexico. We must not allow the G2 we saw in operation become a reality but rather, put ourselves at the heart of this process; this will only be possible if we speak with one voice.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be innovative: innovative on the carbon markets by imposing an upper price limit, and innovative in terms of financing methods. Personally speaking, and without committing my group, I think the issue of a carbon tax at our borders will have to be addressed. We must then restore confidence with regard to Africa by increasing funding, but not by recycling official aid and renaming it ‘carbon’ funds.</p>

For the first time, the United Nations document mentions a two degree warming limit, but the emission limits stated by various countries at Copenhagen are the equivalent of more than a three degree rise in global warming. The last time it was three degrees warmer than now, the surface of the sea was 10 metres higher.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to acknowledge honestly that the EU did not show the sort of leadership it proclaims. The most important way for us to lead would have been, and still is, to aim for a more stringent emission reduction target of at least 30%. Our real target should be a reduction of 40%, if we were to heed the message of the climate scientists, as we quite rightly should. If we now stop short at a 20% reduction in emissions, it will mean that the EU has not meant anything by declaring the two degree warming limit that it has done for more than ten years now.</p>
<p class="contents">According to reports commissioned by a large number of governments, including the Dutch Government, a 20% reduction in emissions is a long way from the world’s most ambitious target. In the light of the information we have now, a 30% reduction target will cost less than what was estimated to be the cost of cutting emissions by 20% two years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, at Copenhagen there were countries that wanted to torpedo the talks. If the EU had led, it would have made this difficult for them. This time, the EU made it easy for them by blocking the Kyoto Protocol’s second commitment period, which is extremely important for the developing countries. It would be constructive to say that we are prepared for Kyoto’s second period on certain conditions, and it would be constructive to undertake to support climate action on the part of the economically less developed countries without recycling development cooperation money under a new heading.</p>
<p class="contents">From this meagre outcome, we now need to move on towards a proper climate agreement. It can only be internationally legitimate if negotiated via the United Nations. We also need a new form of climate diplomacy. It is not enough that our experts know their way through the technical jungle. We need patient diplomatic efforts to overcome the stumbling blocks and also to make the UN negotiating process a more viable one, so that, for example, it adopts rules on voting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In those circumstances, I believe it would be very foolish for those of us in the EU debating these matters to agree to even further emissions reductions. A figure of 30% has been mentioned. Mrs Hassi just mentioned 40%.</p>
<p class="contents">In the absence of a worldwide agreement, I think we would be crazy to agree to further reductions because what we will do is run the risk of saddling our consumers with some of the highest energy bills in the developed world, making European heavy industry and large energy consumers particularly uncompetitive in a worldwide environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Already we have seen a lot of industry relocating to outside the EU, simply, of course, transferring emissions from the EU to China, India and elsewhere. This is a crazy economic policy because it has no net benefit for the environment whatsoever. In fact, in some respects, it has a net deleterious effect on the environment as those goods are simply re-imported back into the EU, after all.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is a comprehensive worldwide agreement. I am fully in favour of that. I hope we will work towards achieving it, but in the absence of one, we should be very wary of further unilateral cuts in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People have always fled from natural disasters, poor harvests, drought, floods and famine. The fact is that climate change and its direct impact on people and the environment are problems that we have no choice but to deal with. However, I cannot help asking whether we are going the right way about it. I agree that we need to be more aware of how we use resources in our daily lives and to research new technologies. We must not forget, however, that in fact, we already have ways of alleviating problems that suddenly arise. In connection with COP 15, for example, there was mention of the Cook Islands – an island group in the Pacific. The problem these islands face is that they are under threat from rising water levels. A sea wall could protect the islands, and in fact, a sea wall is a perfectly manageable investment – just not for a poor island group. While we in the West discuss wind power, electric cars, solar energy, biofuels and new ways of sorting waste in the suburbs of Europe, many islands are gradually disappearing. I would therefore ask whether the Western world should be investing billions in climate technology – the effect of which is highly questionable – while millions of people could be helped using already known, low-cost measures. Rather than quarrelling over statistics, evidence and research, now is the time we need to be dealing with the impact of climate change at a global level by means of real action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, of course, Copenhagen was disappointing. Many of our demands and the expectations of citizens were definitely not met. I would like to add one thing to what has already been said. We want an international agreement for emissions from aviation and maritime transport. Unfortunately, Copenhagen brought absolutely no progress on this matter. It was not even mentioned in the Copenhagen climate agreement. That is a disappointing outcome, particularly as we know that every year that we lose will, of course, result in us having to raise our efforts even further. The later we start, the bolder and stronger our efforts will need to be, and with every passing year it will, of course, become more difficult. It is like a serious illness, the earlier it is treated, the milder the treatment needs to be. That is why it is a disappointment.</p>

It is not. It must continue and that is also what the citizens expect from us. We should look for the positive things that actually happened in Copenhagen. I will take two small examples, namely the undertaking by two developing countries, the Maldives and Costa Rica, to become climate-neutral in the next ten years. The whole world – Europe and the rest of the world – can follow their lead. These are small States, but if we look at a large State like Brazil, for example, what is happening there is also remarkable.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we should analyse our mistakes and not be so arrogant as simply to carry on as before. However, we should not go round in sackcloth and ashes, either, but join with those in the world who want to make progress in protecting the climate. The game must no longer be industrialised countries against developing countries, but those countries who have understood what it is all about against the rest of the world, where the latter group, it is to be hoped, will increasingly shrink in size. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was the first Council configuration under the Spanish Presidency. You were, of course, unable to attend due to an unfortunate family matter, but your Secretary of State, Teresa Ribera, did a splendid job of representing you. Throughout the meeting, which was extremely well organised, the commitment of the Spanish Presidency to the matter was evident.</p>
<p class="contents">That is all well and good, but the result of this Council meeting was not very satisfactory. The Council of Ministers was divided, with a complete lack of direction. There is absolutely no agreement among Member States about what we should do now. That is not a good sign. It is your job and your responsibility to find the common denominator among the 27 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, we need to do three things in the European Union following Copenhagen. The first is that we must regain the leading role in global climate protection. Secondly, we need to show credibility in the commitments that we have made and, thirdly, we urgently need to gain new partners before we get to Mexico.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to regaining the leading role, I agree with everyone here who said that we should continue to state our promise to reduce carbon emissions by 30%. I would like to see us specify this 30% target to the UN Secretariat in Bonn on 31 January, not the old 20% target. If we make ourselves dependent on comparable efforts by others, it will take forever and Mexico will also come to nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of showing credibility, the EUR 7.2 billion must actually be realised before Mexico. The countries in Africa need to be able to see that the first measures are already in progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to gaining partners, I hope that we will develop climate protection diplomacy and, with the help of the African Union in particular, that we will also find sufficient partners, including in Latin America and Asia, for a global agreement in Mexico. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The truth is we do not know the way. We are stumbling around in the dark. I think we just simply have to explore every opportunity and hope that one or more of them will take us forward.</p>
<p class="contents">But I am sure we have to try to maintain our ambitions and keep our leadership, and on this point there is a crucial decision coming up within the next fortnight and I want to know what the Presidency is going to do to get it right.</p>
<p class="contents">Forty per cent of our emissions come from the fossil fuels burnt in our power stations. That is why the development of carbon capture and storage technology is recognised as so important. That is why the Council three years ago agreed that we should try and build up to 12 demonstration projects by 2015. Now, we agreed a year ago a method of financing those projects: to use 300 million in allowances from the emissions trading scheme. It took three months for that idea to come from Parliament, to get approval by the Council to unlock the door, but 12 months later, we still have not agreed how to choose the projects or use the money. The Commission has finally put forward a draft decision. It proposes only eight CCS projects, and the timetable it recommends means that it will be impossible for them all to be built by 2015. Commissioner Rehn has got the hot seat, then; I hope someone will pass him a note between now and the end of the debate so he can explain the lack of ambition in this document.</p>
<p class="contents">But it must be agreed: however inadequate, we have got to move forward. It will be debated at a meeting of the Council’s Climate Change Committee on 2 February, and there is opposition from some Member States who oppose the Commission having the final say over the selection of projects and the use and distribution of the money.</p>
<p class="contents">Now this meeting will be the first opportunity since Copenhagen for the European Union to demonstrate whether it is going forward and taking practical steps or going to slip backwards. It is a crucial test both for the Commission and the Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">So my question to the Minister is: Is the Presidency going to ensure that we get agreement at that meeting, or are you going to drop the ball? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, there were three real losers from the summit: the United Nations, the European Union and the climate. It is of the utmost importance, then, to turn these three losers into victors in 2010 on the way to Mexico. To achieve this, three things must happen. The first is that the EU must really speak with one voice, as Commissioner Rehn has already said, but – and I should appreciate a specific answer to this – who is it to be? Who will speak on Europe’s behalf in Mexico?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the United Nations, Europe must prove its leadership in the negotiations, too, which means no longer looking only to the United States and China, and instead looking mainly to the countries sharing our wish for action on the climate, such as the African Union, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa. We should be widening the group of countries with whom we wish to conclude an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the climate. It is true that we agreed on two degrees, but this figure also means something. The science says that two degrees means rich countries must reduce their CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions by 40%. Therefore, the EU must now promise 30%. On 31 January, it will have another chance to prove its leadership by coming forward with 30%, and I ask that the EU offer that figure. I would appreciate your response to this proposal, as it represents the only way to show leadership and make 2010 the year of the United Nations, the European Union and the climate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Copenhagen conference was a good example of a bad method. And what were the lessons?</p>
<p class="contents">The conference was too massive to be productive: a rock concert of 50 000 people is possible; a meeting, not. Secondly, Europe was outfoxed by China and India, and the US joined in. Instead of being a decisive player, the EU was a confused spectator.</p>
<p class="contents">What should we do? I think we have to reassess the form we used, rather a G20 than an event of Woodstock proportions. Secondly, we have to stop displaying moral arrogance by telling China and India what to do. Important barriers to punish both countries would be disastrous. On the contrary, the EU should re-examine its own stance, which will ultimately undermine our own growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we need serious research on the body of evidence. ‘Climategate’ was already a reminder, and the claim that the Himalayan glaciers are retreating now seems to be based on speculation. Some members of the IPCC now even predict global cooling.</p>
<p class="contents">We need objective, impartial scientific research, and not an agenda-driven political activism.

I still remember the debate we had here in this House before Copenhagen. Everyone was glowing with optimism, but it came to nothing. It was an international conference with its own rules, and we can achieve little with good will alone. So, let us approach the next negotiations in Mexico with the necessary sense of reality.</p>
<p class="contents">If we were to assess Copenhagen, we have to say, to be fair, that it was not so bad, because the result can serve as a basis for the negotiations in Mexico and something, at least, was achieved. The greatest disappointment for us Europeans has to be that we – the EU – were not there when the final document was drawn up. That must give us pause for thought, because we are always emphasising the fact that we are the ones who want to take a leading role in the global fight against climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Why should this be? First of all, probably because, with our 14% CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions, we are not among the largest emitters. The US and China together account for almost half. However, in Europe, we do not speak with one voice. The last Environment Council showed very clearly how different the views are there. Many Member States view the problem very differently to the majority in this House, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">However, another reason is surely the fact that we Europeans are not as good as we always claim to be. If we take these clean development mechanisms, in other words, these joint implementation measures, and the other measures out of the equation and consider only our own measures for reducing CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions, then we can see that our balance sheet is not as good as we maintain.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we also have to say that other countries and other regions of the world have a different approach to this problem. Our big goal is a legally binding agreement. However, China and the US are opting for a different route.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, we need to consider whether we should not be more flexible in our negotiations, because working together to combat the phenomenon of climate change is important, but the methods we employ to achieve this could be quite different. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course you would. That is how the world should have reacted in Copenhagen. That is how the world should of course react when more than ninety percent of leading researchers in the field say that global warming is real and that it is man-made. The EU should therefore demonstrate leadership. Obviously, we can criticise the US. Obviously, we can criticise China for not having had the political will required in Copenhagen. In this House, however, we must look nearer home – we must be critical of the lack of initiative shown by the EU. The EU could have done two things, and it should do two things before the conference in Mexico. Firstly, we should take the lead as regards committing ourselves to reduction targets. That means moving from the 20 per cent reductions promised by 2020 to 30 per cent. Secondly, we should name the amounts we are willing to contribute to financing long-term adjustment to the climate changes that we know are coming. Finally, it is obvious that we will also have more of an impact if we speak with one voice, because we will then be able to negotiate more rationally and clearly than we were able to in Copenhagen.

That is what we liberals are doing, and I hope that we can do so together in Europe. We need a strategy and we need a ‘post-Copenhagen agenda’. An important tool for achieving this is continued investment in the emissions trading system. The EU should immediately open negotiations with the US to integrate the emerging American system with the European system. A transatlantic market for carbon emissions could be the start of a global market.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rehn gave an extremely good introductory address. He is quite right in his conclusion. The EU must speak with one voice in these negotiations. However, it must be borne in mind that under the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament can now influence how these decisions are taken. Parliament has to be involved in the preparatory work, since a final agreement requires our endorsement.</p>
<p class="contents">Within Europe, we must, at the same time, continue to strengthen our own carbon market and stop giving away trading rights for free. We need to invest in new technology and thirdly, we need to set a price floor for carbon dioxide. The climate targets can be reached through the mechanisms of the market, not through more bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">If we now put the Copenhagen conference behind us, make a new start and put all our efforts into future measures, then the first thing we need to focus on is EU 2020. The measures are included there and we need to have well-honed proposals as regards energy efficiency and how we invest in new technology. We need a climate jobs strategy. Finally, I would like to say that clearly, we need a 30 per cent reduction in carbon emissions if we want to win not just the battle for the climate, but also the battle for the market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that Europe has done more and better work in the last 10 years than most of the other countries in the world, but there was clearly a failure of European leadership in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">In Copenhagen, we also saw Europe become simply the combination of the personal communication strategies of the European Heads of State or Government, and I should like to specifically mention Mr Sarkozy, Mrs Merkel and Mr Brown in this connection. Under these circumstances, it is clearly easy to knock the UN process. It is true that the UN system is complicated, and that a G20, where the agreements are meaningless but there are opportunities for major publicity stunts, is much simpler.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that this coming year, Europe must do more and better work. We currently have a 20% target. However, 20% actually means doing less in the next 10 years than we have done in the past 10 years; it means reducing Europe’s climate effort. This is not only absurd for the climate, when the scientists are telling us that we have to reach a 40% target, but it is also absurd for our economy and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mrs Espinosa, please do not reduce Europe’s climate ambition to the lowest common denominator, to the objectives voiced by President Barroso, who does not want to budge from the 20% figure, or to those voiced by Italy and Poland, which will soon deny the existence of climate change. Reread Parliament’s resolution and immediately opt for an unconditional 30%.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some developing countries, using irritating anti-colonial rhetoric, want to get rich on this, while at the same time being the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. African countries, China and India want to keep their exemptions not to submit to the international system of monitoring emissions and, at the same time, receive billions of euros for clean technologies. This is a position we cannot justify to our taxpayers. After the Copenhagen conference, we must get it into our heads that Europe cannot bear these costs on its own. Firstly, because acting on our own, we will slow down the growth of our economy even more, and strike at the prosperity of our citizens.

However – and, yes, I am echoing your words here, Commissioner – this summit still had two virtues. The first was that it mobilised many more Heads of State or Government than the Kyoto Summit did. The second is that it enabled emerging countries to benefit from financial commitments aimed specifically at helping them to combat global warming.</p>
<p class="contents">So what should Europe do now? Of course, it should continue its excellent work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, because the truth is that Europe has already been extremely virtuous. With regard to the Kyoto target, which was an 8% reduction, European companies have achieved a reduction of just under 13%. The latter have therefore shown themselves to be extremely virtuous and very committed to the protection of the environment. However, this fight and this virtuous attitude absolutely must not be situated in a context of unfair competition. As I told you at the hearings, Mr Rehn, all this can be situated only in a context of completely fair competition. Indeed, we must consider implementing a carbon tax at the borders of the European Union, because we cannot abandon our businesses and thus our jobs to completely unfair competition, to the advantage of countries that show no respect for, or do not apply the same standards regarding, environmental protection and greenhouse gas reduction. I therefore think it is absolutely essential – and I echo my fellow Member Mrs Lepage here – that, at some time in the future, we give thought to implementing a carbon tax at the borders of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I was rather delighted to learn at the hearings that Commissioner Tajani has not ruled out the undertaking of an impact study on the possibility of imposing this carbon tax at the borders of the European Union. Therefore, little by little, I think that we are going to win this battle, because it is important to protect our European companies and jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the results from Copenhagen were well below par in the circumstances. That is the first main reason we are expressing our disappointment.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason we are expressing our disappointment and which particularly concerns us as the European Parliament is the poor figure cut by the European Union at the Copenhagen Summit. While one would have expected that, at the first global summit following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the European Union would have spearheaded an effort to achieve a new, ambitious, substantial, global agreement on combating climate change, we and the European citizens witnessed a show of fragmentation, with some European leaders playing their own game and the European Union playing the role of sidekick and spectator. This is not the role we would wish for or the role which befits us.</p>
<p class="contents">So what needs to be done? We call on the European Commission and the Council to show that it is up to the job and to safeguard a leading role for Europe in this new endeavour. May I remind you that it is not merely a question of restricting the repercussions of climate change. It is a much broader challenge; the challenge of changing to a new development model, a green development model which will be Europe’s answer to the need to create new jobs, to support the competitiveness of the European economy and to consolidate the leading role of the European Union in the new order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU needs to commit itself now to a 30% cut in emissions for three reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is simply that a 30% cut requires barely more effort now than the original 20% cut, simply because of the fall in economic activity due to the recession.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, to rein back now would be to lose the momentum which has been built up in the new green industries. We cannot ‘half-commit’ to investment in renewable energy sources and low-carbon transport. There is massive infrastructure which needs to be put in place, whether it is a North Sea supergrid or, on a smaller scale, plug-in charging points for electric cars. Hundreds and thousands of new jobs are at stake, potentially 70 000 jobs relating to offshore wind in the UK alone, but these jobs, which are so necessary for economic recovery, will only be realised if there is a clear roadmap towards a zero-carbon Europe by 2050.</p>
<p class="contents">Investment has to have certainty, and we need to be aware that Europe is in danger of losing its place as leader on renewable technology. Both the US and China are growing their renewables industries very rapidly. If we hesitate now, those new green jobs will move to other continents.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we need that 30% cut because most of the extra commitment can easily be realised by increased energy efficiency. Not to do more on energy efficiency would, in any case, be crazy. Energy efficiency means economic efficiency. It means lower energy bills, not higher ones, and it improves energy security. So, whatever figures are put on the table by the other parties on 31 January – and maybe we will be pleasantly surprised – the EU must commit now to a 30% cut. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By the way, we learnt last week that a significant portion of the environmental data used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was either knowingly falsified or misinterpreted. Seen in this light, it is good to see that the Copenhagen Summit has failed. I do hope that this failure will, first of all, bring a departure from the aggressive so-called ‘green’ politics. Secondly, politics will get back to genuine topics that really concern people in today’s economic recession. Thirdly, it will prevent the waste of taxpayers´ money on controversial green projects. Fourthly, it will create space for a matter-of-fact debate on the rational, efficient and cheaper provision of energy, and we will see the renaissance of nuclear energy. Ladies and gentlemen, when I meet my constituents, they shake their heads with incredulity over the topics we discuss here, failing as we do to deal with their real problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Copenhagen did indeed mobilise more heads of state than Kyoto, but it also created more divisions and, as a result, it turned into a scenario of ‘every man for himself’, where every state can set out their goals and, moreover, do so on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p class="contents">We should note that we have a target reduction of 2 degree Celsius and goals for funding without any explanation whatsoever. These cannot be seen as a consolation. However, I believe that we have to act with an eye to the future, and this means moving from words to actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union always wants to be a leader, and always has. However, when we arrived in Copenhagen, it faltered, failing to define or defend the goals that it had stated here, and which it said that it would never give up.</p>
<p class="contents">My question here, then, is whether in the future we will not act more fairly, whether we will continue to allow a situation where the poorest people go on paying the heaviest price due to our weakness and the decisions of some people over others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I voted against the resolution here in December. I was right, like 92 others here.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union very arrogantly endeavoured to offer the entire world its own solution. A few days before it began, emissions trading fraud worth EUR 5 billion was exposed. This must have been embarrassing just before the meeting was due to start, with the EU offering a way out and facing abuses of funds worth EUR 5 billion. This was shameful, and is the EU now at all worried that these abuses will be investigated? If we are to impose restrictions on emissions, let us introduce a specific emissions system, as we have with cars. It works, although there is never a case for winding down our steel, metal or wood processing industries, in Finland or in the EU countries. That is to no avail: workers and employees should not be made to suffer.</p>

Telling ourselves ‘Let us build upon the work we have done because we just need to make some changes’ is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question I wish to ask myself in this respect is what COP conferences are in the first place? Are they real conferences or just a display for the public? They are both, of course. However, we need to ensure that experts can get on with their jobs and that the public is informed, not only about the informal events which take place on the fringes of conferences, but also about the actual work we are doing. Europe should, therefore, reconsider the organisational aspects of such conferences.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is: What is the role of world leaders at such conferences? Do they come to these conferences in order to pursue their domestic political campaigns or do they come to help participants reach a compromise? I think we also need to reconsider the working methods of such conferences and the roles of the world leaders who attend them.</p>
<p class="contents">My third question concerns the leading role of the European Union. Yes, we <span class="italic">have</span> taken many good measures to ensure that Europe can maintain its leading role in developing environmentally friendly technologies, but we have lost our leading role in the negotiating process. In my opinion, we should not settle for playing merely a coordinating role in the negotiating process, because we have to be an active negotiator ourselves. That is why we should not lay all our cards on the table before negotiations begin and trumpet the goals we are after. We should also be trying to bring ourselves closer to third countries, not distance ourselves from them.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point I wish to make is that we must include in our international meetings the issue of climate change as a matter of urgency and here, of course, I expect close cooperation by both of the commissioners in charge of these two areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are not there because right now, we should be at the stage of moving towards the adoption of legislative changes brought about by an agreement reached in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not at that stage, and we should be sorry. We should regret the fact that, in Copenhagen, ambitions were lowered in the fight against climate change, that a binding agreement was not signed and that the procedure lacked transparency. Consequently, we do not have the sufficient legal base or means to cater for people’s needs, especially in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">However, nor are we at the stage we were at before Copenhagen, because in Copenhagen, we did reach a targeted agreement with the United States, China, India, South Africa and Brazil, to which other countries later signed up, such as Russia, Australia, Norway, Sweden and Spain. We should not forget that, together, those countries are responsible for three-quarters of carbon dioxide emissions; nor should we forget that many of those countries were previously outside the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the step we have taken is not enough, but it is significant. We should take advantage of that significant step in order to push forward from within the European Union. The European Union has been the driving force for all the progress that has been made. However, that progress will not continue unless the European Union keeps pushing.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to Germany and Mexico, we have to work to reach binding agreements and to obtain resources that can help developing countries to mitigate their emissions, to adapt and to update their technology. We have to do this for reasons of efficiency, fairness and because we are in need of more partners.</p>

Not much came of all of the plans that we made here. It all went wrong in Copenhagen. It could also be called a defeat. It is important to describe the situation accurately in order to have the opportunity to think carefully about why this happened, so that we can then make some progress on this matter.</p>

Have we actually considered and discussed with one another all of the essential issues in a fair and objective way? How have we dealt with the questions of fellow Members, whether justified or not, who said ‘we have questions about issues that we are critical of, climate-sceptical questions’? How did we respond in the Committee on Climate Change when fellow Members said ‘we also want to hear the other point of view – the opposing position of some scientists’? What opportunity did we actually have to present that? Moreover, regardless of which position we take, we need to discuss calmly how we should deal with the recent information that fellow Members have also just mentioned that the IPCC made a mistake with regard to the melting of glaciers?</p>
<p class="contents">A second set of questions also needs answers. Are we using the right instruments to tackle this? There are always new timetables, more percentages, new regulations and stipulations. This is a rather bureaucratic approach. Is Mrs Ek not right to emphasise so strongly that technology, innovation and market mechanisms are the way forward here? Other states are taking different approaches, but it is not the case that they are doing nothing. Perhaps a bit more openness and a bit more reflection will give us a chance to be more effective in this matter. This is what I would like to see, rather than the method of ‘shut your eyes and advance’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not want to depict a doom scenario for the future, nor do I want to look back in anger about the failure of Copenhagen – although I am angry.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the resolution is to do far better in the future, the next opportunity being Mexico this year. Firstly, do not walk alone next time. In Copenhagen, we looked back and we stood alone in our ambitions. We must be able to convince others to be as ambitious as we are. How can we claim to be in the driver’s seat if we fail to convince others of our ambitions and of the destination?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, no one size fits all. As sometimes was proudly said during the run-up to the climate summit, there is no plan ‘B’. Well, we certainly know it: there is nothing right now. We have nothing. So we had better have a plan ‘B’ next time.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but not least, how can we win in diversity if our slogan is, I mean, unity. We had better unite next time, and that means one voice. We need a univocal mandate. Europe really needs one voice. So, President-in-Office, are you willing to commit yourselves to obtaining an exclusive – and not a shared – mandate? It would be an exclusive competence for the European Union in climate policy and climate agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the recent climate summit, world leaders did not manage to come to an understanding on a common strategy or instruments to help reach this objective. Paradoxically, I do not think this is bad news, in view of the disturbing information which is coming from, among others, Great Britain and the United States, about an attempt at manipulation by certain lobbies, using scientific data to achieve a specific result.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a reliable diagnosis of the situation. Therefore, I appeal for the appointment of an independent, international expert group, which will compile a thorough report stating whether human activity really does affect climate change and if data has been falsified. When establishing a common strategy for protecting the climate, EU politicians should also take into account the economic disproportions between the countries of Western and Eastern Europe. In view of the crisis, the measures which have been proposed could lead to the ruin of many economies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The countries took note of a document whose objectives were unclear and not binding. Copenhagen stood for much more than a climate summit. There was a new correlation between prominent players on the world stage and the proper role of multilateralism in the UN system. The growing influence of the emerging countries was evident. Copenhagen showed that we need to rethink the role of Europe on the world stage. We will need to make the most of the possibilities offered by the Treaty of Lisbon in order to prepare the way for the next COP. We need to be ambitious, united with one voice and forging strategic alliances.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of Copenhagen forms a foundation for us to build on with further work. The EU should try to ensure that the next stages in the negotiations will further develop the Copenhagen Agreement, with a view to reaching a legally binding agreement by the end of this year. It should also contribute to the implementation of provisions for giving funding to developing countries, and with regard to forests, technology transfer and adaptation measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Internally, Europe has a big task ahead: it needs to implement the energy and climate package, to invest in clean technologies, scientific research and energy efficiency, to invest in a new industrial policy based on innovation and the efficiency of natural resources, to promote policies on low-carbon cities and sustainable transport and mobility. This is the only way that we can lead, but real leadership is based on providing a good example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the future, the EU must not give up its targets, the commitment of three times 20% but, at the same time, it should reconsider its negotiating position and mandate, because we cannot pursue an ostrich policy. The lessons from Copenhagen should be learnt. That mandate was not successful. We failed to understand the commitment of China and other developing countries. We failed to understand the room Mr Obama had to manoeuvre and we were unable to speak with a common voice. As part of the debate of the Spanish Presidency, the President, Mr Verhofstadt, rightly stated that Europe had no common voice.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot pursue an ostrich policy. After Copenhagen, we cannot behave and we cannot do politics the same way as we did before Copenhagen.

In my constituency, in Noordwijk aan Zee, which lies just behind the North Sea dunes in an area that will be first in the firing line if the sea level rises, the schoolchildren were told a story entitled ‘A meeting’, about snowmen deliberating how to keep the warmth at bay. They talk and talk until they have all melted. To be frank, on a bad day, this debate does remind me a little of that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that Copenhagen was not a success. Now we could continue to point to other countries or individual sectors; these one-liners have occasionally cropped up in the present debate, too. Yet it strikes me as a better idea to look ahead to what Europe can, and, more importantly, must do in order to shoulder its responsibility and ensure that an international agreement is still reached. Hence, in my opinion, the option of a 30% reduction must be kept expressly on the table. In addition, Europe must look at ways of promoting new technologies, including with European funds, for example, by promoting the construction of CO<span class="sub">2</span>-neutral greenhouses that are also capable of producing energy, instead of us always viewing agriculture as a problem. Moreover, we must base our approach on science, knowledge and skills and not on emotions, however much we all care about this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as many of my fellow Members have already said, we must speak with one voice. There should be only one seat for Europe in Mexico rather than the eight that were apparently needed in Copenhagen.

<p class="contents">We must be concerned about how easy it was for the US, China and others to circumvent the UN structures, sideline the EU and agree an arrangement which fell far short of global expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is clear. The UN climate talks system needs life-saving surgery before Mexico at the end of this year. As it stands, President Obama is a prisoner of his political system, for he needs 67 votes in the Senate.</p>
<p class="contents">China refuses all measures which would be binding and open to international scrutiny. The irony of the situation is that, the longer the US, China and others frustrate, delay and prevaricate on a deal, the tougher the targets for reduction will, of necessity, become.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at solutions. The EU and this Parliament need to examine honestly how it approaches such matters in the future.

<p class="contents">I am most concerned by the change in attitude, and the fact that our analysis of Copenhagen may well lead to a change in attitude. Firstly, I think that one of our problems is a lack of humility and realism, as my colleagues have already said. Above all, however, I am concerned that, when we have been to other countries, we have found that they do not talk about climate change but rather global change.</p>
<p class="contents">The context in which we will be moving in Mexico, and the context in which we have been moving, is that of a growing population, a food shortage, a need for more agriculture, and limited land and water resources; therefore, any decision we take on climate change must be considered within that context. Of course, we must also remember that many countries have a right to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">We thus need to take a systemic view, something that is lacking in our analysis of climate change. Climate change cannot be resolved on the issue of emissions alone. A sectoral, quantitative vision does not lead anywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, we have to attach greater importance to science. In particular, I ask the Commission that those teams who tampered with data be checked and have their funding withdrawn, if the European Union is indeed supporting them, because this will discredit us forever.</p>
<p class="contents">How are we going to coordinate on this matter? That is another very important question. How is the European Union going to organise itself in order to reach an agreement? We should have already started working on that this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the issue that concerns me: adaptation is carried out in the territory concerned, and we have to begin that process, once again, with a new, strategic vision of the territory; this includes productivity, strategic reforestation, regions, areas and districts devoted to agro-energy and, of course, water and biodiversity. We are lacking that vision.</p>
<p class="contents">On this point, I think we need to think about the option of Structural Funds for new strategic plans in all regions in order to be able to carry out this adaptation; and decision makers should be invited to begin that strategic revision of the territory because we do not have responsibility for that area and it will be very difficult to work on it from Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are miles away from our objectives. Over the next few months, we shall have to see if things can still be put right. I believe, however – as others have also said before – that there is still a great deal we can put right ourselves, even without an international agreement under the auspices of the United Nations. I am thinking in particular of what we can do to achieve a more sustainable transport system. A priority objective was to reduce aviation emissions by 10% by 2020 working through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), and maritime transport emissions by 20% through the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). Thus, I should like to ask the Council and the Commission to continue negotiations within these organisations and to step up the pressure by starting to prepare unilateral measures already if an agreement cannot be reached in a relatively short period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meanwhile, of course, there is a great deal of homework we can be doing ourselves. With regard to intra-European transport, I heard Commissioner-designate Hedegaard advocate an ambitious climate and transport package during the hearings. Commissioner-designate Kallas seemed rather less clear, but I would remind the Commission that transport accounts for 25% of CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions and, as such, requires urgent action. It is complicated, it is difficult and it requires a combination of measures, but I call on you to continue working on it and thus to make an important contribution to a more sustainable policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its short, medium and long-term impacts are undeniable, although the results from the JESC have made the front page of a certain national newspaper and will undoubtedly strengthen the sceptics’ position.</p>
<p class="contents">The Copenhagen conference appeared to the world to be a unique opportunity for world leaders to bear witness to, act on and correct the effects of this process of climate change. The European Union was a key player at this forum, not only on account of the bold legislation we have passed to limit the impact of our activities on climate, but also because Europe represents a union of countries which can really make a difference.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome of the Copenhagen conference has obviously left a feeling of dissatisfaction, but I refuse to call it a failure. The world, including even one of the most reluctant countries, China, has agreed on the issue of limiting the increase in temperature to two degrees. Brazil has just passed a law aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by around 39% by 2020, in line with its undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">Many other countries also showed great ambition with regard to greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. I am thinking here of Japan and Norway. I must also highlight the very positive point that was the consensus achieved on the urgent need for a mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation. A specific and unanimous text was produced on the implementation of the so-called REDD+ mechanism to reduce deforestation and enable CO<span class="sub">2</span> to be stored naturally.</p>
<p class="contents">Although far from a binding agreement, but clearly along the lines of a political agreement, the outcome of Copenhagen should lead us to question why it was such a disappointment. I attended the Copenhagen conference, as did a number of my fellow Members, with this desire to participate, to help and to see a Europe of negotiation and of leadership take action. I was hugely disappointed because Europe, and particularly Parliament, clearly did not play the role that it deserved to in the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">To make its presence felt, Europe must be seen to be stronger in this area. The meeting of our environment ministers in Seville went nowhere, and our leaders were seen to be unsure and hesitant, and we are still divided over our targets.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Mrs Hedegaard, armed with her proposals and the undertakings she gave before the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, will be able to restore the ambitions of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I, too, am disappointed that the legal agreement failed to materialise, and I should like to put a question to the President-in-Office. What are the implications of the lack of such an agreement for our legislative framework, namely the package we have laid down for CO<span class="sub">2</span> trading, among other things? What will be the impact on that system? Can you tell us that? I should like to point out, chiefly in my role as coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for regional policy, that our objectives must be retained in full. Also, Europe should not question the efforts of citizens, towns and cities, regions and enterprises that have committed themselves to the package of implementing programmes. The climate issue is not just hype, and I also note that, fortunately, it is enshrined in the EU 2020 strategy of the new Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out that we have now turned the EU’s own instruments and resources towards climate-related priorities: 30% of regional funds have been channelled to the climate and to energy-related projects, which is double the figure for the previous period. This particular priority creates scope to continue with the innovation and new green technology that will help give us the edge at a global level. This also goes for expenditure under the European Economic Recovery Plan. I believe that this sets a positive trend, including for the financing beyond 2013. I do indeed note great commitment in regions, towns and cities to continue working on this. It would send the wrong message – in the desperation that may be perceptible in a number of speeches here – to diminish this ambition. I share your hope that, in Mexico – our second chance – we shall do better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Copenhagen was a failure. I do not want to focus on this, however, but suggest that instead of criticising others, we would do better to mind our own business. We have to admit that one of the reasons behind the failure was the lack of a common European position in Copenhagen, either in terms of CO<span class="sub">2</span> quotas or funding. I agree with those who say that it is the prerequisite of successful negotiations to have a common EU position. That is true. What do we need in order to achieve this? It is necessary that the Commission and all Member States of the European Union adhere to both the letter and the spirit of the Kyoto Treaty. Hungary, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, the Baltic States, Slovakia and the Czech Republic fulfilled their commitments beyond the level determined in Kyoto. Therefore, they can sell their CO<span class="sub">2</span> quotas. I think it is dishonourable, unfair and inappropriate on behalf of the Commission and the other European Union Member States to deprive these countries of this opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">In Copenhagen, Poland and Hungary suggested a compromise. The point of it was to retain the possibility of selling the quotas beyond 2012, but its volume per year should be limited, and the money received should be spent on green investments. We suggested a compromise for the sake of a common European position. Now it is up to the Commission and the EU-15, especially because without Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the other countries, the EU-15 could not state to have delivered on their commitments, since instead of the 8% undertaken, only 5.5% would have been achieved.

<p class="contents">The reality is that there was a gulf between the rhetoric of an EU wishing to be the world leader in the fight against climate change and its capacity to get others on board in the final negotiations. Not only did nobody come on board but, by putting all its cards on the table far too early, failure was inevitable. In fact, the EU was virtually inaudible during the final negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">So what are we to do now? We must, above all, implement the principle of reciprocity in our exchanges with third countries. Europe can no longer accept a situation in which certain imported products do not satisfy environmental requirements. The situation brought about by the failure in Copenhagen therefore creates uncertainty as to the future international operational rules in the area of carbon emissions reduction, which is particularly harmful for those companies of ours that are required to make major investments. This lack of visibility could also have a detrimental impact on the CO<span class="sub">2</span> market, the rise in power and smooth running of which require a clear and stable framework.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the United States and China are investing massively in green technologies to create the green jobs of tomorrow. Europe must not miss the innovation train. It must support a real European industrial policy because that is the real challenge of the fight against climate change. These new clean technologies are available; it is up to us to accelerate their use in our policies for the benefit of everybody, and especially of developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the challenge that must be taken up by the EU. It has the means to successfully undertake this revolution, but let us be more pragmatic as we approach the next deadlines so that, a year from now in Mexico City, we can turn the agreement concluded in Copenhagen into something legally binding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, a fiasco does not have to be a disaster – sometimes you have to draw good conclusions from a fiasco and see what really caused it. Current European Union strategy for negotiation on climate protection needs to be evaluated, because preparations are under way for the next summit, to be held in Mexico in December this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a question: should we increase the reduction objective, since the current objective was not achieved in these negotiations? We have to find partners for the present objective, and for an increased objective we do not have any partners at all. It needs to be pointed out that without the United States, China and India, and this has also been said many times in this Chamber during this debate, there will be no success with the objectives set by the European Union at the Copenhagen Summit. It will be similar in Mexico, too. We must evaluate the declaration of the other parties, maintaining, above all, the forum of the climate conference as the main forum for negotiation of an understanding, irrespective of the critical evaluations as to whether the UN forum is appropriate, good, working properly, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">We want a green economy, which makes rational use of the environment and which develops new sources of energy and new technologies to generate energy and to save it. At the same time, we know that the cheapest energy is energy which has not been exhausted, and so we need to be rational. By the way – and this is my last sentence – reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases is not achieved by the use of expensive technologies. Very often, our own resources, such as forests and soil, can also be an excellent place for absorption, and this is biological absorption and, hence, effective absorption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This G2 led the negotiations without the Europeans or developing countries really having a say in matters. Agriculture was therefore hardly touched upon. Yet this sector is one of the most fundamental elements in the fight against climate change. European agriculture is currently preparing to switch over to more sustainable production models, with more responsible water management and models that are less energy-intensive and less dependent on chemicals, because it realises that biodiversity and the preservation of ecosystems are the very keys to a reduction in environmental pollution.

The European Union needs to reclaim the role of leader and make itself heard with one voice. The Treaty of Lisbon will help with this, letting Europe assert itself and speak with a united voice and the authority of someone who has done their homework.

I am sorry I cannot respond to all of you personally, from the first contribution by Mrs Wortmann-Kool to the last one by Mr Grzyb, and also the 15 additional speeches we have heard. Allow me, however, to say a few more words following my opening speech.</p>
<p class="contents">Several goals of great importance lie before us in the field of climate change: to consolidate support and an appropriate level of commitment around the Copenhagen agreement and to strengthen each of its components, by developing and detailing their content and speeding up their implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Copenhagen Summit revealed the new international scenario that surrounds us. Within this scenario, we need further improvements, where new goals and expectations are voiced by very different players and where the rules for the adoption of decisions must be changed to adapt them effectively to new timeframes and needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this context, the European Union must consider the best way to demonstrate its leadership in the field of climate policy on the international scene.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not lose sight of our aims because that would weaken our credibility and our position, which has been challenged in recent years. No one knows better than the European Union how hard it is to build this collective leadership. Similarly no one is more aware than Parliament of the advantages and the satisfaction of a result that improves things for all of us. On a global scale, we can only move forward if the way forward is based on mutual trust and the public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Some have defined Copenhagen as a perfect storm with a bittersweet result. I prefer to take something from it that I feel to be very valuable: the fact that it has provided us with a great potential that we will be able to draw on in the coming months. Ladies and gentlemen, you can rest assured that we can say loud and clear that the European Union was not the problem in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the speeches, several of you mentioned solidarity with third countries, emission reductions, deforestation, and more efficient and more sustainable industry, and many of you spoke of leadership and unity. At this stage, it is our duty to push for the immediate application of the Copenhagen Accord.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also our duty to push for full integration of the accord in the ordinary procedure of the United Nations and also to lay firm foundations for a significant advance in Mexico. The role of regional and sectoral alliances will be fundamental there, and the European Union must strengthen them and extend them.</p>
<p class="contents">We must stand shoulder to shoulder in our work, facing the future. We must learn and move forward. We must not succumb to complaining. In looking to the future and thinking of what we must leave for future generations, Parliament can do a lot. All of us together, the Member States, the Environment Council, the Commission, Parliament and of course the Presidency: we all have a role to play.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of supplanting one another, we must act together and pool our best efforts to defend our common future, without forgetting that environment, development, competitiveness and innovation are common goals that must proceed hand-in-hand.</p>
<p class="contents">I take note of your contributions and assure you that you will always have the Spanish Government, which will hold the rotating Presidency of the European Union until 30 June, working with you to achieve a more sustainable future for all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will certainly pass your best wishes to my colleague, Stavros Dimas, for his recovery so that he might join you in the committee shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">I took note of your points and I will try to respond to some of your concerns and policy positions on the basis of the briefings I have asked for during this debate. I think we can interpret your basic messages so that, even though the Copenhagen Accord does not reflect our level of ambition, there is still a certain European fingerprint on it. In other words, the Copenhagen Accord contains references to the level of ambition needed to address climate change for the post-2012 climate agreement and it sets the basis for a financial package and invites serious commitments on emissions reductions.</p>
<p class="contents">On our own behalf, concerning our commitments, Coreper is meeting at this moment, and the Commission and the Member States want to make a single submission that is clear. The details are now under discussion, and I am confident that we will be ready before the deadline of 31 January. This is in response to Mrs McAvan, and this should also create a sound basis for the single negotiating text that Mrs Pietikäinen was calling for.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we see the Accord as a stepping stone for future major leaps in Mexico in future international climate negotiations. Mrs Hassi and many others have called for the EU’s leadership. I agree, and the Commission is determined to ensure that the EU maintains its leadership position over the coming months and transforms this Accord into the ambitious and legally binding treaty that we all want to see. I count on your support for this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately – as has been rightly said in this debate – some of our important negotiating partners, such as China and the United States, have not been able or willing to commit themselves as closely as the European Union has done, which, of course, had a detrimental impact on the negotiations. It is clear to everyone that China, in particular, did not want to commit itself to seriously meaningful objectives. It is my personal view that the new Commission will have to define an overall China strategy for the European Union to better pursue and achieve our common interests with the view of climate policy, trade tensions and exchange-rate policy. It is not acceptable that China’s currency-dumping is risking the economic recovery in Europe. In the same way, we would expect China to make a serious commitment in the field of climate change policy.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us also recall that our leadership starts at home. We need to make every effort to fulfil our Kyoto commitments as we are approaching the finishing line. We also need to ensure that new ambitious policies and measures are put forward that will lead us to the 20% – or even 30% – reduction goal that we have set for ourselves. In order to achieve that, we need to invest in innovation and research in resource efficient, environmental and energy technologies, which will be at the heart of the new EU 2020 strategy we are currently preparing.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mrs Dati and Mrs Grossetête, as well as Mrs Ek, that this implies that the EU 2020 will have to be a climate industry and a jobs strategy – and thus at the heart of the economic revival of the European Union. I would also still like to respond to Mr Davies, concerning his very concrete question. I have checked and I can inform you that the use of the EUR 300 million allowances for carbon capture and storage should be decided on 2 February in the respective comitology committee. I can reassure you that we want to support 12 demo plants. Eight plants will be supported in the first round and the rest in the second round.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, it is our duty for future generations to continue to lead by example and reach a legally binding agreement by the end of this year, ensuring a better and sustainable future for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us continue to put our own house in order. Europe is the only continent to have specific, ambitious legislation for reducing CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions. This must be implemented in the coming months and years. We must not forget that this also has a direct impact on other superpowers, not least China. All the consumer products China wishes to sell in Europe in the near future will have to comply with the strictest European environmental standards. This obliges Chinese manufacturers, too, to change course. ‘Hopenhagen’ may have largely failed, but we must set to work again, as next year will see new opportunities, first in Bonn and then in Mexico. In the meantime, Copenhagen has undoubtedly made sure everyone is alert, greatly heightening our environmental awareness. That is not enough, but what makes me optimistic is the realisation that investing in the climate is also good for our own pockets, for the economy and thus also for employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, if we look more closely at what happened in the Danish capital, we can see that the foundations were laid here for a new global climate order which we are going to achieve, but after years and years of hard work and negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">This was the first time that 115 Heads of State or Government met to discuss climate change. This is an important sign. The fact that the summit took place under the aegis of the UN highlights that even the developing and poorly industrialised countries realise that they need to play an active role in cutting greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of bilateral discussions between powerful industrialised states and developing states has grown, especially in light of the next summit on environmental issues in Mexico. The EU has all the data available to play an important role in bilateral discussions with states such as China, India or Brazil.

The summit’s unsatisfactory outcome is due to both the reticence shown by the large industrialised countries and the system’s complicated rules based on the UN’s consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the European Union’s inability to assume the role of catalyst for the global efforts to restrict the effects of climate change should be examined. By announcing unilaterally a year before this conference its intention to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, the EU had the moral upper hand to provide a fillip to the negotiations in Copenhagen. However, we did not know how to make our voice heard in a meeting dominated by the positions of the US and emerging countries.</p>
<p class="contents">A more restricted format of discussions is required so that we can hope for negotiations ending in success. The ministerial meetings in Bonn and Mexico City in June and December must be used as effectively as possible to leave the way open for adopting a new treaty.

It has shown that we are only one of many players on the world stage. Why did the proposals concerning CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions turn out to be unacceptable? It was because they threaten the interests of many developing countries, do not take account of competition based on the military economy worldwide, unfairly distribute the right to use the common good, which is the Earth, and are based on the not very credible hypothesis put forward by the IPCC on the harmfulness of CO<span class="sub">2</span>, while, as it turns out, the so-called ‘proofs’ have been manipulated (Climategate). Science must not be politically controlled, but should take account of all circumstances and answer every possible question. Has anyone asked, for example, what would happen if there were not enough CO<span class="sub">2</span> in the atmosphere? We should be glad about the warm period in the contemporary history of our planet and that, at the moment, we have around 370-380 ppm CO<span class="sub">2</span> in the atmosphere. In physics and chemistry we know Le Chatelier’s principle of equilibrium, which predicts development of the ideal conditions for photosynthesis. The Earth is becoming greener, a fact which has been confirmed many times, and this guarantees greater harvests and better conditions for development. Let it continue this way, although, unfortunately, there are many signs that, in the next two decades, the world will get cooler. Conclusion: the European Union should immediately review its restrictive climate and energy package, because it reduces the competitiveness of the EU economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By introducing emissions trading, supporting renewable sources of energy and through investment aimed at improving energy efficiency, developed nations are making considerable efforts to curb their carbon dioxide emissions. These measures result in additional costs for businesses. What is more, energy consumption is increasingly taxed in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, many developing countries do nothing to reduce their emission of greenhouse gases. They even constantly increase their carbon dioxide emissions. Instead of giving the largest industrial users incentives to embrace energy efficiency, they provide them with electricity at subsidised rates. Many say that nowadays, the most important comparative advantage of these countries is no longer cheap labour but cheap energy.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why new international trade regulations need to be put in place that prevent trade from leading to further carbon dioxide emissions. We need not only ‘fair’ but also ‘green’ trade. To this end, we need to ensure that if a country fails to fulfil its commitments made in climate change agreements, there are effective legal sanctions in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There were no legally binding commitments determining the future framework of international climate protection. The situation is aggravated by the fact that despite its intention, the EU was unable to significantly influence the final outcome of the negotiations. The failure of the conference does not justify idleness. We have to get used to the idea of emphasising regional solutions until an international treaty is drawn up that is legally binding for every player. Accordingly, the European Union should work on polishing up its internal regulations on climate protection. The regulations of the Union should be made more efficient without causing competitive disadvantage for European industries.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the EU’s climate policy should not disadvantage new Member States either, as was the case with the internal EU burden-sharing agreement recently. When it comes to climate protection, solutions that have many additional effects on top of decreasing emissions should be preferred. Thus, the development of urban transport improves the quality of life, the investments in improving energy efficiency create jobs, and the amounts spent on Research and Development improve competitiveness at the same time. These points of view should also be reflected in the budget for the next seven years. Europe cannot afford to only be a spectator at international negotiations on climate protection. It should continue to take the initiative even if, instead of ground-breaking changes, climate politics will now be characterised by small, incremental steps. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can only say that it is time the EU woke up to reality. We have to stop deceiving ourselves in imagining that the EU has been in a position of leadership or that it could take on such a role. Let us be honest: our ineffective and expensive strategy is tempting no one. I am also going to say this to the future Commissioner responsible for climate change. The Copenhagen Summit has come and gone, but why is Mrs Hedegaard still trying to have us believe that the EU is the leader on climate policy and the one to show the way in the world? It has not played that role for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Follow me, I’m right behind you,’ is the paradoxical slogan the EU has developed for itself. It is with this sort of self-deception that the EU continues with its wretched climate policy that is destroying jobs in the cleanest industries. Those who followed the climate debate at all had known for a long time that an international agreement based on the EU’s formula would not be achieved. The United States of America, China and Japan have chosen a route that has rejected the UN­led model, with its negotiated emission ceilings and timetables. They are investing directly in reducing carbon intensity and in new technology which, in time, will also be seen as the logical way to cut emissions. That method, however, will not expose the economy and jobs to bureaucracy, unfair competition or unforeseen price fluctuations. In Europe, we will be exposed if the EU continues to follow a different path, remaining alone and worsening the plight of companies. It is a sorry state of affairs that no one benefits from this, the people least of all. The environment will not benefit either if the cleanest industries in the world have sanctions imposed on them in emissions trading, sanctions that are not imposed on the rest. It is time for the EU to review its policy and end this fantasising. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Copenhagen Agreement was negotiated and signed with great effort, being just short of a total failure. The compromise accepted with great difficulty was only that of ‘to take note’.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the EU has assumed specific, ambitious objectives, they have not led to similar actions from the other partners. However, it should be emphasised that all the major economic and political powers in the world met to debate and assume responsibility for combating climate change. The objective was recognised of maintaining the global warming gradient at 2° C and agreeing to financial support of USD 30 billion during the 2010-2012 period (fast-start financing) and USD 100 billion by 2020. These sums are intended to fund the measures for reducing and adapting to the effects of climate change for the least developed and most vulnerable countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the future Commission, especially if there is going to be a commissioner responsible for climate change and action, must evaluate very closely all the reduction proposals – commitments made by the countries which are party to the United Nations Convention – and also prepare the negotiations in the same way so that a legally binding agreement is signed at COP 16 in Mexico in 2010. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some progress has been made, however. For example, the creation of the Copenhagen Green Climate Fund will provide financing for poorer countries to adapt to climate change and to develop clean energy, and the formal acceptance by emerging economies that they have coresponsibility makes a concrete commitment from these countries more likely in the near future. The EU must continue to play a leading role in the absence of a legally binding agreement. The Commissioner-designate for climate action has expressed commitment to an international agreement on the protection of tropical forests, the inclusion of road transport and shipping in the ETS, and the linking of EU and US cap-and-trade systems, which would represent a crucial step in international cooperation for global emission reductions. We should continue to develop and implement our own climate legislation as other countries work towards theirs. Our work with international organisations and partner countries in the coming months will increase the chances of more meaningful progress at the next conference in Mexico. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Recently, in Copenhagen, a climate summit devoted to this issue was held. Meanwhile, we discovered that the contents of several thousand documents and e-mails had found their way onto the Internet from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, one of the world’s most prestigious institutions dealing with climate warming and the effect of human activity on this process. The material included correspondence between scientists from various countries, whose research has had a key influence on the position of the European Union and the UN on climate change. The leaked information shows that research results may have been manipulated and, as a result, unreliable information on the greenhouse effect and climate change may have been issued. The countries of the EU, and so our societies, are bearing substantial costs related to the emission of greenhouse gases, while in Copenhagen, attempts were made to make developed countries, including the EU, accept an even greater financial burden related to global warming, in order to help, in this way, developing countries. Every doubt which exists on this matter should be clarified in detail, not even because we want to convince those who doubt the legitimacy of measures to limit gas emissions, but because European taxpayers are bearing and are going to bear huge costs related to this, and they must be sure these measures are based on sound reasons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
