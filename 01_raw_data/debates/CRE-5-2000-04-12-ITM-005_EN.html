We can also remember the drought in Africa in the 1990s, which affected around ten countries. Yet we must also remember that we managed to get nearly four million tonnes of food to sub-Saharan Africa thanks to action by the international community. This was partly in response to media coverage, which is playing an increasingly important role. We must realise that, notwithstanding the crisis situations which now exist, the international community has taken objective action in response. This has probably not been adequate and not what we would have liked it to be, but at least the international community has adopted an objective attitude. Within the international community, either individually or through the European Union as a whole, the European countries have made an important contribution. We must remember this, now that the crisis in Ethiopia is occurring again due to drought.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is keen to ensure that this situation does not worsen and is trying to mobilise all possible means to lessen its effects. Certain instruments are currently working effectively at both EU level and in the role played by the EU within international organisations. This intervention is very important in tackling the problem of nearly 16 million people currently at risk throughout this area. Commissioner Patten will explain, at the appropriate moment in this debate, the actions which the Commission has planned or has been developing. These actions are very important and have been implemented in time. The decisions were also taken at the right time. Both the Directorate-General for Development and ECHO have already sent enough food to satisfy the most urgent needs. At this precise moment, the Executive Director of the World Food Programme is in Addis Ababa for discussions with the Ethiopian Government on this issue, which involves technical and practical problems in transporting the food. We cannot separate from this issue the current political and military position in Ethiopia. We must be aware that this situation, which is in itself extremely serious due to the drought, is currently being made worse precisely because of political and military circumstances which are hindering the distribution of aid. In particular, means of transport may be lacking because they are being used for purposes other than those for which they are intended.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, the European Union has been monitoring this situation. In the General Affairs Council the day before yesterday the Commission presented a report on the current situation in the Horn of Africa and specifically tackled one point of the humanitarian situation. However, these concerns are the centre of attention not only for the Commission but also for the Council. A meeting was held yesterday in Brussels of a group of experts specifically to analyse the best ways of tackling this situation. There were representatives from ECHO, the Directorate-General for Development and the Member States of the European Union. This meeting was preceded by one with the Ethiopian Ambassador to ensure the most effective coordination of the aid and support which the European Union can mobilise, both overall and in terms of that from individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the situation in the Horn of Africa, in both political and humanitarian terms, is at the centre of our concerns. On Monday in the General Affairs Council we had a debate on this subject at which the Council’s Special Envoy was present. He gave a presentation on the situation and its gravity. The European Union approved in this same Council a set of recommendations which are to be added to all the political actions which the Union has been developing, particularly since last year, following the severest onslaught in the conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia. We are monitoring this issue. Unfortunately, sometimes we cannot react as rapidly as we would like to the various situations of humanitarian need and shortage. However, we are watching this issue and we hope that the attention raised by this debate may itself also help to mobilise public opinion on such a serious problem.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate – grateful but sad that the debate is necessary at all. I am standing in for my colleague, Commissioner Nielson, who would have liked to have been able to respond himself.</p>
<p class="contents">For me there is an awful sense of <span class="italic">déja vu</span> – or perhaps I should say <span class="italic">déja entendu</span> – about this debate today. Over a decade ago, from 1986 to 1989, I was my country’s development minister. I know that there are a number of honourable Members in this House who have done the same job for their own countries. I was speaking in similar debates then, tackling similar crises in the Horn of Africa. I am afraid the story is grimly familiar: there are military conflicts, there is environmental degradation, there is drought, and sometimes there have been – and this was especially true in the past – extremely ill-judged policies. It is a lethal mix. It is capable of producing hunger and misery on a massive scale. We face the same old frustrations, as I said in the Chamber yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all the problems we will, in the end get help to the starving, never quite as fast as we would like, but faster than used to be the case. So we improve our capacity to deal with the humanitarian problems in spite of the difficulties. But alas we are still incapable of preventing the humanitarian problems arising in the first place – very often problems with largely political causes. That is the frustration.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me set out for honourable Members what we are doing to alleviate the present crisis. There are currently two Commission teams in Ethiopia: one from ECHO and one from the Food Security Unit of our Directorate-General for Development. They will be making recommendations on our future efforts. The Ethiopian Government has asked for 821 000 tonnes of food aid, 25% more than in recent years. This amount is nearly covered by existing pledges by the international community. The Commission has programmed the delivery of 283 000 tonnes and we are about to take decisions on delivering an additional quantity of up to 260 000 tonnes.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also correct an inaccuracy that is circulating as a result of an Oxfam statement which claimed that the Commission provided only 50 000 tonnes to Ethiopia last year. The real figure is more than three times that.</p>
<p class="contents">The deliveries this year come on top of a quarter of a century in which the Commission has been involved in providing food assistance to Ethiopia. During that time nearly 40% of our total aid to Ethiopia has been in food assistance or food security programmes: some EUR 875 million’s worth, EUR 250 million in the last four years alone. That is the background. It is important to be aware of it.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been a number of allegations about an inadequate European response to the crisis. There is an admirable letter in the London newspaper, <span class="italic">The Independent</span>, by the honourable Member, Mrs Kinnock, who knows a very great deal about the Horn of Africa, in which she sets out the real facts. I hope that letter gets wider circulation. One of the things that she said in her letter – and I guess she speaks with almost more authority on this subject than anyone else – is: “The European Union, together with Member States, remains the biggest donor of food aid to Ethiopia”. She then argues: “This is not ‘visible’ since it is directed through the government, the World Food Programme, the Red Cross, NGOs and others.” It is important to remember that point.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters most is not to rake over these old controversies. What matters most is what we are doing right now to get help to the starving. I want to remind Parliament that total Commission food aid, now being off-loaded, shipped or procured, amounts to over 282 million metric tonnes. An EC food aid shipment of 30 000 tonnes channelled through the World Food Programme arrived in Djibouti port last weekend. A further shipment of over 16 000 tonnes through EuronAid is due to arrive on Sunday.</p>
<p class="contents">This will be followed by further shipments through Djibouti and Berbera in view of the limited port-handling capacity. Total shipments from all donors expected to be offloaded between now and July amount to 504 000 metric tonnes. This quantity should be sufficient to meet immediate needs. Total donor pledges, as I said earlier, are over 800 000 metric tonnes. So that is what we are doing. We will continue to devote our full attention to this crisis until it is over, and our people in ECHO on the ground will continue to work tirelessly to get help to where it is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">We are facing a major problem posed by the lack of adequate port facilities for food-aid deliveries, not least because of the non-availability of the Eritrean ports at Assab and Massawa, which means that only Djibouti and to a lesser extent Berbera can be used. Djibouti is expected to be congested with the arrival of 600 000 metric tonnes over the next three months. We are looking urgently for alternatives, including better use of the Port of Berbera through rapid improvements to the road from Berbera into Ethiopia. We are also considering using the Port of Sudan. Road improvements are under way on the Sudanese side and roads on the Ethiopian side are reported to be quite good.</p>
<p class="contents">As my friend said in opening this debate, of course there are problems because of the conflict zone and I just want to repeat what I said at the outset. I have had to speak in too many debates like this dealing with the consequences of crises like this, in the Great Lakes, in Ethiopia, in the Sudan and now in Ethiopia again. I repeat, we are better at delivering assistance now than we were a decade ago, but it is intensely frustrating that all the assistance should be required in the first place. It is intensely frustrating that as millions starve, governments spend small fortunes on guns and weaponry to wage war against each other when the only war they should be waging is a war against starvation, a war for food security, a war against poverty and environmental degradation, a war in which we are morally bound to help them. It follows therefore that as we combat the hunger, we should also lend our full support to those who fight for peace. We give our whole-hearted backing to the efforts of all of those, including the OAU and the European Presidency’s Special Envoy, Ambassador Serri, who worked for a peaceful settlement to regional conflicts. They will have our unstinting assistance. I am afraid that I should add that experience suggests that they need our prayers as well.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again, we see the scenes on our TV screens of starving children in Ethiopia and we remember the horrors of the last famine in the Horn of Africa. Once again, we have pop stars and celebrities criticising the institutions of Europe and national governments for doing too little too late. It is amazing how quickly some people become experts when a situation like this arises and they can see some publicity, without knowing more of the background to the overall position.</p>
<p class="contents">Somalia is war-torn into small fiefdoms, which makes it extremely difficult for anyone – institutions or NGOs – to deliver food aid to the starving people. Who does one negotiate with in such a situation?</p>
<p class="contents">Ethiopia is engaged in a border dispute with Eritrea, which means most of the manpower is tied up on a war front and much-needed food is being diverted in both countries to feed soldiers rather than starving children.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we must do everything in our power to alleviate famine. However, where countries are at war, all our aid must be humanitarian and channelled through NGO organisations to ensure that aid goes to the starving people and not to the war front. We must watch the situation in Eritrea and balance humanitarian aid there, if required. We desperately want these two countries to sign a peace agreement through the efforts of the OAU so that we can resume full development aid to both countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I recently spent a week in both Ethiopia and Eritrea. I visited refugee camps in both countries and saw for myself the hardship and the poverty people are suffering. It is not true to say that Ethiopia has not been crying for help for food aid over the past two years, but the war situation has blurred the vision of many looking on. When I was there they were pleading for help. I saw children with serious malnutrition and in need of health care, as well as food and proper shelter. I saw families living in caves, the walls running with water, and listened to the hacking coughs of children racked with fever. It looks bad on TV; it is a hundred times worse when you stand amongst it, when people are in such dire situations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I saw food aid being delivered in Eritrea by German NGOs to a camp of 16 000 people, spread over 7 kilometres in case of bombing raids. I watched two strong men lifting 50-kg bags on to women’s backs and saw them stagger off to their plastic shelters kilometres away. I saw children aged eight walking eight kilometres out and eight kilometres back to get water. They were the lucky ones: they were the ones with food.</p>
<p class="contents">We never seem to learn a lesson from the past. It should not be TV cameras and pop stars who alert us to starvation and drought: there should be a proper monitoring system in the sensitive areas of the African continent. Perhaps this could be built into Commissioner Patten’s rapid reaction unit we heard of yesterday. We must have action and we must have action decisively and urgently.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all witnessed the fight against hunger ten years ago. We subsequently visited many projects and saw many things, such as very expert local farmers who were involved in reconstruction projects both in Eritrea and Ethiopia. I find Ethiopia’s criticism hard to take: Europe undertakes too little, you need to send food. Meanwhile the logistical capacity, such as lorries, roads and money, is used to wage a regional war. The least both parties could do is to impose an absolute freeze on military activity. If we talk about distributing food fast to the right places, then these lorries are needed, and these lorries were the force behind the movement which now leads Ethiopia and the movement which leads Eritrea. Both have a great deal of logistical experience, expertise and know-how. If they really channel their energies – and want to channel their energies – into what is available at this stage, if they want to make their ports and roads available, their capacity would be enormous. According to them, we are entirely to blame. But there is huge responsibility on the part of Ethiopia and Eritrea, and they should not try to throw it back at us using a cheap marketing trick. They are jointly responsible. Put a freeze on the military trade, try to reach a peace agreement and meanwhile, deploy your military lorry capacity and manpower where they are needed. </p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns food. There is enormous pressure to send food fast, and I mean fast. Experience has taught us that things can go very far wrong depending on how food is distributed, and it could well end up sitting in the warehouses. I would suggest looking at all the options – this will certainly be done by the monitoring clubs of the EU now in Ethiopia. Is there anything for sale locally in the region? We were right to turn our food aid policy round. We should not send our surpluses there but examine whether anything can be bought locally. After all, anything we can get and arrange there will help their economy and will prevent the local situation from being distorted. Because, ultimately, that is what causes the structural hardship which accompanies these wars. I hope that the early warning facility, which involved a great many experts, will also be built into our ability to receive signals at an earlier stage. It is not easy. Everyone knows that, but it could be an enormous bonus in removing the image of inadequacy when we handle such situations. Ethiopia and Eritrea bear the ultimate responsibility. I give my full backing to any action undertaken by the Commission on this score.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Millions of people are again threatened with starvation. This is not just caused by extreme drought. The blame lies mainly with the unusually irresponsible leaders who prioritise the fight for a dry piece of land over the suffering of their own people. Surely it is absolutely appalling that the governments of poverty-stricken countries such as Ethiopia and Eritrea buy arms on a massive scale instead of building up sufficient food reserves. The blinkered Ethiopian government, in particular, contributes through its obstinacy to the suffering of its own people. How else can you explain the fact that Ethiopia rejected the offer to use the ports of Massawa and Assab? As a result, aid is now unable to reach a large part of its own population. The Organisation of African Unity and the European Union must exert maximum pressure on the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea to settle their dispute in Algiers, and aid workers must gain safe access to the population without delay. </p>
<p class="contents">An Ethiopian Minister has said that the international community does not spring into action until the skeletons appear on television. He failed to mention that these macabre images are not only due to a lack of rain but mainly to a lack of proper leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that Commissioner Patten has addressed the criticism to the effect that European aid is inadequate. Despite this, I would like to ask him what lessons he has learnt from how Europe responded this time round. It is difficult not to despair in the face of the misery in the Horn of Africa. We should nonetheless not lose hope. Nature can only destroy where people fail. After all, war and mismanagement are down to people. Africa’s fateful history does not have to repeat itself, provided that people’s lives take priority over the feuds among its shameless leaders.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Why do we still allow this to happen? Do we not have a conscience? Every day the European Union provides less funding, less aid, in global terms, to the poor countries of Africa. So how can we be surprised at this situation? How can it be that we have warehouses full of surplus food which we are obliged to destroy when it rots away pointlessly or when it does not meet the conditions for consumption which we demand? There are reasons to justify this, but none of them justifies the death of a single person from starvation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not true that we show solidarity. No. All we do is try to put the fire out with occasional aid, without a clear or decisive policy for prevention although we know perfectly well that famine in Africa, and in the third world in general, happens periodically.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that these thousands of tonnes of food aid provided do not silence the media and that they continue to report on the tragedy in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not saying anything new. It has been said a million times and it will be said again, but today I am speaking from the heart and I feel Africa’s pain as if it were my own.</p>
<p class="contents">When will we have a Marshall Plan for Africa? To this end, I propose that there be set up a prestigious and independent committee of international experts to assess the situation together with the international organisations and to implement a series of urgent proposals and initiatives for food and health aid, acting immediately, planning for the future and putting all our humanitarian weaponry into the hands of the non-governmental organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It requires from the international community, and particularly the European Union, a corresponding level of attention and aid in order to prevent an unparalleled human catastrophe. Action is already being taken, like the food aid which the European Union is providing, as mentioned just now by Commissioner Patten. Yet we cannot relax. We also have to overcome all the difficulties on the ground in getting food and medicine to the starving and dying people and children, and as quickly as possible. We must therefore firmly stress to the governments in the region, bearing in mind the political and military situation, that they must allow and ensure rapid movement and access by the international organisations to the areas where these people are gathered. They must also guarantee that this aid reaches those for whom it is really intended. It is essential that these international organisations, such as the World Health Organisation, UNICEF and the FAO in particular, act together and with all the speed and efficiency which the situation demands. They must deliver the food and medical aid but they must also take steps to re-establish the primary sector which is decisive in this type of economy, in order to guarantee a sustainable and medium-term solution. This may be achieved by sending technicians and experts who can set up projects in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The gravity of the situation and the need for our solidarity with these people to result in exceptional and priority action lead me finally to ask the Commission, and particularly Commissioners Patten and Nielson, to keep us regularly and closely informed about how the situation is developing and especially the measures which they intend to use or are developing to ease this situation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The donors, including the European Union, are said not to have kept their promises. I share the Commissioner’s view that the reproach made by Addis Ababa is misplaced to say the least. Misplaced because this statement is made by a government which has been embroiled in an absurd war over borders with its neighbour, Eritrea, for two years now. Hundreds of millions of dollars, desperately needed for social provisions and increasing food production, have already been pumped into the war machine and, at the time when the Ethiopian Minister for Foreign Affairs was heaping abuse on the international community, reports were circulating that his government had bought a military aircraft from the Russian Republic. It is high time that the Ethiopian government faced up to its responsibility and made every effort to end the war with Eritrea. It could then focus its attention on the economic and social development of the country and so be able to prevent famines such as these. But also, and I would like to make this quite clear, the aid industry should stop blaming the international community unilaterally and, in this way, stop providing the local regime with an alibi. Emergency aid is absolutely necessary and must be increased, but development aid to both warring governments must be combined with accepting and implementing the OAU peace agreement. As a token of goodwill, the Ethiopian leader could in the meantime begin by accepting the offer of a humanitarian corridor from his Eritrean colleague, or could the pride and ego of one man get in the way once again of the interests of millions of his people?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Horn of Africa, which has become the site of every conceivable scourge, 16 million victims of famine, of which 8 million are in Ethiopia, are awaiting aid. In Ogaden, the most hard-hit region in south-east Ethiopia, there has been no rain for three years, to the point that the notion of dry seasons and wet seasons is now devoid of all meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">So of course we have to react, and do so quickly, and unfortunately we know all too well that the price of our procrastination and delays is paid in human lives. At the same time, let me thank the Council and the Commission for what they have already done and for the information they gave us a short while ago. Of course the 800 000 tonnes of emergency aid promised by the international community must be delivered as soon as possible. But at the same time, the countries in the region must do their utmost to facilitate this delivery: by opening up the ports, supply routes and infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, in a region torn apart by a rearguard conflict, this crisis leaves a particularly bitter taste, because every penny paid to buy a gun, to buy ammunition, aggravates an already precarious economic, social and nutritional situation. We must demand that Eritrea and Ethiopia freeze their military activities so that all the assets, all the logistical and human capabilities of these countries are put at the service of their peoples. The sound of guns has for far too long drowned out the cries of the hungry.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we must appeal to the reason of the Ethiopian and Eritrean leaders and call on them to put an end to the conflict, to reach rapid agreement on the technical arrangements for a ceasefire under the OAU peace plan. But at this moment, of course, we must simply listen to the appeals of the suffering people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The cameramen left but misery and death did not leave Ethiopia. Starvation and death continue today. The population of Ethiopia pray for rain. Sadly they see only a rain of bullets. People crave water, food and medicine. Sadly all they see is their land and their homes blown to pieces by the tanks and planes our governments supply to the Ethiopian and Eritrean politicians.</p>
<p class="contents">These politicians are hungry for power: politicians who argue over territorial boundaries whilst their people die. These politicians fly their national flags on their parliaments and presidential palaces, but sadly the only flag their people see is the flag of death. Famine, disease and death remain the hallmarks of these countries. Hunger for power must not be allowed to override the hunger for life.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Patten has listed a number of measures the EU has taken to help. Such help has been received with gratitude, but let us put it into perspective. Sixteen million people are starving today; 15 000 tonnes have been delivered. I accept the difficulties of the logistics but that means less than a kilo per person. No time limit is given, in other words it is a kilo that has to last forever. These measures are palliative. They only relieve the symptoms; they do not cure the disease.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must take the lead in curing this serious problem and the only way to do it is firstly to stop arms reaching all the warring parties and make sure we use our influence with those who supply them; and secondly teach these people how to grow food and harvest, store, package and process it so that they can be independent and self-reliant, not beggars for life.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Patten’s words made clear not only an objective awareness of the work already carried out but also an absolute awareness that this situation is intolerable and that the European Commission will be determined on this issue, that it will take specific action and also closely monitor future developments.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Council, I should like to say that there is great interest in ensuring that situations of this kind can be permanently followed and monitored in close coordination with the Commission. It is important that an objective awareness is created within the European Union that humanitarian issues must be dealt with in an increasingly committed manner and that the European Union and its Member States must, within the relevant international organisations, ensure priority attention for these issues. The summit between the European Union and the African countries was held just a few days ago. Its extensive agenda offered an opportunity for what we hope is the first in a series of organised dialogues between Europe and the African countries. Specifically we want to try and establish a more integrated and coordinated vision of all the issues now affecting the African continent about which we are concerned. This must be made clear. These issues do matter to the European continent for a whole range of reasons, even ones which relate to the very safety and stability desired for the European continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Dialogue with the African authorities is essential, as is dialogue with the sub-regional authorities. It is vital to guarantee coherent action in preventing conflicts and creating rapid intervention mechanisms for these situations. Without this collective and organised dialogue, there can be no hope. The problems cannot be solved through ad hoc actions and one-off interventions. If we cannot organise the international community within the global international organisations and within the more regional organisations, we will not have any response to all the crises which are systematically affecting the weakest countries in particular. The European Union has, in this respect, a particular responsibility the tradition addressing this type of problem could almost be said to be part of its civilisation. The EU has an awareness and a responsibility which today’s debate has clearly demonstrated.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
