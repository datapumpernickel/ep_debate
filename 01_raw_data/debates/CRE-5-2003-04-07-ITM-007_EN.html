<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mauro (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, before focusing on some specific points, I would like to say an informal ‘thank you’ to the European Commission, in the person of Mrs Reding and her colleagues, and the Greek Presidency, in the person of the Minister for Education, and Mr Tsiakaris, the chairman of the education committee. It is their availability, in particular, during these two months of intense work, which has enabled to us to respect the timeframes we set ourselves for the adoption of this report, which, I have to say, has been produced in a very short space of time.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out that the amendments to the European Commission’s proposal have been agreed with both the Commission’s services and the Council representatives. We are all quite aware that our greatest achievement in adopting this programme will be precisely launching the related calls for proposals in a short space of time.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot of progress has been made with regard to eLearning since the Lisbon Council in March 2000, and we have now moved from the proposal for action to implement new technology in the field of education to a legislative resolution which will lead to a genuine multi-annual programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As I pointed out previously during the work on the Commission's first communication, particular emphasis has been placed on the role of teachers as a channel enabling the development of digital literacy in our schools. This is why the issue of training teachers or, in any case, equipping them to make use of the new technologies, is an absolute priority, and the endeavours which can be glimpsed in some pages of the Commission proposal must certainly be rewarded and supported.</p>
<p class="contents">I nonetheless consider it advisable to make some changes to the Commission proposal, particularly as regards the multi-annual budget. The question I asked myself at the start of our work was: what should be regarded as an 'appropriate' budget for an ambitious multi-annual programme such as this? It is not easy to answer this question because resources for culture and education always seem to be particularly limited. What encouraged me and prompted me to persevere in this matter<span class="bold"> </span>was the proposal made by the European Commission itself in the 2003 budget: budget line B3-1000 has been allocated EUR 18 million in commitment appropriations for the preparatory actions in the 2003 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasoning behind my decision to amend the Commission’s current proposal of EUR 36 million is this: would it not be unusual to spend less each year on a multi-annual programme than on the preparatory actions which preceded it? In this sense, I think the Commission should be grateful to me for pointing out to it that, actually, EUR 18 million multiplied by three equals EUR 54 million, which would appear to be a more appropriate figure.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of the distribution of the budget warrants further emphasis. Initially, in the Commission’s proposal, 25% of the budget was dedicated to fighting the digital divide. I want to clarify why I have called for this amount to be reduced in my amendment. I am absolutely convinced of the need to fight the social causes of the digital divide. I am equally convinced that the funding should be sought within other Community instruments – the Structural Funds, the European Social Fund and the Leonardo da Vinci programme – because, if we were to wait in order to use the eLearning funds to respond to the need to bridge the digital divide, even then providing essentially only the most basic of responses, almost the entire budget for the eLearning actions would be used up.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the E-twinning of European schools, in line with the objectives adopted in the European Parliament's previous resolution, I wish to stress that training teachers remains a priority within the programme. I want us to reflect on the fact that, on average, 90% of primary schools, 98% of secondary schools and 99% of vocational and technical schools in the Member States were connected to the Internet in 2002. However, only 39% of primary school teachers, 50% of secondary school teachers and 58% of teachers in vocational and technical schools used the Internet as a teaching instrument. These averages actually conceal dramatic differences between Member States: while the average for Denmark is approximately 75%, the corresponding figure in Greece is not even as high as 9%.</p>
<p class="contents">These figures, which are clear enough in themselves, point to two conclusions. The first concerns the use of the Internet as a teaching tool. It is not just a matter of the availability of infrastructure or educational equipment; sometimes the problem concerns the training of teachers and educational organisation. The second conclusion concerns the use of technological resources. The goal can really become that of exchanging methodological and didactic good practice between teachers in various Member States, or the start-up of 'virtual training rooms'.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, I consider that the Commission proposal should give greater weight to finding the most effective ways for teachers to integrate use of the Internet into their teaching and to encourage the dissemination of good practice in this sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for the superb quality of his work and the essential contribution he has made not only to this project but also to the eLearning action plan, which was the subject of his first report in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council, seeking to establish the eLearning Programme, supplements the action taken at the Lisbon Council concerning the integration of new technologies into education and training systems in Europe. The goal is to achieve integration swiftly and effectively, but also in a critical, carefully-thought-out manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal is first and foremost a response to the Lisbon mandate, extended at Stockholm and Barcelona. It therefore carries a political message highlighting the importance of meeting the challenges of new technologies to create a knowledge-based Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The new programme is designed to supplement and enhance the actions of existing programmes. It should make it possible to test new forms of cooperation and thus provide useful information for the new generation of programmes after 2006. The proposal of programmes is also the logical result of the preparatory actions that have been carried out, Mr President, over the past three years as part of the budgetary appropriations proposed by Parliament, which could not take place without a legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme has three main pillars. The first is digital literacy, a new range of essential skills for the knowledge-based society. Schools must provide pupils with these skills, as they do in the case of reading and writing. Apart from schools, this also affects the citizens and society as a whole. Digital literacy must therefore be a part of lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">The second pillar is the virtual campus. The incorporation of new tools and eLearning methods concerns both traditional universities and distance-Learning universities. These new tools and methods can also make an extremely positive contribution to improving the high standards of European universities and their competitiveness at global level.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the third action to be the most important, as it concerns our children. I was pleased to note Parliament’s interest in this action. It concerns twinning schools via the Internet, which was, in fact, requested by the Barcelona Council. At your request, this action now has the clear purpose of acting as a lever for training teachers in the exploitation of new teaching opportunities provided by communication technologies and European cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">As always in this type of programme, we should consider the transversal actions and technical assistance. The results need to be further exploited and the transfer of experience gained so far must be encouraged. This should be achieved not only through the various eLearning instruments and programmes, but by taking account of similar instruments and programmes in the Member States as well. Information and communication will therefore receive particular attention. In this regard, I would like to say that the eLearning portal has already been created. I inaugurated the portal just over three months ago at the <span class="italic">Learntech</span> event in Karlsruhe and the number of visitors is already highly satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I was interested to note the budgetary proposals put forward by the European Parliament, which demonstrate its support for the Commission proposal, and I would like to thank Parliament for that. Parliament is quite aware that, at this stage, the Commission can only maintain its initial proposal, which could be reviewed in light of a possible increase in the ceiling for budget heading 3 for the years 2004-2006. I would also like to tell your rapporteur that the Commission can accept 24 of the 29 amendments tabled by Parliament, which shows strong consensus between Parliament and the Commission. That is why I hope that the negotiations will be concluded as quickly as possible according to the interinstitutional procedures in force. I am pleased to note, Mr President, as I often do, moreover, the perfect agreement between our two institutions to make progress towards a Europe of citizens, and, in particular, smaller citizens, whose schools will become part of a network in the twinning operations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pack (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Mauro report does indeed contain proposals for making this programme even more effective. It was already very good the way the Commission had proposed it, but the proposals Mr Mauro has made improve it still further. Above all, I believe that the apportionment of funds – as he envisages it – enables this programme better to meet the demands that we make of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot see how these paltry resources are meant to enable us to bridge what is called the digital divide, which is for real and consists in the fact that, in some countries, many schools are equipped with computers, while, in others, very few have them. That is why we have tried something for which I also thank Mr Mauro, namely to make you more aware of this. Our amendment is among the twenty-four that aim to get schools communicating with each other and more money spent on equipping them with computers.</p>
<p class="contents">The other question, as to how we can close this digital divide between one nation and another, cannot be answered on this occasion. This is a gap that can perhaps be filled by using money from the Cohesion Fund or from the Social and Regional Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach to the eLearning Programme must, as you said, be increasingly directed towards the creation of synergies between existing programmes and the eLearning Programme. If we attach particular importance to schools being linked up to each other through a network, that is something that can be firmly tied into the 'COMENIUS' programme, and which actually has been hitherto, probably without any support. I have seen this in many schools that I have visited in connection with the COMENIUS programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, then, that this is where we have to forge a new partnership, one that promotes eLearning as an aid to language learning, as well as intercultural dialogue, above all in schools. When we talk in terms of a virtual campus, that of course relates to what we were discussing earlier in connection with the De Sarnez Report. There must be a close connection with Erasmus and Erasmus World. If we are to achieve the best results, we have to combine virtual mobility and physical mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, moreover, to underline what Mr Mauro said earlier. There is a massive shortage of teachers, and the attempt must be made, with the help of this programme, to compensate for it. Teachers should not lag behind their pupils, but really should be a bit further ahead, so that they can inject greater stimulus into this area. The eLearning Programme – as at present envisaged – is an important addition to all the educational programmes currently in existence. Again, sincere thanks for all the work you have done.</p>

Among many equally important means to this end is greater and better use of information and communications technology. The eLearning Programme, as we have just heard, is now to promote still further access to European educational and training programmes in order to improve their quality and accessibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The enormity of the gulf between one country and another is demonstrated by the statistical data that Mr Mauro has just enumerated. There is good provision in schools, but the equipment is underused and the teachers lack the necessary skills, so there are grave deficiencies here, not to mention the gap between North and South. The fact that there is almost 90% use in Denmark, and only some 11% in Greece demonstrates to me that there is a great divide between these two countries and thus within Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The proper response to this digital divide is integration into the other European instruments. This is where primary and secondary schools make up a very important target group, one in which I therefore believe greater investment to be needed. We can therefore wholeheartedly agree to this proposal for 40%, which should be the percentage in elementary and secondary schools.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let me stress that the success of educational policy is not dependent on the number of programmes, but rather on their being implemented and funded in a realistic way. This makes it necessary to increase funding from EUR 36 million to EUR 54 million, without adjustments taking funding away from other programmes. That is the only way, Commissioner, that we will achieve the Europe for small citizens to which you have just referred. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are talking about a small programme, and a cheap one, even though it would cost EUR 54 million, but it is a step in the right direction, and it is high time it were taken. The new information and communications technologies are exciting and important, and it is very important that they be integrated into the European education and training systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme we are now talking about must not replace, but support and supplement the initiatives on the part of the Member States. I should like to take up from where Mr Mauro and Mrs Prets left off and, in all modesty, state that we have come a very long way with the new educational technologies in Denmark where 70% of primary schools, 81% of high schools and 92% of vocational and technical courses for young people have daily Internet access.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone has something to learn, however, and it is therefore important to be able to use the programme for supporting the promotion and dissemination of best practice, for example by supporting school twinning. It is very important to share experiences of the new technologies in particular, and that is actually an exercise encouraged by the Internet itself. Indeed, mutual aid and the free exchange of ideas are part of the Internet’s splendid philosophy. I am also quite certain that many teachers have benefited from exchanging experiences with their pupils, for the fact is that, in this area, young people have, in many cases, far greater knowledge and experience than their teachers. This too is something that this programme will get to grips with.</p>
<p class="contents">Education has been high on the agenda for the Lisbon, Stockholm and Barcelona European Councils, and, with the adoption of Mr Mauro’s report, we are taking a step, albeit a modest one, in the right direction of complying with the important decisions taken at these summits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not having access to the Internet or lacking ICT skills is becoming a barrier to social integration and to personal development. A large number of jobs in services and industry now call for employees to possess all-round ICT skills, and that is why a programme such as eLearning is essential to achieve the overall objective of the 2000 Lisbon Summit, of making Europe the most competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Mauro, that we should teach ICT skills from a very young age up to university level, and ensure that schools and universities and, more importantly, the teachers themselves, are capable of using all the new technologies. Nevertheless, we cannot forget that there are many disadvantaged groups unable to benefit from traditional educational and training provisions, who are consequently becoming increasingly isolated both socially and culturally because they are not digitally literate. I would endorse the point that has been made already regarding the importance of maintaining the 25% from the budget to bridge the digital divide. In many areas, not only in accession countries, but in my own area of Wales, which is an Objective 1 area, it is vitally important for us to maintain the 25%, because many of those communities have not yet bridged the important digital divide that is emerging. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have proved their worth in such a way, and have been so successful, that we only have to adapt them to the new structures. The structure of eLearning is the same as in the example we were given earlier, Erasmus Mundus. We are all familiar with the Comenius programme within the great Socrates programme framework, which is about cooperation between at least three schools from different Member States. This programme is extraordinarily successful, achieving a high degree of efficiency with relatively meagre resources and great commitment on the part of both teachers and students. So I think it is tremendous that we have managed to use the eLearning Programme to strengthen this area of technology-supported school partnership. We have, unfortunately, always had to decry the lack of sufficient funds for mobility for existing Comenius schools, and now, thanks to technology, mobility is being multiplied, albeit in the virtual realm. That cannot, and must not, become more than an additional area. Whilst it cannot be a substitute for real encounters between people, it can be an immense help to our schools in building up a real awareness of the Europe that we share.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I also enthusiastically welcome our desire to increase the estimate to 40%, and I would like to point out that, quite apart from bridging the digital divide, it is extraordinarily important not to lose sight of the need to develop European software. Of the software used in Europe, 80% originates in the USA. Whilst I am a friend of the Americans in bad times and good, I would like to see a more equal balance in the field of software, and so what I ask of the Council, not only as regards this programme, but also the other technological programmes, is that they keep an eye on the development and enhancement of European software and facilitate the support and promotion that this needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The eLearning Programme is also a good example of excellent cooperation between Parliament and the Commission. On Parliament’s initiative, and for the second year running, the EU budget already has a special budget line to support eLearning. This year EUR 18 million has been allocated to this heading, B 3-1000. The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport has in fact expressed its concern that the Commission proposal will mean less being spent each year on the programme than has now been allocated for the preparatory actions. For that reason the committee is proposing that the overall budget be increased from 36 million to 54 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport is aware that the expenditure for its category of activity must be accommodated within the degree of manoeuvre reserved for heading 3 in the Financial Perspective, which is very restricted. Neither do we wish to haggle over the financing of multi-annual programmes that have already been approved. I would nevertheless like to draw people’s attention to the fact that the opinion of the Committee on Budgets also makes reference to the discrepancy between the Commission proposal and the preparatory actions. It is the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, therefore, that there would seem to be genuine justification for increasing the appropriation, as proposed by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport. Besides, it concerns such a small amount that it will probably go into the margin for error under heading 3.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport would like to stress the importance of school twinning via the Internet. The committee would like both primary and secondary schools to be included. The inclusion of primary schools is, I think, justified for many reasons. Networking via the Internet will provide brand new opportunities for small schools in remote areas to provide an opportunity for international studies and learning foreign languages and foreign cultures. As primary schools cover a whole age group there are good grounds for making such facilities available to them, also to prevent the digital divide, which is the other aim of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">For everyone to be included in the information society it is vital that there is a sufficient number of teachers with information technology skills. The use of computers as a teaching tool is still very limited. In 2002, on average 90% of primary schools had an Internet connection, but only 39% of teachers used the Internet in their teaching.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still considerable differences in the extent to which the Internet is used among different countries, as we have already heard here. They will narrow only if there is action on the part of the Member States. The eLearning Programme at its best will only ever be an undertaking to support the equal utilisation of information technology and provide examples of how it can be used. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would just like to mention three points. It is a good thing that primary education is included in it, but I would also like to argue on behalf of older people and people who live in remote areas. We must not neglect these people. They will benefit from lifelong learning, and they can pass on their knowledge and experience to subsequent generations.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the importance of encouraging twinning between schools. There are great differences – this has already been mentioned – between the various regions within Europe in terms of the level of knowledge and the use of IT in education, and that makes it difficult for schools to work together. I would like once more to emphatically urge that we map out the current situation and also involve candidate Member States in this, because only then will we be able to achieve a more targeted approach for schools that are lagging behind, and this will hugely increase the range of options available.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that it is not only about quantity but also about quality. I expect the private sector, which created the eLearning Industry Group working party, to play a major role. Collaboration between the private and public sectors is, in my opinion, a very good thing. It will enable us to become the most dynamic knowledge economy in the world, and that is what we are aiming for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even since my twins – who are now nine – were at pre-school, they have been showing me again and again how to use a computer, so I think I would need the eLearning Programme more than my children do. Leaving such personal matters to one side, I congratulate this programme, and also the rapporteur, especially on his calls for European software, for more European content and for European services. This is a responsibility for the Fifteen and for the European Union. It is one from which the Council, too, cannot be discharged.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome all the amendments that are intended to foster a critical engagement with the instrument of the Internet, not only on the part of school pupils, but also on the part of their teachers. Whilst much of this is good, there is one point on which, unfortunately, I am unable to agree with you. The digital divide between the Member States is something that the Fifteen – who will soon be joined by another Ten! – must sort out among themselves, but the digital divide in our societies is a matter of concern for all of us. I do think that, in order to be consistent with your Amendment No 10, we should stick to the Commission proposal as to how the funds are to be divided up. We consider that to be a more equal and more balanced allocation of funding. I am sorry, but with so little time available to me, I cannot go into greater detail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I remember the time 20 or 30 years ago when we were asked at school to outline what we thought the twenty-first century would be like, and we all imagined Martians, UFOs and flying saucers and ultra-modern trains and cars, including electric cars, yet no one was able to guess what would be the real revolution of this century: the advances in information and communications technology. Even though it is very difficult to keep up with changes that are taking place at such a dizzying pace, we are obliged to ensure that the citizens of the European Union, especially children and young people, are able to be educated in current technology. This presupposes a cost, since they need computers, multi-media equipment, Internet connections, plus one other very important thing, namely qualified teachers.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot skimp on matters of such vital importance. We need to bear in mind that if, tomorrow when they have reached adulthood, the children of today are unable to use the new technologies, they will be almost like children of our own time who are illiterate, and that is something we cannot allow. By that, I mean I am totally in agreement with the rapporteur that it is necessary, as a priority, to train teachers to be able to give classes in new technologies. I also entirely agree with him that the budget should be more than the EUR 36 million proposed by the European Commission, since it would be truly absurd to spend more money on the preparatory action for a programme than on the programme itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to support e-twinning of European schools since that seems to me to be an excellent way of bringing about cooperation between schools from every corner of Europe. What is more, it will help us promote intercultural dialogue and language learning and will also facilitate exchanges between children who have got to know each other through the new technologies and who would like to meet face to face. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, even if we achieve the increased budget sought in this report, increasing it to EUR 54 million, we will still be only scratching the surface. If we are serious about achieving the objectives outlined in the Lisbon process then clearly not only do we need to increase our budget at European level, but we must also find ways to ensure that Member States actually address the issues seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of the fact, for instance, that teachers in Ireland have acquired skills at their own expense. They have, through their trade union, acquired skills in order to pass them on to their pupils. That is not a satisfactory way of achieving the objectives of the Lisbon process.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the proposal to devote a quarter of the budget to the digital divide. This is an economic issue – ensuring that pupils, when they enter the labour market, are capable of participating in it. It seems obvious also that people without the technical skills required to operate the technology would not only be unable to participate economically, they would be unable to participate in the democratic processes of society. This, surely, is the bottom line in terms of the exclusion of citizens from society.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a clear demand for better computer resources in Irish schools. As I said, 2 500 Irish schoolteachers undertook development programmes in the past year.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support the budget increase. I support the idea of concerted actions between the Commission, the Member States and other partners in the field of education to examine national experiences and to promote best practice regarding the use of eLearning and fighting the digital divide. I know that the proposal will give much-needed impetus to the provision for eLearning in schools. I hope that will be the case in relation to Ireland. I particularly like the idea of e-twinning. I hope this is used to its fullest extent.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it astonishing, given that Ireland depends so much on technology for its economic development and growth, that this area is so badly funded and so badly addressed in current educational policy in Ireland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martens (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council in Lisbon was, at that time, rightly concerned about the international position of Europe and discussed the possibilities of new technologies. The emergence of information and communication technology is of great importance, we can no longer imagine life without it, and it has many implications in many different areas, including education. ICT places new demands on education, and therefore also on teachers. Students must be prepared to participate in the knowledge society. This not only means extra work, however; it can also mean an enrichment for education. After all, it also opens up new opportunities for the transfer of knowledge. We cannot rule out the fact that ICT will require a massive change in the structure of education in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We formulated our first thoughts on <span class="italic">e</span>Learning in 2002. Now we need to elaborate upon these in our working plan. This is an important and ambitious plan to implement a high-quality ICT infrastructure at a reasonable price and in a reasonable period of time in order to improve the quality and accessibility of ICT in education – a massive challenge. Right from the start it was clear that this cannot simply be about making equipment available and being able to operate this equipment. Just as important is how teachers and students are able to use this equipment as an educational tool in the learning process. This brings us to the didactic, pedagogic and educational dimensions of <span class="italic">e</span>Learning. I am glad that attention has been given to this in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, the question ‘what for?’ is also important. Education not only relates to the transfer of knowledge but also to such things as communication skills and social skills, which are important for personal development. It should also contribute to a feeling of citizenship, social involvement and, when it comes to Europe, respect for cultural diversity. Can it also be used for this? Yes. The report offers good points of departure for this, particularly where it talks about making software available, when it talks about content and when it talks about the importance of training teachers.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that this plan is an excellent opportunity for making a young generation familiar with new technologies and that it can promote a new intercultural dialogue, which is so important for Europe. Peace is not something we can take for granted; we have to work on it every day. In Europe we do that via dialogue and cooperation, and that seems to be a good formula. It will, however, also require commitment on the part of a future generation. In order to interest them in this and motivate them, it is important that people get to know each other and understand each other. In order to achieve this, contact across borders, international contact and experience are of great importance. This eLearning programme offers new opportunities in this area. We all know – and it has already been said – how successful exchange programmes are and what tremendous experience schools and students can gain with them. ICT increases the opportunities in this area via virtual campuses, school twinning, via the Internet and by promoting teaching partnerships.

I therefore thank the rapporteur for his excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
