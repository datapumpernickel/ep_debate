I would, however, like to take this opportunity to assess the situation in terms of our relations and to consider the prospects for improving them in the future, within the framework of a European neighbourhood policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out briefly that, following its independence in 1991, bilateral relations with Belarus began to move forward satisfactorily towards the adoption of an association and cooperation agreement and a provisional commercial agreement. Nevertheless, all these negotiations became paralysed as a result of the deterioration of the internal political situation in Belarus in 1996, and regrettably they have not improved since then.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, since 2002, the European Union has been trying hard to bring the issue back to the fore, to try to overcome the situation of deadlock, taking a points-of-reference approach with a view simply to improving our political relations with that country gradually.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, however, the continuous efforts of the Union, the talks, have not yielded any tangible results. Nevertheless, the Union is still prepared to continue making progress provided that there is some movement on the part of the authorities of that country.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also remember that, following the latest enlargement, Belarus has become a direct neighbour – we have shared borders – and, in this regard, it is all the more important to us that it becomes a democratic, stable and prosperous country.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that our proximity can and must manifest itself in the long term through close cooperation and exchange in fields of mutual interest, such as trade, justice, home affairs, transport, energy and the environment. All of this requires fundamental political reforms in that country, however.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say once again that the European Union is deeply concerned about recent developments in Belarus, where all indications are that the situation is deteriorating in terms of respect for the Rule of Law, democracy and human rights, and where we are still seeing how policies relating to independent media – some of which have been closed down – the actions of the government and the forces supporting it with regard to political opposition forces and the situation of independent social organisations and higher education establishments are becoming increasingly difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I must point out that we are also following the debate taking place in the Council of Europe, here in Strasbourg, on the people who have disappeared in Belarus, with the greatest of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the information presented by the European trade union confederations, the Commission has also begun an investigation into alleged violations of freedom of association and of the right to collective negotiation within the framework of the Regulation on the system of generalised preferences. Depending on the conclusions of this investigation, the Union will have to reconsider Belarus’s future access to the benefits of the system of generalised preferences.</p>
<p class="contents">A key element of our policy with regard to that country is support for civil society and for the process of democratisation. In recent years, however, the authorities of that country have refused to apply tax exemption to European Union debt, which undoubtedly hinders the entry of that aid and, therefore, its use and access to it by Belarusian society.</p>
<p class="contents">The authorities of that country are currently registering all the free external aid projects, and in practice this is allowing them to reject any international assistance that they believe goes against their partisan interests.</p>
<p class="contents">So how can we improve our relations with that country in these circumstances? We have developed a European neighbourhood policy in order to continue strengthening our relations with our neighbours, including Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">By means of this policy we believe we will be able to consolidate our efforts to support democratic development in Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make it clear that if fundamental political and economic reforms are carried out, and as soon as they are carried out, Belarus will be able to participate fully in the European neighbourhood policy, with all the advantages that would come with it. Nevertheless, under current circumstances, the minimum conditions required are not in place and we cannot therefore go ahead with this policy in relation to Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">The first important milestone for Belarus will be the parliamentary elections and the referendum scheduled for October. The Union has committed itself to supporting democratic parliamentary elections in the autumn, in coordination with the Office for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and with the Council of Europe. We wish, however, to place the emphasis on the legal framework for the elections, as well as freedom for the media and the conditions under which the campaigns of the different political parties must be carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the OSCE has established a mission of electoral observers for the parliamentary elections. The Union will participate by supporting the election observers and at the same time we will remain in contact with the democratic forces. I must, however, point out that we are very concerned about the referendum called on the modification of the constitution and the repeal of the current limit on presidential mandates.</p>
<p class="contents">We have informed the authorities of that country on several occasions of the consequences that referendum would have in terms of our relations if circumstances do not change.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council approved yesterday are crystal-clear on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the Commission once again wishes to send a clear message to the people of Belarus, letting them know that the Union is not forgetting them. The important thing is that people – in particular those who are fighting for democratic change – do not feel they have no support. Now more than ever it is essential that we continue our work supporting civil society and the democratic forces in that country. Moreover, we have committed ourselves to doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Parliament’s resolution expresses similar causes for concern in Belarus and I am naturally interested in hearing the honourable Members’ opinions about the current evolution of our relations and in particular in considering how we can improve our support, our backing for the democratisation of the country, and therefore our support and backing for Belarusian democratic forces in such a difficult situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These elections acquired added significance last week with the announcement of a referendum to be held at the same time. This is of course an attempt to maintain the authoritarian rule currently in place, but it is also a tremendous chance for the Belarussian nation; a chance for the Belarussian people to be mobilised and to express their own opinions on the state of human rights and democratic standards in Belarus. It is also a challenge for our common foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">There appears to be a need for a more courageous approach in the EU’s foreign policy, and for certain tasks and strategic goals to be reformulated. Not only is it very much in the EU’s interest to keep Belarus an independent state, but Belarus’ independence will remain under threat if it is governed in an undemocratic manner. What is more, it will only seemingly be a stable country, and stability in Eastern Europe will only seemingly be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">Dictatorships generally fall with a bang rather than by means of velvet revolutions. If the EU’s new eastern border is to be safe, it cannot be an iron curtain, let alone a screen behind which the rich and free cower. Our foreign policy on Belarus must be much more active, which means it must differ from our foreign policy to date.</p>
<p class="contents">It was of course right to freeze all programmes under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement after 1996, and it is right to break off contacts with high-ranking officials of the Lukashenko regime, but our policy lacks political will towards Belarussians themselves. I am very pleased that the Commissioner has acknowledged that the aim of the EU’s policy is to support civil society, but together we must develop procedures which prove to be effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy in Belarus will not come about of its own accord, and Belarussians must build it themselves, but our task is to help them, and to do so much more energetically than to date. This help should be targeted at specific social and political groups, as well as at local authorities, non-governmental organisations, schools and young people. Its aim should be to support those who are currently planting the seeds of a civil society and democratic politics. Help should also be given to the democratic opposition, which deserves praise for its recent integration into the 5+ coalition. These are our friends. They speak the same language, they have the same values, they think in the same categories and they believe in Europe. I hope that the future belongs to them and that one day they will sit in this very House.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, a more active and subtle approach is required, which makes it possible to isolate an undemocratic government without isolating society. The government should be isolated in order to provide positive support to the Belarussian people.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as short-term strategy is concerned, there is a need for energetic measures, or in other words the short-term measures to which the Commissioner referred.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the current electoral campaign should be observed very carefully, and there should be a rapid reaction to any irregularities, such as the banning of the Labour Party, an event which has already occurred, as well as to the fact that many candidates are refused registration and opposition representatives are not allowed to sit on electoral committees. This election and referendum are so important that our political group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, is calling in its resolution for an observers’ mission to be sent to Belarus and for a report to be drawn up. We would like this post-election report to also act as an opportunity for a serious discussion on the future shape of the EU’s foreign policy on Belarus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although they may be new neighbours, we are talking about an old problem, one that has been around since 1996, when we, the European Union, first got into an argument with President Lukashenko, the key figure in Belarus. The parliamentary elections of 17 October are around the corner and it is important for us now to turn our attention to the situation in that country. A referendum has also been announced about a possible third term in office for the President. I was fortunate enough to act as chairman of this Parliament’s delegation in Belarus for five years and we have had bad experiences with elections in that country in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">On two occasions, a parliamentary troika of this Parliament, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, had to declare the country’s elections unlawful, and I fear that this will now happen again. It appears once again from all the reports I have received about the run-up to the elections that the opposition is being sabotaged, the opposition candidates are being thwarted and the media are being influenced in an improper manner. That is why it is also important that now, with the elections more than a month away, we in this Parliament should send a message about what we expect, in the hope that we do not need to declare the elections unlawful again. Earlier this year, we made an attempt to breathe new life into the troika of the three parliamentary institutions in order to get it up and running in time for the elections in Belarus, and this House, in particular, was hindered from playing its part, and I personally was declared more or less <span class="italic">persona non grata </span>in that country. It follows that this problem should be solved before this House can send a delegation to act as observers in the elections at all.</p>
<p class="contents">We want the opposition to be given the chance to conduct a campaign in a proper manner. In addition, we want the candidates to be given the freedom to do what they want. The use of government resources to sabotage the opposition and civil society must stop. This change must go hand in hand with an improvement in the climate, which also entails more freedom for trade unions and academics. There are countless examples of how trade unions are being manipulated and infiltrated. Academic institutions trying to work independently are being closed down either temporarily or outright. The flow of subsidies intended to promote freedom in that country is being cut off. Only when all the above changes have happened will we perhaps be able to say, after 17 October, that improvements have finally been made, and that there is at last room for the European Union again to make relations, which have been frozen since 1996, somewhat more open, and to develop more contacts with that country. As I already said, this is possible only if the referendum is cancelled.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard what President Lukashenko is now trying to achieve via a referendum, one in which the population will undoubtedly again be manipulated in all kinds of ways, as some kind of constitutional <span class="italic">coup d’état</span>. To guarantee a third term in office would be a step in the direction of a system which cannot be described as other than authoritarian, as is already the case. We must endeavour to ensure that Europe’s last dictatorship, which is what we generally tend to call these, is brought to an end, and that on that basis, we can actually establish a new neighbourliness policy with that country. I hope that the elections will be a step in the direction of Europe, but I fear that they will rather be a step in the direction of a yet more authoritarian system. I share the Commissioner’s pessimism about this development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The dictator Lukashenko is clinging desperately to power, and he has now announced a referendum in order to extend his term of office for an unlimited period. Mr Wiersma talked of a constitutional <span class="italic">coup d’état</span>, and that is precisely what this is. He appears to want to follow in the footsteps of another dictator, Fidel Castro, who is equally past his sell-by date. With the systematic and hardly sophisticated system of electoral fraud devised by Lukashenko’s regime, there is unfortunately not very much to suggest that either the referendum or the election on 17 October will in any way be fair. This means that Lukashenko can remain where he is, while his people become ever poorer and ever more isolated.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of course shameful that we in Europe have a Communist dictatorship as our closest neighbour. In spite of countless attempts to influence the regime using the carrot and stick method, we have failed, and failed totally. Trying to cooperate with the regime has been a pointless and fruitless exercise, and the country is thus miles away from embracing the values we defend. Freedom of expression is minimal. Human rights campaigners and opponents of the regime are oppressed and persecuted. Peaceful demonstrators are arrested, tortured and given prison sentences following trials that smack of nothing more than farce. Belarus is the only country in Europe that executes its prisoners. There is extensive trafficking in women. We find thousands of Belorussian women on many of the streets of Europe. Many people who have called the regime into question have disappeared in mysterious circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Belarus is our neighbour, however, and we cannot abandon the Belorussian people to their fate. Just like everyone else, they are entitled to freedom and democracy. Just as the Commissioner says, we in Parliament, the Council and the Commission must therefore try to find ways of giving economic, political and, especially, moral support to the courageous people and organisations that, in spite of everything, exist and fight for democracy, human dignity and the principles of the constitutional state. The official pressure must be intensified. We must demand that observers also be allowed to monitor this illegitimate referendum. My group would like to see Parliament send observers on 17 October.</p>
<p class="contents">Our new Member States have not only afforded us geographical proximity to Belarus, but also knowledge of that country and of its history. It is important to use this knowledge and to be creative in finding ways of supporting the forces of democracy in Belarus. Many people see Europe in terms of hope for a better future and of the opportunity for, and possibility of, a new life. We must of course preserve the dream that, one day, a democratic and open Belarus, operating a market economy, might also become a member of the European Union.</p>

As Mr Wiersma said, it has been like that for years.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we have been keeping our eye on Belarus for years, it is one of the reunited Europe’s failures that we have not been able to prevent a dictatorship of dark and Stalinist stamp on its own doorstep. Contrary to what the President of Belarus says on his country’s television networks, which all toe the party line, his power brings the people no security, but rather fear and terror. He rules through state-sponsored contract-killers and by using strong-arm tactics such as those of silencing all opposition, criminalising commitment to civil society, and banning the free expression of opinion. The list could be made much longer, as you know. It will be very difficult for Belarus to find its way back to democracy, and it is in that light that the referendum should be seen. In order to keep his hands on his personal power, he chose the day of the parliamentary elections, the day when democracy could have returned to the country, to demand a vote of confidence in him, as a distraction from the real issues, the real questions that the people are asking, as to why things are getting worse and worse while the situation in the neighbouring countries is improving, why it is that they cannot share in the neighbouring states’ prosperity, why the consequences of Chernobyl are denied, why aid projects are banned, why health care is being cut back and why experts collecting data to enable help to be given are put behind bars. Even eighteen years after the event, Chernobyl’s consequences have not been dealt with and many of the people are exposed to radioactive contamination.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the dictator Lukashenko’s latest action, the shutting-down of the humanist university in Minsk. It was the last university to maintain and teach liberal and European values, and it was closed down in the teeth of opposition from the students and the people. For that reason, we must not be silent; we must protest, for this is yet another course of action driving the genuinely pro-European elite out of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, Commissioner – and this is where I agree with the first speaker – that the European Union is open to the accusation of not having done enough to drag Belarus out of the black hole of self-isolation, and we know why; our instruments are inadequate. Even the new instruments that you are proposing as part of the Neighbourhood Policy are nothing like enough to deal with this special problem. You have ignored Parliament’s proposals for setting up special programmes for this with other options and financed in other ways, enabling us at last to take the action that is urgently needed, such as, for example, the development of civil society and the strengthening of a free press.</p>
<p class="contents">Last of all, let me mention my friend – my best friend in Belarus – Viktor Gonchar, who, as you all know, was one of the victims of the contract killers. While I believe that we should do more to get the murderers punished and his death fearlessly investigated, we should also carry forward his vision of a democratic Belarus, one that allows its people to share in Europe’s progress and prosperity.</p>

This is the second time I have taken part in a debate on Belarus, the first having been as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and I must confess that I have never lost hope. The EU institutions have the right to express their opinions on remarkable or even exceptional events and situations, and it is therefore natural for them to also pay particular attention to Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">Belarus is a state in an exceptional situation. It is one of Europe’s youngest states, with a political elite inexperienced in statehood. It is a country where administrative borders have changed into state borders, thus dividing families, an economy and a culture. Such a state merits not only particular attention, but also exceptional help. In my opinion, one of the worst possible ways of providing help in such a situation would be excessive criticism of the government and unreserved support for the opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, the aim should not be to topple the government, but to help the people of Belarus. What do we know about the opposition, which some of our colleagues, in all respect, are endeavouring to bring to power? Will it not be worse at governing the country than the current government? What do we know of the real wishes of the Belarussian people? Maybe they want a nationalist government, or anti-Russian policies, or merely more democracy and prosperity in their own country and the closest possible cooperation with their large and rapidly developing neighbour? I do not believe that we know the answers to these questions.</p>
<p class="contents">In its present composition, this House is only just starting to grow accustomed to its duties and responsibilities. The worst possible start would be to succumb to ideological prejudice and to pass judgment on the basis of the way in which our emotions are guided by the mass media. We were not elected to this House in order to pass judgments without allowing the other side the right to defend itself. We were not elected to make a fuss merely because we do not like someone or because television reports and newspaper editorials have painted a negative picture of them. We were not elected to set Europe against itself. We are in this House in order to put in place the conditions for mutual understanding, or in other words not to isolate people, but to conduct dialogue. On this point I agree with my friend and colleague Bogdan Klich.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the proposal for Parliament to send a delegation to Belarus made up of representatives from all political groups, and I hope it will be able to establish the opinions of politicians, the public and experts. Then we will be able to say what the situation in Belarus is like without using double standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Belarussian people will elect their parliamentary representatives and decide on the form which the Constitution should take. Voices have been heard from all over the world questioning the integrity of the Belarussian state authorities and the results of the elections in advance, although we will only know the results after 17 October. It is taken as read that democratic principles will be violated. I believe that questioning the integrity of elections and referendums before voting has taken place is also incompatible with the spirit of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are entitled to observe the situation and must do so, but must not pass judgments ahead of time. In addition, I doubt whether a structure which is as undemocratic as we believe the European Union and its bureaucratic institutions to be has the moral right to judge the level of democracy and decisions of a sovereign nation to be undemocratic. Is the European Union competent to reprimand independent states?</p>
<p class="contents">There is an ancient maxim which says <span class="italic">Medice cura te ipsum</span>, that means physician, heal thyself. The European Union wishes to impose the Constitutional Treaty on free nations, even though in such instances the mandatory national referendums approving the Treaty are not required. Where is the democracy in such cases? Parliament should first guarantee democracy and independence in European countries, and only then issue condemnations and reprimands to others.</p>
<p class="contents">‘You see the mote in your brother’s eye, but you do not see the beam in your own eye’. Pharisees and hypocrites! This is not to say that we should not react to violations of human rights wherever they may occur in the world, but that is not Parliament’s job. It would be like the Congress of the United States of America passing a resolution on democracy in France or Germany, or the Polish Parliament reprimanding the European Parliament. It is not Parliament’s job.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament should therefore not overstep its competences. Democracy is based on respect for the sovereign decisions of nations, irrespective of whether we like them or not. Let us await the results of the elections in Belarus, and then every Member will individually be able to make a judgment. The European Parliament as such does not have the right to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore opposed to Parliament sending any diplomatic missions to Belarus or to it drawing up joint reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite this close proximity, it is a country in which universities and the remaining independent media are being closed down. It is a country where political parties, such as the Labour Party and the Belarussian National Front, are made illegal merely for being in the opposition, regardless of whether they are left or right-wing. Despite all this and despite this proximity we have no guarantee, contrary to what we have heard, that the referendum process and the forthcoming elections will be democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not prejudice, these are facts. People who hold views that differ to those of the official authorities in Belarus are being killed. Media outlets in Belarus are being closed down. Democratic candidates find it difficult to register with electoral committees in Belarus. This is not prejudice.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who can see no difference between the Belarussian opposition and the Government should take note of the fact that it is not the Belarussian opposition which is responsible for the disappearance of individuals or the closure of independent newspapers. Anyone who cannot see this difference should go to Belarus and take a closer look.</p>
<p class="contents">All these things are happening right under the nose of the EU, and the EU therefore bears responsibility for this aspect of its eastern policy. If the EU today is to seek a distinct identity in the field of foreign policy, it must do so whilst not avoiding conflict with its closest allies across the Atlantic. If the EU’s foreign policy is to be based on respect for fundamental rights, Belarus is one of its most crucial responsibilities today. If we do not take action on this issue, our credibility in the debate on the shape of foreign policy will be weakened.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that the Belarussian opposition today must be certain that we have not forgotten it and must be entirely certain that we support it. It is for this reason that President Lukashenko must be certain that his actions will not remain unpunished, and that the Belarussian nation must be certain that its European ambitions will some day receive a genuine answer from our side. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today this concept refers to North Africa, and the EU’s priorities lie with the Maghreb and Mashreq, rather than Belarus or Ukraine. This is bad news, and it means that the gulf between the democratic and wealthy Europe and Eastern Europe can and will deepen. This is not only bad news for them, it is also bad news for the European Union. It is obvious that the situation in Belarus is deteriorating. Newspapers and political parties are being closed down and people imprisoned. Should the EU’s reaction be to turn our back? Are we to be like Pontius Pilate, who washed his hands? Let us not forget the disastrous results which this had 2 000 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Contacts with Minsk should therefore now be stepped up, Mrs De Palacio, not scaled down. Human rights and democratic freedoms must be constantly emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Belarus is becoming ever more grave. President Lukashenko has announced the possibility of restrictions on presidential terms of office being abolished. He may be hoping to become president for life. This is an even more pressing reason not to create a new Berlin Wall on the EU’s new eastern borders, on Poland’s borders with Belarus and with Ukraine. Belarus is not on Mars, it has common borders with the EU. Let us therefore not ask for whom the bell tolls, let us repeat after Ernest Hemingway that it ‘tolls for thee’, for Europe. The EU must take action on the issue of Belarus, we must not remain mere newspaper readers. The proposal to send a special delegation of observers to Belarus, to observe the outcome of the election, should therefore be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the representatives of the Belarussian democratic opposition should be invited to the European Parliament. Passivity on this issue, and pretence that the problem will solve itself is, in the words of Talleyrand, worse than a crime, it is a blunder. The European Union should not act like a certain tribe in Africa which believes that if it does not talk about a problem or a disease, and does not mention its name, the problem will cease to exist. On the contrary, the EU must talk about Belarus and talk details, Mrs de Palacio. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One could say in its favour that unlike some of its neighbours it remains free of inter-ethnic strife. It has also unilaterally renounced its nuclear arsenal, as well as much of its conventional weaponry. Organised crime is low. Rather surprisingly, Belarus is also enjoying a 4% growth rate economically. However, the country is an increasing worry to the EU, having deteriorated into authoritarianism and repression of human and linguistic rights, while opposition political parties are now suffering harassment ahead of the referendum and parliamentary elections on 17 October.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, the Belarus House of Assembly is barely recognisable in western terms as a freely-elected Parliament. The election of President Lukashenko in 1994 led initially to the hope that authority would be upheld, corruption rooted out and the economy put back on track. Yet this has not happened, because the Soviet-style approach resulted in the re-introduction of the economic model of central control leading to clientelism and interventionism in all aspects of public life. He now seeks the right, through the referendum, to become President for life.</p>
<p class="contents">Private enterprise in Belarus functions poorly and the bulk of financial investment comes from Russia after a promising but short-lived start, particularly in the SME sector. The effects of the Chernobyl disaster are still of grave consequence and something like a quarter of the country is still contaminated by radioactive fall-out.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2001 Lukashenko won 75% support, although the OSCE declared that the election had failed to comply with its minimum standards. Nevertheless, no one actually disputes his victory. Leading opposition figures have been arrested and beaten, and a few have disappeared, although – mysteriously – some have reappeared. Two years ago three journalists were sentenced to three years of hard labour for slandering the President. Many Belarussians support eventual EU membership for their country, although if asked they also claim to support union with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Lukashenko would ideally like to build an eastern pan-Slavic bloc hostile to the West. However, especially since President Putin came to office, Russia has responded by seeking to partly distance itself from Belarus. A Russia-Belarus state union treaty was ratified in 1999, but in practice it has been largely ignored, while the single rouble currency union has been deferred to 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The municipal elections in March 2003 showed that some favourable political developments have taken in Belarus. They showed that the democratic opposition parties have been afforded greater freedom and fairer treatment. The EU should respond to Belarus accordingly by stepping up western contacts with pro-democracy parliamentarians who are willing to challenge the regime and are dedicated to making the country a fully-fledged member of the international community, and as such eventually entitled to a partnership and cooperation agreement with the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Experience from Spain, Greece and Portugal suggests that given time and economic growth the transition from dictatorship to free market democracy is achievable everywhere in Europe.</p>

We show our greatest solidarity towards the Labour Party of Belarus and towards the National Front. The way the government is treating them is not acceptable in today’s society. Our appeal must be one of goodwill. I am convinced, as I think many of you are, that in every organisation in every country there are people of goodwill who know how to distinguish good from evil. I appeal to such persons, especially within the authorities of Belarus and its government to work and do so with all means at their disposal to see that democracy rules. We must be aware that the present situation in Belarus is also our responsibility, due to what we did or what we did not do. We must ensure that the policy that we adopt from now on will not be a reactive one, not one of embargos which, experience shows us, is hardly effective, but one that is pro-active. It must not be a sporadic one but one taken in the framework of a neighbourhood policy, the need for which is felt more now than ever before.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Neither the carrot nor the stick appears to have any impact whatsoever on regimes such as that in Belarus, and that is unfortunately also true of certain countries in Asia, Africa and America. This shows that double standards do not apply here. On the one hand, the impression is created that this debate is rather pessimistic, since many speakers have been forced to recognise our powerlessness to bring about constructive changes in Belarus. This does not mean, however, that we need to give up. Various speakers have indicated the way forward. We need to join forces with civil society, and the population of Belarus must be able to elect their representatives in a free, transparent and honest manner. In addition, NGOs trying to uphold values such as democracy and human rights in the face of adversity must be supported. The object of the whole exercise is to give the people a chance to share in Europe’s wealth and prosperity. The Commission and Council can count on our unqualified support in further efforts to bring about changes for the good. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a well-known fact that this geographical closeness does not exactly run parallel to political like-mindedness. A week ago to the day, the Belarusian President Lukashenko highlighted this chasm by issuing a decree to legitimise and consolidate his authoritarian presidency via the ballot box even after 2006. In just over one month, on 17 October, this constitutional change could be a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span>. This predictable development does nothing to simplify relations between Brussels and Minsk. Since Belarus constitutes an important passage for energy and other supplies of goods from Russia to EU Member States, Lukashenko and his repressive regime are in a strong position. Incidentally, over the years, it has appeared immune to direct international efforts towards gradual democratisation and reform. Lukashenko's undeniable ambition to stay in power will, if anything, reinforce this trend in time to come. What impact can the European institutions have in Belarus? Indeed, is not the present leaders’ self-imposed political isolation from the West complete?</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, we do not need to leave Belarusian society at the mercy of Lukashenko’s unbridled thirst for power. This undoubtedly difficult path is pointed out in a German study published this summer. Change in Belarus can only be successful in the medium term by promoting that country’s own initiatives from the bottom up. There is indeed a glimmer of light here, because despite the grave circumstances of the past few years, to date, some 2 500 registered civil organisations have managed to hold their own. This was definitely made easier by long-term contact with foreign partners. With hundreds of initiatives, Germany is in the lead here. How does the Commission view this way out of the political impasse between the European Union and Belarus? It is certainly a long-term effort involving many risks. What is inspiring, though, is the honourable object, the general well-being of the Belarussian population, with the active involvement of civil society and, if possible, both local and regional authorities. I would like to ask the Commission once again whether it considers this a viable option and if so, what practical action it intends to initiate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, such an opportunity – to speak one's own language freely – is denied to Lithuania's closest neighbours, now neighbours of the European Union – 10 million Belorussians. There is a nation quite close to the geographical centre of Europe, which is not allowed to speak its native language in either schools or universities. Even more – it is denied freedom of speech and liberty of conscience. I speak of an imprisoned nation at the centre of Europe, in a country which is ruled by Europe's last dictator, who on 17 October by means of a fictitious referendum plans to extend his dictatorship for life, and who sees Hitler's regime as one of the best in Europe. We believe that the European Union's continued policy with regard to eastern neighbours has to be expressed not only in the condemnation of this regime, with general declarations, which do not have more concrete consequences, but also in concrete support for those democratic opposition forces, which are spreading the ideas of democracy and pluralism by non-violent means, so that the Belorussian nation might live in a country which recognises human rights and freedom. This is why my colleague Mr Szymañski and I move to endorse a draft resolution submitted in the name of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group and in this context call for the Sacharov Prize to be awarded to those who will decide the future of Belarus - the opposition youth movement ‘Zubr’, as a symbol of all forces disobeying the regime and determining the future of a free Belarus.

<p class="contents">As we know, the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, politically isolated by western states because of human rights violations and restrictions on media freedom, is using all means to attain a third presidential term in the elections for a head of state to be held in 2006. The question, which is to be presented in a referendum scheduled for 17 October, is formulated in very simple and clear terms for the citizens of Belarus: 'Will you allow the first President of the Republic, Alexander Lukashenko, to participate as a presidential candidate in the elections for a head of state?' Unquote. Lukashenko explains this to the people of Belarus in equally simple and understandable language. Quote: 'As I promised you before, if I decide to participate in the 2006 presidential elections, I will definitely consult you and ask for your permission - this is what I am doing now,' he said on Belorussian state television. Today, as previously in the European Parliament, many cases of human rights violations have been mentioned, along with evidence of restrictions on press freedom, and the banning of university and non-government organisations. However, the people of Belarus know little of our concern for their situation, their life. If they manage to reach Belarus, statements on this subject by leaders of the European Parliament and other institutions in the democratic world are distorted, they are presented to the citizens of Belarus as the will of global capitalism, as attempts to dictate to Belorussians how they should live.</p>
<p class="contents">Information which Belorussians find on the internet, to which they do have access, is less censored, however the level of computerisation in that country is poor, and so a large part of society is fed state propaganda. We must see that objective information reaches the citizens of Belarus via channels which they are accustomed to.</p>
<p class="contents">I propose: that in approving the European Union's budget for 2005, we must find funds to broadcast radio, perhaps also television programmes in Belorussian and Russian, which could be compiled with the help of Belorussian journalists [...] and could be broadcast from the neighbouring states - Lithuania and Poland - as was done until 2001. A few million Litai each year from the European Union's budget certainly will not bankrupt the European Union, but in my opinion, would be a more effective means of strengthening civil, democratic initiatives and traditions than sending a delegation from the European Parliament to observe the elections, carry out monitoring and record the de facto situation.

Up until now we have mainly talked about what cannot be done. I would therefore ask the Commissioner to make a note of three things that can be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, diplomats from the EU Member States can be instructed to monitor the pre-election situation in Belarus and to inform the EU institutions, including the European Parliament, on a weekly basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Commission officials can be ordered to conduct urgent political consultations with states with which the EU maintains contacts, in particular with the United States and Russia, with regard to the development of the pre-election situation in Belarus and to defining the scope of joint appraisals. As an MEP I would also like to be kept informed on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, financial assistance can be provided for young people in Belarus who wish to study abroad, for example in Poland, and for small businesses that wish to develop outside the Lukashenko administration’s sphere of influence. This third point requires only a small amount of money, but it requires a great deal of courage, and I hope that the Commission will not lack this courage.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have something to say to the speaker who could see no difference between Cuba and Belarus. Here is a difference that is worth remembering: Cubans escape at night on boats to the United States and die <span class="italic">en route</span>. Belarussians travel by car to Poland, that is, to the European Union, in order to find jobs and return to Belarus. That difference is certainly worth remembering. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To tell the truth, I am not particularly optimistic about the success of this mission, because as Josef Stalin once said, ‘it’s not who votes that counts, it’s who counts the votes’, and a decision has already been taken on how the votes will be counted.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the situation requires our constant attention, as it is becoming worse and worse. There is no rule of law in Belarus, only the rule of those who simply exploit the law. One result of this, amongst others, is the abolition of independent education, and the European Humanities University has already been mentioned. I would also like to mention the closure of the Kolas Lyceum, the only secondary school in Minsk in which lessons are held exclusively in Belarussian.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, what we are witnessing in Belarus is quite simply a regression to a quasi-Soviet state. Official ideology rules in the country. Ladies and gentlemen, there is such a thing as an official Belarussian ideology, and there are high commissioners in each of the institutions and high-ranking executives responsible for ideology. This has resulted in the return of practices which are completely incomprehensible to us, in the light of recent developments in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely essential that the European Union take more active measures in this matter. It is also extremely important to involve our neighbours, both near and far, in these measures, and I would like to return to a comment made by Mr Siwiec, namely that we should take advantage of all existing opportunities to exert influence jointly on Belarus. These opportunities include Russia, and in particular the democratic Russia which is unfortunately in retreat, but still exists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Now the whole democratic world has received a provocation from Mr Lukashenko. A referendum is under way to allow him to prolong his dictatorship. We can predict that the dictatorship will succeed, as the democratic opposition has been deprived of its rights and silenced behind prison walls.</p>

As a result, it poses a threat not just to the people of Belarus but also to the neighbouring democracies. Why is Belarus’s partner, Russia, not concerned about this? Was this a problem discussed with Mr Putin by Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schröder in Sochi?</p>

The isolation of Belarus has become more obvious and, at the same time, less sustainable. With EU enlargement, Belarus has become a neighbouring country of the EU, giving cause for increased contacts in those areas where such contacts are possible. Right now, it is, however, unlikely that contacts will be improved as long as there is no decisive turnaround in the policy conducted in Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">This applies above all to the distribution of power, the constitution, increased opportunities for the opposition to operate freely and the protection of human rights. So far, there have been few indications of such a change. That distribution of power that is central to a democracy is at present absent from Belarus. Changes to the election process before the autumn parliamentary election on 17 October are thus necessary. Not only, however, is Belarus to elect a new parliament on 17 October, but President Lukashenko has also announced that a special referendum on a change to the constitution is to take place. The referendum is about changing the constitution to extend his own period of office. That is unacceptable from a democratic point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Ever since Lukashenko took office as president in 1994, he has been dictatorial in strengthening his position in that role. If there is a majority in favour of this latest attempt to remove the limit on the number of terms of office a president is allowed to serve, this means that, in all likelihood, Lukashenko will serve for at least another five years. If I have calculated correctly, that will make for an uninterrupted period of 17 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Together, we must act to bring about increased support for democratic development in Belarus and must combat that isolation of Belorussian society and of the Belorussian people that many have talked about. The EU must continue to support human rights and the development of a pluralistic society, to oppose trafficking in, and violence against, women and to further civil, democratic society. It is also of the utmost importance that the whole of the international community be alert and supportive prior to the presidential election in order to show that this is something of significance, that we are concerned that Belarus develop in a democratic direction and that, as a number of people have said, we support the people of Belarus. We must not turn our backs on the Belorussian people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must try to improve the functioning and capacity of our support and therefore improve the capacity of any political measures we adopt with a view to applying pressure in order to promote the democratisation of Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that parts of the Berlin Wall, which has come down right across Europe, should remain on a border with the European Union. There remain certain fragments, in Belarus for example, and if one of the objectives of European Union action and presence at world level is to support democratisation and defend human rights, that objective and concern clearly become all the more important in the case of an immediate neighbour, in other words, on our own border.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that we in the Commission cannot accept Mr Czarnecki’s assertion that we are only concerned about the Mediterranean and not about Eastern Europe. How can you say we have not worried about Eastern European when, amongst other things, we have carried out an enlargement involving eight Eastern European countries, and within three years two more Eastern European countries will join. When you see Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and other Mediterranean countries becoming members of the European Union, then I will accept that we are more concerned about the Mediterranean, but that is not the case now. All we are offering the Mediterranean is a neighbourhood policy – it is our southern flank – and if you consider the demographic figures, you will see that, although you may be in Poland, what happens in the Mediterranean affects you considerably. If, moreover, you are in Poland – that is to say, in the European Union – the Mediterranean is your problem, not just a problem for the Italians, the Maltese, the Cypriots, the Spanish, the Portuguese or the French. The Mediterranean is your problem as a Pole and as a Member of the European Union. Let us not confuse our values nor our objectives and priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Eastern Europe, Europe – there is a reason why we call ourselves the European Union – is also our priority. So much so that we have been able to enlarge, to grow – and we are continuing to do so now – and there has not yet been any talk of closing those borders. So let us see things as they really are.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the various suggestions, I will refer firstly to the possibility of participating as observers in the forthcoming referendum and elections in Belarus. I would like firstly to point out that the Belarusian Government has only invited the OSCE to participate as an observer – specifically its Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights – and that this Parliament has not been invited officially.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is prepared to work together with the OSCE, which has been invited to attend as an observer solely at the parliamentary elections, not the referendum, which we believe it should also be invited to. We believe it to be important that that monitoring be extended to the referendum. Furthermore, we are going to continue working to ensure that the number of observers is increased and, possibly, that Members of this European Parliament can also participate. We must remember that this is not currently the case and that we need to be invited in order to participate in this type of activity.</p>
<p class="contents">The next issue raised by certain speakers relates to the idea that our actions until now have not been sufficiently effective, that they are not producing results and that we should be much more active. We in the Commission are prepared to promote that activity, but we must appreciate that there are limits.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, some of you have said that spiritual assistance is not enough and that what is needed is financial assistance. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out that there is currently assistance for Belarus for promoting democratisation, as well as shaping and strengthening civil society, but we wish to increase that assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will maintain its aid in support of civil society and democratisation, regional and humanitarian cooperation, neighbourhood programmes and measures for facilitating movement in border areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, the European Union’s TACIS programme provides for EUR 10 million for 2005-2006 and will focus on supporting that civil society, cooperating in the field of higher education and alleviating the consequences of the Chernobyl accident which unfortunately was not so much an accident as a disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also point out that the European initiative for democracy and human rights will play a very active role in Belarus in the coming years. Specifically, in 2005-2006 the candidates in Belarus will be able to request aid within the framework of two campaigns we are going to launch, aimed at promoting the culture of human rights and promoting democratic processes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, emphasise – and I said this at the beginning of my speech in this debate – that the authorities of Belarus are placing administrative obstacles in the way of all the programmes for this type of assistance we are proposing, and we must be able to overcome this resistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to certain more specific issues, is it possible to collaborate with regional or even local governments? Yes, provided that the national authorities of Belarus do not prevent us from ensuring that current funds reach their destination. Are there any funds? Yes, and furthermore the ceiling available is not being used because of the problems I am referring to, caused by the Belarusian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We are worried about the closure of newspapers, the restriction of freedom of expression, persecution – in some cases of opposition elements – and the outlawing of political parties – we have naturally protested and are continuing to protest. In this regard, the Council of General Affairs Ministers – that is to say the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the 25 States of the Union – yesterday issued a protest at the development of the situation in Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">We protested at the closure of universities – specifically the University of Minsk– and we will continue to do so, but we must be aware of how far we can go, and that limit is largely set by the authorities of Belarus, which is clearly not a democracy but rather a dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe, ladies and gentlemen, that we must make use of the family relations between Belarusian citizens and citizens of European Union countries to promote the European Union’s ideology, which is the ideology of freedom, of human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that we must promote political cooperation between political parties as much as possible and, to this end – as I have said – there are funds, there are possibilities, and this Parliament and its Members have a role to play. We must be aware that things are not easy, that it does not appear that the latest measures taken by the Lukashenko regime are going to improve the situation, but we must nevertheless have faith in the citizens of Belarus. It is not, moreover, a question of telling its citizens they are going to become members of the European Union, as I heard some honourable Members say a moment ago. It will be they who decide in the future whether to go ahead with their strategic alliance or reunification with their neighbour Russia. We cannot get into that kind of argument, which could create more tension.</p>
<p class="contents">The main objective is the full democratisation of Belarus, economic support to promote that democratisation, and then, once that democratisation is achieved through our neighbourhood policy, support for development and economic recovery and the improvement of living conditions in that country, which is a European country and a neighbour of the European Union.</p>
