<p class="contents">Over the coming years we will do much together that could help shape the world in which we live. This is a unique chance to address a unique phenomenon. Managing the impact of globalisation, both at home and across the world, represents an unprecedented challenge. If we get it right, we can offer billions of people a decent chance in life, tackling extreme poverty, fighting disease and hunger, promoting good governance and supporting development and inclusion, with the structures and financial means to bring them about. If we fail, we will sow the seeds of continuing injustice, division and instability. That is why this Commission has proposed a programme which is as relevant to Europe as it is to our partners around the world. It is designed to spread prosperity, strengthen solidarity and offer security.</p>
<p class="contents">We must offer an internal and an external response. Inside the Union, we must boost cohesion and deliver the full potential of our recent and future enlargements. Through our social agenda we must continue to fight exclusion and poverty; we must help more people find work in a dynamic and growing economy; and we must change attitudes and behaviour, supporting our goal of sustainable development by taking ambitious action. Outside the Union, we must pursue the Millennium Development Goals with renewed energy and imagination. Creating this fresh momentum is a key goal of our ongoing review of sustainable development, ensuring that our internal and external actions are better coordinated.</p>
<p class="contents">As Europeans, our shared values and experience can be a major force for improving the quality of life of billions of people around the globe. Our unique model of cooperation is inspiring regional cooperation, for example the development of the African Union. It ensures that our voice is listened to when it comes to reforming international institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, the Kyoto Protocol entered into force. Kyoto is a good example of our ability to bring a European perspective to helping shape developments at a global level. Kyoto and the Millennium Development Goals also highlight the dilemma we face. We must deliver effective action at a global level, but we must also drum up wide support for our proposed action among countries and civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the new reality of global governance that is taking shape. It is defined as much by our formal gatherings in the WTO, the World Bank, the G8 as by the more informal settings provided by the World Social Forum or the World Economic Forum. That is why I welcome our debate today.</p>
<p class="contents">Both Porto Alegre and Davos stand as symbols of one real benefit of globalisation: our ability to engage in continued dialogue at an international level with regard to the type of society we want. This possibility is giving more people a voice in shaping our future. While such meetings do not necessarily set a political agenda, they act as a sounding board for a broad spectrum of public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me elaborate on the events in Davos and Porto Alegre. This year, I participated in the event at Davos; next year I hope the Commission will be able to join the 150 000 people attending the World Social Forum. Fortunately, in Davos I was able to talk about Porto Alegre in detail with President Lula of Brazil, a good friend of mine. I have great respect for his vision and commitment to making globalisation work and reducing global disparities. Our discussions gave me a sense of the mood in Porto Alegre. One thing which struck me above all else is how the agenda of both gatherings are tending to converge. Davos was not a hotbed of neo-liberalism, nor was Porto Alegre simply an anti-Davos demonstration.</p>
<p class="contents">Among other issues, the discussions focused on the fight against poverty, the situation in Africa, the role of trade and economic dynamism in spreading prosperity and opportunity, the need for a sustainable path for global development and the challenges of global security. I could draw a number of lessons from what I heard.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we should not deny that, while the agenda are converging, the two audiences are looking at the issues involved from different angles. Nevertheless, the representation of civil society is increasing in the World Economic Forum, and there is a broadening range of participants in the World Social Forum.</p>
<p class="contents">I took two key messages away with me from Davos. First, we must act together to solve global problems ranging from poverty and development to climate change. I was proud to see that European leaders such as Jacques Chirac, Tony Blair and Gerhard Schröder were ready to set the pace. They took the initiative to propose some important ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we need to light the flame of economic dynamism to stimulate reform around the world, not as a goal in itself, but as the best means of offering more people the chance of a decent life. We can turn globalisation into an advantage. European leadership is required to face the challenges arising from globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Europe can do a lot, but we can certainly achieve more if we are able to act together with other partners to address global challenges. This is the message that I will pass on to President George Bush tomorrow. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must find the means to ensure that the commitment of the participants in the World Economic Forum and the World Social Forum bears fruit. Europe must provide a link between the very different perceptions of the possible consequences of globalisation. In this regard, I would like to respond in several ways.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the European Union is, and must remain, an ambitious player on the world stage. It is the largest integrated market. Its gross domestic product is the largest in the world and it is the world's top player in international trade. We, the European Union, are the largest provider of international aid and, as the tsunami tragedy has demonstrated, we are prepared to show solidarity. Thanks to the euro in particular, we are a key partner in the field of international financial relations. We must use our network of bilateral relations to move things forward, to encourage change and to promote respect for fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, if we acknowledge that we are a world player and that our ambition is to play a decisive role, we must champion an effective form of multilateralism. We must continue to promote the development of a world order founded upon the rule of law, but that rule of law must not just serve the interests of the rich western countries. We must demonstrate solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we are expressing our commitment to the United Nations, our determination to seek creative international solutions in order to improve prospects in Africa – as I have said, Africa will be our priority – and our desire to promote the quick completion of the Doha development round.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Union must mobilise a wide range of political instruments aimed at improving the fate of our neighbours in the world. We must take the best advantage of the new possibilities offered to us by the Constitution thanks to the creation of the post of foreign affairs minister and of a European foreign action service.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, also focus our attention on the priorities and achieve concrete results. These objectives will be reflected in the initiatives we take, such as reviewing the European Union's approaches to sustainable development and preparing the review of the Millennium development objectives. They are objectives that already form an integral part of the European Union's partnership for growth and employment, which I launched at the beginning of this month.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude now. The European Union is a world player. We must accept that responsibility. We must contribute actively to defining the new world order and enhance international governance founded upon the rule of law. Europe has a very specific contribution to make. We must strengthen the European Union as a civil power. We must ensure that the ideas of peace and democracy and the principles of the market economy are disseminated throughout the world: the principles of open societies. We have the instruments needed to make a real difference.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must, therefore, respond to the hopes placed in us both by our citizens and by our international partners, whether it be in Davos or in Porto Alegre. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are facing challenges from China, India, Brazil and other countries. We have heard a clarion call from the President asking us to throw out the old models and to create new ones in order to compete.</p>
<p class="contents">In that context I want to say that we agree that the World Economic Forum was a tremendous success, as global representatives from governments, businesses and civil society managed to agree on a coherent set of principles for action: matching global trade with sustainable development. Many of these – such as concrete measures to liberalise trade and accelerate aid to the poorest countries – will be of great benefit in helping to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate all those involved in the World Economic Forum.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, however, and less diplomatically than the President of the Commission, I must also make some remarks about the World Social Forum, which proved to be something of a disappointment by comparison. Poverty reduction is the largest of the Millennium Development Goals and, as one main aim of the World Social Forum's participants, one would have expected the Forum to produce some concrete recommendations as to how this might be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet even journalists who were generally in favour of the World Social Forum had to admit that its basic objective was not to produce a unified document suggesting concrete ideas for fear of spoiling the diversity of opinions, and that the resulting proposals contain many contradictions. We in the European Parliament respect diversity and want to hear the views of world social experts as part of our commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. But, logically, we cannot do both simultaneously – one thing and its opposite. I would, therefore, call for more unified proposals from the World Social Forum in the hope of achieving those goals more rapidly and without wasting further time.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard I was also disappointed that, as the President of the Commission said, although we are the largest economy there were very few people from the European Parliament in the World Economic Forum. Do the people who are arranging these matters consider that the elected representatives of the people of Europe are also important in the decision-making process of the World Economic Forum? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it is a sign of recognition by this House of the World Social Forum which, when it was created in 2001, was portrayed by many as an ineffective gathering for challenging globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, social forums and the movements that promote them have revolutionised the debate on globalisation. They have popularised many issues and positive proposals which are now debated in all international bodies including, increasingly, within the World Economic Forum in Davos. When I say that, I am thinking about access to global public assets, the creation of global taxes, the cancellation of debt, the reform of the international financial institutions and the latter’s need for transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that one of the other important contributions of the social forums has been to root the challenge to liberal globalisation, to the economic and social injustices it creates and to its often destructive consequences for the ecological balance of the planet, not in the false belief that national or sovereigntist solutions had to be found, and not in a rejection of the very idea of globalisation, but in the view that globalisation and its rules and institutions must be transformed, in order to allow for a different kind of globalisation, a globalisation of solidarity, of democratic triumphs and of human rights, a globalisation that guarantees the right of all peoples to development, justice and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">For the European Union, this new world civil society is a source of support, because its aspirations coincide with objectives that the Union has established for itself at international level. However, it is not enough to take pleasure in its emergence. Our policies and decisions should reflect its demands and its aspirations in practical ways. So we must demonstrate that Europe can make a difference, as you have said. We must demonstrate – and we are doing so in certain fields, such as with the Kyoto Protocol, which you have mentioned – that we really are able to transform international policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In the social field, as in other fields, such as those we have just been talking about, declarations of love are not enough; we also need demonstrations of love. Today, 21 Member States have not yet fulfilled their promise to provide 0.7% of gross domestic product in development aid. A global tax is today being discussed. I am pleased about that, and many Member States have signed the New York declaration of September 2004, but unfortunately the reticence of some nations is being used as an excuse not to take any decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, therefore, like to make the following proposal: that the Union, by means of the Commission, should help those Member States that wish to commit themselves by means, if necessary, of enhanced cooperation, so that they do not remain blocked by the reticence of some nations to implement, from now on, a tax dedicated to international development funding. It could be used in the fight against AIDS, because a recent Council document indicates that, if nothing is done between now and 2010, a fifth of the active population in five of the developing countries most affected is going to disappear. Take the initiative, Mr President of the Commission. Show that Europe can indeed move on from statements to actions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The global elite from the business, political and academic communities made it clear that they are fully aware of their responsibility for the problems in the world and that they are willing to act. Bono, the lead singer of the Irish band U2, summed this up very succinctly: if you want money and if you want help, he said, you must talk to those who can give money and provide help. What makes the Davos meeting so important and so useful is that it brings these very people together. The same cannot necessarily be said of the World Social Forum, and the outcome of the latter, I believe, is also far more open to criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">It may have surprised the critics to learn that the main topics in Davos were Africa, problems relating to the worldwide growth of poverty, how to shape the globalisation process in such a way that everyone derives some benefit from it and how to bring about fair world trade. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are convinced that free trade is the best development aid. Free trade is what helps countries that want to develop, and free trade is also what motivates developing countries to become increasingly competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should lead the way here. In particular, it should put free trade on the agenda, especially in areas where trade barriers still exist, namely areas covered by its agricultural policy. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are also vehemently opposed to the introduction of any global tax on financial transactions. Making ourselves poorer in this way would not help the poor to become richer. It is also illusory to believe that solidarity is fostered by introducing new taxes, in other words by imposing what is tantamount to a financial penalty on those who are actually supposed to help.</p>
<p class="contents">No, the real way to create solidarity is through a worldwide change in people’s perceptions and, quite simply, through willingness to adopt other measures of assistance. We therefore support the priority given to the issue of debt cancellation and find it an eminently sensible course of action, and we believe that those countries which are moving towards democratisation and which are committed to the introduction of sustainable and free economies should be eligible for full debt cancellation.</p>
<p class="contents">Such forms of aid, however, will have no long-term impact if they are only one-off gestures. For this reason, let me repeat that free trade is what both the developing and the developed countries need most and what will enable us to progress. If we want world trade to be fairer, our foremost aim should be to make it freer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At this point, it is not a question of competing to see who is in the best position to combat poverty, but of seeing things as they are.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, the World Social Forum was an enormous success this year – 155 000 participants, 135 countries; that is considerable – and it has taken on a new tone since, on a certain number of issues – social, environmental, economic, financial – many networks have continued to be put in place and have done extremely serious work, in an extremely concrete manner, in order, specifically, to produce a number of proposals which have yet to be developed, but which are very real.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the World Social Forum does not just consist of NGOs, it also includes parliamentarians – the Parliamentarians’ Forum – and local elected representatives, of which there were also many this year, who have discussed district and local authority policies in response to the challenges we are facing. Very dynamic, enthusiastic and hard-working young people are also extremely well represented, and I do not believe we can casually sweep aside such dynamism and vitality.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, the World Social Forum has two aims. Firstly, to explain that free trade cannot provide a response to the increasing social inequalities. They are not increasing because of a scourge which has merely come out of the blue, but rather because the policies being implemented over recent years in the fields of structural adjustment and of reducing public spending have led to increasing inequalities and poverty and to increased deterioration of the environment and of the planet as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aim is to propose an alternative to the current development model and reject the presentation of world free trade as a panacea and a miracle cure for everything. It is clearly not these things. All the bodies of the United Nations indicate that the situation is deteriorating today.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, whether we are talking about Porto Alegre or Davos, what we need is practical action. We must no longer be content with words, images and positions adopted. We need very practical and precise commitments, a work plan. Mr President of the Commission, that is something else we expect from you who are, together with the Commission – and with us all – in a position to take decisions: not just good intentions or Millennium objectives, but also extremely specific proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although there has been a great deal of empty talk – particularly on the part of Mr Barroso –it is fashionable nowadays to use impressive-sounding phrases while continuing to pursue the same policies as before. This sort of behaviour is quite typical of the World Economic Forum in Davos, and, indeed, the phrase I would use to describe this Forum was coined by the well-known academic, Elmar Altvater; he described it as a big show, and, unfortunately, a rather unproductive one.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet it is interesting to note that there has been a change in the terminology used at the Forum and in the issues with which it deals. It would be no exaggeration to say that it is increasingly the critics of the World Economic Forum who are setting its agenda; these critics met at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, where 150 000 people held debates and protested against neo-liberal and neo-imperial policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Social Forum movement is of crucial importance in terms of opposition to both globalisation and war. The World Social Forum saw a large number of very pragmatic debates held on issues ranging from human rights for all – not only for people in Western countries – to the protection of public property, as well as debates held in protest at cuts in social services, in protest at the war, in protest at debt – with particular reference to the question of when the debts of the countries affected by the tsunami will finally be cancelled – and in protest at poverty. Environmental issues also featured heavily on the agenda, and I took part in a forum on water, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make it quite clear – and this is a point that must be stressed – that the participants of the World Social Forum levelled their criticism and protests not only at US policy, but also at the policies of the European Commission and the European Council. By following a similar path to that of the United States – or in other words following in the wrong footsteps – the European Union is losing ever more credibility in these circles. The participants of the World Social Forum did not wish to play the game that we see the European Council, the Commission and a great many Members of this House playing time and time again; looking askance at the USA whilst talking up their own policies. Can something along the lines of the Bolkestein directive be a genuine alternative to US policies? The answer to this must be ‘no’, as it is a neo-liberal programme. Can it be a genuine alternative to enshrine, as has been done in the EU Constitutional Treaty, a commitment to armament or an open market economy with free competition? The answer to this must also be ‘no’.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, you said that the EU is a global player, but the key question that needs to be asked is what kind of a global player it is. It must be made quite clear that free trade is not a foolproof way of reacting appropriately to the kind of policies that are currently being pursued. Instead, real debt relief must be provided; there must be a move away from neo-liberal and economically liberal policies, and the whole process must not go hand in hand with the militarisation of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close with a quote from a declaration adopted at the Forum, one that calls for an immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq and expresses support for all efforts to bring them home. ‘We support efforts to organise soldiers, conscientious objectors and military families against the war. We support the counter-recruitment campaign and demand political asylum for deserters.’ The message could not be clearer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not only in recent times, though, that reality has had a different tale to tell, and this makes it even more important that the World Economic Forum in Davos and the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre should examine, on a regular basis, the methods employed by globalisation and the effects resulting from it. The recent World Social Forum drew up over 350 proposals on globalisation, although I hope that these will be pruned down so that we are left with fewer, but more meaningful recommendations. If action is to be effective, principles must be thought through with crystalline clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Three priorities were proposed by the World Economic Forum; the reduction of greenhouse gases, more money for the poorest countries and the abolition of trade barriers through the WTO. What is missing from this list is corporate social responsibility, for which businesses themselves should be accountable. It is not only the economic weight of businesses that matters, but also the extent of their social activities. The turnover of the top multinational corporations is higher than the combined total of the budgets of the UN Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is safe to say that if Mr Ackermann of Deutsche Bank – a company that can certainly be considered a global player – had read this recommendation, he would not have announced a return on capital of 16% in the same breath as the loss of over 6 000 jobs. Those affected by his ‘smart sourcing’ method, view it as nothing but a combination of compulsive profit making and irresponsibility. ‘Smart sourcing’ has every chance of becoming 2005’s least popular new phrase.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more positive note again, both the World Social Forum and the World Economic Forum are important platforms for inspiring debates. I therefore believe it to be necessary that both the President of the European Parliament and representatives from our specialist committees should participate in these forums in future. More than ever before, global elites need representatives of the people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Barroso, you are no longer a Portuguese politician: you are a European politician, selected by this Parliament and by the Council of all of the Member States to represent Europe. You cannot intervene in domestic politics as a Portuguese politician; that is not acceptable. Unless you understand that, you will weaken the Commission. Criticism of that position will not weaken the Commission but your actions will.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not unrelated to the issue that we are currently discussing in connection with the World Social Forum. An awful lot of people right round the world look to Europe as the only transnational, democratic institution that has the capacity to try to rein in the forces that they see destroying the world. If you cannot see the role of the Commission as a body that can transcend national politics and parties in a way that will give a lead to the hope expressed in the World Social Forum, then we are wasting our time here.

I do not want to go into detail, but I should like to focus on an issue that I believe to be of great significance, and perhaps even the greatest significance, in political terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Two fora have been held, an economic forum in the wealthy city of Davos, and a social forum in the poor city of Porto Alegre. What is worrying is that not enough attention was paid to social issues at the economic forum, and that the ‘social’ forum is turning into a vehicle for questioning, and even challenging, the economic forum. Two approaches are emerging in the search for solutions to modern-day problems. The first of these involves looking for ways to develop the economy, whereas the second involves looking for ways to ensure social goals are attained, despite the fact that the two issues are intimately linked. Discussing economic and social issues separately amounts to a grave misunderstanding. I therefore believe that in future, instead of two global initiatives competing with each other, there should be a single economic and social world forum. This is where the European Union, and in particular the European Parliament and the European Commission, can play a role by pushing for such a forum in the future. I thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In Porto Alegre, I was one of 155 000 delegates from 135 countries. At the same time, 20 Heads of State and 70 ministers met in Davos. Was any listening done in Davos, however? Perhaps from a theoretical European perspective it is possible to believe that free trade, capitalism and liberalisation constitute the solution to development problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The theory is not, however, consistent with the everyday lives of millions of people, and it is time that we began to adjust the theories to the reality, and not the other way around. It is time that trade became a tool for human beings, and not vice versa. We must stop demanding the liberalisation of water and other sensitive sectors in return for countries’ being well treated.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso, when you meet President Bush and the EU Heads of Government, you can remind them of their 30 year-old promise to give 0.7% in aid. That aid would not even be needed if more of the profits from production in the developing countries were to stay in those countries.</p>

I would like to see the World Economic Forum and the World Social Forum merge, thus enabling us to talk to each other, rather than about each other.</p>
<p class="contents">Although you said, Mr President of the Commission, that the EU is a global player, I do believe that we have yet to become a global player rather than a global payer. Tomorrow will be an important step in this process, and I wish you the best of luck in this respect. The EU is needed, and it bears responsibility. We share responsibility, while yet being reliant on others; we both shape events and are affected by them. Our understanding of fundamental freedoms and human rights, our rejection of the death penalty, of child labour and of discrimination of any kind, our concept of what it means to be human; all these things know no borders, whether these be borders of countries or of continents, and it is in this sense that we also bear responsibility for what happens in the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The answer to globalisation must not come from Europe alone; what is needed is a debate on a model world order. We need a global code of ethics and global principles of action, in spite of the fact that different cultures exist. I therefore believe that we should speak up in favour of multilateralism, that we should support the initiative for a global Marshall Plan and that the EU should hold a UN conference, and that this House should call on churches throughout the world to convene an international ecumenical conference and to agree common principles of action. I believe that the European model of an environmentally friendly social market economy could become a worldwide hallmark of the EU, and that this would allow us to help change the unfair rules that currently govern the global economy.</p>

<p class="contents">These two institutions stand accused of imposing neo-conservative economic fundamentalism on the poorest countries in the world. Aid carries with it the poison pill of conditionality that forces the opening of the markets to privatisation of state assets, and the straitjacket of monetarist policies. This approach flies in the face of reality. The challenge to them is to name a country with a weak economy that has opened up and succeeded in developing its economy.</p>

In 2003, 11 000 new millionaires were created in India, while 8 million people were unemployed and 50 million lived on less than a dollar a day.</p>
<p class="contents">What is to be done? In the next ten years 45 million children will die of poverty-related diseases, 12 million AIDS orphans will be produced in Africa, and 100 million children will remain totally illiterate. The World Bank claims it is merely carrying out the wishes of the 147 states which own it – a verbal sleight of hand. African countries do not impose conditionality on themselves, nor do the Latin-Americans. It is the G8 industrialised countries that make decisions, often led by their own self-serving agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the fact that the IMF and the World Bank are now ‘talking the talk, but not walking the walk’ suggests that pressure from civic society can have an impact. The World Bank is including poverty reduction programmes in its plans, and is expressing concern about countries such as Tanzania which spend more on debt servicing than either health or education.</p>
<p class="contents">China and India can force these issues onto the agenda and the fact that the European Union has more votes in the IMF than the United States suggests that the World Social Forum slogan 'Another world is possible' is achievable: with sufficient willpower and political commitment. It is for the NGOs and civic society to give Europe's politicians the necessary backbone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore particularly pleasing to see that in Davos and in Porto Alegre, the crucial importance of liberalising world trade was recognised. Economic growth is the cornerstone of development in developing countries, whether we are dealing with climate change or guaranteeing good education. It follows on from this that I cannot emphasise strongly enough the need for the forthcoming Doha round to be a success, and the crucial role that the Commission and the Member States have to play in this. Whoever is serious about aid to the developing countries should not be blind to what goes wrong at home. Europe’s tariff barriers are, to my mind, an example of how things should not be done. Alongside positive points, there are also a few negative points to be identified. The pleas for extra tax on international financial transactions, the famous Tobin tax, strike me as eccentric, as does the extra tax for multinational companies. I see no good in such measures. They put the cart before the horse. Those who strive towards freer world trade should not impose new rules at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am surprised at those who promote unconditional debt cancellation for the developing countries. My group finds it simply unacceptable that this should be done without conditions being imposed. We believe that countries actively and successfully pursuing democracy and good governance should be able to count on support, but debt relief should not be granted without a commitment to that. The liberal priorities are freer world trade and the emphasis on economic development. That is the way to fight poverty and is, at the same time, the basis for an effective and affordable social safety net. It also allows us to pursue a more environmentally-friendly policy as a result. The question is: will we all go down together in apathetic solidarity, or will we opt for dynamism, innovation and progress? I welcome the leadership of the Commission President to opt for the latter. That, President Barroso, is a political role and we specifically want you to act politically. I consider your position in the Portuguese elections to be very justifiable, and your absence would, moreover, have been construed as complete disloyalty to your Portuguese heritage. I find your involvement very valid and I only regret that it did not benefit your Party more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that you, Mr Barroso, were ‘Global Leader of Tomorrow’ at one time, and now several Members of the European Parliament are involved in this programme for the young.</p>
<p class="contents">The Economic Forum was an excellent indication that world business wants to take responsibility for the global challenges facing us. On the opening day of the Forum, an interactive Global Town Hall discussion was held. This was a seminar in which 700 decision-makers at Davos set priorities for the world’s problems using Gallup polls, and discussed the challenges they presented.</p>
<p class="contents">When we consider the age, sex, places of residence and range of occupations of the participants, the results are quite astonishing. What, for example, would we imagine that men between the ages of 40 and 60, mainly from the EU or North America, and half of whom are business executives, think are the greatest challenges posed by globalisation? Would they be profitability in business, flexibility in employment, increased turnover, or the China phenomenon? Not at all. The greatest challenges, as proposed by this group, were the elimination of poverty, the establishment of equitable globalisation and the management of climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Global responsibility has progressed a great deal when leading businessmen say that to eliminate poverty people have to go beyond their normal way of thinking, extend the benefits of globalisation to the poorest regions and create global leadership to combat climate change. It is also worth noting that there is genuine convergence between the views expressed in Europe and North America.</p>
<p class="contents">Globalisation does not appear in the end to be the sort of divisive factor that the left-hand side of this Chamber believes it to be. These issues would be at the top of the agenda if the Friends of the Earth organised a similar meeting. The World Economic Forum has also proposed concrete action and a timetable to respond to the challenges. I am certain that there are also initiatives connected with the World Social Forum on which we have the same views. As the objectives are common to both, it would be more sensible to aspire to them together rather than separately. We give you in the Commission our full support in this.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would therefore firstly like to thank my fellow Members who were in Porto Alegre, and in particular my colleague Harlem Désir, for the work they have done over many years to enable Europe to take part in this large-scale civic meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">Many commentators and participants shared the fear that this movement would run out of steam, but that has not been the case. The anti-globalisation movement has been able to redirect its activities and to define a new organisational method that has resulted in the World Social Forum being no longer just a platform for demands but also a platform for proposals. Moreover, the fact that the Davos Economic Forum discussed some of the subjects brought up in the world social forums proves that the questions asked there are ones that ask us all what sort of world we want.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither the World Social Forum nor the World Economic Forum in Davos, however, is a political actor that can, on its own, turn demands into political decisions. That is why a body like the European Parliament is duty-bound to pass on and lend powerful support to a number of initiatives, such as cancelling the debt of poor countries, increasing and improving public development aid, instituting a global tax, reforming international trade rules, combating tax evasion and tax havens and defending public services.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Heads of State or Government have already taken initiatives, and other proposals will need to be put forward at the G8 summit. In this year, 2005, in which we will make an interim assessment of the implementation of the Millennium Objectives launched by the United Nations, these are all positive moves, provided they are not just more empty promises. That is why more than 100 organisations, NGOs, associations and trade unions will run a mobilisation and questioning campaign at global and European level this year. This campaign will speak out on the subjects of trade and poverty, in particular, and one of the first of its many initiatives will be a global action week for fairer trade next April.</p>
<p class="contents">We already know that, at the rate things are going, the Millennium Goals will not be achieved. It is therefore down to us to keep the promises made by others a long time ago, by supporting these initiatives and this global anti-poverty campaign in order to emphasise and demonstrate our desire for a better distribution of wealth, in a democratic and peaceful world. Politicians have let people down in the past. They may well do so in the future, but under no circumstances must they abandon the idea that they themselves have to fight for a fairer world, and translate this idea into action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Your speeches, ladies and gentlemen, have confirmed the richness of the debate and have demonstrated the wide range of viewpoints on the subject of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, I should like to highlight a point that I believe was also aired during Mr Désir’s speech, concerning a degree of convergence that, despite everything, is becoming apparent – I mean regarding globalisation. At first it appeared that there were two extreme positions: one consisting of seeing only the negative side of globalisation and the other, initially expressed in Porto Alegre, something of an all-out rejection of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are seeing today – what is clearly visible – is that, at the Davos Forum, a certain effort at corporate social responsibility is being made and an increasingly strong emphasis is being placed on a programme for global government or governance. There is also an interest in taking on board some of the concerns expressed by so many non-governmental organisations and by so many protagonists of the movement that initially saw itself even as an anti-globalisation movement.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of those people originally in the anti-globalisation movement quickly realised that globalisation was inevitable. Today’s globalisation is not the result of a decision made by any one country or group of countries, and nor is it a conspiracy on the part of a group of companies. Today’s globalisation has much more to do with the trends of international trade and, in particular, the technological revolution, which no government really controls. Consequently, instead of just protesting against globalisation, many of these actors and protagonists have chosen, rightly in my view, to seek an alternative form of globalisation, and to try to incorporate some of their concerns into globalisation. That is our position. I welcome this because I feel that we can learn from both Davos and Porto Alegre, although proposals have been made in both places that cannot be taken very seriously. There are lessons to be learnt, however, from both processes.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Europe and the Commission, what can I tell you? We must, I feel, work on practical issues, from both an internal and an external perspective. From an internal perspective, are we in favour of cohesion or not? I am in favour of cohesion and the Commission is in favour of cohesion – economic, social and territorial – and I therefore appeal to you today, ladies and gentlemen, to help me and to help the Commission ensure that all EU governments are also in favour of cohesion and ready to offer their help with, for example, the financial perspective that we have been debating, because poverty does not only affect countries of the Southern Hemisphere, it also affects Europe. Europe now has greater disparities than ever before – and this is especially true of post-enlargement Europe. We need more advanced programmes in Europe to fight social exclusion. Accordingly, if we wish to conduct a coherent debate on the issue of cohesion, we must begin by seeking to implement cohesion – economic, social and territorial cohesion – here in Europe. This forms part of a fast-track approach that is vital for the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the external perspective: what can the Commission and the EU do on the external stage? In this context, two areas that I think should not be seen as mutually incompatible or contradictory are those of international trade and development aid. Some remarks that I heard were against international trade on the grounds that international trade is, to some extent, the embodiment of the neoliberal model. Let me tell you once again that, in my conversations with the leaders of developing countries, the first request that almost all of them make is in the area of trade – they want greater access to the markets of more developed countries – and so we must also help these countries with regard to trade. It cannot therefore be said that trade and aid are irreconcilably incompatible. It is clear to me that we can and must do more for developing countries, in both of these areas. Yet we can also ask more of them, because when the EU and the EU Member States give considerable amounts of aid, as we do – worldwide, the EU is the biggest donor of development aid – we also have the right to demand good governance on the part of those countries and we want to know if the money given to them is being used properly and above board and if in fact the reforms aimed at better integrating those countries into international trade are being carried out. This is also a shared responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me tell you that the Commission wants to go further. We want to make a more ambitious contribution towards achieving the Millennium Objectives. As things stand, it is clear that we are only limited by the resources available. We therefore intend to continue to work with the Member States and with Parliament in order to set a more ambitious agenda in the area of development aid, above all by placing Africa at the forefront of our priorities, because Africa has structural problems that other regions have, to some degree, already overcome, particularly because of their more successful integration into international trade. I should like to assure you that the Commission and I would like to see an attitude of greater decisiveness and greater commitment to the aims of a global world, a fairer global world in which the EU must play a leading role in encouraging more responsible governance of our planet’s resources and creating a fairer society on a global scale.</p>
