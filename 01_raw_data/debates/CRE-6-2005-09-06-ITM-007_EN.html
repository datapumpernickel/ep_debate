<p class="contents">The future PROGRESS programme will play a decisive role in the development of social Europe. In this context, it aims to bring together the four Community action programmes on which the implementation of the social policy agenda up to 2006 is based, as well as a series of budget headings concerning working conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed approach will contribute to simplifying the instruments, both in legal terms and from the point of view of managing them, and to rationalising the budget structure. It will also enhance the clarity, visibility, coherence and consistency of the instruments and will prevent overlaps. The Commission has always been very keen to ensure that the revised text preserves this simplification and this rationalisation. That was the case with the initial proposal, and the majority of the amendments that Parliament has seen fit to suggest are also directed to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be pleased, Mr President, to listen to Parliament’s observations, standing in once again for Mr Špidla, who has been detained by the EU-China Summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karin Jöns (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like at the outset to reiterate my thanks to my fellow-members of the Committee for their constructive cooperation, but would also like to thank the Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspective, which has played a substantial part in ensuring, not only that PROGRESS is now a good instrument for the better implementation of the social policy agenda, but also that we will have enough money to be able to really ensure greater sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">PROGRESS represents a response to the results of the Eurobarometer surveys, for what the public wants is greater involvement on the part of the EU in the combating of unemployment and poverty. For that, though, a primary requirement is for well-organised and structured sharing of experience, with it being particularly necessary that we should promote to a far greater degree the process of learning from one another, whether by supporting European networks, setting in motion Europe-wide studies and analyses or even by means of conferences. This is the only way in which we will succeed in maintaining, in future, the highest possible level of social protection throughout Europe, on which, after all, the maintenance of a peaceful society and social cohesion in the European Union depends. That is something that the Member States now, at last, appear to have realised.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the Commission proposal, to which we have proposed a range of improvements and additions. The improvements primarily have to do with an increase in the overall appropriations and certain changes to the way in which they are distributed among the various areas targeted. What this boils down to is that we have now voted PROGRESS EUR 225 million more than the Commission originally allocated it, and I might also mention that this sum takes estimated inflation into account.</p>
<p class="contents">There was one of the fields to which the PROGRESS programme applies for which we, together with the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, had to fight particularly hard, and that was gender mainstreaming. Without wanting to reopen old wounds, I have to say that I am firmly convinced that, if there are in future to be no more officially free-standing action programmes to promote equality of opportunity, reinforcing this in all areas to which the programme relates and measures taken under it is what is needed to win over the Women’s Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, our Committee was not prepared to accept the cuts in the resources set aside for gender mainstreaming that the Council and the Commission sought. We are reversing many of these cuts, but, rather than taking the money away from other important target areas, we have done this by voting to make the very high flexibility margin of 10% less rigid and thus make it possible for the share allocated to gender equality to be increased by 4% to its present 12% share of the budget for PROGRESS.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee also regards five points in this programme as being particularly important, and I expect the Commission to support us in this. For a start, we want to make the individual target areas more visible, which means that the programme committee needs to have five sub-committees, and also needs to organise for each target area an annual exchange of views on the way in which the programme is put into effect, enabling each of these committees to join with the specialist committees in this House in debating it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we want the transnational exchange to be maintained in future, for that alone will provide Europe with the added value that we want, and, thirdly, we want PROGRESS to help to really get the experience gained from the programme circulated among the Member States faster than the current programmes have done.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this Parliament do of course now want – and this is my fourth point – to be more closely involved in monitoring the programme. As I see it, the mere fact that the programme is to run for seven years makes this an absolute necessity. We therefore believe that the distribution of the annual funding around the individual target areas should not be a responsibility for the programme committee but rather a matter for the Budget procedure each year.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to my last point, the role of the social partners and non-governmental organisations. The Committee found the Commission’s desire to limit their role to no more than the pursuit of the EU’s objectives incomprehensible. We regard their involvement in the ongoing development of strategies as indispensable.</p>
<p class="contents">The possibility of participation in PROGRESS must also be open to national and regional non-governmental organisations. It therefore follows that the maximum co-funding should continue to stand at 90% and not at something like 80%, which would be a cause of major difficulties to many EU networks.</p>

<p class="contents">Accordingly, in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, we have sought to strike a balance between the need to raise the profile of the struggle for genuine equality between men and women and the Commission’s proposal, bringing action on the ground and the existing directives closer together. Against this backdrop, the creation of the European Gender Institute is of major importance; it should be granted greater powers and its own financial resources, more so than the Commission is currently proposing.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the proposals that we adopted in the Committee on Women’s Rights have been addressed, at least in part, in the report by Mrs Jöns, whom I congratulate on her work. I should like to highlight the following points: the increase in cofinancing to a 90% ceiling, in light of the difficulties experienced by NGOs and other social organisations working in these areas; the increase in the financial framework to EUR 854.2 million for the seven-year period from 2007; and the change in the financial allocation between the different strands.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme must effectively address the question of the protection and social inclusion of immigrants, the disabled, the unemployed, children and young people, and the elderly, along with issues such as working conditions, the fight against discrimination, and the promotion of diversity. I wish to stress, however, that gender mainstreaming and the issue of equality between men and women must be incorporated into all strands and measures forming part of the PROGRESS Programme and all programmes using Community funds, in order to prevent women from being victims of repeated discrimination and to prevent any backsliding on the policy of equality between men and women across a broad spectrum of areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am equally delighted by the quality of the debates we have had in committee and by the very interesting compromise amendments, of which I would specifically like to point out the following. I believe that interesting amendments have been made to the Commission’s text, particularly with regard to Parliament’s role itself. It should be recognised, Commissioner, that the Commission’s initial text treated us somewhat as the poor relation when it came to the evaluations of a programme actually extending over seven years (2007-2013). I think it is worth remembering what the Commission was proposing concerning the role of Parliament, namely the simple forwarding to Parliament of an ex post evaluation focused on the entire programme, an evaluation drafted by the Commission one year after the programme’s conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the proposals being submitted by the Commission respond to the need for Parliament to intervene directly and throughout the entire seven-year period covered by such an important programme. They are also particularly acceptable to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, through the use of compromise amendments, Mrs Jöns has drawn attention to the particularly important role of non-governmental organisations and of social organisations. Everyone will be in agreement in recognising that, from a national and transnational perspective, these organisations play a particularly important role in the framework of the specialised networks belonging to them at EU level. It is therefore only natural that they should participate in devising, implementing and monitoring the programme. It is equally clear that promoting the direct exchange of experiences can ensure a greater understanding of the individual nature of events taking place in different countries; it is, moreover, only in this way that exchanges on strategies, good practices and innovative strategic approaches will bear fruit and endow the evaluations with the quality scientific approach they require.</p>
<p class="contents">I will say one final word on financial and budgetary matters since they remain the core issue. It should be pointed out that the sum of EUR 628 million, proposed by the Commission, falls well short of the amount recommended in the Böge report on the financial and budgetary package for 2007-2013. I would like in particular to emphasise that the success of the PROGRESS programme essentially depends on the amount awarded to it, and it is clear that the amount proposed by the Commission is by no means acceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have taken a positive view of this proposal concerning PROGRESS and the amalgamation of the previous four programmes. This may mean better coordination, less overlap and more efficient use of expenditure. Amalgamation is therefore to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme has a role to play in the Lisbon strategy that is, of course, not only about competitiveness but also about a social Europe and a less stratified society. It is a fact that unemployment is too high at present. Social protection systems and social integration do not operate in ways that are entirely satisfactory. Gender equality is not always to be seen, and there is still discrimination. This programme is therefore extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to comment on a number of aspects also addressed by the rapporteur. Firstly, the pooling of experience, including transnational experience. It is incredibly important to make the most of the programme’s innovative character, for, at national level, we conduct labour market policies. These programmes must be creative and innovative and be extended across national borders so that everyone might benefit from what is being done through different projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, gender equality should not just be applied specifically in one area. Instead, it must permeate all parts of the programmes and of PROGRESS. I also wish to emphasise the accessibility aspects. Disabled people are now excluded from the labour market to a greater extent and have more difficulty being integrated into society. It is therefore important for the accessibility aspects, broadly understood, to be integrated into, and taken account of in, all parts of the programme so that disabled people can participate in the labour market. The same applies to the social integration of people who come from other parts of the world and who are not part of the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself have experience of working in Sweden on the Swedish programme. I wish to emphasise what the rapporteur too mentioned, namely that both sides of industry, as well as non-governmental organisations, must be involved in the whole of the work, designing, implementing and supervising the programmes. They will be a major resource in the work being done firmly to establish these programmes at national and regional levels.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial aspects have already been touched upon. The Commission’s proposal would make far too few resources available and is too old-fashioned. Social Europe is an area on which we must concentrate when we create the long-term budget. That is why the proposal by the committee responsible, put forward here in Parliament and recommending more resources, is to be preferred.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the subject of a social Europe has been taken up by the British Presidency. In this context, the need for a properly resourced PROGRESS programme should also be evaluated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my view, the greatest merit of the PROGRESS programme as part of simplification and rationalisation efforts is the renewal of a commitment to priorities that are crucial for achieving the Lisbon Strategy’s objectives, by providing instruments that are appropriate, albeit not fully balanced.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk of investment in aspects such as human resources, training, employment services, efforts to achieve higher employment rates, the promotion of crucial qualitative and quantitative employment levels and at the same time an agenda for social cohesion, we have in mind objectives that should not be seen solely as a compensatory or offsetting appendage to a Lisbon Strategy focused exclusively on the economic sphere, but that form an integral part of it.</p>
<p class="contents">For these very reasons, I believe that it is fundamentally important to propose and plan a reinforcement of the financial framework, but we also place considerable emphasis on the success of this proposal, including the section relating to an increase in the cofinancing ceilings, which are essential in promoting a decisive and determining aspect of the programme: an upgraded role for partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">If the social dimension does not play a leading and decisive role in planning and implementation, commitment from the institutions alone will probably fall short of the objectives. Other issues have already been dealt with by other Members, and so I have dwelt on just a few points that, in my view, are crucial for the success of an option that is decisive in the relaunch of European strategies for development and the system’s competitiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The speaker spoke Irish)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I welcome the report by Mrs Jöns and thank her for her work. In particular I welcome the emphasis placed on social inclusion, gender mainstreaming, people with disabilities and the role of the NGO sector in this programme. I also want to throw my support behind calls for an increase in the financial aid proposed and for a co-financing rate of 90%, rather than 80%, in relation to the role of NGOs and social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear: the current economic strategies are driving more and more people into poverty within the European Union, and our hope is that PROGRESS can help play an important role in the fight against social exclusion. The strengthening of gender equality should be supported wholeheartedly by this Parliament, especially those elements which emphasise actions promoting gender equality that aim to combat discrimination and access to employment, career development, pay and training, and that fight the causes of poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a real and immediate issue for women in particular. In Ireland, for example, the gender pay gap has substantially increased for women and the gap between men's and women's pay in Ireland is among the largest of any EU Member State. Irish women are paid 17% less for the same work as Irish men and, according to a recent report by the Central Statistics Office, one-parent families are three and a half times more likely to experience poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to see fundamental change within society and bring in this fundamental change in mindsets and conditions, we must support this programme and this report. I will be voting for this.</p>

The greatest social benefit, the greatest solidarity, is for people to have jobs. However, fuller employment will not come about through bureaucratic plans and schemes such as Lisbon, which the rapporteur and others seem to think will help and which is now discredited, surely: halfway through its time span and less than half implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Employment is encouraged by removing restraints and scrapping regulations. I point out again in this House that those countries that have not adopted the euro have the lowest levels of unemployment. However, it goes deeper. In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in July, David Blunkett, the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, said that we must not work against Member States, that different countries have different solutions and that defining best practice is the first step.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we must observe what others do and learn from each other, taking and adapting from each other what suits best. We must not conjure up new projects with ever increasing budgets. The rapporteur rightly says that red tape must be cut through but is sceptical about the European Union's ability to do so. Likewise, David Blunkett said that many regulations were being passed which were impossible to implement. Just so: the first measure to be discarded is this well-meaning but artificial attempt to create social solidarity. I voted against it in committee and I ask this House to do the same. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is in favour of this programme. If we want to achieve the Lisbon objectives, if we want jobs for everyone, we must help people to achieve this goal. After all, people in employment are best placed to meet their own basic needs. That is why it is so important that all those disadvantaged groups know that Europe exists and that it can provide them with support in finding jobs, in gaining extra qualifications, in changing working conditions, and so on, and it is for that reason that I congratulate Mrs Jöns on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to answer two questions. I have just received a note to which I can now respond in my own language. The first question is: how do you actually arrive at the amount mentioned in your amendment? The amount that was proposed at the time was EUR 854 million, which was still wishful thinking on the part of Mrs Jöns. We then thought that such an amount was not attainable, but we subsequently joined forces and arrived at a final sum of EUR 858 million in Mr Böge’s report. That is why we have increased the amount from EUR 854 million to 858 million, and I assume that everyone is agreed on this. We have also changed the percentages. We wanted to do the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality a favour by setting aside more funds for gender equality and we also wanted to put some money aside for working conditions. I think that those issues are worthwhile and that they can redress the balance in PROGRESS to some extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is because all those minor incidental programmes do not make life any easier that I am delighted with PROGRESS, which will enable us to channel our money, commitment and energy much more effectively. I would therefore support everyone involved in this PROGRESS programme, and I hope that those two amendments tabled by our group will make it past the finishing line. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It underpins our European work on the critical issues of discrimination and social exclusion that continue to hold back so many people in our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Lisbon Strategy is to mean more than just words, Parliament is right to expect a significant increase in funding for this area. If politicians in Brussels are genuinely worried about disengagement and alienation, as reflected by the votes on the Constitutional Treaty and in other ways, it is right for us to insist that the Commission should strengthen, not weaken, the role of both social partners and of non-governmental organisations in this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly support combating all forms of discrimination. As many colleagues are aware, I have a specific interest in working with the disability movement. I would like to remind Parliament and Commission that this is the programme which provides the core funding to enable disabled people, and indeed other groups that are discriminated against, to meet and to represent themselves at European level. If we fail to allow this, we exclude the most disadvantaged people from our work in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember very well the budget crisis back in 1998, when the funding for such NGOs was called into question in a wholly unjustifiable manner. It was resolved at political level by the Member States, on the clear understanding that the work of these organisations on combating discrimination is vital in pushing forward the EU agenda. Let that be remembered today.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to reiterate that it is important for these networks to be independent and capable of representing the concerns of their members. The Commission too often sees them as agencies for promoting and implementing its work. No, they must represent the views and experiences of disadvantaged people themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe in gender mainstreaming, but it should apply to disabled people too, with disabled, not able-bodied, people representing them. Our amendments, which provide for adaptations, accommodations and accessibility and include publicity, are absolutely crucial in ensuring that disabled people are involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I want to express support for the small disability organisations for blind and people, or people with intellectual disabilities. They too have a right to meet at European level and we should not forget them and try and lump people together in large groups. There is room for all organisations, large and small. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Solidarity is one of the most fundamental principles of European integration. In this regard, the neighbouring Scandinavian countries serve as a good model for my home country Estonia. Finland, Sweden and Denmark have some of the highest human development indicators in the world. At the same time, they occupy positions at the peak of economic competitiveness. In order to achieve the Lisbon development objectives and find an appropriate social model to meet the challenges the European Union will face in the future, we should certainly keep their valuable experiences in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision under discussion, which would establish a programme for employment and social solidarity in the Union, is a substantial step towards the creation of a more uniformly developed social environment in Europe. In connection with this, I would like to emphasise that non-governmental organisations can be effective partners to national governments, and as motors of civil society, these are also responsive social indicators.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to increase and improve the progress of this programme, and also its implementation, I, as one of the co-rapporteurs, suggested that the rate of cofinancing should be raised to 90% of the total expenses of NGOs. This is a significant measure which will especially help the 10 countries that have most recently joined the European Union to catch up more quickly with the others. A prosperous Europe is a goal towards which we all strive. Today, the new Member States in particular require support in order to work as equals with the other Members, without eating into the other countries’ budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure the stability of democratic processes, and this is directly connected with social stability. The measure of raising cofinancing is also important because both the associated candidate countries of the European Union and the western Balkan states included in the process can participate in the programme. In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, for her expert work, and also you, my good colleagues, for your attention. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Reducing the number of budget lines from 28 to 2 and harmonising the scope of the four programmes which already exist will, we hope, help to make support for the social and political agenda of the Lisbon Strategy more effective.</p>

<p class="contents">Ι hope in particular that future provisions adopted by the programme committee, assisted by the four proposed subcommittees, will bring about the required simplification in the use and flexibility in the funding of the programmes, so that the participation of European networks and of national and regional non-governmental organisations becomes a reality, so that transnational cooperation is reinforced and mainstreaming to combat all forms of discrimination and gender discrimination and to reinforce participation by women and people with disabilities becomes a reality, so that the European Employment Strategy, which is the key to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, is helped by the social awareness which will strengthen the PROGRESS programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme is designed, therefore, to support the application of protection and of the fight against social exclusion, especially of minority groups, and improvements to the working environment, supplemented by the provision for combining family life and work so that women are given the opportunity to participate in the workplace.</p>

All the directives relating to this have made a decisive contribution in improving the position of women, who make up 52% of our population and thus constitute the majority. Grateful though I am to Mrs Jöns for having reinforced this aspect of the PROGRESS programme, I do take the view that the amalgamation of the five areas of the social agenda is politically mistaken and must not be allowed to remain unchanged. Gender equality should have a free-standing programme of its own.</p>
<p class="contents">There are six arguments in favour of this: firstly, the Constitutional Treaty reinforces equality policy; secondly the equality programme, like the budget for it, was formerly a matter for the Committee on Women’s Rights, and quite rightly too. Thirdly, the awaited creation of the Gender Institute, gender mainstreaming and a relevant and free-standing equality programme will, in matters of equality policy, make the EU and this House of ours very visible to women; all women will see that Europe is actively working for them. Fourthly, the Women’s Committee remains a driving force for the rights of our female citizens and will not agree to those rights being undermined by such things as the planned amalgamation, with effect from 2008, of the DAPHNE anti-violence programme with the programme against drugs, which amounts to an open assault upon women’s policy. Fifthly, gender mainstreaming must be consistently applied in all PROGRESS’s pillars, whether in employment, social protection, working conditions or the fight against discrimination, for women are still subject to discrimination in many areas, and, sixthly, what is currently going on runs counter to the Barroso Commission’s commitment to putting equality high up the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Although PROGRESS puts women back on the social agenda, pigeonholing them under ‘social issues’, the solution to the equality problem is political in nature. We women may have lost the first round, but Parliament’s amendments – and thanks again to Mrs Jöns – have prevented drastic cutbacks in the area of equality of opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me warn the Commission, though, that, if equality policy becomes even less visible and is taken even less seriously, then support on the part of women will diminish as well. PROGRESS depends on them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate Mrs Jöns on her report. Without doubt, the Lisbon challenges impose the need for an agenda to achieve a rationalised social policy in terms of spending and monitoring. Yet, will the new European social policy enable women to gain full recognition for all the functions they perform? Will the value of their work be better recognised by integrating the policy of equality into that of employment?</p>
<p class="contents">Etymologists set us thinking. The origin of the word economy, <span class="italic">oikos</span>, house, and <span class="italic">nomos</span>, rule, explains that economy is a desire to run a house efficiently. In all domestic or professional spheres, in the market or non-market sector, women know how to make use of scarce resources and turn them into something else. They know how to satisfy everyone’s needs and desires and to redistribute the outcome of what they produce. Around 30% of women’s economic output is not even accounted for. That earned the US economist, Gari Becker, a Nobel Prize. In my country, behind the Iron Curtain, women did not expect to receive a pay slip, nor unemployment benefit to support those close to them. They only worked to ensure their own survival and that of their family. Lisbon wishes to fight against impoverishment in Europe and for greater social justice. The clearly identified commercial criteria are widely debated here. Let us make no mistake, a significant effort remains to be made to identify the work of women, the driving force behind the networks of solidarity, including the economic indicators of our nations’ accounts. Solidarity in the economy calls on us to conduct politics in a different way and to establish relations between human beings based on public-spirited and socially aware behaviour that respects everyone’s differences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the recently enlarged European Union has as its basic aspiration the difficult objective of economic and social cohesion in today's environment of low development levels and regional and social inequalities.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Union is preparing to enlarge towards south-east Europe and to start accession negotiations with Turkey, a large country with serious problems in all sectors. These developments relate directly to our political plans and to our financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the social problems of European citizens which the PROGRESS programme is designed to combat lie at the heart of speculation about the effectiveness of our social model and the credibility and viability of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, we expect a great deal of the PROGRESS programme in terms of its structure, its collective and coordinating character, its adequate funding, the potential to mobilise social and economic agencies and, more specifically, to give numerous agencies at national and regional level the chance to participate, because we must not forget that our administration to date is making European citizens say that we are supporting and cooperating with the professionals of the European programmes and not the real, basic protagonists.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like in particular to highlight the need to integrate the gender factor into all sectors in which action is taken, in all evaluations and reviews, both interim and annual, of the PROGRESS programme, as the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality emphasises in its opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a great deal of experience in the European Union today from the application of equality programmes at Community and national level. At the same time, women have a great many problems in connection with discrimination, unemployment, poverty and exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to work in the new framework which we have before us, in the PROGRESS programme, with political perspicacity and appropriate administrative mechanisms, in order to respond to the aspirations of women and resolve their problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jacques Barrot,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, I thank Parliament for this interesting and important debate. I am delighted that the opinion adopted by Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs shares with the Commission’s proposal the same desire to simplify and to rationalise, and I would like to say a few words about the Commission’s position with regard to certain major amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Having regard to Amendment 55 on the inclusion of regional and national non-governmental organisations as potential beneficiaries of the programme, the Commission stresses that this support for national and regional NGOs has not been ruled out. Nevertheless, the Commission wished to send a signal to clearly indicate that the programme is first and foremost aimed at NGOs organised at EU level, as they bring a higher degree of added value.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards increasing the financial envelope of the programme, Amendments 66 and 73 together with dividing the funds among the various sections of the programme and the flexibility reserve provided for Amendments 67 and 74 the Commission is not opposed to a debate on these issues but, at this stage, it is not amending its initial proposal and is waiting for an overall agreement on the financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Having regard to Amendment 59, which divides the Committee into five subcommittees corresponding to the five sections of the programme, the Commission will not change its position with regard to the fact that it wishes to be assisted by only one committee on the PROGRESS programme, even if the members of this committee may change according to the agenda, as is indicated in recital 12a of the amended proposal for a Council decision. I am pleased to note that the position of the European Parliament is not very far removed from that of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Inter alia, the amendments aimed at strengthening the role of the European Parliament or, furthermore, at mainstreaming the gender dimension are very much welcomed by the Commission. There is no danger that we will lose sight of gender mainstreaming in the new PROGRESS programme; on the contrary, the Commission will ensure that it highlights the aspect of gender which, by being integrated into the new programme, will strengthen the principle of mainstreaming.</p>
<p class="contents">I quite understand the concerns expressed in the draft opinion of Parliament; that is why the Commission will amend its proposal as far as possible in order to respond to this opinion of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will now list the amendments that the Commission can accept in full: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 30, 34, 36, 37, 39, 40, 42, 43, 46, 47, 52, 53, 54, 61, 62, 63, 68, 69 and 70.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can substantially accept the following Amendments, but accept only the spirit of parts of them, and on condition that they are reworded: 4, 11, 14, 18, 22, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 35, 41, 44, 45, 48, 49, 58, 64, 65 and 71.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission must reject Amendments: 9, 16, 23, 33, 38, 50, 51, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 66, 67, 72, 73 and 74.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to thank the European Parliament for the quality of its debate on this proposal. Thanks to the dialogue between the Commission and the European Parliament, I can say with conviction that the resulting text will take better account of the political objectives of the European Parliament while at the same time having contributed to the effort to simplify and to rationalise, which will be to the advantage of the beneficiaries. The PROGRESS proposal submitted to you is essential for implementing the new social agenda. This programme will enable us to give financial backing to the instruments we have, such as the open method of coordination, the drafting of legislation and efforts to monitor its application, the exchange of good practices and the action of non-governmental organisations. Mr President, that is my conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
