We have expressed our intention to reject the Council"s common position and it must now call a meeting of the Conciliation Committee to see if it can reach some sort of agreement regarding the amendments. If this is not done, if the Council refuses, it is likely that when discussions have ended, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media will put forward a motion rejecting the common position. But we are still hopeful of finally arranging a meeting with the Council so that we can work together on amendments which will enable the Council and Parliament to agree on a solution which both respects Parliament"s prerogatives and guarantees the cultural quality of the cities chosen in 2005 and beyond.</p>

We believe that the European Capital of Culture event is of great benefit to the Community. For the sake of the event's future, it is essential that there should be a fair and effective system for deciding which cities should host the event and when.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that the compromise proposal of an automatic rota system with a guidance panel with diminished powers, as put forward by the Council, has some definite disadvantages. On the one hand, the proposal would transfer the emphasis from the cities – which are supposed to be the focus of the event – to countries, and on the other, the Council procedure undermines the position of the European Parliament. In this respect, the committee's criticism – in line with previous decisions – is correct. We would nevertheless stress the need to find a solution that is acceptable to all Member States, in order to avoid future arguments over the selection of cities and the designation of years.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the advantage of the Council's proposal is that an element of predictability would be introduced which would make planning and follow‐up activities easier for the city concerned. Our position on this issue depends partly on whether or not we think a compromise will improve the way in which nominations for the European Capital of Culture event are handled, and partly on whether a viable solution to the problem can be found which avoids argument in the future.</p>

<p class="contents">It is doubtful whether the Council's compromise proposal to establish a rota system based on the same order as the presidency, with an additional city from a third country being chosen every year, is the best solution. However, it is a proposal for which all the Member States, after a good many ifs and buts, have expressed support.</p>
<p class="contents">Negative criticism of the event has mostly been levelled at the need for long‐term planning and the lack of ongoing results. An automatic rota allows both countries and cities to prepare for the event and to develop it further.</p>

The Commission's proposal for a directive on a common framework for electronic signatures is a positive measure and a major step in the right direction. However, I hope that the many relevant amendments proposed by the committee, which are aimed at clarifying the text of the directive, will be taken into account during the next stage of the procedure.</p>

However, I must say that, although I agree with the Seppänen report, I have considerable problems with its explanatory statement as it is an accurate representation of the Russian nationalist point of view in this context. It describes NATO membership for Latvia as dangerous and points to the problematic issue of Russian minorities. But it does not mention that this problem is a consequence of the fact that, contrary to the provisions of international law, Latvia was occupied for decades and subjected to a systematic settlement policy, and that the country was therefore settled by occupation in violation of international law. Attempts are now being made to use this problem, which undoubtedly needs to be solved sensitively, as an excuse for possibly calling Latvia"s independence into question.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I believe that Latvian membership of NATO would not aggravate this problem but would alleviate it. If Latvia knows that its freedom and independence are no longer under threat it will also deal with its minority problems in a more relaxed manner.</p>

<p class="contents">‐ Korea has admittedly been a member of the OECD since 1996 but this country has not met the corresponding conditions with regard to its labour legislation. The main trade unions are still banned, hiring and firing is customary, and the situation in the workplace is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ The harmful consequences of dictatorial regimes such as the National Security Law, and the resulting host of political prisoners are contrary to our understanding of the rule of law. Fundamental democratic rights continue to be flouted. As Article 1 of the agreement consists of a democracy and human rights clause, the agreement would have to be immediately suspended as soon as it came into force.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ The death penalty continues to exist, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Great hopes were pinned on the change of government. The financial crisis in Asia also changed the situation. Nothing, or practically nothing, has been done for this people that has been abused for centuries. Yet industry, businesses and certain sections within the Commission want the green light for bilateral trade. The reasons they give include the shift in the balance of trade, enormous market opportunities, liberalisation and the whole package of measures that the IMF has made a condition of its financial assistance. Human rights and labour rights, on the other hand, are no longer mentioned by those in favour.</p>
<p class="contents">From experience, however, we cannot rely on a simple trickle‐down effect where human rights are concerned. There have already been too many dictatorships whose economic performance was excellent while people lived in want and disappeared.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Parliament would be giving up an important instrument for bringing pressure to bear if we were now to give our approval. We would then no longer have any way of intervening. Parliament has no say on the democracy and human rights clause.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday evening"s debate confirmed the view of the Green Group that we should withhold our approval of the agreement. Sir Leon Brittan has assured us that he will do everything that he deems diplomatically appropriate to ensure that conditions are improved in Korea. Unfortunately, we know that the euro is much more important to him than social well‐being. And his refusal to give Parliament an annual report on the situation in Korea simply means that we will never have the Commission"s position in writing on this. His offer to present the information orally in Parliament certainly sounds promising, but by doing so he is avoiding any serious possibility of having to do his duty properly.</p>
<p class="contents">A good relationship with Korea and the welfare of its inhabitants are issues that are very important to us. It is precisely because of this that the time is not yet right for this agreement.</p>

Indeed, this week I am more strongly than ever in favour of Parliament having a stronger influence over the Commission. We must ensure that Parliament is no longer the Commission"s slave but that instead the Commission – which must of course also be strong, but supported by Parliament – is monitored by a strong Parliament. This week we have seen the disaster that has occurred as a result of this not being the case hitherto. I am in favour of the strictest measures in the current crisis, perhaps going as far as a motion of censure. But there is one thing that I do not agree with: the proposal to have an elected President of the European Commission. I could perhaps have accepted this in the Social Democrats" more moderate version but not in the form in which it has now been adopted, because in my opinion an election of this kind is not appropriate for a multinational structure such as the EU and could easily lead to national or nationality‐related problems. In my view, the Commission and the Commission President must be determined by Parliament, but I do not believe in this kind of EU‐wide presidential election.</p>

However, we do not entirely agree with the ideas contained in paragraphs I(2), I(3) and I(4). We think the implications of these requirements are too far‐reaching and specific.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, we support the amendments to the above paragraphs tabled by the PSE Group. In our view, they allow the governments of the Member States more room for political manoeuvre, since they make the more modest assertion that it would be interesting if, in future, the political movements were to nominate candidates for the presidency of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 2 is also more circumspect, pointing out that it would be wise for Member States' governments to take account of the outcome of the European elections when nominating the candidate for the presidency of the Commission. The amendment goes on to propose that Parliament should hold a vote as soon as possible on the candidate nominated by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor are we able to support paragraph II(1), which we regard as too broad in scope but too specific as regards the number of Commission members to be chosen from among sitting MEPs. Instead, we support the amendment to this paragraph tabled by the PSE Group, to the effect that we should continue to develop the practice which has been successful up to now of choosing some MEPs as Members of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we cannot give our wholehearted support to paragraph IV(3), since we think it is far too specific as regards the time appointed for the nominee to make a statement of intent. Instead, we support the amendment tabled by the PSE Group to the effect that the nominee for President of the Commission should make, as extensively as possible, a statement of intent, followed by a debate, at the July 1999 part‐session.</p>

It also strength the power of the nominated President with regard to the choice of the Commissioners – in agreement with the national governments – the definition of the Commission"s programme and, once appointed, the political coordination and direction of the Members of the Commission. It is therefore necessary to strengthen the democratic legitimacy and political responsibility of the Commission and consequently of its President. This is the main thrust of the idea proposed by Jacques Delors, and backed by Mário Soares and Felipe González among others. It aims to organise the European election campaign around not just a political programme but also the choice of Commission President, with the European political parties having to publicly present their candidate for this post to the electorate.</p>
<p class="contents">The main positive effect of this would be the personalisation of the election campaign and therefore increased visibility of the institutions, better understanding of the rationale and greater emotional identification of the citizens with the European Union itself and its objectives and policies. I believe that the EU would surely gain in terms of greater prestige, proximity to the people and democratic responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The Brok report generally includes these objectives, although the requirements of <span class="italic">realpolitik</span> , which aims to preserve the power of the prime ministers to negotiate and choose the person to be proposed to the European Parliament, have dulled the clarity of the report in favour of forms of parliamentary compromise that allow room for both sides of the argument.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, it has been proposed – I am pleased to say that this is due to my amendment – that the European Council should choose the person to be nominated as Commission President bearing in mind the election results. It is therefore not right for the German Government to claim that it will start the process of nominating the next Commission at the Cologne European Council set for 3 June, before the European elections!</p>
<p class="contents">The method thus proposed allows the necessary involvement of the other relevant and pro‐European political forces in the Commission by means of the Commissioners in important posts. In particular, this does not conflict with the continuing intergovernmental nature of the EU and its institutions, which were originally conceived as having a supranational nature. However, this method is the only way for the nomination and future appointment of the Commission to correspond to a genuine agreement – as specified in the Amsterdam Treaty – between the Council of Ministers and the Parliament directly elected by the people. Parliament would surely gain in legitimacy – because the elections would have a higher turnout – and also in responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission President would gain in authority in respect of the Commissioners and the governments. This is essential in order to guarantee that the Commission is the independent body acting as the political driving force of the European Union and defining the Community interest, as is provided for in the Treaties. It is not the administrative secretariat of a Council, easily dominated by the large Member States. It is clear that this system would involve a strengthening of the political responsibility of the Commission and its Members who would be considered individually by Parliament, and this would certainly be welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The experience of the appointment and performance of the Santer Commission and the circumstances which caused this motion of censure demonstrate that <span class="italic">realpolitik</span> has not led in this case to satisfactory solutions, be it for the EU and its prestige, be it for the Member States and their citizens, or be it for the European Parliament and its irreplaceable role in the construction of a European democracy.</p>

The most frequent criticism relates to the European Commission"s lack of direct democratic base, which is partly due to the more or less secret negotiations it holds and the balances it strikes without most of the electorate knowing.</p>
<p class="contents">The single currency is in place, enlargement continues according to its own criteria, and in six months the European Parliament elections will take place. It would therefore be highly appropriate for European democracy to fully commit itself to a broader process of reforming the Commission. To satisfy some 370 million Europeans it is time to seriously consider nominating candidates for the presidency of the European Commission in the elections next June to allow them enough time to present a genuine political programme. It would also enable the person nominated to be accompanied by Commissioners who have been selected from among the elected representatives of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 214 of the Amsterdam Treaty confers new powers on the European Parliament and brings the Commission"s term of office into line with that of the European Parliament. It is therefore perfectly possible for this proposal to be implemented in time for the June 1999 deadline. The advantage of this would be twofold: it would make the electoral campaign more dynamic by upping the stakes, namely European policy for the next five years, and it would also create a more independent European Commission, one that would better implement Community law and do so with respect for political equilibrium.</p>
<p class="contents">A more tangible Europe, and one which is closer to its citizens, has never seemed as realistic and feasible as it is now, thanks to the Brok report. I therefore approve of its provisions and as it is the beginning of a new year, I should like to express my wish to see the majority of us commit ourselves to this aim, an aim which the majority of Europeans are hoping will be achieved.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Berthu </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN), </span><span class="italic"> in writing. – (FR) </span>Grand federalist moves to definitively transform the European Commission into the government of Europe are once again in full swing.</p>
<p class="contents">Last October, the President of the European Parliament in this House welcomed the new role conferred on the Commission by the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties, which according to him involve the Commission exercising political, legislative and budgetary management. Today, through the Brok report, the Committee on Institutional Affairs takes over by trying to create new provisions in the Amsterdam Treaty, the ‘catalyst for fundamental changes in Community interinstitutional relations".</p>
<p class="contents">The new provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty are deliberately quite unclear, in line with the tried and tested federalist way. In any case they have never been clearly explained to the citizens, as the debate currently taking place in France goes to show. For example, amendments to Articles 158(2) (appointment of the President and Members of the Commission) and 163 (internal organisation of the Commission) help the Committee on Institutional Affairs to twist its interpretation of the Treaty according to the federalist view. This view sees the gradual transformation of the Commission into a sort of government of the Union, invested by Parliament on the basis of a programme of ‘political guidelines" which reflects the results of the last European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal basis is exploited for the good of the cause. In particular, the ‘political guidelines"<span class="italic"> </span> evoked in Article 163 of the Treaty are, in the context of this Article, aimed at constituting the Commission"s instrument of internal discipline and not an ‘investiture programme". Furthermore, such a programme certainly does not exist under Article 158, which deals with the Commission"s appointment.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally speaking, the Commission"s shift towards government status, as recommended in the Brok report, in our view goes against the nature of the Union and as a consequence, beyond the terms of the Amsterdam Treaty. In fact, despite its ambiguities, the Treaty leaves the Council the right of initiative in choosing the nominees for the Commissioners" posts and the power to finally appoint the new Commission (Article 158). These provisions should also be viewed in the light of the Treaty as a whole, which leaves the Member States the most important role, both under Article D, which entrusts the European Council with responsibility for providing the Union with the necessary impetus and defining the general political guidelines thereof, and Article 145, which gives the Council the power to take decisions, coordinate economic policies, and confer implementing powers on the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, notwithstanding federalist eagerness to exploit the new Amsterdam provisions to their own ends (which was only to be expected) we are firmly convinced that the Council should retain its pivotal role in accordance with the general thrust of the Treaty and the Union's status as an association of States. In fact, we should like to consolidate this role by making the Commission itself accountable to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the idea of the ‘Commission"s independence", on which the report lays great emphasis, is, in our view, extremely ambiguous. Although we agree that the Commission's independence vis‐à‐vis pressure groups should be enhanced (and, indeed, have tabled amendments seeking to ensure this), we do not believe it to be of the least use vis‐à‐vis the democratically elected governments meeting within the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As I emphasised yesterday in the general debate, the theory of the Commission"s independence has induced a feeling of superiority which is largely responsible for the lax behaviour noted today. Fraud is the natural outcome of poor European institutional planning. We must not increase but reduce the Commission"s independence, and we must reduce the excessive privileges this body enjoys: a monopoly on initiative, self‐regulation, discretionary powers, and so on.</p>

We are supporters of this form of vetting of the Members of the Commission before they take office, but we do not think that people should only be eligible for a post in the Commission if they are current or former Members of the European Parliament. There are many other ways of gaining parliamentary experience so as to be able to carry out such a job. Similarly, we are not avid supporters of each group in the European Parliament having its own candidate for the position of President of the Commission as part of the election campaign. The Commission should retain its independence, and Parliament should retain its own independence as a supervisory body.</p>

<p class="contents">I voted against the report, because what the rapporteur is seeking goes much too far. Apart from anything else, it would not be a good thing for the election of the Commission President during the European elections to mean that we got a kind of ‘minister for Europe". The European Commission is after all an executive, and in principle it thus has no responsibility for making policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Amsterdam Treaty gives the European Parliament greater powers in the appointment of the Commission President. Logically, this should mean that Parliament has more influence when it comes to malfunctioning on the part of the Commission. But I think Parliament can use its powers primarily to influence the budget. That does not impinge on the work of the Council which, after all, appoints the members of the Commission and therefore bears the main responsibility for taking action. It seems strange to me that the report makes no mention at all of this responsibility of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the European Commission does not have to be elected on the basis of a political programme, since the Commission, as I say, is the executive arm of the Council and Parliament.</p>

The importance of this resolution lies in the fact that it will not only affect future relations between Parliament and the Commission but also the future democratisation of European institutions. In this respect, this declaration is indeed aimed at all European institutions but its chief justification is as an internal discussion paper for Parliament. This is because it attempts to chart the most democratic course possible for Parliament to negotiate in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">When the public first heard of the Amsterdam Treaty it thought that the intergovernmental conference had been a great deal of effort that had led to nothing much. The Treaty is undeniably complex and those who expected institutional progress to lead to a trouble‐free enlargement of Europe have been disappointed. However, it did introduce a number of new elements which it is our duty to consider so as to fulfil our mandate as representatives elected by universal suffrage.</p>
<p class="contents">Our comments here centre on three of the new elements contained in the Treaty. Firstly, Parliament shall give its assent on the person nominated by governments as President of the Commission. The nominee shall then act in the capacity of the person jointly responsible for forming the Commission. Secondly, the Members of the Commission and the nominee for President shall be subject as a body to a vote of approval by Parliament. And thirdly, the Commission shall carry out its duties respecting the political guidelines as set out by its President.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way we are able to see the gradual emergence of a European Union with an executive body, namely the Commission, which will be formed by two legislative institutions. One of these institutions, namely Parliament, will represent the citizens, and one will represent the Member States, namely the Council. It will be a tripolar structure which <span class="italic">a priori </span> may seem somewhat fragile, unstable even. But we are all aware of the fragility of democracy itself and that the most elaborate structures which aim to respect the rights and duties of everyone are the weakest. This does not make them any less effective even if they do require the various partners to make huge efforts to listen to each other and compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">With the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty, it is obvious that neither the Council nor Parliament will be capable of forming their executive body without first taking into account the position of the other. They are in fact forced to listen to each other and negotiate the composition, political guidelines and operating methods of the Commission. Today Parliament is therefore clearly capable of playing a bigger part in the formation of the college of Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the opportunities that have arisen because of the points I have just mentioned regarding the European elections and the boost they are likely to receive thanks to a process to create ever greater European integration. In short, the main thrust behind the proposal put forward by Jacques Delors is, in my view, relevant. There is a striking contrast between the obvious loss of impetus in European architecture and the concerns of the public. This is because the public feels the impact of European policies on their daily lives but fails to see any evidence in Europe of the democratic practices they are accustomed to in the different Member States. Giving a fresh impetus to the European debate means making the choice of the future President of the Commission a campaign issue in the next European elections and preventing them from being dominated by exclusively national concerns. Lastly, this would also herald the beginning of a genuinely European political life and one which, at the same time, is highly personalised.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns the desire to better politicise relations between Parliament and the Commission and, in this connection, to reduce the Union"s democratic deficit. The public has been surprised to see that the European Parliament – which is essentially a breeding ground that states dip into when forming their governments – is called on so little when it comes to appointing the Commission and the President of the Commission. This goes against the democratic practices of our respective countries. What is more, Parliament"s democratic credibility will only be truly strengthened when, as our declaration requests, ‘a significant number of the members of the Commission (are) chosen from among sitting Members of the European Parliament ..." This, in my opinion, also implies due respect, here as elsewhere, for the balance between men and women.</p>

<p class="contents">That said, it is absolutely vital that the reform of European institutions takes place within the context of future enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">An enlarged Europe including some 20‐25 members would be totally inefficient if it were to have a European Commission that comprised at least one Commissioner for each Member State. The vital reform of the structure and composition of the Commission should therefore confer on it a legitimacy other than that conferred on it today through the national appointment of its members.</p>
<p class="contents">In any democratic state the government is formed as a result of ideologies that exist in representative assemblies which reproduce more or less faithfully the divisions existing in the society that elected them.</p>
<p class="contents">In an ever closer union, genuine democratic legitimacy will always be visible in this House which is elected by direct universal suffrage. It is therefore indeed the European Parliament that should confer new legitimacy on the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementing the report"s proposals in this regard will constitute a further step forward in both Parliament"s emancipation and in the democratic unification of the European continent.</p>
<p class="contents">I should particularly like to highlight once again the vital need for the Commission"s independence from Member States and for the inevitable consequence of this, which is that Parliament would have increased control over it. At the same time the Commission must remain protector of the Community"s interests and guardian of the Treaties. It must also once again become the driving force behind European integration.</p>

<p class="contents">This is a proposal that I endorse, which is why I have signed it.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal to make European elections more personal and more political by encouraging electors to participate in appointing the future President of the Commission was watered down in the Brok report to the point of being ridiculous. This is due to the compromises made between the groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is this the case?</p>
<p class="contents">It is because the Heads of State and Government simply do not want it. Whether they are socialist or conservative they want to go about their business without any democratic debate, preferring a Vatican‐style conclave instead. In short, they are anxious to retain control over the appointment of the President of the Commission without any outside interference, be this from the electorate or from political parties.</p>
<p class="contents">If this continues we may end up with the following outcome regarding the future President of the Commission: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ on 3 and 4 June 1999, at the Cologne Summit, the German Presidency proposes to initiate the process of appointing a new Commission by nominating a President; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ on 13 June 1999 the European elections take place.</p>

<p class="contents">In the conclusions of the explanatory statement, mention is made of going beyond ‘the intergovernmental method to the Community method', and of strengthening the process of integration by ‘furthering the goal of a united federal Europe'.

<p class="contents">In our view, the report goes too far in its interpretation of some of the provisions contained in the Amsterdam Treaty.

<p class="contents">The report is also full of contradictions. On the one hand, it wants to safeguard the Commission's independence, while on the other it would like Parliament to be involved in negotiations to choose members of the Commission, hence ‘a relevant number ... should be chosen from among sitting Members of the European Parliament'.

Nonetheless, we must fiercely oppose such damaging proposals that will lead to the demise of our institutional system, which is revolutionary in the history of constitutional politics.</p>
<p class="contents">By moving closer to the model proposed in the founding Treaties, we will perfect the EU"s institutions and they will progress. Any trend towards developing the Union"s institutions so that they resemble the now defunct constitutional systems of the nation state would lead to disaster. The Community system supersedes the nation state as it governs different relations and realities. The Commission, Parliament and the Council are institutions which can only work together thanks to the interinstitutional way in which they operate and the internal balance between them. Although the governments of the Member States nominate the President and Members of the European Commission, the Treaties wisely put a counterweight to power, the motion of censure, in Parliament"s hands. If Parliament and the political groups were to nominate the Commissioners and the President of the Commission, this essential balance would be upset and the College of Commissioners would be politicised. The Treaties stipulate that it must be independent, not only from the governments but also from any political group. On the other hand, if each political group were to put forward a candidate for the Presidency of the Commission, this candidate would actually become politically dependent on a particular political persuasion and would therefore not have the necessary independence. What is more, this would lead to a tendency to create some support or opposition groups in Parliament which would in turn upset the free political game where all Members are part of the opposition from the outset and have no reason to support either the President or the Commissioners. At every stage of the game, majorities are formed according to the issues being discussed and this is a much more free and democratic system.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Brok"s report is marred by some severe contradictions. It defends the collegiate responsibility of the Commission and yet, at the same time, supports the possibility of calling for Members of the Commission to resign from office. Also, giving greater powers of leadership to the President goes against true collegiate responsibility. It seems to have been forgotten that the essence of these Community institutions lies in the principle of giving all the power to the institutions and not to any of their presidents. The responsibilities belong to the institution and not to the person. It is for this reason that the Presidency of the Council rotates, is restricted to six months and only plays a coordinating role. The President of the European Parliament does not have any significant power either and if the President of the Commission were to have too much power, this would harm the ‘unity through diversity" of the College of Commissioners. The presidents of the institutions have the full authority of the bodies they represent but do not have their full power. And this is a good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission maintains its independence by strengthening and heavily emphasising the principle of political independence and by avoiding the pressure from governments for increased politicisation of officials by imposing national and party quotas. Parliament should also be aware that if it has the power to monitor the Commission, it should adapt its staff structure and its working methods accordingly, instead of channelling its energy into commenting on news in the papers one month after the event.</p>

In order to ensure the constructive development of the multilateral trading system and to bring about reforms in world trade, further work in this area must be guided by the principles of accountability, equity and solidarity. The profits that accrue from world trade should be utilised to improve living standards in all parts of the world and to bring about an equitable distribution of wealth, with the ultimate objective of eliminating the widening gap between rich and poor.</p>

Furthermore, the EU should ensure that a social clause based on ILO principles is incorporated into agreements with third countries. We voted in favour of making a code of conduct for European multinational undertakings based on the ILO conventions as binding as possible.

<p class="contents">It is even more important that the call for widespread respect of a few simple principles and rules enshrined in ILO international conventions be considered as highly legitimate. These conventions are designed to restrict the use of child labour, prohibit the use of forced labour, and guarantee the right to join trade unions and engage in collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has called for this on many occasions and has also expressed its desire to see minimum standards included in a social clause, within the unilateral and multilateral trading system. It has also said that it is willing to support the principle of a more in‐depth dialogue on this issue, within the multilateral framework of the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to demonstrate our credibility to our partners at the many discussion and negotiating forums in which the European Union and Member States participate. How can we hope to maintain this credibility when some of the Union"s Member States have not ratified all of the ILO conventions specifically relating to these fundamental rights?</p>
<p class="contents">I broadly share the rapporteur"s concerns and wishes, but I should particularly like to stress the need to put our own house in order first of all. This is why I urge Member States who have not already ratified these conventions to do so as soon as possible.

This is because we all recognise the need to put an end to social dumping which has corrupted the world trading system as it currently operates within the framework of the Marrakesh agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">And yet, in 1994, not so many of us were of the view that the Uruguay Round negotiations had their place in the 1960s, in a world in which trade generally took place between a small number of similar or comparable countries. However, the end of the Cold War and the globalisation of transport and communications systems meant that countries of socially different levels found themselves in competition with each other. Rules which may be beneficial in a specific context can nonetheless become quite the opposite in different circumstances. Such is the situation we have been forced to acknowledge just a few years after the Marrakesh agreement entered into force.</p>
<p class="contents">In making an inventory of the EU resources still available to combat social dumping, the Sainjon report notes that such resources are scarce. What is more, the rapporteur can only propose optional and incentive measures. One can only agree with the rapporteur"s recommendations regarding the very stringent limits to be brought to bear on the marketing of products made by prisoners. The same applies to the desire to combat forced child labour. The suggestion put to the Commission to intervene in WTO decision‐making procedures to ensure that respect for minimum social standards by the applicant countries is upheld as a criterion for admission is also very positive. We must urge the Commission to rigorously ensure such demands are carried out. It is in fact clear that the decisive level for action in this area as in many others is global and not European. Unilateral European provisions may even backfire on European companies if competitive third‐country companies are not subject to the same rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and the Member States must therefore work at global level to promote the need for binding measures to put an end to both unacceptable working conditions and the phenomenon of distortion of competition linked to social dumping which has a direct effect on European companies and jobs.</p>

We have to have standards for trade. If we do not, there is the chance of certain groups of people being exploited. International recognition of labour standards is a valuable way of preventing such exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore glad to see the Commission making the point that the liberalisation of world trade is not altogether being matched by the recognition of labour standards. We as the European Union must endorse international initiatives in this area as far as possible. But if the Union is to do this credibly, its Member States must first put their own house in order. We back the rapporteur"s call for various Member States of the European Union to recognise and comply with labour standards.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the development of a whole range of independent European initiatives goes too far in the opinion of our group, for example when it comes to promoting education and training opportunities for young people in other countries. We think it is better for us to make labour standards an integral part of our other policy areas, such as development cooperation. So we did not support the rapporteur"s paragraph 19. We were happy with Amendment No 4, however.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in favour of a voluntary European code of conduct, and Mr Howitt"s Amendment No 10 best reflects our vision of this. Later this week, we shall be having a more comprehensive discussion of this topic. Various other amendments are, we think, of little significance and we did not support them.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group agrees with the rapporteur that little has been achieved in the last four years as regards the recognition of international standards. The adopting of this resolution will be a significant step towards an ethical system of trade. We thus voted wholeheartedly in favour of the rapporteur"s report, precisely because it seeks to support existing international initiatives.</p>

<p class="contents">The delay in financing means that the whole job‐creation project is failing at European level. We are all aware that one of the reasons for this delay is the decline in infrastructure investment by Member States that are keen to reduce their public deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">The public sector alone cannot provide this financing, which is why private sector funds are being considered. The Commission"s communication, which is the subject of our colleague"s report, paves the way for such collaboration by setting up partnerships between public sector organisations and private sector investors and companies.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as with any successful collaboration, guidelines need to be set out. A public‐private partnership (PPP) should be aimed at planning, programming, financing and carrying out a project given the go‐ahead by public authorities. And in order to see it through to completion, the risks involved should be distributed according to everyone"s ability to cope with them. In fact there should be some form of guarantee to fall back on should one of the partners involved fail to deliver.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as the rapporteur suggests, for the PPP to succeed, ‘public procurement" directives will need to be amended. However, they must not become too liberal in nature and, to counteract this hypothetical risk, it would be preferable if the notion of public service utilities were taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the concept of the public‐private partnership has the support of high‐priority projects, there is doubtless great interest in smaller‐scale infrastructure projects which are also ‘of major potential value at local or regional level" (paragraph 17 of the resolution).</p>

It is therefore indispensable for Europe to have an efficient port and maritime infrastructure in order to assure the important services offered by this sector. Similarly, it must not be forgotten that ports constitute a crucial factor within the regional economy, particularly in the peripheral and ultraperipheral maritime regions of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission"s Green Paper has the advantage of initiating a broad debate with all the parties involved (port authorities, sea transporters, freight forwarders, Member States) on the opportunities for improving the infrastructure and economic efficiency of European ports. I welcome the fact that the House has had the opportunity to participate in the debate and, as an elected representative from a large port city in the south of France, I should like to make two comments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission document does not deal with the issue of recognising the notion of general interest services pursuant to Article 90(2) of the Treaty. Nonetheless, a large number of installations, services and undertakings in sea ports can be classed under this category. This omission therefore needs to be rectified.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the main objective of the Green Paper is to eliminate the present discrepancies in regulations in the various Member States. This is to enable European ports to be better adapted to the international context and relates mainly to the establishment of financial and competitive conditions. We agree with the Commission"s proposal to make an inventory of the financial flows of Europe"s biggest ports before drawing up a proposal for a directive. This should not be made on the sole premise of banning state aid for this sector, but should aim to correct the imbalances between southern and northern ports in terms of development. The key role that ports play in local employment should not be undermined.</p>

<p class="contents">In our opinion, the ports constitute a fundamental part of the European and trans‐European transport networks, not only in terms of European competitiveness in the world economy, but also for intra‐Community traffic and for the integrated development of the whole European territory. Particularly in an enlarged Europe, short sea shipping is the alternative to road transport which is causing increasing congestion on Europe"s roads.</p>
<p class="contents">The French lorry‐drivers" strike, for example, paralysed a large part of the economy of several regions, and this is a warning that Europe needs transport alternatives based particularly on sea and rail transport. Also, from the environmental point of view, sea transport offers unrivalled benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">An efficient port system can also constitute a local and regional development factor, particularly in outlying and insular areas. In addition to bringing these outlying areas closer to the centre, it is a dominant factor in economic and social cohesion.</p>

<p class="contents">Our priorities for a policy on ports and maritime infrastructure are as follows: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ Easy accessibility of ports and better communications with the hinterland. Better opening up of ports by means of improved rail links with the interior will ease the burden on the road network and lead to sustainable mobility. I would mention here the importance of modernising the existing ‘<span class="italic">Ĳzeren Rijn</span> " link which connects Antwerp with the Ruhr. The port of Zeebrugge also needs better links with the hinterland.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ Greater clarity over the financing of infrastructure, whereby it must be clear that port superstructure does not have to be financed by government.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ It is essential to have the same operating conditions for all ports. This should ensure that all structures which distort competition will disappear. It is no longer acceptable that the Flanders region as a shareholder in the port of Zeebrugge should act as both judge and jury.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ I would also stress how important it is for each port to have a strong local base. Every port must retain its autonomy.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ Finally, the success of a port depends partly on the economic and fiscal policy of the country in question. We must ensure that economic but above all fiscal measures do not have an inhibiting effect, and we must prevent high wage costs and tax considerations from making a given port less competitive than others.</p>
<p class="contents">I support Mr Jarzembowski"s report and hope that we will follow this example in Flanders too and rapidly approve the maritime ports decree.</p>

<p class="contents">There is still some doubt as to whether ports come within the EU's field of competence, or even whether they should be regarded as part of the TENs.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a significant proportion of the structures, services and operations in ports are not specific to ports, and so comparisons cannot be made. This also has repercussions in terms of competition and public procurement.</p>

<p class="contents">Traditionally considered by governments as growth poles, fulcrums of national and regional development and instruments of regional planning, Member States" ports and in particular the bigger ports have today become interfaces between trans‐ocean sea transport, short distance sea transport (coastal shipping) and land‐based transport. They are also centres of transshipment, services, distribution and logistics.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this development, the most pressing problem concerns finance and charges for sea and port infrastructure. However, it must be stressed that Member States" ports differ in terms of ownership as well as in their organisational and administrative structure. This structural complexity generates a considerable number of problems when it comes to analysing the differences in aid to be given so that the level of fairness in competitive terms can be gauged.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group endorses all the points contained in the Committee on Transport"s resolution. But it must point out that another category of ports exists. In fact, some ports or port installations, services and undertakings are, by their very nature, of general interest and should therefore be entitled to aid for specific development projects, contrary to the rapporteur"s proposals. There are a number of modest or medium‐sized ports which serve as a good example of this because they enable links to be established with remote islands. Since these ports enable islanders to receive supplies they are clearly of general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">If the motion for a resolution were to be adopted in its present form, this category of ports would be excluded completely, which would certainly have detrimental economic and social consequences. This is why our group supported Amendments Nos 1 and 3, which would enable this type of port to receive aid from national and local authorities. In the name of fair competition, the public service offered by some ports or port infrastructures must not be undermined.</p>

The aim of such a policy is to do away with the social role ports and marine infrastructures are called upon to play, and to open them up to private exploitation and the creation of more profits for the Community's monopolistic enterprises. Aiming to facilitate the direct or indirect privatisation of the whole or parts of port installations and to liberalise the market in port services, the Commission views ports as mainly commercial enterprises, 'commercial entities' as it characteristically calls them, and is promoting the restrictive application of the concept ‘public asset' to obscure their inalienable and non‐negotiable nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Paper we are debating gives notice of specific legislative proposals, such as a proposed directive on port dues, a regulatory framework for the liberalisation of the port services market, facilitating the participation of private capital in port activities, the adoption of uniform pricing principles, etc., supposedly to improve the ‘competitiveness' of ports, whereas in reality it promotes cost cutting and increased profits for private capital with major adverse consequences for society as a whole, on the pretext that there are prospects for the further development of international trade, for increasing European exports and for intensifying competition against other major ports outside Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the celebrated public‐private sector cooperatives, the Commission is trying in this branch as well to hand over the prime profit‐making activities to the shipowners. It is burdening the public sector with the cost of financing infrastructure and insisting that private capital must participate even in the planning and formulation of investments, and should be granted long‐term exploitation rights. The Commission's statements about the way ports are to be financed aim to undermine public or public‐law enterprises by giving notice of the systematic and strict application of the Community framework for state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is ignoring the fact that besides purely commercial transit functions, ports and port authorities provide very important services related to monitoring the implementation of safety requirements, carrying out surveys and reviews, exercising supervisory and administrative responsibilities, for example in the context of implementing the principle that ports should be controlled by the state, and social services to the benefit of the coastal and island regions they serve.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures are announced for the pricing system, which will result in a steep rise in prices in the name of the ‘user pays' principle. The cost, of course, will not be borne by the shipowners who have been pushing in that direction, but will emerge in the end price, in other words the price paid by the travelling public and in consumer prices for goods. There is no mention at all of the fact that for countries like Greece, with an extensive island network, sea transport is the basic means for local development, communication and the development of tourism, and consequently any increase in transport costs would have an adverse effect on the development potential of those areas. The Commission's plans for port dues will lead to a substantial reduction in the revenues of small ports which have a low turnover, with the result that their viability and operation will be placed at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also serious threats to the rights of working people, while significant job losses are also on the agenda. The Commission is seeking to extend flexibility in the port sector, it expresses reservations about the legitimacy of worker registers, and is preparing the ground so that the private companies it wants to bring into the market can use other personnel, non‐registered personnel, thus giving the green light for an extension of black‐market labour and the employment of low‐paid port workers and thereby abolishing the long‐established rights of workers in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the inclusion of ports in the trans‐European transport networks, we wish to stress that the said inclusion is not intended to secure Community resources for their development, but to impose the involvement of major capital in that sector. We consider that any Community aid must take into account the development needs and characteristics of each region, and not be determined by the choices made by major multinational capital.</p>
<p class="contents">Workers in my country and in other countries too are already disturbed by these proposals, which some governments are already trying to implement by amending their national legislative framework. Already the Piraeus and Thessaloniki Port Organisations – though both are profit‐making bodies – are among the agencies likely to be privatised with a view to bringing Greece into the euro and are in the process of being converted to limited companies. In any event, we will support working people in their struggle to prevent the adoption of these proposals, which hold out no promise of anything good for them.</p>

This is a very important area in which the EU already has substantial strategic, political, economic, industrial, employment, security and defence interests. With a world market for GNSS estimated to be worth EUR 50 billion in 2005, it is clear that a European strategy must be given high priority.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan proposed by the Commission represents a practical step towards developing a civil multimodal system, fully integrated into the trans‐European transport and telecommunications networks. I assume that the ESA – the European Space Agency – will act as the EU's technological arm in this area. I was pleased to note the list of recommendations and proposals made by the committee in its report, and I largely agree with them.</p>

Telephone networks and television channels are the prime users of space technologies, but a great many services based on satellite facilities are also provided to other sectors such as transport, agriculture, fisheries, protection of natural resources, and others.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards transport, for example, satellite navigation could help to make more efficient use of existing transport infrastructure, improve safety and reduce pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">In the fisheries sector, satellite navigation systems will enable widespread and undisputed implementation of controls within the framework of the common fisheries policy, but also and above all they will improve safety for ships" crews.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of agriculture, satellite systems will facilitate control over planting perennial plants (arboriculture and viticulture), the analysis of ground water resources, the control of irrigation, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the next few years new applications will be developed to include worldwide satellite communications networks and new research platforms in space. Everything must be put in place to enable Europe"s Member States to gain a leading position in this highly competitive satellite market which is at present dominated by the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Aeronautical and aerospace activity has developed thanks to cooperation between European companies in these sectors in accordance with their specialisms. As a rule, this cooperation has largely occurred outside the European Community. It is therefore necessary for European countries to adopt a similar approach to the satellite sector. The success of the Ariane and Airbus projects, which were both developed outside the scope of European institutions, proves that it is perfectly possible to build a high‐technology Europe without a heavy administrative technostructure. The example given of the Ariane and Airbus projects, which used very few Community financial resources and in which the Commission played a purely anecdotal role, should serve as a model for the development of this European satellite industry in years to come.</p>
