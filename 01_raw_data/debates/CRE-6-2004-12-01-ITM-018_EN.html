<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gauzès (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I should firstly like to say that I am delighted that, for my first speech in plenary session in this House, there is an esteemed audience present. I also wish to greet Mr Kovács, the new Commissioner-designate for taxation, who is similarly having his baptism of fire today. In view of the lateness of the hour, I shall try not to use up the ten minutes that have been allotted to me. I wonder, for that matter, about the significance of holding such a debate, given that three reports of the same nature have already been adopted and it appears that the political group that requested this debate is not even represented this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">In the absence of any coordination of national systems of taxation of savings income, some residents of the Member States were able to avoid any form of taxation in their State of residence on interest which they received in another State. Consequently, a directive was drafted to remedy this situation, which is conducive to the development of damaging fiscal competition, as capital tends to flow to countries outside the European Union with abnormally low rates of taxation. The lack of information about this income thus hampers the proper functioning of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Council authorised the Commission, by its decision of 16 October 2001, to negotiate appropriate agreements with Switzerland, the United States of America, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino under which those countries would adopt measures equivalent to those to be applied within the Community, so as to ensure effective taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments. Since then, the Council adopted the directive on taxation of savings income on 3 June 2003, which provides for a system of information exchange. Three Member States (Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg) attached conditions to this abolition of banking secrecy. They secured a transitional period during which they will be authorised to withhold tax instead of exchanging information.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, agreements have been negotiated with Switzerland, Andorra, Liechtenstein, San Marino and Monaco. In the case of the United States, the existing framework of bilateral relations with the Member States with regard to taxation makes it possible to conclude that equivalent measures already exist. The agreements between the European Community and Switzerland, Andorra and Liechtenstein were very recently submitted to Parliament and were adopted. The two last agreements to be submitted to Parliament are the agreements with Monaco and San Marino. The content of these two agreements is similar to the content of the agreements that have previously been examined. I shall briefly detail them: withholding of tax at source shared with the State of residence, voluntary disclosure of information at the initiative of the income recipient, a review clause and progress on exchanges of information in cases of tax fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">These two agreements, like the previous ones, represent a major step forward from the political point of view. The agreements will have the effect of ensuring the adoption by the countries concerned of measures equivalent to those which must be implemented within the European Union to tax effectively savings income in the form of interest payments made in one State and intended for recipients residing in another State. This instrument should permit effective taxation, which is necessary to combat damaging tax competition and help improve the functioning of the single market. In order to attain this objective, the automatic exchange of information between tax authorities provided for by Directive 2003/48/EC is an appropriate means.</p>
<p class="contents">With these two agreements, the necessary phase of concluding agreements prior to the implementation of the directive for the countries that I mentioned above comes to an end. The implementation of this series of agreements was initially scheduled for 1 January 2005. It was postponed, however, until 1 July 2005 by a Council decision of 19 July 2004, as the various conditions for their implementation ought to be met by then. It is important that this date should be respected in order for the whole package to be implemented properly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have in Mr Gauzès a very skilled and professionally competent addition to this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself agree that the EU should aim for income policy agreements and cooperation with its neighbouring states. This way we can be sure we are operating according to the same rules as our neighbours. It is especially important to make efforts to prevent fraud and money laundering as part of the fight against terrorism also.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal barriers regarding financial services in the EU’s internal market have already been removed in the main, or they are being removed right now. The function and strength of the internal market depend precisely on how effectively we can agree and implement acts at European level in those areas where they are needed. By this I also mean implementing decisions in Member States and monitoring that implementation, something that is often less than satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, much to be done, especially still in the area of taxation. For example, in January 2003, FEFSI, the European Federation of Investment Funds and Companies, published a study on various tax barriers that investment fund managers have encountered in the internal market. The study said that tax barriers are one of the major obstructions to a real single market in investment funds. These, of course, are not directly linked to earned interest, but they certainly are linked to impediments in investment and capital markets.</p>
<p class="contents">There is thus a need for standardisation in taxation. I do not believe, however, in any beneficial effects of complete harmonisation of taxation. Healthy competition, rather, among the EU Member States and with neighbouring states too, is ideal for boosting the effectiveness of our markets and bringing benefits to end users. Cooperation and harmonisation must be brought about in tax bases, that is, the things that we tax, and in administrative collaboration.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to make a request to Commissioner Kovács. In the hearing you referred to the Tobin tax and indicated you were interested in this. I would hope, however, that you will take into consideration in your future work the view put forward on numerous occasions by the European Parliament that we do not want any initiatives from the Commission regarding matters to do with transfers of assets.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This directive admits the principle that the European Union has the right to interfere in Member States' taxation policies, something that the British Government has always told the British people it will never allow to happen. Indeed, it interferes with the taxation policies of non-member STATES too, and this has been achieved by threats, coercion and bullying. Taxation policy should be the reserve of independent, sovereign states; any desirable end contained in this directive should be achieved by international agreements freely entered into by sovereign states.</p>
<p class="contents">Tonight we are discussing Monaco and San Marino, but this directive will also affect some British overseas territories, namely the Cayman Islands, some other Caribbean islands and Gibraltar, territories that depend heavily on banking and financial services for their economic existence. In the great tradition of European legislation, this directive extends the power of the European Union whilst damaging the economic performance and viability of the victims of that legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the European Union, the British Government has acted true to form in its usual cowardly and treacherous manner. Just as it betrays its own people, it has betrayed its dependent peoples in order to fulfil its higher loyalty to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking on the bright side – who knows? – perhaps this directive may help in time to turn up some of the countless millions that have been embezzled from the European Union. Unfortunately, it is far more likely that those millions along with other perfectly legitimate millions will be subject to capital flight and will be reinvested outside the reach of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask any MEP who values national sovereignty to vote against this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to take as a point of departure the fact that there is a very clear and strong Community interest in upholding the principle of fair taxation and in the elimination of tax evasion. That was the aim of the directive on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments, more commonly referred to as the savings tax directive, which received the strong support of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure the effectiveness of these measures and to preserve the competitiveness of the European financial markets, the Council gave the Commission a mandate in October 2001 to negotiate agreements with key third countries for the application by those jurisdictions of equivalent measures in their own savings tax directives.</p>
<p class="contents">The two agreements in front of us today follow those with Switzerland, Andorra and Liechtenstein, which have already been presented to and supported by Parliament. They constitute an essential component of a new framework for cooperation in the field of direct taxation based on our own savings tax directive, but also comprising similar agreements signed at national level with dependent and associated territories of Member States. All these legal instruments will have simultaneous application from 1 July 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me thank Parliament for this vital support for these two valuable reports in favour of the proposals for the conclusion of these agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing let me express the hope and expectation that these agreements will now be ratified without problems on both sides and so help alleviate uncertainty for market operators as regards the timing for the necessary preparations, in order for them comfortably to meet the starting date of 1 July 2005. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
