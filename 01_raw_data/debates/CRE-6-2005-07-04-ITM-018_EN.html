<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Antonios Trakatellis (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, the directive under debate concerns restrictions on the use of phthalates in toys and childcare articles in order to protect children, who are one of the most vulnerable groups of the population; that is because phthalates, which are generally used in large quantities in order to impart flexibility to toys and childcare articles made of plasticised material, present scientifically substantiated risks.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why six years ago the European Commission proposed the directive we are debating, proposing a ban on the placing on the market of articles which are intended to be placed in the mouth of children under the age of three and, at the same time, supplementary provisions for labelling all other articles. It even proposed a temporary ban pending final adoption of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament called at first reading for a ban on all phthalates in toys and products and childcare articles for children under three years of age and the labelling of those intended for children over three years of age but which might be put in the mouths of children under three years of age.</p>
<p class="contents">It has taken five full years after the first reading by Parliament for the Member States to reach a common position in the Council. After five years, therefore, of discussions – not to say inertia – the Council issued a common position; however, it made significant changes both to the Commission's proposal for a directive and the European Parliament's first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the six phthalates are no longer treated as substances in the same category or as posing the same danger to children's health on the basis of scientific reports by the competent scientific committee. The Council divides them into two categories:</p>
<p class="contents">for the first category of three phthalates, namely, DEHP, DBP and BBP, a total ban is proposed on all toys and childcare articles, because the risk assessment showed that these substances are carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic. Here the Council position is perfectly clear.</p>
<p class="contents">For the second category of the other three phthalates, namely DINP, DIDP and DNOP, the Council proposed a partial ban; to be specific, they are banned for children under three years of age and, for articles which may come into contact with the mouth, it allows them both to be used and, of course, to be placed on the market for children over three years of age.</p>
<p class="contents">There would be no problem if we did not have the relevant expert opinion by the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment and there was no uncertainty as to the safety of these substances. I can tell you that there are experimental data on rats and mice which show that these three substances cause neoplasm in the liver and kidneys. In all events, there is no full assessment of the repercussions on man and, consequently, the relevant risk assessment has not been concluded. However, account must be taken of the principle of precaution, which the Council does by banning these compounds for all toys and childcare articles for children under three years of age, but allowing them for children over three years of age, but without any safety valve, such as labelling for parents' information.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we ended up by calling for a ban on the three phthalates intended to come into contact with the mouth or in toys and childcare articles which may come into contact with the mouth and we called on the European Commission to draft guidelines for the implementation of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">To cut a long story short, following the resolution by the European Parliament, there was clearly still room for unofficial talks with the Council in the presence of the Commission. We finally reached an agreement. The package of agreements contains the following:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a ban on the use of the three phthalates in all articles which children may place in their mouths; secondly, a review of all the applications which contain the substances in question for medical appliances; thirdly, the inclusion of child hygiene articles in the definition of childcare articles; fourthly, the adoption by the European Commission of guidelines on what is meant by toys and childcare articles which may be placed in children's mouths and, finally, the Commission study on the risks of plastic articles containing fragrances.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very satisfied with the result, because the Council was finally persuaded by Parliament's arguments that it is not possible, given that there is cause for concern about a substance, for that substance to be allowed for children over three years of age and only to be banned for children under three years of age.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to recommend without reservation that Parliament vote for these agreed amendments at which, I repeat, we arrived with the Council and with the European Commission. I am sure that we shall thus avoid tiresome official conciliation and that this directive will be published and will become part of Community legislation straight after the vote at second reading and I hope that it will be passed tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask that we do not move away from this package of agreements which we have achieved and, consequently, that we vote in favour of what is being proposed by the five groups, by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When, in 1999, the Commission forwarded to the Council and Parliament its proposal for restrictions on phthalates in toys and childcare articles, it did not expect so much time to elapse before this directive was eventually adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">It did not at first appear possible to bring together in a compromise the divergent views held at Council level, and so the Member States decided to defer their decision until a series of risk assessments had been carried out in accordance with Regulation 793/93.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, however, think it is important that it be said that the children of Europe were not, at this point, in any sort of danger, as the Commission, in a decision under the General Product Safety Directive, had called on the Member States to ban certain toys and babycare articles containing the six phthalates in question, although this decision had to be extended on a regular basis in order to remain valid.</p>
<p class="contents">It therefore gives me a great deal of pleasure that the Council and Parliament have now reached agreement so soon after most of the risk assessments have produced results and the relevant scientific committee has delivered its opinions. This compromise, which will serve as the basis for what will now be a permanent rule, takes the precautionary principle into account without, however, losing sight of the principle of proportionality.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking on behalf of the Commission, I would like to state that it is not minded to accept Amendments 22 and 23, on the grounds that they do not reflect the compromise reached between Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the negotiations between the Council and Parliament, the Commission had offered to make two statements in order to facilitate the reaching of a compromise, and that I shall now proceed to do. The first statement has to do with the compilation of a handbook and reads as follows: </p>
<p class="contents">As soon as a directive on restrictions on the marketing and use of phthalates in toys and childcare articles has been adopted, the Commission, in consultation with Member States’ experts responsible for the management of Directive 76/769/EEC and stakeholders, will prepare a guidance document in order to facilitate the implementation of the directive. The document will address in particular the provisions relating to restrictions on certain substances in toys and childcare articles, insofar as they concern the condition “which can be put in the mouth”, as in the annex to the directive.’ </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> The second statement deals with the use of fragrances in children’s toys, and reads as follows: </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">‘</span>The Commission confirms its intention to address the issue of fragrances in toys within the framework of the revision of the directive on the safety of toys. This will have the advantage of identifying exactly what should be understood as fragrances, of considering the appropriate measures to deal with the risk identified and of ensuring consistency with the other provisions of the said directive.’ </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Let me conclude by congratulating Mr Trakatellis and the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council. Without the efforts both of them have made, it would not have been possible to reach agreement on this highly problematic and weighty matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU’s assessments of the risks of DNP do not show any risk as being associated with its use by all categories of the population including infants.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite that, the Council, drawing on the study carried out by the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment, extended restrictions on phthalates in children’s toys to the age range from 0 to 3 years. The precautionary principle, on the basis of scientific results, was thereby sufficiently reflected in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore regard the Council’s proposal at second reading stage as even-handed and realistic. It takes account of the need for our children’s health to be adequately protected and gives businesses in the toy industry clarity about their prospects. It is also a good thing that we have been able to broker agreement between Parliament and the Council, and so I am addressing my fellow-Members of this House when I say that I am not entirely satisfied either with the way this debate has gone or with the result that has emerged from it. Let me explain what I mean.</p>
<p class="contents">For a start, the approaches we are currently taking are characterised by an excessive emphasis on the precautionary principle. What is the point of warning notices if there is nothing to warn against, and what is the point of bans on fragrances that are meant to neutralise smells? If we carry on like that, we will end up as a breeding-ground for prohibitions and panic. Contrariwise, although hardly any deaths are attributable to phthalates, 380 people a day die as a result of smoking, despite which we have not yet managed to ban smoking from the sittings of this House. People puff away to the point where it makes one’s eyes water.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, by submitting these compromise amendments, we are abandoning our most fundamental function – the drafting and enactment of legislation – into the hands of the Commission. What Commissioner Verheugen has said encourages me to have confidence in the Commission, and so I can do no other than urge continued adherence to the risk assessment with the Council’s position for second reading; then, I believe, we will end up with a positive outcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank the Council, which has also exerted itself in some really basic areas, thereby showing that it takes Parliament seriously. It deserves to be thanked.</p>
<p class="contents">Particular account should be taken of the fact that it is more than five years since this legislation was embarked upon. Almost six years have had to go by before we have been able to get such important legislation affecting our children’s health adopted. We are concerned here with carcinogenic substances and endocrine disrupters. This is an issue that affects everyone in Europe every single day and is very much on people’s minds, and yet such a long period has elapsed. I am therefore all the happier about the result that we have obtained and that is now before us. It is a genuinely positive result. Firstly, the three most dangerous substances are completely banned, and that is of course a big step. Secondly, we are to have the three second—most dangerous substances banned in all forms of toys that can be put in the mouth, and that is of course at the heart of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also other positive points, to which Professor Trakatellis has already referred and which I shall not repeat. I would, however, emphasise that this is a basic and significant example of legislation on which Parliament has stuck to its guns. We have not allowed ourselves to be influenced by the huge lobbying effort from industry. Industry has not been allowed to force through its position. We have maintained our stance that, in such an important area, it must be the precautionary principle that applies. Naturally, a sense of proportion must also be kept, but it is our children’s health that is at issue here, so the precautionary principle must be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">On quite a few occasions during the negotiations, I could not help but wonder if I was hearing correctly – indeed, I almost had to pinch myself to be sure – when draftsmen – albeit only a few of them – spoke against this proposal. Our children’s health was at stake, yet people were unwilling to apply the precautionary principle. I also see that a number of amendments, to which Mr Verheugen referred, were tabled. I presume that there was a translation error, as I had understood them to be parts of the compromise that people were unable to support. These amendments are not part of the compromise. The compromise does not include the parts to be found in Amendments 22 and 23. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This directive concerns the daily life of European families and sounds the death knell for these six substances that pose a danger to health and to the environment, since they are reprotoxic and particularly harmful to the immune and hormonal systems. The scientific evidence is accumulating. I am not going to mention all of it here, but all of the signals are turning to red.</p>
<p class="contents">It is completely logical that the ministers for trade and industry of the 25, in accordance with the proposal put forward by our former Dutch Liberal colleague, Jan Brinkhorst, in September 2004, wished to withdraw these six phthalates from the market. They did so on the basis of the recommendation of the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment. They also did so for practical reasons, as they know that a very large number of substitutes exist and are already on the market, such as citrate for instance.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, Parliament wished to strengthen the common position for two main reasons: firstly, because it made better sense since, from now on, with the compromise, no distinction is any longer made between a child over three years of age and one less than three years of age who puts toys in its mouth; and, secondly, because it is our responsibility as elected representatives of the citizens of Europe not only to say no to these phthalates in toys but also – if need be - to gradually regulate or ban all phthalates.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned, I believe that protecting the health of our fellow citizens deserves better than this fragmented ban. It is difficult for me to explain to the voters that, as we decree it, a dummy plasticised with DEHP is dangerous to newborn babies but that, on the other hand, a needle used for drips that contains the same DEHP is harmless to a premature baby. The danger is strictly the same.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why this legislation must be considered as a first application of the precautionary principle to phthalates. The Commission, Mr Verheugen, has to act swiftly in the area of medical arrangements and in the areas of food packaging and floor coverings. That is the sound legislation that the people of Europe are waiting for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is long overdue, but we are at last able to take action to protect children from these high concentrations of toxic substances in their toys.</p>
<p class="contents">Toys are meant to be fun and they are meant to be safe. Soft PVC toys containing hazardous substances are neither fun nor safe and that is why this ban is so important. It is scandalous that children’s toys containing phthalates could weaken the immune system, cause liver damage and affect the hormone balance, especially when there are other alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur, Professor Trakatellis, for his work on reaching this agreement and I echo his call to Parliament to support the compromise amendments in the vote tomorrow. I am pleased that we have agreed on the ban, rather than labelling for children under three years old, which would not have been effective. The fact that this will cover all toys that can be put into the mouth is also vital as are the Commission guidelines on exactly what this will mean and what products will be covered to ensure the highest level of protection. We have heard about that from the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is a real achievement, despite the fact that it has taken so long and despite the lobbying by the industry. I believe we have come to the right conclusion and that this legislation will protect the health of young children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a success in terms of children’s health and an extremely good example of the way in which the precautionary principle should be applied. Faced with practical warnings from scientific experts that there is a threat to public health, it is our duty as politicians to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">An important reason why we have achieved this success in Parliament is that the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, was so tough and determined in the negotiations. I should like to thank him for the way in which he carried out this work, as a result of which we have been able to achieve this agreement whereby it will be possible also to ban the last three disputed phthalates in toys intended for children of between three and six years of age.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a lot of discussion in the committee as to how much scientific evidence is required for it to be possible to take a decision such as this. I believe that we have sufficient knowledge when a number of the recognised committees say that these products are dangerous and involve risks. We then have an obligation to take action. That is what is entailed by the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another aspect of this decision that I also wish to point out, namely that it is now more comprehensive because childcare products, for which there is quite a large market, are also included. It is important that we have successfully pushed this dimension through in the negotiations and that the products concerned are included in the decision. Obviously, the whole of our group will support the draft compromise with the Council of Ministers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The many products involved are used as packaging, cosmetics, bathing accessories and, unfortunately, toys. These toys are squeaky, soft and particularly fun for small children to play with, which means that they often put them in their mouths.</p>
<p class="contents">Research has proven that phthalates can cause allergies as well as liver, kidney and lung damage. They can also have a harmful effect on the endocrine glands, and are reprotoxic and carcinogenic. The rules currently in place, which ban the use of phthalates at levels exceeding 0.1% by weight in childcare articles and toys, go some way towards protecting children. They are an inadequate safeguard, however, particularly since the liberal economy and the laws of competition mean that legislative provisions are sometimes nothing but wishful thinking.</p>
<p class="contents">The need to inform and educate people about these threats is a major problem. It would be preferable if products made from PVC were to be replaced by those made from wood, rubber, ceramics, leather or other natural materials. We should remember that the uncompromising reaction of any organism, and of babies and small children in particular, to any such detrimental compromise, is disease. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With cancer rates across the world growing at this phenomenal rate, citizens are depending on governments for help, protection and information. Phthalates, as we now know, are used in large quantities. In some cases, a proportion of up to 45% is used to increase the pliability of toys or childcare articles made from plasticised material.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the legislation, but before welcoming the compromise package agreed between the representatives of the European Parliament and the Council, which goes further by extending the ban of concentration in toys and childcare articles to children in general – as opposed to the original wording referring to children under three years of age – we must first obtain clarification as to the exact nature of the risk posed by DINP, DIDP and DNOP to children. I note that there are divergent opinions as to the danger they pose and would appreciate clarification to that effect as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, on the balance of this report and support the general call for more labelling and information for the consumer. I also agree that more research is required to take account of the exposure of children to risks from sources other than toys.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we should certainly be researching into restrictions on the marketing and use on the European market of dangerous substances to which newborn babies, children, pregnant women, elderly persons, workers and other high-risk sections of the population are heavily exposed.</p>

Toys should give children pleasure, and not harm them. And it is for the reasons of safety, and of not harming children under any circumstances, that I greet the report and would like to congratulate above all Mr Trakatellis, mainly for the fact that as a doctor he respects the rule of <span class="italic">primum non nocere</span>, above all do no harm.</p>
<p class="contents">The report distinguishes between three toxic phthalates which should definitely be banned, and three others about which there are doubts, and which should be replaced by non-toxic substitutes.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view there is little benefit in distinguishing between toys designed for children under three and those for children over three, because as a mother I know that often the older children play with the younger ones and with the same toys. It is important to point out that phthalates can enter children’s bodies not only via the mouth, but also through the skin, and can thus cause other illnesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, attention should also be paid to the toys that children put in their mouths. For this reason I propose that such toys be clearly marked, and above all that the phthalates that a toy contains, or its constituents, are marked on them. Using such unsuitable toys as toys for animals is not the answer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our absolute priority should be to protect the health and safety of children. This holds particularly true in cases where we have a direct influence on the issues that are at the root of a problem, and where we are in a position to take decisions and impose legal restrictions that minimise the suffering of our youngest citizens and the incidence of disease in this group. A policy of this kind would be proof of the EU’s good intentions, as well as being easy for the public to understand.</p>
<p class="contents">Research and analysis have shown that toxic phthalates are widely used in the manufacture of children’s products and clothes, and that levels of these preparations greatly exceed the safety standards that have been adopted. Phthalates are chemicals that are added to plastic products, in particular those made of PVC, to make them more pliable. In the majority of cases, these are toys for small children. As rightly stated by Helen Perivier, a Greenpeace campaign coordinator, some manufacturers are fully aware that they are adding compounds that pose a threat to children’s health, but they fail to take into account that it is children who are most susceptible to the effects of these chemicals.</p>
<p class="contents">For as long as governments fail to force companies to use safe substitutes, children will continue to be exposed to the effects of substances that can cause long-term damage.</p>
<p class="contents">Research has proven that phthalates can cause allergies and serious kidney and liver damage, and that they are carcinogens. It has also been confirmed that phthalates have a negative impact on levels of the male hormone testosterone, which is essential for normal male development. At the same time, they cause other tissues in the human body, including those in the brain, to develop abnormally. Current regulations governing the use of such chemicals leave much to be desired, and immediate action should be taken to change this state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a major problem, and so it is to be welcomed that the Luxembourg Presidency and the European Commission have drafted a compromise proposal extending the ban on the use of phthalates to all toys that children could place in their mouths.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of imports from third countries still needs to be resolved. Toys imported from the Far East have traditionally contained high levels of phthalates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very pleased that the common position has been changed and we now have a compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">What swung it for me, when I looked at this for the first time in detail, was that there is an alternative. It is possible to use alternative chemicals so it is quite right that we ban these dangerous chemicals.</p>

Does the Commission now have a timetable for that review and any idea of the scope?

The existence of safe alternatives means that this start on abandoning softeners is long overdue. There were worrying results from tests in Germany on scoubidou cords and plastic dolls, and these precipitated widespread alarm by demonstrating a high concentration of softeners, although it does have to be said that they made it clear that the legislation already in place, which provided for checks during production, was inadequate. The European Toys Directive does not cover the softeners that are suspected of damaging the liver, kidneys and reproductive organs.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference has already been made to the fact that the toxic cocktail is unleashed not only by spittle but also by fat in the skin and by sweat. Poisoning children in this fashion is no way to start them out on life. The ban on softeners that damage the reproductive system is a milestone in terms of the protection of consumers and particularly of children. I would like to see us venture a quantum leap in the second category too, for we could then demonstrate that the internal market is not just in the interests of industry, but also exists to benefit and protect children. Such hazardous substances as phthalates have to be taken out of circulation and replaced by safe ones.</p>
<p class="contents">Phthalates in soft PVC, though, are no more than the tip of the iceberg. I hope that the Commission will produce, as soon as possible, a proposal covering medical materials such as infusion tubes and blood bags, for alternatives are available to these too, and here too we cannot jeopardise the health of children and the newborn in particular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why phthalates should be banned in all toys. The directive is concerned with six different softeners divided into two groups. It is proposed that there be a complete ban on the first group for children of all ages. That is a tightening-up of the Danish rules, in which the ban only applies to toys intended for children under three years of age. It is proposed that there be a ban on the second group of phthalates in connection with some, but not all, toys intended for children under three. This would involve a relaxing of the Danish rules, which impose a complete ban on that group of substances in all toys intended for children under three. The directive permits a limit value of 0.10%, compared with Denmark’s figure of half that amount: 0.05%. There is no sense in distinguishing between children under and over three years of age, for it is difficult for the EU to monitor whether baby sister borrows her big brother’s toys. In order to ensure a high level of protection, I have tabled two amendments involving a health guarantee so that we can be sure that there is a place for all the pioneering countries in the EU. If the proposal is implemented without a health guarantee, some countries, such as Denmark, will have a lower level of protection in some areas than they have at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The international research which measured the content of various chemicals in toys also produced something interesting. Of the 83 toys sampled, in just 15 were there no traces whatsoever of these chemicals. Among these 15 ‘clean’ toys, the majority, nine to be precise, were from a group of plastic toys that did not contain phthalates.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps this was a side-effect of the ban on the use of phthalates introduced at the end of 1999.
