<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haarder,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, thank you for your very friendly welcome. The World Summit in Johannesburg took place from 26 August to 4 September 2002. There was a very high level of participation from parliaments, NGOs and trade and industry. The Danish Presidency – the Danish Minister for the Environment – attached great importance to remaining in close contact with participants from the European Parliament. I believe a number of you present here will be able to confirm this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to compliment Parliament on Mr Lannoye’s report, which was adopted in April and was an important document in the whole process. We faced a great challenge. As a leading player, we had to encourage the viewpoints established at the previous Council meetings of Environment, Development and Foreign Ministers in Seville. We had to achieve a good outcome and obtain the greatest possible influence, and that was not a particularly easy task in view of the many viewpoints and divergent interests with which we are all familiar.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the decision to hold the summit was taken by the UN General Assembly in autumn 2000, the same year in which the Millennium Summit adopted the eight Millennium Goals for reducing poverty by 2015. The mandate from the General Assembly for Johannesburg included identifying new challenges and opportunities for sustainable development, as well as policies and means of supporting developing countries and countries with transitional economies in their efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel with the lead-up to Johannesburg, two other international conferences were held at ministerial level: the WTO’s ministerial conference in Doha in November 2001, which adopted the agenda for the negotiating round on trade and development, and the Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey in March, at which an historic agreement was entered into on funding and good governance. At the same time, for the first time in many years, new and substantial promises of aid were given by the rich countries. From 2006 onwards these assurances will increase the total aid volume by around 25% annually.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the EU, we greatly desired to establish development targets in a number of areas that were not covered by the Millennium Goals or by previous agreements. We wanted to insist on the results achieved previously with respect to human rights, workers’ rights, equality and good governance, and we wanted to ensure effective follow-up.</p>
<p class="contents">In a number of aspects these desires were satisfied, and I will now mention the most significant of these.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards globalisation, we attached importance to reflecting the positive opportunities that exist as a result of globalisation and to emphasising the social dimension and corporate responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We were able to define the combating of poverty as crucial for sustainable development in a context that encompasses not only increasing prosperity but also access to clean drinking water, sanitation, energy, better health and equality.</p>
<p class="contents">We were able to establish a number of practical objectives, with deadlines for achieving them, within the areas of poverty, health, the environment and natural resources. One of the most important of these is the objective of halving the number of people without access to basic sanitation by 2015. This should be seen as a supplement to the Millennium Goal of halving the number of people without access to clean drinking water by 2015. Other targets adopted were restoring and regulating fish stocks at sustainable levels by 2015, ensuring absolutely minimal risk and harmful effects on health and the environment from the production of chemicals by 2020 and substantially reducing the loss of biodiversity by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there is an agreement to establish a ten-year framework programme for sustainable production and consumption which tackles the crucial problem of the separation of economic growth from deterioration of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The most difficult negotiations conducted were without doubt those concerning the target for sustainable energy. No practical target, with a deadline for achieving it, was adopted due to opposition from the USA, Japan and the OPEC countries in particular, but we did obtain an objective of increasing the global proportion of sustainable energy at the earliest possible date. What is worthy of note, however, is that we succeeded in gaining substantial acknowledgement of the advantages of sustainable energy at an international summit for the first time. This is the greatest pronouncement adopted to date in this area. Furthermore, in cooperation with a number of other countries, the EU submitted a declaration to continue working on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">These goals and objectives from Johannesburg together with the Millennium Goals provide a concrete agenda for our work on national, regional and international efforts over the coming 10-15 years.</p>
<p class="contents">The assurances on trade and subsidies given at Doha to increase market access for developing countries and support the phasing out of subsidies which distort trade were confirmed. Johannesburg placed greater political focus on the actual WTO process and its significance for developing countries. We now have a great duty to live up to these expectations in the forthcoming negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreements reached at Monterrey on financing for development and the significance of good governance in attracting investment and funding were affirmed. Those donors that had promised new funding in Monterrey confirmed this. Moreover, a number of EU countries took the initiative at the summit jointly to procure further voluntary contributions of approx. USD 80 million in order to increase the Global Environmental Facility to a level of USD 3 000 million, the original target for the top-up.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we were able to establish that the social dimension is to be promoted and that the consensus achieved previously on the role, rights and equality of women is to be adhered to. The EU submitted a declaration on this, since the issue of the role of women was not given as strong a position as we would have liked.</p>
<p class="contents">Importance was attached to the national responsibility for good governance, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We succeeded in establishing that the national sustainability strategies – which may be formulated as poverty strategies – must be ready for implementation in 2005. I would also add that indigenous peoples were also mentioned in the declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to partnerships, the ground was prepared for greater interaction between the public sector, private organisations and private businesses in the implementation of the goals set. In addition, the EU launched two new ambitious initiatives within the priority areas of water and energy, namely ‘Water for Life’ and ‘Sustainable Energy for Poverty Reduction’.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Parliament that the crucial thing is implementing this, turning words into deeds. Johannesburg created the momentum for more effective implementation of the agenda on sustainable development. The private sector will be more involved. There was a clear message from business that in their investments and production they accept their responsibility for local communities and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">International follow-up will be carried out under the auspices of the UN. This is an important issue on which we must continue working. The World Bank and the World Trade Organisation should also be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">These words must be turned into deeds. The Presidency attaches great importance to effective follow-up of both the internal and the global dimension of the EU’s obligations for bringing about sustainable development. In this context we have a particular duty to follow up our own initiatives in respect of water and energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention that yesterday the ASEM Summit was held between 25 European and Asian Heads of State and Government. In preparation for this summit I presided over a conference of Finance Ministers from these countries last Thursday and I am pleased to report that much of the agenda that we have discussed here was discussed with our Asian partners, and that it was decided to initiate a series of preparatory activities between the EU and Asia so that we can ensure that progress is made in Cancún and elsewhere where the WTO process is to be continued. Lastly, I would like to say that it is important that, when we talk about these things, we in Europe realise that, although we may be major players, we need partners who want the same things as us. And both I and Commissioner Pascal Lamy are very pleased that we got as far as we did with our Asian colleagues last week and yesterday. I therefore believe there is reason for a hint of optimism as regards the opportunity to make further substantial progress in the year ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, we welcome this opportunity to present the Commission's assessment of the outcome of the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg concluded three weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in a way rather early to make a definitive assessment of the outcome. Time and our own committed efforts will tell if this summit will deliver where Rio de Janeiro did not. As we said repeatedly at the end of the negotiations, we have the words and it is now the duty of all of us to turn these words into effective deeds.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not over-simplify and try to sum up the summit in one word as either a success or a failure, but overall the Commission believes that we can be satisfied with the results of Johannesburg. We succeeded in adding new momentum to the cause of sustainable development and the outcomes of the summit take us in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course people will draw comparisons with the Rio Earth Summit of 1992. The immediate assessment of some NGOs and others in the period after Rio was that it had been a failure. Now it has come to be seen as a defining moment in the fight for sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The Rio Summit was very different from Johannesburg in some important respects. Most importantly, the political climate in 2002 is very different from ten years ago. Against a difficult political backdrop it fell largely to the European Union to champion the cause of sustainable development in Johannesburg. We were, you might say, almost the only engine in this whole process.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you of how the European mandate was determined. In preparing for the summit, the Commission issued two specific communications, one in February 2001 entitled 'Ten years after Rio: preparing for the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002' and a second communication in February 2002 entitled: 'Towards a global partnership for sustainable development'.</p>
<p class="contents">Building upon these communications the Council adopted several sets of conclusions in 2001 and 2002 in which the European Union's negotiating platform for the World Summit on Sustainable Development was defined.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth noting specifically the Development Council conclusions of 30 May 2002, which list in detail the EU’s priorities. The European Parliament also issued its opinion in a resolution adopted on 16 May 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">In substantive terms, we worked to undertake further steps towards the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, in particular the goal of halving the number of people living in extreme poverty by 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty eradication was the over-arching theme to which we linked all the concrete issues. The Union argued that we had to show real commitment by setting quantifiable targets, with timetables and monitoring mechanisms, in the Implementation Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now focus in particular on some key achievements reached in Johannesburg, which Mr Haarder has already mentioned, but which I think are worth noting again.</p>
<p class="contents">The first element I would like to highlight is that a set of new targets has been agreed as part of the Implementation Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">I will mention five. First, halving by 2015 the proportion of people lacking access to basic sanitation – this currently stands at three billion people, half of the total world population. This new target complements the Millennium Development Goal on access to clean water.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, a commitment to minimise harmful effects on human health and the environment from the production and use of all chemicals by 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, a commitment to halt the decline of fish stocks and restore them to sustainable levels no later than 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, a commitment to begin implementation of national strategies on sustainable development by 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth, a commitment to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010, as earlier agreed by the parties to the Biodiversity Convention. The endorsement by all Heads of State and Government is a major achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement to establish a ten-year framework for programmes on sustainable consumption and production, with industrialised countries taking the lead in this global effort, is another important result.</p>
<p class="contents">On globalisation, as has been said, the summit agreed on concrete actions to enhance the role of trade for sustainable development, for example by encouraging trade in environmentally friendly and organic products from developing countries and by strengthening international action for corporate responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s objectives on energy were addressed in the Council Presidency Conclusions of 30 May 2002, in which the EU reaffirmed its commitment to facilitating the achievement of the millennium development goal of halving the number of people in extreme poverty, and other millennium development goals, by 2015, through the provision of adequate, affordable and sustainable energy services.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with its general position in favour of a focused and result-oriented implementation plan, the European Union also supported, among other things, the establishment of a quantitative, time-bound target to increase the proportion of renewable energy within the overall energy mix.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we were ultimately not able to get a specific target for renewable energy sources in the Action Plan, we did reach an agreement to increase urgently and substantially the global share of renewable energy sources. We also agreed to take joint actions to improve the access of the poor to energy. Those agreements will be regularly evaluated and their progress reviewed.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the European Union launched a 'coalition of the willing' on renewable energy. This includes countries and regions willing to set themselves targets and timeframes for the increase of renewables in the energy mix.</p>
<p class="contents">This coalition maintains pressure on the unwilling, and should give a boost to the development of renewable energy throughout the world. Significantly, this coalition will set a renewable energy target representing a floor as opposed to a ceiling.</p>
<p class="contents">Linked to this, there have been positive developments on climate change. Those who have already ratified Kyoto have confirmed their commitment to entry into force at the earliest possible date and others are urged to join as soon as possible. The announcements made by Poland, as well as by the Russian and Canadian Prime Ministers, mean that the Protocol should enter into force very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission spoke with one strong voice in Johannesburg. As Commissioner for the Environment, I shared with Poul Nielson (Commissioner for Development) the responsibility as <span class="italic">chef de file</span> in the preparations for Johannesburg. We both participated in the high-level negotiation sessions at ministerial level at the WSSD Summit.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, Mrs Wallström has correctly said that I will be talking more specifically about trade, finance and follow-up, but first a few general remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">One needs to keep in mind that Johannesburg was a UN conference. This means delegations must reach consensus. Not everybody gets everything.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Wallström said, we are in a different political climate than in 1992. It is almost as if NGOs and the Group of 77 had given up expecting constructive multilateralism from the United States; as if the US is not part of the equation for sustainable development. That attitude is not possible in the negotiation rooms, where the US, of course, is a real player, as we could see when the US and OPEC members joined forces in resisting targets on renewable energy. But Johannesburg did result in consensus, and that in itself is positive.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me address trade issues in more detail. I have noted some concerns here. The negotiations were indeed difficult. Developing countries focused on trade and on subsidies in agriculture. This forced the EU to put in a strong effort to safeguard Doha as the place to discuss the substance and to avoid, in general, a derailing of the multilateral agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted point 6 in the motion for a resolution, and I would like to point out that I think this is a correct reading of this problem. We succeeded in avoiding this derailing of the multilateral agenda, but of course we had to use up negotiation capital defending what everybody had in fact internationally agreed less than a year ago.</p>
<p class="contents">What is very encouraging – and you could call this 'EU leadership' – is that we avoided a repetition of the disorganised 'agenda overload' that was in fact the cause of the breakdown in Seattle. When NGOs say that Johannesburg was a failure because it didn’t reopen Doha and Monterrey, this is a self-constructed and unnecessary misunderstanding of what Johannesburg was about. The fact that some MEPs seem to share this misunderstanding does not help much.</p>
<p class="contents">Doha dealt with trade in November 2001. Monterrey dealt with financing in March 2002. This helped Johannesburg succeed. The multilateral agenda was better organised for Johannesburg. This enabled us – despite the difficulties I mentioned – to focus in the end-game on the core issues of the Johannesburg Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU will continue to promote its positive agenda on trade for the benefit of developing countries. There are plenty of things to report here:</p>
<p class="contents">First, we are ahead of other major trading partners on market access, thanks in particular to 'Everything But Arms'.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, on Friday, the EU and the ACP countries launch negotiations on Regional Economic Partnership Agreements under the Cotonou Agreement. I can go into more detail if you have questions about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, last week, the Commission adopted a communication on trade and development, addressed to Council and to this Parliament. It sets out what needs to be done to help developing partners benefit from national, regional and global trade. It responds, within less than a month, to the Johannesburg Political Declaration and the call for increased Trade-Related Assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">The relevant Doha provisions are quoted throughout the text. The Johannesburg text also calls for the successful completion of the Doha Agenda, placing the needs of developing countries at the heart of negotiations, but without interfering with its negotiations on subsidies and tariffs. On subsidies, the Johannesburg text directly quotes the Council's conclusions. The text also reaffirms the text on access to medicines and TRIPs.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the Johannesburg text on trade and finance is in line with the mandate given by the Development Council on 30 May. That is not a bad result.</p>
<p class="contents">The message from southern delegations was nevertheless loud and clear: 'The North must show that it is serious about Doha being a development round'. That is a rather useful reminder which we, from the Commission side, welcome and find meaningful.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding finances, Johannesburg fully reconfirmed the millennium development goals, also adding a few new, important targets. Sustainable development remains the core objective of the Johannesburg political declaration, and this gives us a coherent framework for implementing the outcome of all major UN conferences.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against poverty was given high priority throughout the chapters of the Plan of Implementation. It is a step forward that the summit explicitly prioritised fighting poverty in pursuing targets such as access to energy, water and sanitation, and equitable sharing of the benefits of biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have sound, common yardsticks for whether the community of nations is doing enough. The agreed language on finance ensures a dynamic post-Monterrey process, thereby maintaining the pressure for more ODA. You will not be surprised to hear, however, that I think donors should be doing a lot more. If you want concrete answers as to where the EU is going, you should look at 2003 fiscal budgets for each of the EU Member States. That is what I will do.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the role of the European Parliament – there has been some debate on the role of Members of this Parliament at the summit, and on collaboration with the Commission. Since some of these remarks have been made in public, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly react.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission was pleased to accept a substantial presence from the Parliament in the Union's delegation, as has been the case for all major UN conferences. Members followed the summit actively and interacted with the Commission in briefings, summit events, side-events and so on, all in the interests of representing Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As agreed between the institutions, Members of Parliament participated in delegations as observers and did not take part in negotiating sessions. There was no deviation from established practice in Johannesburg. I think I should repeat this. There was no deviation from established practice in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission did its best to support the parliamentarians. They were kept regularly informed of negotiations, and the Commission listened carefully to their views. Debriefing meetings were held on a daily basis by senior Commission officials. This demonstrates the importance we gave to a transparent flow of information. Both Commissioner Wallström and I participated in this process, and I personally met the Parliament delegation three times during the summit, not to mention the Parliamentary side-events I attended, including two events organised by the Green party.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this was done within the current framework, a framework referred to explicitly in President Prodi's letter agreeing to parliamentary participation. I pointed out to Members of Parliament raising this issue in Johannesburg during the summit, as I had to, that we had not come there with new rules and that it was not in our power in Johannesburg to change these arrangements. Any such changes require a tripartite decision involving the Commission, Council and European Parliament. If being a loyal custodian of what has been agreed to makes one ancient, I prefer that, rather than trying to be modern if that means not being able to respect what has been agreed to.</p>
<p class="contents">Now a few words on follow-up.<span class="italic"> </span>Partnerships between governments, business and civil society will be necessary to deliver the commitments made in Johannesburg. We welcome the more than 200 partnerships launched at the summit. These partnerships will hopefully bring additional resources and expertise, and mobilise action at all levels.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is the quality and size of the partnerships that matter, not the numbers as such. The Cotonou Agreement is 'only' one partnership, but it covers 15 EU Member States, 77 developing countries, and has a financial protocol of EUR 15.2 billion. We are not starting from scratch.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission will focus on securing strong EU implementation of the two EU-wide partnerships on water and energy launched in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="contents">During the summit, the EU signed with its African partners a strategic EU-Africa partnership on water and sanitation. In conjunction with the EU Water Initiative, this is an important step towards the development of concrete actions building on strong ownership and commitment from African partners.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, it is clear that the effective implementation of the outcome of Johannesburg means translating intentions into action through development cooperation undertaken regionally and nationally as well as locally.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must continue to take the lead. The European Council has already agreed to review, at its Spring meeting in 2003, the EU strategy for sustainable development, with a focus on putting into practice the commitments undertaken in Johannesburg. To prepare this review, the Commission intends to submit proposals building on the communication 'Towards a Global Partnership for Sustainable Development' issued earlier this year. Internally, one of the main issues to be addressed in the synthesis report for next Spring's European Council should be how to move towards more sustainable consumption and production patterns in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I would conclude by saying that the European Union can be satisfied with the role it played in Johannesburg; and by stressing 'European <span class="italic">Union</span>'. The cooperation between Commission and Council was also a very positive experience.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU clearly came with the longest wish list. But of course, the higher the level of ambition, the greater the scope for disappointment. NGOs and the press focus on these shortcomings. So be it. But as responsible politicians, we must be careful not to draw the conclusion that we, for this reason, should be less ambitious in the future. The Commission does not believe the EU – and indeed the world – can afford to be less ambitious.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hulthén (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV) </span>Mr President, I should like to thank the Danish Presidency and the Commission. I want to begin in a positive mood and say that I fully agree with the Commission and the Council that we should not be too critical and negative about the result of the Johannesburg Summit. It is not possible to measure the gain that nonetheless results when we see that more people have access to water, proper sanitation, food and an environment with fewer chemicals. I think that we should say that this really is a gain and that we should share the credit together, for, had it not been for the European Union, I think that we never would have got as far as we did in Johannesburg. This is also perhaps where part of Parliament’s frustration lies. Ever since the period before the Gothenburg Summit, we in Parliament have worked actively for sustainable development. Many have compared our wish list to some sort of Christmas tree with an overabundance of decorations. We have nonetheless been agreed on the requirements and on the process we wanted the Union to implement in order to make the necessary changes. Our frustration stems from the fact that we can see that the results have not yet been achieved. If our wish list is considered to be an over-decorated Christmas tree, then one could well say that the result from Johannesburg is more like a Christmas tree with no needles – but nevertheless a Christmas tree.</p>
<p class="contents">Our frustration also expresses itself when we are not able to make use of our abilities and our knowledge at summits. I still think that this message is one that the Commission should take note of. It is a matter of the attitude between Parliament and the Commission. This fact is, however, worthy of a much smaller degree of frustration than the situation we actually ought to be frustrated about, that is, the situation the world finds itself in. This is the problem we really ought to discuss today. The problems that might exist between Parliament and the Commission as to who should say what at the international meetings can be taken up in a forum other than this Chamber, and we should now concentrate on the problem that we actually need to do something about.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good that there is emphasis on us now having to start on the real work. We must ensure that the commitments and promises that the EU made in Johannesburg now find expression in our actual policies and that they are visible in our budget. I should like both the Council and the Commission to return to Parliament in February to report on what has been done up to then and what will happen in future so that the commitments from Johannesburg can be implemented. In this connection, I will naturally emphasise aid. The Member States fall embarrassingly short of the standard when it comes to international aid. There are few who actually come up to it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a few words about the other commitments that the EU has made, for example at Kyoto, and about how things are looking with our own climate programme, which the Commission approved about a year ago, a two-year programme that comprises one half of the strategy to combat climate change within Europe. We come back to the other half, the trade in emission quotas, in October through Mr Moreira da Silva. It is a pity that we cannot also discuss emission quotas in this context, but I will, however, say something about the report that the Commission published about one year ago.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made good progress with what the Commission has put forward, but the Commission’s programme is lacking a great many important parts. Agriculture policy, for example, is still not included, but this could perhaps be included in the programme now since one year has passed. With regard to our targets and the 8% reduction we want to achieve, the principle must still be that climate policy should form the basis of energy policy. This should govern the formulation of our energy policy in future. We must ensure that this is expressed in our research programmes and in the directives that the Commission has promised, such as the directive on public procurement with regard to energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Transport remains the biggest problem. There are no good solutions, a fact that could be described as embarrassing. Less embarrassing are the local examples. The car-free day all over Europe on Sunday is witness to an enormous commitment of a kind that we should make much more often than we have in the past.</p>

Commissioner Nielson, I was astonished by the self-satisfaction you radiated during your contribution on the outcome of Johannesburg. There is little evidence to justify it, and your abuse of the press is of no use and makes no difference.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to speak on the Climate Change Programme, and with specific reference to the ten of its forty-two points that are to be implemented over the coming two years. The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has welcomed this programme as a whole, as we take the view that it is not enough for measures to be taken by the Member States alone. There can, though, be no doubt that responsibility for adherence to the climate change objectives rests primarily with the states that signed the Kyoto Protocol, that is, with the Member States of the European Union, that burden sharing is a voluntary agreement within the European Union, and that the measures proposed by the Commission and supported by Parliament must not be allowed to frustrate these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Committee on Industry takes the view that what matters in evaluating the measures is that the most efficient and cost-effective should be taken first. It is, then, about not providing just for any old measures that cost a lot of money and put the European Union's industrial competitiveness at risk, but rather about making a start where everything can be put into effect as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, as yet, few proposals on how to go about this. Two have been received, one on biofuels, which are the right thing but expensive, and another on emissions trading, on which latter subject the Committee on Industry has made an emphatic call for a voluntary pilot stage up to 2008, and for such trading not to be enforced before that date. It is my belief that this objective and these considerations have to be looked at from the point of view of industry policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been preceded on the floor by four speakers from the Scandinavian states. I believe it to be the common responsibility of us all not to lose sight of our industrial policy objectives and our economy's competitiveness, no matter how necessary it is that we support to the utmost a sensible European climate change programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Moreira da Silva (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, I am going to speak about the Johannesburg Summit. With regard to the Hulthén report, my colleague, Peter Liese, will address this issue. Unlike what many tried to do, and which amounted to condemning the summit to failure even before it began, Parliament set out for Johannesburg with considerable ambition: in other words, we did not join in with the cynical approach of those who sought to lower expectations before setting off in order to be able then to make small victories appear to be major ones.</p>
<p class="contents">We adopted this approach for two reasons: first, because this is what the world required. The world is in a state of emergency, in both the environmental and the social fields, and so achieving a merely reasonable result at the summit was not acceptable to this Parliament. Second, because this was an opportunity that did not arise ten years ago and which will not arise in the next few years. It would, therefore, have been a tragic mistake not to take advantage of this opportunity. We set out, then, with considerable ambition and with a great spirit of unity and of solidarity between all the political groups. And at the end of the summit, I must say that although we moved in the right direction and we went further than Rio, we achieved less than what was needed. Admittedly, some results were achieved, but these are by no means sufficient to reverse the signs of unsustainability afflicting the planet.</p>
<p class="contents">On the positive side, in addition to what the Danish Presidency and the Commission have highlighted in terms of timetables and targets, specifically for poverty, water and health, I would highlight as equally positive the change in the character of the summit. Whereas in Rio we did not get beyond the concept of sustainable development, Johannesburg was associated with action. The nature of the summit took a qualitative leap forwards. Secondly, a qualitative leap was also taken in terms of concepts: sustainable development made a very close link between the environment and poverty. And I think that another qualitative leap was the desire to eradicate poverty and, at the same time, to put a brake on environmental degradation. Thirdly, in terms of the actors: reversing unsustainability stopped being an obligation of nations, of states alone. With the huge number of partnerships approved, the participation of civil society has been guaranteed. Both the public and private sectors are committed to this objective of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">On the negative side, it was obviously a disappointment that no quantified targets were set for renewable energies or for reversing lost biodiversity. I would, however, add a point not mentioned either by the Danish Presidency, or by the Commission, and which I believe is negative: it is the fact that no boost was given to institutional reform in the field of the environment. This summit could have been used to ensure the ‘greening’ of the existing institutions, such as the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation, but also to launch new institutions that place globalisation at the service of sustainable development. I am thinking, for example, of a World Environment Organisation. This issue was not mentioned or discussed, and played no part in the summit, and this was deplorable.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one last thing to say, also on the negative side, with regard to Kyoto. Many people have placed Kyoto on the positive side of the balance-sheet of this summit. I would put it on the negative side. It is true that Russia, Canada, India and China made very fine declarations with regard to the future. What was expected of this summit, however, was not declarations or intentions about Kyoto: what was hoped for was for the summit to lead to the practical implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. And ten years after the Rio Summit, Kyoto has still not begun to exist in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to say one last thing about the role of Parliament and our relationship with the Commission and with the Council. We tend, at these summits, to praise the Commission and to criticise the Council. This time, things were reversed: our relationship with the Danish Presidency was excellent, transparent, highly cooperative and, unfortunately, this time, with the Commission, we did not see the same level of cooperation that we have grown accustomed to at the conferences on climate change with Commissioner Wallström. We have always enjoyed excellent cooperation at the summits on climate change. Unfortunately, this time there was neither transparency, nor cooperation, nor sufficient collaboration.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lange (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioners, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Johannesburg was indeed a summit at which it was no longer the fine and already so often enunciated words that mattered, but the commitment to definite actions. I believe that this was also timely, as what we know to be necessary has long been an item on the agenda. If it is the worldwide acceptance of sustainable development that we are about, then it goes without saying that this involves the alleviation of poverty and the promotion of social cohesion in many countries of the world, that being the foundation stone for sustainable development and for environmentally responsible behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is that I find it all the more regrettable that the current American administration behaves as it does, making use of every tactical evasive trick in an attempt to forestall definite commitments with the ultimate aim of causing its own economic interests to prevail. I believe that this has to be said with the utmost clarity, especially in the light of how the European Union, the driving force behind this summit, tried to get the right questions onto the agenda and also to get to grips with the right targets for implementing sustainable development. This has, unfortunately, been only partly successful, mainly because the world's largest industrial state blocked it. The EU provided the driving force and indicated the right way to go, notably on issues of water supply, sanitation and environmentally friendly production.</p>
<p class="contents">I also found the daily discussions with the Commission good and appropriate, and am also grateful to the Presidency of the Council for, on three occasions, having very in-depth discussions with the Parliamentary delegation, although it is still Parliament's demand that the leader of the delegation at least should take part in the EU coordination meeting tomorrow and be able to observe and comment on the actual negotiating processes.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, you point the finger at the right issues, three fingers are generally pointing back at you, and that is also true on this issue of sustainable development. One of these fingers is our agricultural policy. How, indeed, can we go on the offensive in demanding changes in production worldwide if our agricultural policies and subsidies stand in the way of fair dealing, if our agricultural subsidies are many times in excess of what we give as development aid?</p>
<p class="contents">Second finger: what about a system of fair trade for the world? To judge by the situation that coffee growers currently find themselves in, there is a need for bold revision of the trading system and also of the international financial flows, which have to aim at fair investments rather than the maximisation of short-term profit. The third finger, without a doubt, points to the issue of sustainable policies in our own activities. How successful are we in fact in pointing the European Union's transport systems and private households towards sustainability? We will have credibility in the eyes of the world only when we ourselves can make it clear that what we demand of others we also put into practice ourselves. That is why the climate change programme that we are discussing today is an important building block towards combining environmental policy channels with economic performance and social justice.</p>

Has any progress been made in this ambitious area? Have new definite objectives, and above all, timeframes, been set? Have old objectives been confirmed? A question that is even more important, in my view, is: where do we go from here? Will we go into action worldwide? It is high time we did! Taking an overall view and considering the climate in which the negotiations were held, my group takes the view that the outcome is reasonably positive. It could have been worse. However, we certainly have a few points of criticism. I want to make it clear, though, that we are particularly positive about the role that the European Union played. It was a pioneering role, certainly as regards worldwide commitment to ensuring that a million people have access to basic sanitary facilities and, in their own way, be given human dignity, better health and a better living environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we reached agreement on curbing overfishing, dangerous chemicals, and made multinationals accountable for destructive practices. These too are all firmly on the agenda. We also welcome the commitment concerning gender mainstreaming. We also believe that the liberal ideas, on which we have insisted for so long, are firmly embedded in the plan of action. I am, of course, referring to the fight against corruption, maintaining the rule of law, democracy, human rights and good governance. In our view, these are crucial elements to address before we can embark on new partnerships with developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole and considering the climate, we should count ourselves lucky that we managed to persuade the world not to go in for any backtracking, despite the strong opposition from the United States and some other countries. Indeed, they displayed an unwillingness to reach reasonable agreements. The US, in particular, managed to dig its heels in at every opportunity. This is beyond me. It is mainly thanks to the EU's united stance that any progress was made at all. I saw it with my own eyes: it was the EU at its best. A true world player. A trend setter. The EU set the agenda time and again. This is why we should pay tribute to the negotiators.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have some criticism. In our view, the EU skated over the subject of sustainable energy too quickly. In our view, the new partnership for energy should have been launched in a better way and should have been discussed beforehand in Parliament. My final point relates to political legitimisation, which concerned me, and I agree with my fellow MEPs. I shall not go into any more detail. It is a missed opportunity that the EP did not act more clearly as <span class="italic">Dritte im Bunde </span>[Third in the Alliance].</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, however, I should nevertheless like to express my thanks, respect and appreciation.</p>

I must add that the results of previous conferences, Rome and Monterrey, to be specific, did not give rise to such expectations either. We agree, however, that it is legitimate to expect more than what was achieved. And, basically, considerably more was needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, we do not wish to play down some of the objectives that were sketched out and also some of the time targets that were adopted, particularly in terms of access to drinking water and to basic sanitation, in terms of the use and production of chemical products or the recovery of fish stocks. Not to mention other objectives which had been previously enshrined and which have now been reaffirmed. However, and at the same time, we cannot ignore or gloss over the clear failures seen in other fields, specifically in the field of renewable energies, to which the European Union has been so committed, but in which the results fell far short of our expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we must bear in mind that the means and even the commitment crucial to realising the objectives adopted remained largely undefined, especially if we take account of the deadlines that were set. Despite the fact that, as has been mentioned, some new objectives were defined, nothing relevant or practical was put forward apart from the insipid Monterrey commitments in the field of financial resources, either in terms of public development aid or of debt cancellation. We are aware that a decision was taken to create a solidarity fund designed to eradicate poverty. We also know, however, that this fund has a purely voluntary basis which is not, therefore, binding. We cannot, therefore, expect great results of it. At the same time, this fund demonstrates the clear failure by the developed countries to provide the public aid to which they committed themselves some decades ago. In other words, given the lack of adequate resources, we might once again be in the field of good intentions, such as many of those declared in Rio and which experience has shown have gone no further. Fundamentally, however, the Johannesburg Summit produced no clear and objective definition of the direction to be taken in order to achieve the realisation of the central objective of the summit, and which it took, incidentally, as its motto: sustainable development. We would really like to see, in this field, a level of commitment, a degree of responsibility and a clarity with regard to targets similar to those that have been adopted at the trade summits. It is clear, however, that neither the will nor the political priorities are the same, especially on the part of those that determine the outcome of these events. And, with regard to this, it is worth pointing out that Secretary of State Colin Powell set the tone by making the very limiting statement that trade is the driving force of development and that Johannesburg is an important step on the path that lies between Doha and the future. Much of what happened in Johannesburg can be understood in the light of these two statements placing the entire emphasis on trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This change in the political climate is taking place not only in the US, but also in the EU because we have a much more trade-dominated political agenda than we did in 1992. The Verts/ALE Group today considers that we will no longer be credible in the eyes of the G77 countries if we do not change this and add four cornerstones to our international policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, monitoring is not sufficient. We need a binding agreement in the EU on 0.7% of ODA. Secondly, we must stop export subsidies on agriculture. Thirdly, we must progress in Europe in the area of production and consumption patterns. Fourthly, we must stop trade dominance and restore a better balance between multilateral environmental agreements and trade, and also introduce binding agreements for big business with regard to their corporate and social responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the way the negotiations were handled in Johannesburg – and this is another reason for its lack of success – in the first week we had a Commissioner who was primarily interested in trade issues. There may have been very good reasons why the Commissioner for the Environment was only able to attend for some 48 hours, but on top of this we had a Commissioner who had determined a substantial part of the negotiations, without any democratic scrutiny, in secret negotiations months ahead of the whole summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we were less well prepared with regard to the energy partnership than we were on the water partnership. That was another reason why we were not able to move ahead quickly on this and you, Commissioners, signed a letter in which you tried to readdress the question of the role of nuclear energy in this partnership. Can you give us a clear message that we in Parliament will be much more involved in the future of this partnership, as we requested in our report?</p>

What should have been the climax of the Johannesburg summit – the political declaration – ended up being a weak mish-mash of the special interests of various countries which does not dare mention human rights directly, which leaves it up to the corporations themselves to check whether they are meeting their responsibilities and which erased all mention of the promises made at Rio not having been met. A declaration that never managed to grasp the nettle and change the circumstances that could really make a difference to the poor people of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither the EU nor the USA had the will to make concessions to the developing countries in the area of aid and trade. Both Mr Lange and Mr Turmes have mentioned the EU’s agricultural subsidies, which are quite fundamental. Consequently it was also difficult to achieve improvements in the areas of the environment and human rights. So that was the outcome of hours of negotiations behind closed doors – in sharp contrast to several sections of the declaration, which talk about the broad involvement of partners.</p>
<p class="contents">The Johannesburg Summit provided confirmation of ten years’ experience of the USA as a player in global environmental and development policy. First they water down the agreements, then they still do not sign up to them anyway. Unfortunately, the EU does not have much to boast about either. 'Let us enter into an agreement capable of replacing darkness and despair with light and hope for hundreds of millions of people,' said Mr Rasmussen in his speech at the summit. Sadly, I find it difficult to see where these fine words are reflected in the final outcome. Water and sanitation – yes, those are positive things, but if we look at the promises made at Cairo, for example, and at how few of them have been met, I would like to see things implemented before I dare to trust in these promises.</p>
<p class="contents">Do global summits still have a role? Yes and no. As long as the rich leaders of the world have no real intention of bringing about improvements for the poor people of the world, the money can be spent on better things than expensive conferences and summits. It will take more than pipe dreams to feed the poor properly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rio still managed to be the bearer of great hopes, at least as regards theoretical approaches and fine words. The deeds that ensued were so disappointing that the environmental movement around the world has been virtually struck dumb.</p>
<p class="contents">Kyoto was at least able to formulate an objective. The length of the periods of time leading up to implementation is such as to induce paralysis. Johannesburg was another disappointment in terms of what had been expected of it. Every failed summit does more harm than good, as it brings on a mood of resignation.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all this, I would like to mention the positive things about Johannesburg. For the first time, the European Union set out a practicable way ahead and a definite strategy in the form of the development of renewable energy sources. It is of course a matter for regret that the global one per cent increase was not adopted, but the EU now has the chance to live out and demonstrate, within its own borders, the way in which conversion to renewable energy sources makes everyone a winner, in that, by doing so, we will not only be mitigating climatic disaster, but will also be creating five times as many jobs as we would with traditional use of energy, preserving resources around the world, using renewable energy sources to develop technologies that we can export. Let us bear in mind that two billion people in the world have no electricity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now for us to work hard at demonstrating by our actions that we are actually achieving the objectives set by the White Paper for renewable energy sources. I would like to point out that we are rather behind in our aim to double their use by 2010. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What has been reported by the Members of this House who were in Johannesburg, and also his conduct here today, make me wonder whether it makes any sense to let a Parliamentary delegation take part in such summits in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now, though, to Mrs Hulthén's report on climate change, which is excellent and for which I thank her. One might say that this topic has been whirled back to the surface by the floods in Germany and in neighbouring countries. Although we cannot say that this actual flood was a product of climate change, we are all aware that such events will occur more frequently if we do not take prompt action now. This makes the European Climate Change Programme important, but the actual measures so far proposed by the Commission are insufficiently ambitious. Emissions trading is a highly controversial topic in this House, and the Commissioner knows that Mr Moreira da Silva has my firm support in his efforts at improving the Commission proposal and preventing it from being watered down. The Commission proposal on emissions trading is, however, only a part of a comprehensive strategy. Too little has been done to date in the areas of transport and the Budget, and, if we are not careful, this can even result in grave distortions, for example, to the detriment of railways and to the benefit of HGV transport.</p>
<p class="contents">We are still waiting for the proposal on the energy efficiency of machinery. If we are to have a comprehensive strategy on this as well, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi should waste no time in submitting a very ambitious proposal. I would like to draw Members' particular attention to item 16 in the Hulthén Report, which has to do with the abolition of subsidies that harm the environment and the climate – a difficult topic, but we are sticking with it, dealing as it does with the introduction of a revenue-neutral pollution-related levy for all areas to which emissions trading does not apply. This means that industry, if it wants to campaign against emissions trading, has to ask itself whether it would, in its stead, prefer this pollution-related levy, and I do believe that we will then have a hard-headed discussion on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the reduction of the prevalence of HIV-AIDS – a disease that has reduced life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa from 62 to 47 years – is an absolutely essential target. There are reliable estimates to say that if the present state of the disease continues, every other 15-year-old girl in South Africa will die of HIV-AIDS. One way to combat this is through further development of microbicides. This particular form of preventive treatment can be singled out because, unlike conventional methods of protection, it allows women to take responsibility for its use. The problem is that investment in their development is not sufficient and such treatments are still several years away. There is a real problem in obtaining money for clinical trials.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is to draw the attention of colleagues to Parliament's own work on the Sixth Framework Programme. Through this programme the European Union has given high priority to combating poverty-linked infectious diseases, such as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to mention access to medicines. I hope the present <span class="italic">contretemps</span> about TRIPs and possible barriers to the most modern medicines will be overcome very shortly. There is also a shortage of generic medicines, the cheaper medicines and other forms of treatment, which are just as important in countries where poverty is so rife and where water standards are so poor. It is a priority and the European Union must do all it can to stave off one of the biggest threats to the global population – disease. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, those of us who were there are aware of the positive role of the European Union, which, it is true, was the driving force behind what took place. Secondly, the negative role of the United States, which, for example, put pressure on the countries it could pressurise – and I am afraid the number of such countries will soon be excessive – to prevent an agreement on renewable energy from being concluded. Thirdly, our group – a delegation of eleven Members – attended the official summit, the alternative summit and visited two townships – called Soweto and Alexandra – and was able to see for itself what it means to be without water or sanitation, and with only very precarious housing.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioners, I have to admit that, having visited these two townships, the debates that took place at the official summit seemed to me to be a long way away from the reality that was so close to the official summit, so safe and so luxurious. This is a feeling I have to express and I therefore share the critical spirit of the resolution of the Committee on the Environment, which points out very clearly that, in matters such as the protection of biodiversity, in matters such as renewable energy, there are no clear, concrete objectives. And in those areas where there are more concrete objectives, such as the reduction of poverty, the economic objectives are still not clear. In other words, the summit did not discuss an objective which has been in the public domain for over thirty years: 0.7% aid to development. And aid to development is constantly decreasing instead of increasing. Other considerations are nothing but hollow words if this 0.7% aid to development is not implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that we criticise the result of the Johannesburg Summit, it is true – and in this I agree with the committee and the rest of my fellow Members – that we need to follow up the minimum agreements to ensure that they are fulfilled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that it is true that the European Union played a positive role. I would like to draw everyone’s attention to the fact that if we really want to make progress at this type of summit, we must be credible to the partners who take part in negotiations and discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, however, our credibility is marred by the fact that the European Union, in a whole string of policies, is doing the opposite of what it claims to want to do. If we take the case of the common agricultural policy, the current debate on Mr Fischler’s proposals shows that the majority of the Member States are reluctant to change, are reluctant to abandon the privileges that we acquired in the area of export subsidies. We absolutely must make an effort in this area to withdraw export subsidies and to gain this credibility in countries which are affected by these subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not do this, how can we ensure that, at summits of this type, these people listen to us slightly more earnestly than they do at the moment? They are not listening to us, because we are not credible. I am thinking of the agricultural policy, of the fisheries policy, which we are proposing to reform as well. The future will tell us that if we are not capable of revising these policies, in the appropriate fashion, we will not succeed in gaining more influence at forthcoming summits, because the Johannesburg Summit is not the only one, there will be many others. It is absolutely essential that we put our own house in order before we tell others what to do.</p>

The first is a total ignorance of the declaration signed in Doha, where the European Union agreed to reduce its export subsidies, but managed to insist that all other types of subsidies, specifically the credits handed out by the United States of America and the state undertakings of other countries, should also be reduced. And this is a major victory for the European Union to have achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason is that this wording reveals a completely ingenuous analysis, which states that a unilateral reduction of subsidies by the European Union could solve the problems. Especially at a time when the United States has just approved an agricultural policy in which they increase their subsidies and especially when it is widely known that this new American policy is heightening the depression in world prices. This way of thinking is all the more ingenuous because the USA is the largest exporter of agricultural products to the Developing World, and not only to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The third reason is this declaration’s incomprehensible silence on the European Union initiative known as ‘everything but arms’, which is to date the largest, most relevant and generous offer made by the developed countries to the world’s poorest countries. And the fact that this has been ignored and not mentioned is incomprehensible. In other words, we are not valuing our own efforts. All these reasons, therefore, explain why the wording of items 6 and 7 in this declaration on agriculture is known in politics as 'shooting oneself in the foot': this weakens the European Union, this European Union that has until now been the most powerful force promoting the interests of the poorest countries. This is why it is crucial, in tomorrow’s voting time, to remedy these aspects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is what happened after Rio, this is what happened after Kyoto, even though, in the meantime, Rio and Kyoto became undeniable milestones in the area of sustainable development. The concept of sustainable development has become a chant, a sort of enchanted prayer that is uttered indiscriminately. In my view, it is obvious that there can be no sustainable development without economic and social development – it is as simple as that. Poverty is the major enemy to managing natural resources and protecting the environment in a responsible manner. Responsible globalisation must become the process of a global economic development that makes genuine global solidarity possible. State development aid is not sufficient, even if we manage to double or triple it. USD 50 billion of state aid is not much. Americans spend the same amount of money on the upkeep of their lawns! In 2001, a year that did not bode well for international investment, private investment flows towards developing countries amounted to over USD 200 billion, in other words already four times more than the total state aid. For private investment to reach all countries, we must, as a necessity, negotiate a multilateral agreement on investment protection, which involves creating international arbitration bodies responsible for resolving disputes. No private investor – no ethical investment fund, even – will invest any money without guarantees and without the prospect of a return. In the absence of any multilateral rules, there will be an avalanche of bilateral agreements. There are already more than 1 200! Yet, in all bilateral agreements, it is not the poorest partner who dictates the conditions. Sustainable development needs global standards, and these standards are also needed for investments and for their protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It may suffice to say that it was a necessary, useful meeting, although the optimism of Rio, 10 years ago, has given way to a certain diffidence with regard to the time frames and to the goals to be achieved. The endorsement of both a Plan of Implementation – focusing, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, on poverty reduction, health, technology transfer and trade – and the political declaration setting forth an international commitment to work together to improve the use and distribution of natural and energy resources provides an ambitious goal for both developed and developing countries in terms of restoring the balance in North-South relations in the world and achieving sustainability of development and progress policies. I do, however, hope that the conference was more than just a parade of Heads of State or Government and that it made clear the need for issues related to sustainable development to be given a central place in the international political agenda. Johannesburg revealed precisely the need for supranational governance which can tackle the world’s many environmental, economic and social issues, focusing particularly on the poor and developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The poor and developing countries’ debt is, without a doubt, a key issue too, impacting considerably on the success of the strategy for medium- and long-term sustainable development. In this regard, the issue of transparency, to be achieved through the computerisation of the budgets of the developing countries, is an essential condition if we are to continue along the path of cancelling past debts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully and wholeheartedly agree with everything Mrs Anneli Hulthén has to say on this matter, but I do miss one aspect, namely communication with the citizen. Since the recent floods, the seriousness of any potential climate change is starting to strike home, but few are aware, let alone convinced, of the need for action. I would suggest three points that could facilitate communication with the citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I believe that the citizen must be given clear choices. Although Member States play an important role in this, the Commission can do a great deal to clarify the options. What is the implication, for example, of reducing the maximum speed on motorways to 100 km/hour? How much do we stand to gain? What does it mean if each house were to be fitted with a solar panel or use low-energy light bulbs? Are these merely drops in the ocean or do they make a substantial contribution? If the choices were clear, then citizens could become involved in the subject of climate. Policy on climate could then also become integrated in a climate strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, policy on climate should be placed much more in the context of development. Investing in sustainable energy is costly, but rewarding. At present, 2 billion people have no access to electricity. Sustainable energy is local and can give an enormous boost to development. We should not only send out this message in Johannesburg, but also in Brussels and Strasbourg, and preferably every day.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, a flagship is what is needed. Member States must invest jointly in the development of sustainable energy and energy efficiency. Something along the lines of the Airbus project. The Sixth Framework Programme for research and Article 169 offer good opportunities in this area. A flagship project is visible to the citizens and can play a key role in public awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, in my view, there could be a little more enthusiasm for policy on climate. To date, we have mainly sent out a negative signal and a sombre message. More attention to communication and the political aspects could contribute to public involvement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These Fisheries Ministers came from the USA, Chile, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, the Faeroes, Norway, and so on. They say unanimously that Johannesburg is on the right track with this decision. Rarely enough are there real political decisions. Everyone prefers to rush to coat their personal or national egoisms with a veneer of sanctity, particularly when the eyes of world public opinion are upon them.</p>
<p class="contents">This time, though, there was a real decision on sustainability and on the fisheries sector, which has undergone such a severe battering. This agreement on a point of principle was achieved very quickly. It sends the message that there is nothing more to be discussed, and that now is the time to act. That is Johannesburg's appeal to the world. It is also addressed to us who have Europe for our home and sit in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform of European fisheries policy simply will not wait. It is of great intrinsic value and must not be used to gain advantages in other policy fields by being a pawn in negotiating tactics and games that it is all too easy to see through. That is what is also called meeting each other halfway at the expense of fisheries. Johannesburg was unerring in recognising that. Fish stocks are to recover by 2015. Now we have to get a move on. I hope this will be one of our successes – one of the successes of the European Union within the framework of a reform that is imminent and can be delayed no longer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Great: in a multi-national and cross-party body, that means our message will get through. We all agree, for example, that energy is the largest contributor by far to the emission of greenhouse gases. Some of us think that nuclear energy is expensive, outdated, potentially dangerous and no solution at all to energy problems. But we all agree that transport is the key energy problem: fossil fuels must be replaced by alternatives, and very soon. How? We agree that renewable energy and energy efficiency are key solutions. This was recognised in Johannesburg, but unfortunately, only to a limited extent. However, we should act quickly on this through the EU. Remember that the key role of energy in poverty alleviation was recognised at Johannesburg, and that the new EU programme, COOPENER, on renewable energy and energy efficiency in the developing world, will help to access some of the funding which will be available, this programme is important.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, incidentally, a very strong gender implication to the provision of energy, because of the tasks of women throughout the developing world.</p>
<p class="contents">The failure to achieve targets for renewable energy – a failure for which the United States, to their shame, are largely responsible – can be overcome with goodwill and effort from the European Union. On the matter of implementation: Carrying suitcases from summit to summit does nothing. It is what happens in between the summits that matters, and I urge you, Commissioners, to use your legislative powers and your monitoring ability to ensure that what was said at Johannesburg, even if it is not enough, is carried through. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We heard over and over again that the summit had to change the lives of the poorest people in the world if it was to be a success.</p>
<p class="contents">We did not expect dramatic changes and we did not get them, but there was some modest progress. For example we saw a move towards achieving better governance. I hope that this Parliament will actively support universal membership of the UNEP for environment ministers. This could be the starting point for a world environment organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings us to the central question of enforcement and monitoring. We know from experience since Rio that it is one thing to make agreements but another to ensure they are implemented. We welcome the possibility at last of bringing the Kyoto Protocol into force, but it has been a long and difficult process. How will progress from Johannesburg onwards be achieved? It is not clear. Although the Johannesburg Declaration includes a commitment to an inclusive process, which means involving the kinds of groups that met around the summit, how is this going to be done? Similarly the regional and local level are important. We know how the private sector is going to be involved, but how will different levels of government be involved?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I welcome the fact that the efforts to include biotechnology as an intrinsic part of sustainability were resisted in Johannesburg, despite the efforts of the United States. At the very time when the summit was going on to use a human crisis to try and force GM food aid on some of the world's poorest countries. This takes away freedom of choice, undermines human dignity and works against sustainability. We must continue to resist it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are aware of the critical situation of the planet, the deterioration, the pollution, the lack of natural resources, and the extreme poverty of a large part of the population which means that these people live and die in inhuman conditions, and are forced to emigrate to other parts of the world where these conditions do not exist. And, although it is true that there have been agreements, it is also true that it has not been possible to conclude many other agreements. Mrs Wallström, you said it was time to turn our words into actions, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations also said this, using other words, but just as forcefully. This, however, was not possible and despite the good will of the European institutions, the problem of reaching the agreements that were supposed to have been the minimum basis for solving the serious problems we have in this world was not solved.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Commissioner is right to say that frustration should not mean that we politicians stop making ambitious proposals. Frustration should make us far more ambitious and, even if only by means of voluntary agreements, we in the European institutions, the Commission, the Council and Parliament, must move forward with all these proposals – many more than those on the table – because, in fact, the maintenance of living conditions in the world might depend on the example we set here in the European Union, where we do have that political will.</p>
<p class="contents">If we – each and every country – show this will and this commitment to agreements, programmes, dates – not with words but with actions – the agreements that are currently still voluntary could be extended to other countries and in ten years European good practice could mean that in future Johannesburg will not be what it is today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lage (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioners, I am reminded of the optimism caricatured by the French philosopher Voltaire in the person of Pangloss, which, in fact, derives from the philosophy of the German philosopher Leibniz, according to which 'everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds'. If Voltaire were to return here, however, he would also draw a caricature, certainly a very impressive one, of those that today think that everything is for the worst in the worst of all possible worlds.</p>
<p class="contents">This almost phantasmagoric pessimism that affects many commentators, many politicians and many Members of this House is unjustified. It is unjustified because at the Johannesburg Summit, as I see it, indication was given of the right way forwards, the correct diagnosis was made, and the European Union acted correctly at the summit, and we should be congratulating it on this instead of being constantly critical.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit pointed in the right direction but we must also take account of the fact that the rich countries are going to have to pay for the policies that were outlined in Johannesburg and that control mechanisms must be established to ensure, as has already been said, that words are translated into action. I would also say that the Johannesburg Summit served to reveal some of our fears and weaknesses in analysing the world’s problems. I wish to highlight only one of these, if I may, which is the issue of birth control and the world’s population. It makes no sense that this problem should not be addressed because we fear religious dogma, the type of dogma that Voltaire condemned, or because we fear being considered Malthusian. We all know that it is precisely where the population grows at a faster pace that we see more poverty and more degradation of nature. And, therefore, this issue of birth control, of the global regulation of the world’s population cannot be ignored in any discussion about the survival of the earth and about a more humane life for human beings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me refer to a Danish author, Hans Christian Andersen, who wrote a story that many of us have read, The Emperor’s New Clothes. Sometimes I feel that the debate we are holding is a little reminiscent of this very story. Everyone can see that the emperor is naked, but we will not, dare not, actually say so.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore one of those who cannot in any way see the Johannesburg Summit as a success. I think that it was good that the meeting was held, that a large number of contacts were made and that a number of good decisions were taken. Given the problems we face on this small planet; poverty which continues to spread rapidly, the spread of infectious diseases, the many environmental problems and, especially, the tremendously rapid development in technology in many areas, some form of regulatory framework is required if it is to work well. What we arrived at in Johannesburg is not sufficient. Unfortunately, I am afraid that we will meet here again in five or ten years and that we will then see that a great many of the problems that have quite rightly been identified in connection with Johannesburg will have become worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me raise an issue where I think that the final result from Johannesburg leaves a great deal to be desired. As early as 1992 in Rio de Janeiro it was seen that current patterns of production and consumption are not working in a world with seven to eight billion people. At the same time, everyone wants the poor countries to develop. It is therefore obvious that production and consumption must change. What I had hoped for from Johannesburg was a real commitment from the rich countries to assist with the modernisation of patterns of production and consumption in the poor countries. This applies to energy production, which is now expanding very rapidly, this applies to transport, it applies to chemicals, waste handling, agriculture and water. Every year, countries like China, India, Mexico, Indonesia and Brazil invest hundreds of billons of US dollars or more in new energy production. Most of this is carbon technology. We have a self-interest in helping out with favourable loans, with subsidies and with technical cooperation in order to actually ensure that the required energy development also occurs in an environmentally friendly and efficient manner. Unfortunately we do not have the instruments. I welcome the initiatives that the Commission took on Sustainable Energy<span class="italic">.</span> I think that this was very good, especially in the light of the Commission’s previous doubts about making vigorous efforts in this area. I will gladly contribute towards working out the details, but this is a very limited measure compared with the great needs that exist.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider that we need efforts of a completely different magnitude. It seems as if we have realised this too late. In a few years, we will undoubtedly increase resources in this context, but they are required <span class="italic">now</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by stating that perhaps we simply have too great a level of expectation from this type of international cooperation. I think that Commissioner Wallström made a very true remark in the days after the Johannesburg Summit. She said ‘that it is possible that we must find other ways, that we must identify countries that want to go further, including hopefully the European Union’. We should perhaps create partnerships with companies that want to progress further and faster, with popular movements, with researchers and so on, so that we can achieve greater speed in some of the areas where the situation is particularly critical. We simply do not have any political system at the international level that is a match for the development that is now occurring, where so many problems of different types require common rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to initiatives from the Commission in these areas. I would ask the Commission in each individual case to involve Parliament at an earlier stage. As regards the initiatives that the Commission took in the areas of water and energy, we have never had an opportunity to present any opinions, something which is somewhat frustrating considering that there is indisputable commitment and interest in these areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do think that there are enough Members of this House, who, on finding the king totally naked, would say so out loud in the plenary. I believe it is very difficult to assess either the role of the European Union or the results of the Johannesburg Summit. None of us is satisfied with the results. We would, in various areas, have preferred results that went further.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, though, like to say that I see the European Union's – Europe's – role as having been a good one and one that was also well coordinated. It should also be said at this juncture that, on the most important demands, coordination between the European Union and the candidate countries worked. I am of course not satisfied with the Commission's attitude towards us, or with the information policy. I want to address Commissioner Nielson directly in saying that we did not expect all our demands to be met, but it is sometimes the case that the tone is what matters in music, and at times our side was dissatisfied with the way the parliamentarians were negotiated with or spoken to.</p>
<p class="contents">I took part in this delegation as a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and one of the major topics in Johannesburg was of course the way in which development is financed. It was also clear that we will not go back to the way things were before Monterrey. One generally wonders whether it makes sense to stage UN summits of this sort at short intervals and then end up with little substance to the agenda at a summit on sustainability. That, though, is the responsibility not of the Commission, or of Parliament, but of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">The question I want to put to the Commission is a very straightforward one: how will we monitor the Monterrey undertaking to allocate an average of 0.39% of gross domestic product to development cooperation with effect from 2006? Will Parliament receive reports on development? I am from Austria, and on this point I am less than proud of my own country, which is among those at the bottom of the league as regards support for development cooperation. Now for the actual question. I know that you cannot draw up the national budgets, but what form will follow-up take<span class="italic">,</span> including as regards Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">Something I found quite absent from Johannesburg was the issue of population growth and that of reproductive health. I found the formulations in the final text to be woolly, to say the least. There is reference in them to health and to mothers, but not to reproductive health, which, along with family planning, I believe to be essential issues in sustainable development. I would, however, like to express my gratitude for the clear position that the European Union has taken up on these issues. We know that America, with the fundamentalist states, has stood in the way of progress of every kind and that the requirements of the Cairo Action Programme on reproductive health are far from being complied with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maaten (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Parliament’s task is, in the first place, to monitor the Commission and, in general, the Council's and Commission's achievements in Johannesburg. I think that this debate demonstrates that we can be rather positive about the role Europe played. In my view, Commissioner Wallström was right in saying that the European Union was the driving force behind the Johannesburg Summit. As far as I can see, though, the results of Johannesburg are too insubstantial, but this is actually more <span class="italic">despite</span> rather than <span class="italic">thanks to</span> the EU's efforts. I believe we can be pleased about the role we ourselves played on that forum.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the outcome of Johannesburg is, broadly speaking, too insubstantial. In not one single area have verifiable and firm goals been established, and sanctions pertaining to the infringement of the already weak goals are completely lacking. I believe that this is because these goals were too abstract. Everyone is in favour of cleaner water, less poverty and more education, but in my view, the Heads of State or Government should have directed their energy more towards achievable and concrete projects. The Rio Summit had already taught us that concluding agreements that cannot be enforced is an empty exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, some positive results have been achieved which have been mentioned in this debate. I should particularly like to single out progress in the field of cleaner water, hygiene and the prevention of diseases. These elements are, of course, of crucial importance, particularly for the poorer sections of the world's population. Another positive development is what has finally been said in the documents on fisheries and on energy, although concerning the latter, these documents could have easily been a bit more constructive in the chapters on wind and solar energy and hydropower. Anyway, this too is something which causes no problems in the EU but has run into major problems elsewhere. These texts are upbeat, even the introduction in the text on agriculture and relevant subsidies is upbeat, in my view. It is not, however, the EU that we have to thank for this, of course. Quite the reverse, in fact; the EU could have been a little more accommodating on this front. Anyway, we are all familiar with the internal situation. It is a matter on which we need to reach a better position internally the sooner the better. Agriculture still remains a weak point for all of us in those international negotiations, and this is something we only have ourselves to thank for and which requires our involvement. It is also related to the issue of environmentally harmful subsidies, something that we know Commissioner Wallström wishes to address in the EU. It is a matter related to agriculture, but also to all kinds of other subsidies that we provide in the EU, as this is also done worldwide. The fact that we made little progress in this area in Johannesburg should serve as an incentive to address it within the EU and outside it as a matter of priority.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off with a comment on the role of Parliament's delegation. I did not intend to mention this at first, but since the matter has now been brought into the open in such a manifest way, I should like to say a few words. This delegation was, incidentally, excellently led by our fellow MEP Mr Moreira da Silva. I should like to express gratitude on behalf of our group for the way in which he acquitted himself of this task. I should also like to thank the Danish Presidency. We – at any rate those of my group who attended the Johannesburg Summit – were delighted with the communication at the summit. I am, however, somewhat surprised about the comments by Commissioner Nielson on this score. I can understand that it is disagreeable to be monitored by troublesome MEPs, but it is still necessary for us to join forces more effectively at times like these. We must create a wider support. I think that the MEPs who attended the summit had a positive attitude and that better cooperation and communication benefits us all. The Commissioner struck me as somewhat acidic in his comments, and the environment is acidic enough as it is without the need for an acidic Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that in future, at other conferences too – for this was not a one-off problem, but one that also plays a part elsewhere – better cooperation will be established between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Cooperation is fluid and requires a positive attitude, not only from Parliament, but also from the other institutions, and this will eventually benefit us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We passed our resolutions and we held our debate and, that being so, I have no desire to challenge all the positive points we have managed to find in Johannesburg or what Mrs Wallström has said or what the honourable Members who were in Johannesburg have said. I shall not reiterate them, just as I shall refrain from reiterating the negative points, the specifics, aid, renewable sources of energy etc., issues which my honourable friends have already raised.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, if I may, to comment on two or three other points which perhaps received too little attention. We said before Johannesburg that we need to strike a balance between development and trade on the one hand and environmental protection on the other. This balance was not struck. The Johannesburg text is full of references, reservations and provisos, just to make sure we keep our hands off trade. It is written with one eye on the World Trade Organisation and there is no institution with the same standing and influence as the World Trade Organisation to oppose it. That is a fact. It is not good, I am not saying it is fatal, but it is a fact nonetheless.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point we made was that we needed to incorporate the cost of environmental protection into <span class="italic">our</span><span class="bold"> </span>production and <span class="italic">our </span>consumption in the most practical way possible. Instead of this, which implies certain things, it implies taxes, it implies bans, political arrangements, a whole series of topics under discussion, we have a statement to the effect that we need to change production methods and consumption patterns. And why not? All very ambitious and even rather literary, I think, but it does not say to what. To me, it is totally incomprehensible, as it is to my first year economics students.</p>
<p class="contents">A third point we made was that we would at least try to keep to and, of course, build on and implement what was said in Rio. For example, what has become of the principle of prevention? Why was there a preventive approach? What does this bode for the future? For the policy which we, the United States and others will apply? Why were the United States so insistent?</p>
<p class="contents">A fourth point we highlighted was the policy and international dimension of environmental protection and sustainable development. Instead, nothing was done. And with all due respect, not only was no world environment organisation set up; it was buried post haste before Johannesburg had barely started and all discussion of greater political coordination between old and new bodies, between Bretton Woods and the World Trade Organisation, for instance, with the political objective of sustainable development, was sidelined. Why? How are we supposed to pursue a line of thinking that says we set targets, we introduce measures, we monitor and control and we impose sanctions? Which is the very essence of governance. Governance means no more and no less. Because if all it means is moralising to Developing World countries, however useful that may be, it is too little and it is highly hypocritical on our part. I think that pretty speeches were made, with no targets, means or timetables and we need to keep an eye on that.</p>
<p class="contents">I suggest and request that we think hard. Surely somehow – I think under the Rules of Procedure – the European Parliament should be able to set up an ad hoc committee to permanently monitor the application of all these pretty speeches along general lines to have come out of Johannesburg, so that we can also look at what the Commission and the spring Council bring and what is happening internationally, so that we do not just simply end up like Epimetheus, saying what we like or dislike after the event and with no monitoring on our part. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Johannesburg was not a success. The results were disappointing, but I am pleased that the Commission is now giving a balanced judgment rather than the overoptimistic views it expressed immediately at the end of the summit. In our view, if the summit were to be rated according to the Dutch rating system, it would be given a four out of ten, a fail in other words.</p>
<p class="contents">I am bound to correct the Commission on one point, namely biodiversity. It has not been agreed worldwide that we will put an end to the loss of biodiversity by 2010. The only thing that has been decided is to significantly reduce the extinction of species, while only this spring, 100 ministers in The Hague called for an end to the loss of biodiversity by no later than 2010, as we have also stated at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is, of course, why Europe has achieved so little. Of course, it is true that the United States wanted hardly anything, but many G77 countries are also tired of unfulfilled promises. They were promised more development aid while they are, in fact, receiving less. This is why it is logical that these G77 countries have focused on the traditional fight against poverty and for clean drinking water, sanitary facilities and energy for the poor. This is what they got, which is a positive thing.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, search our own conscience. Too many key players in Europe, particularly Commissioners Lamy and Nielson, saw Johannesburg only as an intermediary step between Doha and Cancùn. That is why Europe had hardly anything to offer to the G77 countries. This is not helped by the fact that we still have not reformed our own agricultural policy and that we consider our own trade interests to be more important than sustainable development. We have not got our own house in order in terms of agriculture, fisheries, traffic, energy and the use of materials.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that mega-summits of this kind will work any more in future. We should move towards UN summits that address specific goals, the prime example being Kyoto. If it is impossible to conclude a treaty at world level, Europe should at least act consistently on its own patch. What we need, for example, is a UN treaty in which multinational businesses are required to issue a social and environmental report that is inspected by independent accountants. We can start with this in Europe. It is also necessary for large businesses, maybe over a 5- or 10-year period, to commit to using the same environmental standards outside Europe as they do inside. Volkswagen is already doing this. After all, South Africa and Namibia do not have environmental legislation, let alone any system of enforcement. We cannot wait for a worldwide regulation in the environmental field.</p>
<p class="contents">Another example is deforestation. Rio failed to produce a treaty, and so did Johannesburg, but there is something we can do in Europe. Why does the European Commission not suggest that a clear label be introduced for timber and timber products? A green label for sustainable timber and a red label for incorrectly produced timber. My group would like to see us adopt an even-handed approach in trade policy. I hope that Mrs Wallström will join in the preparatory meetings of Cancùn and that she will be representing Europe at that summit in Cancùn in a year’s time, for this is the only way we can prove that we take sustainable development seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is essential for a balance to be struck between social, economic and environmental components. Moreover, we should try to achieve this balance in the developed and the developing countries alike. The Johannesburg Summit has culminated in a plan of action which mainly focuses on the economic goals and not so much on the environmental goals. This is hardly a balance, therefore.</p>
<p class="contents">Ten years ago, a legal framework for climate and biodiversity was established in Rio. The Kyoto Protocol has been drafted for climate, but ratification and implementation are still a major point of concern. As far as biodiversity is concerned, we opted for the status quo ten years ago. As Mr Alexander de Roo mentioned earlier, this goal has now been watered down in Johannesburg to a decelerated decline in biodiversity. In addition, the summit did not manage to reach definite agreement on sustainable energy. Despite great European ambitions, and it is certainly no criticism of the Commissioners, worldwide sustainable development has not been given any extra impetus.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, there are also a number of positive elements to report, including target goals for drinking water and sanitary facilities, chemicals, fish stocks, the fight against poverty, hunger and child mortality. As regards development aid, however, the rich nations have for the past ten years been promising that they intend to spend 0.7% of their GNP on it. When will this happen? I would have liked to have seen a deadline set for this.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against poverty can create scope for environmental protection, for it is true that if people have no food, no housing and no clean drinking water, environmental protection is often a concern for later. In other words, we must create a support structure for environmental protection and this is why it is our primary task to do something about the fight against poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">If the agreement, taken from the Johannesburg plan of action, that trade policy should not affect the development of poor countries and is taken seriously in the area of the environment, this will have far-reaching consequences for European agricultural and trade policy. I should like to hear from both Commissioners what their views are on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people seem happy with the outcome of the UN Conference in Johannesburg on sustainable development. Whether my grandchildren will see things in the same light 20 years from now remains to be seen. This is a requirement, however, if we consider Mrs Brundtland’s commitment to achieve a good definition of sustainable development. The implementation of the goals will certainly need to make a contribution to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am, however, convinced that we must take as a starting point the consideration that the quality of life and, in many respects, the quality of the environment in the world too are not declining, as some people would have us believe, and that we must therefore avoid any form of disaster-mongering, and I am thinking here of the – subsequently disregarded – predictions of disasters which characterised the environmentalism of the 1970s, from Stockholm to the Rome Club. This does not, however, mean reducing our efforts to address environmental issues, which are, moreover, the items on the Johannesburg agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two points to make in this regard. Firstly, as, moreover, has been pointed out repeatedly by Members too, I am convinced that one of the decisive factors in improving the quality of life of many peoples and, therefore, of the environment, is the need to open up markets to international trade. I believe that the United States, the subject of much criticism in this House, is right on this point, and I feel that Europe must do more in the area of agricultural policy, agricultural protectionism and other forms of trade protectionism. We would point out that the <span class="italic">Everything but Arms</span> initiative of which the Commission is so proud – and it is right, in part, to be so – provides for the elimination of all agricultural duties and quotas on products such as sugar, rice and bananas imported from the poorest countries. This is the commitment we Europeans have to make good.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the countries which do most to protect the environment are democratic countries where human rights are respected, the countries with open economies. The increase in development aid has been mentioned: that is all well and good, but I would point out, first and foremost to the European Commissioners and Commissioner Nielson, that much of the aid which Europe appropriates serves to fund dictatorships, non-democratic countries, countries without open economies. In those countries, our funding does not lead to improvement of either the quality of the environment or environmental policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to start by thanking Mr Moreira da Silva and Mr Maaten for their kind words concerning cooperation between the institutions of the EU in Johannesburg. I will pass on these words to the Danish Environment Minister, who is today meeting his Chinese counterpart to discuss issues including those we are discussing here. As you know, the EU-China Summit is being held in Copenhagen today, and consequently he is unable to be here.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Scheele wished that there had also been coordination with the candidate countries. I have been informed that in fact there was daily consultation with the candidate countries. I, too, consider this to be of great importance. She says that nothing about women and health was mentioned in the declaration, but I would like to draw attention to the fact that it was stated in very concrete terms that environmental threats to health are to be reduced. This is to take place in accordance with human rights and fundamental freedoms and in conformity with national legislation and cultural and religious values. So there is something included in that.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted Mr Lange’s desire for Members of Parliament to be present at the morning sessions. I have noted it. I cannot make any promises about that here today, but we must learn from experience and am therefore grateful for the suggestion.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people have touched on the issue of EU agricultural policy and there is not much that I want to add to this. What Mr Lannoye and Mr Maaten have said cannot be disputed – that agricultural policy is a problem area when we within the EU, for our part, try to reach agreement on a more sustainable future. I would like to mention again that at the ASEM Summits last week and this week a decision was made at the request of the Chinese to hold a preparatory conference on agricultural policy in Beijing, so that the European and Asian countries can be as well equipped as possible for the summit in Cancún. So things are making progress. At any event there will be opportunity to continue this dialogue with a number of other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I noted with great interest Mrs Corbey’s suggestion for increasing awareness among citizens of how they themselves can contribute, and without referring back to what was said I would like to thank Mrs Langenhagen, Mrs McNally, Mr Wijkman and many others for their committed contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted the literary examples that have been given: Hans Christian Andersen’s ‘The Emperor’s New Clothes’ and Voltaire’s Pangloss who, whatever happens in ‘Candide’, thinks that all is for the best. This is very amusing and we should always bear it in mind since, after all, Andersen and Voltaire had a keen sense of the human urge to forget the cares of the world when it suits us. However, I think that at the end of my contribution I should be allowed to point out that the institutions of the EU did good work in Johannesburg. As Mrs Wallström said, the EU was the engine behind the process. New goals were set and existing goals were tightened up. Certain deadlines were set. Now it is a matter of keeping each other to them, of leading from the front and thereby being justified in making others adhere to these objectives. For as Mr Papayannakis has just said, follow-up is crucial. Now it is a matter of follow-up. I am looking forward to it and therefore before I hand over the floor to the commissioners I would like to thank them for the great work that they have done and will continue to do in connection with the follow-up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is looking forward to this. As Mrs Hulthén pointed out at the beginning of the debate, we are also looking forward to coming back to Parliament in February to discuss how the follow-up is to be organised. All this is quite positive.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one new aspect that is very important: the water and energy initiatives are EU initiatives. We are moving into new terrain. It is not defined only by what the Commission does. This is a 'Monterrey-plus' landscape, because we are about to announce and launch global EU actions, which also makes it quite interesting.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn to the discussion on how we view this matter – whether with complacency, or pessimism, or optimism etc. From a literary point of view it is not totally correct to say that the emperor was naked. He was wearing some clothes, but only his night attire. So one would be justified in asking whether he was half-naked or half-dressed. There is no certain answer to this, just as there is no certain answer to how we should approach this area.</p>
<p class="contents">From the very start – even in Johannesburg when we were trying to respond to questions at press conferences – we tried to avoid using the terms 'success' or 'failure' because it was clear that this would never bring us and the people we talk with through the media close enough to something that was a professional and correct evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, in the course of the discussion we have tried to address the wilful pumping-up or the toning down of expectations before the meeting, which have been referred to as deliberate working methods. This makes a lot of sense, but the truth is that with global UN meetings like this we must calibrate expectations to fit in with reality. We are firmly in the realm of intergovernmental work. Comparing that with what we in Europe could do if we unite is, unfortunately, not fair. Everybody talks about the international society. We do not have one, we are trying to create one. That is where we are. I am pleading for professional realism as to how we evaluate these things.</p>
<p class="contents">On balance, whilst progress was made, we would have preferred to have made much more progress. However, to express dissatisfaction as Mr Turmes did when he said that we did not come back with the whole Christmas tree, complete with decorations, is an illustration of the fact that one has not allowed oneself the minimum of realism. That is the raw material that creates results.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder whether a debate like this is taking place in any other political centre in the rich North. I doubt that the US Congress would devote a day to discussions, as we are, after Johannesburg. It would be nice if this happened, but let me remind you that it would be an error to think that it was only because of US attitudes and resistance to multilateral agreements that these were so difficult. It is a dangerous illusion to think that the whole G77 group is very enthusiastic about these different targets, or committing itself to a specific energy mix within a certain timeframe. This is not how it is in reality. The things we need to change cannot be changed easily.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Moreira Da Silva said some very important things which characterise indicators of progress. They are more specifically action-oriented compared to Rio, but this is exactly what we should be doing with regard to Johannesburg. Secondly, Mrs McNally and others pointed out the closer and clearer link between the environment and poverty. It is extremely important to move closer to reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The balance between the issues of trade, development and the environment has been taken up by a number of speakers. We must remember that the basis on which we were able to work in Johannesburg was very clearly defined by decisions in the Council clarifying our mandate. In essence, Europe clearly wanted, and needed, to stick to the Doha formula. We could neither add nor subtract anything. This was the political basis on which we were able to negotiate in Johannesburg. Some may not like it, but it was a diplomatic achievement for Europe that we came back from Johannesburg with a formula that clearly reflected our words and left the Doha track open and clear, as it should be.</p>
<p class="contents">Please bear in mind that the meltdown in Seattle was due to an overload of the international agenda. If we had not cleared this up, and done what we did in Doha and Monterrey in order to allow the world to discuss sustainable development in Johannesburg, the whole thing would have been one big mess, damaging our attempts to tackle our problems with liberalising, and reducing subsidies for, agriculture. All that is now part of the Doha track. This would have been damaged if we had tried to 'redo' Doha in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the institutional debate is concerned, some people clearly find it a problem that I described the cold hard reality of institutional agreements. I noted Minister Haarder's remarks when he said that he could not promise any changes here today. Strangely enough this is exactly what I told Members of Parliament in Johannesburg. I could not undertake to depart from the institutional agreement. Nor should we regard this debate as simply a discussion between Members of Parliament and a Commissioner. Normally one says that it takes two to tango, but the institutional complexity of the European institutions is such that for us it takes three to tango.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore a mistake to think that this discussion is just between Parliament and the Commission. In fact if people look at what actually took place in Johannesburg, they will see that we did our utmost to try to inform parliamentarians. I would certainly have welcomed full participation by parliamentarians until the end of the summit. Unfortunately, however, after the weekend, very few stayed in Johannesburg until the end. The money spent on travelling there with nine assistants would have been far better spent if Parliament had allowed its representatives to stay throughout the international meetings rather than returning home in the middle. That would have strengthened cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to Mrs Evans and Mrs McNally that an integrated approach to energy, gender, poverty, health and population – a point which was also very strongly made by Mrs Scheele – corresponds exactly with the kind of approach that is required. Mrs Evans stressed the importance of enforcing monitoring. The best method is to incorporate this into the country and regional strategies to secure ownership in the South. Considering what I said before about the lack of enthusiasm shown by many countries in the South to do these things, it is extremely important that we ensure that this is anchored in their own planning.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Scheele also asked how we are monitoring the financial commitments to development assistance levels made by Member States and the Union collectively in Monterrey. Fortunately, monitoring is already available via the reports which are made to the Development Assistance Committee in the OECD. This means that every donor country is obliged to submit information which the Commission will use to gain feedback. Discussions will be held on a regular basis to ensure that this increase is actually happening.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion on reproductive health and rights dominated the last days of the summit. This is another reason why I would have welcomed the presence of Members of Parliament during that time. Article 47 of the political declaration was the result of a huge battle that was fought, day and night, before we finally managed, with the support of Canada, to get the established Cairo terms accepted. These were reintroduced into the text and we avoided a major defeat at the hands of the dark coalition of you-know-who. We ended up with something acceptable. This was an unwelcome drama. It is very disturbing to have to fight for something like this.</p>
<p class="contents">I have covered some of the aspects. Certainly, the enormous follow-up task is going to be a huge challenge. The water initiative – trying to organise regional cooperation in all the major African river systems – will be a huge project. We hope this will also feed into the general effort of trying to create more stable regional cooperation, which again will be good for democracy, stability and liberalisation of trade. So we see the water initiative there not only as an aim in itself but as something which is also very positive with regard to its indirect effects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some Members have taken pleasure in attacking the Commission on the pretext that it has, apparently, failed to communicate sufficient information. In my view, the Commission did a good job in Johannesburg. It defended European positions, even though it was unable to impose Europe’s views on the rest of the world. And although the Commission did not have enough time to boost the egos of certain Members who were twiddling their thumbs in their hotel, it is certainly not a tragedy. I also think that the same Members who criticised the Commission should have at least stayed in the Chamber to listen to the answers provided by the Commissioners and the Council.</p>

<p class="contents">I shall try to explain once again: Let us separate the institutional level, the role of Parliament, from political cooperation. At the institutional level, we want both the Commission and the Council to support our right to participate in the daily coordination meetings of the European Union. This is a matter to be resolved under the forthcoming revision of the Interinstitutional Agreement. Cooperation policy is a very diverse thing and we had the feeling that, in the framework of cooperation policy, the Council was acting with transparency and the Commission was guilty of omission. And this is what is causing us certain difficulties because we were not used to this sort of behaviour by the Commission; we were used to seeing its commitment, to holding joint Parliament press conferences with the Commission and with the Council, to openness, to a real involvement of Parliament, which this time we only felt was apparent, unfortunately, on the part of the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would of course like to thank Mrs Hulthén for the report on the European Climate Change Programme. The idea behind this programme is that, as a consequence of our international commitments and the fact that we are continuing to advocate climate issues strongly, we should ensure that we do our homework and that we produce in Europe what we also want to see in the rest of the world. I would prefer us to be pioneers. It is also a matter of being able to show actual results by achieving the goals to which we committed ourselves in the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, the essential thing has been that this must occur with the participation of all the various parties concerned. That is why we created the European Climate Change Programme. We had seven different working parties that investigated what was possible within the industrial sector, within the energy sector and so on. We have now identified no less than around forty different measures that are possible to implement at European level. In the initial stage we have picked out ten such measures and published this list in a communication. We have included these in this first stage because we have seen that they are cost effective and because they are ones that we can tackle within the next two years. We will then naturally continue with the other areas. We have a new working group that is working on the agriculture area. We must also implement measures for the transport and consumer area and progress within all other policy areas to ensure that we become effective in our climate policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I see the report and your comments as support for our action and I also believe that this helps us to speed up the work by identifying the next stages with hopefully more proposals that also cover other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I had also thought about commenting and answering Mr Liese’s and Mr Langen’s speeches since, as you know, we have also put forward a proposal on the trade in emission rights. This is an additional way for Europe to show that we can be pioneers, that is to say by meeting our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol in a cost effective way. We can also consider this as a training period before it becomes an internationally established system for tackling climate issues. Both these gentlemen have now unfortunately left the Chamber, so I will not go into more detail on this matter. I should like to thank both the rapporteur, Mrs Hulthén and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for the work on the draft report.</p>
<p class="contents">The current matter was not as prominent during the Johannesburg Summit as could have been desired, but the actual summit produced reactions from leaders in different parts of the world who thought it was time to make statements in this area. This certainly gave a slight impetus, but I would have liked to have seen the area given an even more prominent role. We see here perhaps the clearest example of unsustainable development if climate change continues as before. Since this is a global problem, it also requires global solutions. This is why we continue to fight hard for the Kyoto Protocol. We will show the way in Europe through our climate change programme which also includes a democratically anchored process with a number of different groups involved in the work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to make some concluding remarks on our debate on Johannesburg. I sense the frustration in this House, and I think that frustration is probably the black, silent companion of every politician today, especially if you look at the subject of sustainable development. But I hope that frustration also leads to some anger and some determination to actually do something about it. As a result of that frustration, I sense that there is support for our being more ambitious in our follow-up and implementation of all of this. I take that as a strength, and I feel that you are also supporting us in the follow-up work. But we must also address expectations, because expectations were so different and the result must be judged according to the expectations one had.</p>
<p class="contents">What kind of yardstick do you use? Do you use it to compare with the reality? In that case, of course, then frustration is the only answer. We know, however, that it is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Whenever has a UN conference produced something that is really enough to solve all the problems and answer the questions that were put to us when we came to Soweto? How do we get more jobs in Soweto 6? What about shelters for homeless children? People living in those circumstances ask 'how do we get water? When will you come to drill the wells in our area?'.</p>
<p class="contents">Do you, on the other hand, compare it with the goals we set ourselves in our various communications and our Council decisions? If so, we maintain our position that we must be satisfied, because remember, nobody's jumping with joy, but we can see that we were actually able to act on the particular objectives that we had set ourselves. We knew that the political situation would be very different compared with ten years ago. We knew that it was not only the United States causing problems, wanting to hold us back, but also the developing countries. In the whole discussion on energy, they took sides with the United States, because the G77 is no longer a homogenous group of countries, but actually includes oil-producing countries, those that are slightly more developed, as well as the poorest of the poor countries in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">It meant we got no support, other than from small countries such as Switzerland, Norway and others. But for the rest, we had resistance from the other big negotiating groups. We saw that very early in the negotiations, and understood that it would be difficult. This happened not only in the area of energy, but in other areas as well. This lead us inevitably to the conclusion that there is also something wrong in our own approach to the developing countries, when we introduce the whole concept of sustainable development into our discussions with the poor countries in the world. We will have to be much more consistent, much better at actually integrating sustainable development into our discussions and into our aid and our contacts with developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The political challenge was much more difficult than it was ten years ago. Should you measure it against whether it was a satisfying result or not? Or should you measure it against the expectations expressed in the agenda, which was as long as my arm?</p>
<p class="contents">We had a difficult preparatory process in Bali. Too many things were put on the agenda. We wanted to discuss everything because we could see that they were interdependent, that they are interlinked, but one has to focus. Mr Nielson has already said that. You have to focus because you have to decide and balance the agenda in order not to lose sight of the environmental agenda and the green issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We could theoretically have accepted that. We could have made a new round on trade and aid. But then we would have totally lost the concept of sustainable development. It is easy to imagine what kind of debate we would have had. We saw that early on in those discussions, and we said that we understood how important this was for developing countries: we had to find a common line on trade and aid, and not let those two issues take over completely and turn it into a conference not about sustainable development, but about other more detailed trade and aid matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The developing countries asked us whether we could help them in identifying how to implement what was agreed in Doha and Monterrey. That is what we have tried to do – and successfully in my opinion. We managed to reach an agreement early on in the negotiations so as to get that dealt with and allow other issues to reach the agenda. If we had lost all the green issues, the whole environmental agenda, the balance would not have been the right one, either on the economy and social issues or on environmental issues. This was very much thanks to skilful negotiators, and again thanks to the European Union being the motor in these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The tango is perhaps the best metaphor for these negotiations. As you know, in the tango it is one step forward, two steps backwards, and then three sometimes surprisingly quick steps forward. I hope that maybe after this prelude it is now time for the three quick steps forward. We can help in our own plan for implementation and follow up Johannesburg in our own way. We must not let our internal problems and the ways in which the three institutions cooperate get in the way. Let us have a separate debate on that issue, but here let us discuss the substance and see how we can move quickly to implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken note of your views that we should also keep Parliament informed in a more effective way. That is absolutely necessary and we will also plan to do so on the follow-up to the initiatives which, as Mr Nielson said, we presented on water and energy. We will make sure that all the information reaches Parliament. We are learning, and we sometimes make mistakes, but we can also put them right. We should act on the sustainable development political agenda, as we have done on climate change. We must take the lead. We must demonstrate to the world that we are also capable of turning all these fine words into reality.</p>

Which was not self-evident, so whose fault is it?</p>
<p class="contents">Community responsibility for this lamentable lack of progress should not be diminished. The collective failure amounts to a loss of credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">It is ridiculous to seek majority agreements with the G77 countries, who were allies at Rio and Kyoto, whilst the Union’s own plan for a sustainable development within its borders has failed! The examples are as numerous as they are revealing: biodiversity, the subject of a Convention in Rio, continues to decline sharply. Species are disappearing and habitats are being lost forever. The ‘Biodiversity’ action plan is honourable, though it is nothing more than a pious hope. And it is still an instinctive response for many Member States to overlook the ‘Birds’ and ‘Habitats’ Directives.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our essential political and moral responsibility to demand of ourselves what we are demanding of others. The Commission must provide an annual presentation of the progress made in integrating the dimension of sustainable development in all Community policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to restore Europe’s credibility, we must, in conjunction with our international partners, draft a policy to eradicate poverty and industrial processes that are damaging our ecology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
