The same agreement applies to Amendment No 1, relating to recital 4. In the text before us, however, the word ‘up' has only been inserted once. May I ask you, once we have voted, to make that adjustment, so that the word ‘up' is also inserted into Amendment No 1. That is what was agreed between the Commission and the Council.</p>

<p class="contents">I know that you also enlisted the aid of the legal services to try and clear up the situation. On behalf of the members of the Committee on Budgets, I should like to make the following statement. Until the present time, the standard practice of this House has been to decide on interinstitutional agreements by a qualified majority. This means that we reach an agreement on the basis of the last sentence of Article 203(9) of the EC Treaty, which states, in connection with the maximum rate of increase, that ‘another rate may be fixed by the Council, acting by a qualified majority, and the European Parliament, acting by a majority of its members and three‐fifths of the votes cast'.</p>
<p class="contents">You know as well as I do that neither the Treaty nor our Rules of Procedure – not even the new Rules – regulate the question of voting on interinstitutional agreements. In this interinstitutional agreement and in the financial perspective, however, we are fixing the maximum rate of increase for the next seven years. We are thus indirectly taking a decision for which the Treaty explicitly prescribes an absolute majority. Not only for that reason, but also because of the political need for such a decision to be utterly binding on the Council and the Commission and on Parliament too, I would therefore ask that we proceed on the assumption that this vote requires a qualified majority. May I ask you to confirm that?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">President</span> <span class="bold">.</span> – Thank you very much, Mr Samland. I cannot confirm what you are saying. I have in fact examined the report by the Committee on Budgets in great detail and I have asked the Legal Service to give its opinion. As mentioned in the note your committee sent – which I have examined in great detail – and as you have indeed said, it is not stated either in the Treaties or in the Rules that interinstitutional agreements require an absolute majority. What is more, as you are all aware, a past ruling by the Court of Justice from 23 July 1988 states that the majorities required for a decision cannot be stipulated by each institution. This was what forced us to replace in our own Rules the absolute majority, which was used to grant discharge, with a simple majority instead. We came to the conclusion that it was not possible to maintain an absolute majority system when it was not enshrined in the Treaties. This would be an appropriate argument in this instance.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with the Legal Service, I have also examined the argument you have put forward on whether or not this decision in itself covers budget decisions, in other words, whether or not it covers budget decisions which, according to Article 272, require a qualified majority. I agree with the Legal Service"s conclusion that it does not cover budget decisions because the agreement is neither a rule nor a budget decision in itself. Each year, when the budget is adopted, the President must verify that a sufficient majority has been achieved and has been taken into account. Then, when the annual budget is adopted, the decision is taken with these majorities. And you may take a decision that is theoretically contradictory not to reduce certain lines, even though the institutions may have adopted the agreement among themselves. This agreement does not have the force of law and is below the law. However, it is an agreement that is based on the goodwill of the institutions and it has no regulatory value.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, we cannot demand a qualified majority if the agreement has no legislative or budgetary value. And there are rulings by the Court of Justice that confirm this point, which are also quoted in the Legal Service"s report which I will make available to you.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, taking all these factors into account and to avoid making a mistake that might mean we could be brought before the Court of Justice and then lose – as has already occurred on a previous occasion – there is no other solution but to adhere to the Legal Service"s criterion, which states that this vote requires a simple majority. It will therefore be decided by a simple majority only.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to remind Mr Samland, who used a political rather than a legal argument, that this House has often called on the Council to do away with unanimous and qualified majority voting and to adopt agreements by a majority.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a strange political move to ask the Council to do something that we apparently do not wish to respect. This goes against the Treaties, our own Rules of Procedure, the case‐law of the Court of Justice and even common sense, which tells us that, in legal terms, an act is an act and only has the value of that formal act. It does not have the value of its consequences, which do indeed exist but which will eventually have an appropriate legal form, with the majorities required by the Treaty.</p>

We have to be very careful, because if we act on the basis of political considerations, we change everything, we can keep contradicting ourselves. We have already seen that this week.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we need to take this fact into consideration: interinstitutional agreements alter budget annuality, by agreement of the institutions, and they are an integral part of a vision of the budget that we have accepted by mutual agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Colom i Naval report, one paragraph and also Amendment No 27 directly relate to Article 12 of the interinstitutional agreement, an article which alters the maximum rate of increase for the duration of the seven year period. This is an extremely significant and extremely strong act on the part of this institution. Paragraphs 8 and 9 of Article 3 in Annex IV of our Rules of Procedure require an absolute majority of Members. I think that Mr Samland"s objection is well founded. We are protecting ourselves from the Council by demanding that there should be an absolute majority.</p>

This does not, however, mean that the institutions are not autonomous enough to decide to increase the required majority in a particular situation, for example in order to enhance the binding effect ascribed to the maximum rate of increase in Article 203. This is a further argument in favour of the position taken by the Committee on Budgets. We are making a change here and are fixing the maximum rate of increase for the next seven years. The House would do well to ensure that this decision carries the support of a qualified majority.</p>

But what concerns me now, as I would of course be prepared to correct the error, is your own interpretation of the issue, Mr President. This is because the agreement we are voting on, as it stands at the moment, provides for the revision of the financial perspectives themselves by qualified majority. According to the opinion you have expressed, this act would be null and void and would be at odds with the 1988 decision you mentioned. Therefore, we could not adopt an act which, from what you are saying, is invalid according to the July 1988 decision.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr President, if your interpretation is correct, the interinstitutional agreement is inadmissible because it contains a whole series of provisions which require a qualified majority. If the Treaty really does have to specifically require a qualified majority on every occasion, and limit the cases in which the qualified majority can be extended, then this interinstitutional agreement is inadmissible, as Mr Colom i Naval has just said. It is void, and you must withdraw it.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more fundamental level, I think that the main issue in this matter is that this Parliament, on its last day, intends to bind its successor and its successor"s successor to a fundamental limitation of the budgetary powers laid down in the Treaty, budgetary powers which this Parliament mainly exercises by qualified majority. It is totally unreasonable and contrary to the Treaty to make a decision by simple majority, as the Treaty states that we have budgetary powers and that we exercise those powers by qualified majority. We cannot constrain the next Parliament and prevent it from exercising its budgetary powers by a simple majority agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add that this agreement follows on from the institutional agreement of 1993, which was agreed by qualified majority and which explicitly states that it can only be revoked by qualified majority. This new agreement implies the former agreement being revoked and replaced and it must therefore be passed by qualified majority.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, Mr President, at the meeting point of the political and the legal, I think that you are grossly under‐estimating the significance of the emergence of interinstitutional agreements in our system. In ruling after ruling, the Court of Justice, which you cited, is increasingly recognising interinstitutional agreements as fundamental rules. What you are doing – if you pass this law by simple majority – will mean that, tomorrow, on a misty Friday morning, with a majority of 48 votes to 47, a makeshift Parliament will be able to abolish and destroy not only the financial perspectives, but the entire structure of interinstitutional cooperation that has been put in place over the last twenty months.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">You do not have the right, Mr President, to wipe out in this manner something that is one of the foundations of sound interinstitutional operation, namely these agreements which have been drawn up gradually and confidently by the institutions. We must vote by qualified majority. Loyal cooperation between the institutions is at stake, as laid down in the Treaty and recognised by the Court.</p>

We have presented more than twenty working papers on it. At Monday's meeting of the Committee on Budgets we had another four‐hour debate, in which Mr Fabre‐Aubrespy chose not to participate. Yesterday we discussed this report comprehensively here in Parliament. So with all due respect, we can support the report or oppose it, but any move to refer it back would truly be a slap in the face for the rapporteur and the House after all the work they have done. I move that we proceed to the vote.</p>

We have had votes this morning, under the new Amsterdam procedure, in which we have not been able to take individual amendments like Amendment No 28 which would call for a review clause for this perspective which extends – as some speakers have already said this morning – over seven years without any review. There will be no possibility for a new Parliament and a new Commission to have their say on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support the suggestion of Mr Fabre‐Aubrespy to send it back to committee. We are in the process of negotiating. We can clarify what is in Parliament's interests. I fear that if we take this final decision now, Mr President, you will be left with a kind of feeling that you have been acting on behalf of interests outside this House and not the interests of Members themselves.</p>

Firstly, it remains unclear whether the Committee of the Regions has been given a role to play. I personally find it hard to comprehend that the Council should be presenting us with its amended position before it has consulted with the Committee of the Regions to clarify the role it intends to assign to the Committee. That is an unacceptable error of law. Secondly, this morning it was still impossible to obtain the correct version of my report from the distribution counter. The version that was available there this morning for the second reading still indicated the wrong legal basis, namely the Maastricht Treaty. May I ask you, Mr President, to postpone the consideration of this report until tomorrow at the earliest and to instruct your legal services, which have already been working on this since Monday, to check that the text on which we are to vote contains no errors of law and that it is available tomorrow from the distribution counter.</p>

Having failed to achieve them through the content, because we rejected all his amendments by a large majority in committee, he is naturally trying the legal route, and I certainly have no problems with that. The only thing is that the legal situation has been unequivocally clarified, by your legal services for example. We have also proceeded in the manner advised, recommended and urged by Mr Jarzembowski himself in the committee, and even confirmed the first reading in committee. These matters have been thoroughly discussed, Mr President; I consider it right and proper that we should vote on this today as you proposed.

I am afraid I have to invoke Rule 129 and request that the report be referred back to committee. It is not a matter of having no agreement with Mexico, but rather of our perception of our role as a parliament. A year ago, we decided to approve an interim agreement so that the overall agreement could be negotiated, and at the time we explicitly said that we would not approve the overall agreement until all of its component parts had been negotiated. And that is precisely what has not yet been done. If we want to exercise our powers of control, not least on behalf of the European people, we should have absolutely no qualms about putting this agreement on hold and voting on it when all the pieces are in place. The Mexican Parliament approved the agreement on the proviso that the government would consult it again at the end when the whole agreement was completed. That is how we see our function here in Parliament, and that is why I would ask you to endorse my motion.</p>

That argument is somewhat insubstantial, even more so than the jacket that the chairman is wearing today.</p>
<p class="contents">I just wanted to say that I am obviously very pleased that my absence was noticed, as that proves that something gets done when I am there. However, on Monday evening there were several important meetings, including that of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights, and it was due to the fact that I was sitting on the Committee on Legal Affairs that I was absent from the Committee on Budgets. I would also like to add that I had attended the previous meeting on 29 April, the one that is mentioned in the report, and that I voted against the Colom i Naval report, which was not altered very much during the committee"s meeting on Monday night.</p>

Cases of maladministration, dishonesty, corruption – whatever you wish to call them – may be rare. The cost, however, does not just come out of my own, my constituents' and others' pockets – bad enough though that is. The ultimate cost is borne by the European Union as a whole, which is tainted and labelled a cosy club of crooks in the public imagination.</p>
<p class="contents">The Labour Government lost no time in setting tough new standards in public life in Britain when it came to power two years ago. By then, 18 years of Tory sleaze had weakened the very fabric of public trust underpinning British democracy. As a part of this process, the Labour Government also began devolving power from Westminster and bringing it closer to the people. Indeed, today voters will elect the first Parliament in Scotland for nearly 300 years and the first all‐Wales Assembly ever. In my own region, the new North West Regional Assembly could one day form the basis of regional government for the people of the North West – if they so desire it.</p>
<p class="contents">Labour will not flinch from pushing for the highest possible standards in public life, whether in London, Brussels, Edinburgh or Manchester. Labour will also continue to argue that decisions are taken as close to the people as possible, whether in Britain or Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">The commitment appropriations proposed for structural measures are in accordance with the European Council decision: EUR 32.678 billion shared between the Structural Funds (EUR 30 billion) and the Cohesion Fund (EUR 2.6 billion), which represents a 7 % decrease compared with 1999, in other words, a large decrease, and to a certain extent, one that is TOO LARGE.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to compensate for this reduction in the budget, we need to increase the efficiency of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the aim of the draft regulations that we are discussing today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cohesion Fund is a separate consideration, because it is based on funding by project and not by programme. It may be separate, but it has a determining role in that its aim is economic and social cohesion, one of the missions of the European Union. This is why there was a need to revise its basic regulations, notably by redefining the key terms and in particular the actual concept of the project, as the Commission"s proposal suggests. I also support the idea of simplifying financial management, and I feel that it is essential to ensure that the Member States take responsibility for the Fund, and to monitor the use that is made of the subsidies granted from it, as otherwise the risk of fraud will be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Structural Funds in general, the Council regulation only envisaged three Community initiatives (Interreg, Leader and EQUAL). The European Parliament managed to reach a compromise with the Council concerning the inclusion of a fourth initiative, URBAN. I welcome this. This initiative, which began life several years ago, has demonstrated how essential it was in urban areas in crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, concerning the ERDF, the rapporteur opted for the reasonable solution by not altering our first reading of the Council proposal. For your information, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the extension of the codecision procedure, the European Parliament intends to change its position on 49 first readings under the cooperation procedure and on 15 texts adopted at first reading under the cooperation procedure. The European Parliament only intends to uphold its opinion on three regulations resulting from Agenda 2000, including the one that we are debating today. In this case this is due to the need to move this forward rapidly. With the same aim, the rapporteur has proposed compromise amendments to prevent the reform from being blocked. I think that these amendments (measures in favour of island regions, expanding the ERDF"s scope of research, support from the ERDF for the URBAN and Interreg Community initiatives) are appropriate, and I support them. I hope that the Council will ratify them quickly, as we cannot afford any more delays.</p>

<p class="contents">I voted against the draft regulation laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds because it is not consistent in relation to the ultra‐peripheral regions, as can be seen from the main reference to them included in Article 3, according to which ultra‐peripheral regions above the 75 % threshold are also covered by Objective 1. But they are all above that threshold! So what is this supposed to mean?</p>
<p class="contents">After so much work to have the ultra‐peripheral regions formally recognised in the Treaty on European Union, I felt obliged to vote against these regulations, which represent a lost opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I would like to stress the wide‐ranging contributions that the European Parliament has made to improving Agenda 2000: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ structural actions represent 0.46 % of the GDP of the European Union; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ Objective 1 accounts for two‐thirds of all funding available for the Funds, which helps to concentrate them where they are most needed; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ the main criterion for allocating the Funds is still the level of development in the region, and not any other criterion!</p>
<p class="contents">‐ it has helped to keep Portugal, Spain and Ireland as beneficiaries of the Cohesion Fund although they have joined the euro area; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ it has recognised the role of non‐governmental organisations in regional development; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ it has clarified and strengthened the principle of partnership, which guarantees participation and transparency; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ it has mitigated the perverse effects of losing unused funds by promoting the idea that they should be reallocated to the same Member State; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ it has reduced the reserve not distributed by Member States from 10 % to 4 % as from the outset, which will be an incentive to those which perform best; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ it has secured the URBAN Community initiative on urban areas; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ it has made ERDF support available to tourism and cultural initiatives; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ it has encouraged the use of the trans‐European networks to create better links between the centre and islands and other peripheral regions.</p>
<p class="contents">With so many objectives achieved, it is a great pity that we could not prevent the omission of the ultra‐peripheral regions!</p>

I welcome this and I thank our colleagues for their persuasive efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the conclusions of the Berlin European Council, our Committee on Regional Policy had to fight on an important issue for all the people of Europe: establishing a fourth Community initiative, URBAN, which is aimed at the economic and social regeneration of cities and urban neighbourhoods in crisis with a view to promoting sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">This was one of the priorities for the Group of the Party of European Socialists. We managed to have it adopted by the plenary session in Strasbourg on 19 November 1998, and we had to get it accepted by the Commission and the Council. Parliament"s credibility and our commitment to our constituents were at stake. The Union needed to also help those who would not be included in a ‘zone" or a regional ‘Objective". Our duty of solidarity was at stake, and our concept of Europe was being put to the test.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been recognised that our point of view is correct. This is why I will vote in favour of this report and all of the reports that are part of the Agenda 2000 package. The 2000‐2006 perspectives can now be launched. Parliament is therefore ending this legislature by tying up this issue, one which is paramount for the future of Europe and of enlargement. It has been a long, arduous and difficult battle, sometimes strewn with obstacles, but it has always been an exciting one, and I am pleased to have been a part of it.</p>

It will not help to improve economic and social cohesion. It will result in a particularly damaging breakdown of regional policy, notably to the detriment of several rural areas of France.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not waste any time on considering and weighing up each of the measures, which are more or less welcome, that are contained in the general regulation. The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations intends to question the supposed benefits of costly Structural Funds, which are tools used by the Commission to gain political favour in order to serve a centralist Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the reform of the Structural Funds has resulted in another increase in funding: ECU 195 billion for structural policy, ECU 18 billion for the Cohesion Fund and ECU 49 billion for the pre‐accession instruments. The Objective 1 regions get the lion"s share, with 69.7 % of structural funding, compared with 11.5 % for Objective 2.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone is competing to be the most eloquent in demanding more funding, but no one is questioning the effectiveness of the money spent. What is there to say about a budgetary approach which consists of fixing a spending objective rather than a ceiling for spending, seeking out projects at all costs in order to spend all of the funds that have been approved, rather than allocating funds to existing projects? Spending is becoming an end in itself and the measure of the programme"s success.</p>
<p class="contents">It may also seem strange that during the negotiations Objective 2, which is dedicated to industrial and rural regions undergoing economic restructuring, should have been sacrificed, to the benefit of Objectives 1 and 3: its budgetary envelope will be ECU 22.5 billion for the 1999‐2006 period, which is more or less the same figure as for the 1994‐1999 period. Rural regions eligible for Objective 5b will be among the main victims of this situation: in France, one third of the population eligible under this Objective will no longer receive structural funding after the transition period.</p>
<p class="contents">The future of rural areas seems to be all the more uncertain given that the Commission and Parliament, always concerned with seizing new fields of competence for themselves, plan to develop an integrated urban policy, in contempt of the principle of subsidiarity. The Orlando report, which was hastily adopted on Tuesday without even being put to the vote, echoes President Prodi"s investiture speech in calling for this European policy for cities. Once again, the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations would like to reiterate its desire to see the European Union concentrate its efforts on the existing common policies (the CAP, the CFP, etcetera) rather than spreading itself across an ever greater number of sectors, with a danger of worsening the inevitably inefficient scattering of public funds and encouraging an increase in public spending, which is always harmful.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the only anomaly in the reform of the Structural Funds. Many regions are benefiting from special treatment, as a result of political bargaining that has enabled them to escape the rigour of joint decisions. Only three countries are left out of this: Luxembourg, Finland ... and France. The case of the Belgian Hainaut is significant. It is receiving an additional allocation of ECU 15 billion in order to compensate for the loss of its eligibility for Objective 1, while the French Hainaut, which borders on it, is receiving nothing; this discrimination is not justified either by the GNP or by the level of unemployment in the two regions.</p>
<p class="contents">This example is quite a good illustration of France"s position at the end of the negotiations on Agenda 2000. Having been undermined by Germany with regard to agricultural issues, France"s position on regional policy has been manipulated, while it is also unable to maintain the position that it had within the CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform of the Structural Funds is a failure: a failure for Europe and a failure for France. The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations therefore had no choice but to reject the McCarthy‐Hatzidakis report.</p>

About a third of the Community budget is spent on structural support measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree that European structural support cannot be spread evenly across all the regions of Europe. This implies a reduction in the number of regions considered worthy of support, and hence in the target areas for assistance from the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a good thing that we have created a phasing‐out period for regions, such as many of the Objective 2 areas, which are set to lose their eligibility for support; this will prevent the abrupt termination of programmes that have started well. However, the support for rural areas for which we had campaigned was not introduced. We do have the Leader initiative, but that is only a drop in the ocean. Measuring rural areas in Europe against areas with high population densities is the wrong approach. The measures of hardship in rural areas are the absence of particular infrastructural facilities and the disadvantages deriving from the economic and social structure. These shortcomings create a vicious circle, because a lack of infrastructure means a lack of jobs. People cannot escape from this vicious circle by their own devices alone.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been discussing programmes such as Restruct or Recover, and URBAN is set to become the fourth Community initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Smaller and medium‐sized towns are measured against towns with populations in excess of 50 000. This is another way in which smaller structures in Europe, including rural structures, are being sidelined. We want to help the poorest regions in Europe to reduce the gap between themselves and the richest regions.</p>
<p class="contents">In our efforts to do this, please do not let us allow the structurally weak rural areas to slip through the safety net.</p>

<p class="contents">Having participated actively in the entire process, I must say that I am particularly pleased with the decision to renew the URBAN programme.</p>
<p class="contents">This result is particularly important for cities, since it reinforces and boosts the credibility of the Action Plan for sustainable cities submitted by the Commission last November in Vienna, and because it reinforces the instruments already contained in Objectives 1 and 2 of the Structural Funds for urban areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteurs on the framework regulation for their willingness to tackle the problem of an Italian region particularly close to our hearts. This is the Abruzzi region, which was removed from Objective 1 of the Structural Funds in 1994. It is the only region in Europe which has not been able to benefit from any flanking measure provided for under the new regulations for former Objective 1 regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Berlin European Council mentioned this as one of the ‘special cases" which are listed as an annex to the report which we are about to approve. Nonetheless, paragraph 44 of the Council conclusions does not detail what is meant by the special attention which the Council quite rightly intends to pay to this region.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Parliament"s requests will lead both the Council and the Commission to quantify the funding and/or population size allowed and clarify the possibility of granting state aid by way of exception to the competition rules under the terms of Article 92(3)(c) of the Treaty, as has been done in other so‐called ‘special cases".</p>

Building on the work of Labour MEPs, Tony Blair gained a great deal for Britain – and the North‐West in particular – at the Berlin Summit. As a result, European funds will continue to flow into the North‐West to help tackle unemployment, social exclusion and environmental pollution. This is just another example of Labour's positive approach to Europe delivering concrete results to the people of Britain.</p>
<p class="contents">Euro funds have already made a lasting improvement to the lives of the people of the North‐West. In my own part of the world in Manchester, the EU has pumped 13 million pounds into the Metrolink light rail network. The EU also helped build the Trafford Park industrial estate, creating over 15, 000 jobs. Euro money was a key element in transforming the old Manchester docks at Salford Quays into a vibrant commercial centre, creating over 4, 000 jobs. EU funds also helped transform Manchester into a major cultural and tourism centre, by helping build the G Mex Exhibition Centre, the Bridgewater Concert Hall, The Manchester Museum of Science and Industry and the Imperial War Museum (North).</p>
<p class="contents">The Euro‐rabid Tories – the ones led by William Hague, that is – would have us believe that the EU brings us nothing but bureaucracy and interference.

Misunderstandings by the Commission and the Council threatened to undermine the result of painstaking work, with the risk of reducing negotiations to a trial of strength between the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are delighted to have established, together with the texts of the new regulations, a starting point enabling us to be actively involved in the management of the funds, which is also facilitated by the code of conduct drawn up between the Commission and Parliament on the implementation of the structural policies. This will allow Parliament to play an active role in the reform, including in the implementation stage and throughout the programming period.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that URBAN is to be included once again amongst the Community initiatives is a victory for all European citizens. The key role of urban and metropolitan areas in regional development must be acknowledged.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of balanced and complementary growth in urban and rural areas is essential for economic and regional development. To this end it is necessary at all levels to enhance cooperation between regional and local authorities and socio‐economic operators, those closest to the changing world of the regions; it is also necessary, however, to take account of the competitive differences between regions because of the different levels of employment, quality of infrastructures, the natural environment and development, in particular during the sensitive stage that is just starting with the selection of regions which are eligible under Objective 2.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms we are in favour of reform, but we have a few reservations about aspects which have not yet been explored in sufficient detail, such as, for example, the impact on regions which, for the sake of the principle of concentration, run the risk of seeing their development process come to a standstill. People living in these regions will be penalised and that will not help show that the European Union assists the development of less favoured regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Italy too runs the risk of being penalised by the calculation of the financial resources ceiling for the new Objective 2. Regions in industrial or rural decline (former Objectives 2 and 5b) will have their share of funding reduced compared to the previous programming period, with a guaranteed maximum reduction of 33 % of the population concerned; to this percentage, however, would be added the figure accounted for by the inclusion of former Objective 1 regions, causing these regions to be doubly penalised; and this is leaving aside the case of Abruzzi – the only region removed from Objective 1 before the end of the current programming period – which, hovering somewhere between transitional support and inclusion in Objective 2, runs the risk of not being fairly included in this reform framework.</p>

Our contempt for the agreement was not a reflection of a contempt for cooperation. It reflected our contempt for a risky and excessively restrictive seven‐year financial programme.</p>

<p class="contents">It is not acceptable for the report as presented by the Committee on Budgets to include an amendment that goes a great deal further than the object of the report itself. This is true to the extent that it has now been placed in an totally ambiguous situation, given that at the time when we considered the report in the Committee on Budgets on 29 April, there was no question of approving the text of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add to what Mr Bourlanges said a moment ago, that institutional agreements cannot be considered separately. It is the entire procedure that is wrong. It is wrong, firstly because there is not an absolute majority, something which you yourself insisted on for the interinstitutional agreement of 17 July 1998 on the common foreign and security policy, an agreement that I fought along with my group. Secondly, it is wrong because the national parliaments have not ratified texts which add to, alter and refine the Treaties, sometimes to a considerable degree.</p>
<p class="contents">What Mr Bourlanges has just said concerning the budgetary aspect is therefore particularly true, but he should have extended his comments to all interinstitutional agreements.</p>

Experience with the financial perspective over the period 1988 to 1999 has shown that annual budgets can perfectly well be implemented without conflict. It was also possible to adopt budgets which fell well below the revenue‐based ceiling of own‐resources. We believe in financial parameters for the annual budgetary procedure, particularly given the pre‐accession arrangements and the measures required in that context. It is important for the EU to ensure that it has the financial resources necessary for admitting the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">We support this proposal for a lower financial ceiling than that established in the CAP guidelines. The EU spends far too much money on an over‐regulated system of agriculture which is not sufficiently adjusted to today"s environmental requirements. Reform of the CAP must be pursued. We also believe that the best way of funding European policy is by concentrating on those measures that are absolutely vital, rather then creating mini‐budgets which swallow up large amounts of the Member States" money. We therefore support the Council"s endeavour to produce a tight budget covering the whole period.</p>

<p class="contents">The Cohesion Fund was set up in order to encourage certain Member States to join the single currency: Community funds were allocated in order to enable them to cope with the budgetary tightening that was imposed by the Maastricht criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">To ease the burden caused by the four Member States that benefit from the Cohesion Fund, payments were also made to other Member States, including France, to cover the cost of the convergence criteria. I could add that the Cohesion Fund contributed to the conjuring trick that made some Member States into miracles of monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations, which fought against the very principle of the single currency, must consequently have reservations about the Fund and the use that is being made of it. The policy of redistribution, when taken to such extremes, has overwhelming repercussions for the economy, as it weighs down private initiative with the burden of obligatory deductions.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, there are serious faults in the Cohesion Fund: in particular, its efficiency is questionable and there are financial irregularities in the way that funds are used.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is a tool for federalist redistribution, whose aim is more to gain support for the Commission among the beneficiary Member States and their people rather than to enable them to overcome their difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">The only merit of the Cohesion Fund is that it is allocated to Member States and not to their regions, as is the case with the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The launch of the single currency is in danger of worsening the imbalances between Member States and causing an increase in relocations, either towards states or regions that are more competitive than others, or away from regions that are in difficulty towards the dominant economic centres that we are already seeing emerge (north‐west Germany, the Benelux countries, Ile‐de‐France, northern Italy). In this context, the Cohesion Fund will perhaps enable us to limit the damage done by EMU, but it will nevertheless fall very far short of what is needed.</p>

Parliament actually: <br />‐ opposed the conditionality of the Cohesion Fund vis‐à‐vis the stability pact, because it believes that the Cohesion Fund must be considered in full terms a structural instrument; <br />‐ considered that the Cohesion Fund should be subject to the same partnership rules applying for the Structural Funds, and that its operations are planned within an integrated framework together with the structural operations, involving regional and local authorities; Parliament also wished that mainstreaming horizontal themes such as employment and equal opportunities should be taken into account in the Cohesion Fund in the same way as in the Structural Funds; <br />‐ asked that Cohesion Fund resources in the fields of transport and mobility are used to fund projects which improve regional and interregional cohesion, interoperability and intermodality, and in the field of the environment are also used to fund projects to maintain and restore biodiversity and preserve natural reserves; <br />‐ stressed the importance of being able to group together small projects into a bigger entity and demanded therefore that some 5 % of the total fund endowment be made available for projects of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Group considers those requirements fundamental and therefore is not content with the agreement reached in the Council to maintain the Cohesion Fund without deeply reforming it.</p>

At the end of my mandate, in May 1999, my political positions on social issues such as agriculture, food, rural development and the environment remain the same. The reform of the CAP was necessary, but not in the form proposed in Agenda 2000 by the European Commission. In our debates we have demonstrated a certain level of consensus on what we now call the ‘European agricultural model", which on many points is at odds with the ultra‐liberal aims of the countries of the Cairns Group and of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore voted against the reports which had not been sufficiently amended by Parliament and which therefore lose their meaning and substance. What is more, some rapporteurs share my position.</p>
<p class="contents">1. The Görlach report as it stands, with a budgetary allocation that is far too small, does not allow the implementation of a real policy of rural development, which is more necessary than ever in order to guarantee a worthy and lasting future for the rural areas of the EU (80 % of EU territory).</p>
<p class="contents">2. The Mulder report mentions in a recital the possibility of cofinancing, which we opposed because in the long term it would mean the destruction of the CAP and of the objectives of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">3. The Graefe zu Baringdorf report did not allow for a coherent mechanism to reorganise and limit agricultural aid according to social and environmental criteria, and following the amendments adopted in committee, the rapporteur himself will probably not recognise an amended text which is too far removed from his original text.</p>
<p class="contents">4. With regard to the Goepel report on milk, it did ensure the maintenance of some sort of status quo, but it envisaged the possibility of abolishing milk quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I voted for the reports in which Parliament"s firm position had significantly altered the uncompromising or inadequate nature of the Commission"s proposals: </p>
<p class="contents">5. The Garot report, in which the skill and determination of the rapporteur meant that the beef sector could be partly protected, particularly suckler herds, which maintain the countryside, give structure to rural production, guarantee income for quality production without hormones, and safeguard the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">6. The Martin report, the text of which my colleagues and I have altered considerably in a manner that favours all of the wine‐producing industry – some parts of the industry have already said so – particularly with regard to the definition of wine, the ban on producing European wines with must imported from third countries and the preservation of traditional oenological practices and therefore of the quality that underlies our European cultural identity.</p>
<p class="contents">7. The Fantuzzi report on COPs, even though the treatment of oil proteins is still far from satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that European farmers and consumers will therefore understand the way in which I have voted and will be aware of the battles that still have to be fought in order that European construction may have a future in this field.</p>

I was pleased to see that the majority of my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development came to the same conclusions as I did. This is why no amendments to the Commission"s proposal were adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
<p class="contents">All of the French members of the Europe of Nations Group voted against the legislative resolution, bearing out the Berlin agreement on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">European agriculture is in a very bad situation. The price of agricultural products is falling steadily, as the principle of Community preference gradually disappears. The globalisation of trade in agricultural products is not an empty word, but a reality that our farmers are experiencing.</p>
<p class="contents">The forthcoming negotiations in the World Trade Organisation lead me to fear the worst for the years to come. Did Commissioner Fischler not say yesterday in this House that he envisaged a fresh reform of the common agricultural policy in 2003? The fact that the date given in that statement coincides with the end of the negotiations in 2003 is surely not a coincidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Direct support for farmers is necessary, and it is essential for some sectors of agriculture. For example, the sector that currently receives the most aid is sheep farming. It is completely absurd, given farmers" level of income, to try to put a ceiling on aid and to reduce it steadily. In France, sheep farmers have the lowest income among farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">A direct and across‐the board reduction in compensatory aid will therefore upset the balance in European agriculture. The only European producers that will survive will be those who are most competitive at world level. The environmental balance and the balance of land use and use of agricultural land will be completely upset in the years to come if the policy of destroying the CAP continues as it was launched in 1992.</p>

<p class="contents">Needless to say, I cannot be enthusiastic about the results of Berlin summit in terms of the common organisation of the markets in milk, beef and cereals. But these are the lesser of two evils when compared with the Commission proposals and are even an improvement on the outcome of the Agriculture Council discussions. Whether this compromise will be enough to save the European agricultural model is, unfortunately, a matter for conjecture.</p>

<p class="contents">Surely it is unacceptable that wine‐growing areas should suddenly appear in Ireland, Denmark and Sweden, thereby raising the spectre of wine being produced there in future with imported grape juice and being marketed as a product of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a pity that the splendid chapter on vinicultural products and health which we had included in our report was not retained.

We have voted in favour of a large number of practical requirements aimed at improving the protection of consumers' interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle that the rules of the country of origin will apply with regard to Internet commerce has both advantages and disadvantages. It is an advantage for the Internet industry that they are subject to regulations in their home country, since they then know the rules. Conversely, it may be a problem that the consumers do not know the rules. We have therefore voted in favour of increasing the rights of the consumer, including a requirement that the Member States must take measures to ensure that consumers can have themselves entered in an opt‐out register, which the service provider must then check regularly. As a general principle, the Danish Social Democrats are working to ensure the strictest possible EU minimum requirements with regard to marketing on the Internet. If common rules are ultimately adopted which raise the level of consumer protection in every country, it will become less important whether it is the rules of the country of origin or those of the recipient country that apply.</p>

The negotiations between the parties to the agreement will not be concluded until late in the year. To accept the Commission's proposal regarding the content of the agreement at this point will therefore be tantamount to giving the Council and the Commission a blank cheque for the negotiations. We wish to see the final result before we reach a decision on the extent to which we can support it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal for the agreement is a distinct improvement on the present framework agreement on cooperation, dating from 1991, which it is to replace. In particular, the democracy clause (Article 1) is an important step forward. What is lacking, however, is a clear specification of the mechanisms that are to be used to monitor the extent to which the parties are respecting human rights. Without such mechanisms, the clause is essentially useless. Bearing in mind Mexico's continual infringements of human rights, this is wholly unacceptable. Moreover, the proposal does not contain any indications as to how the involvement of civil society can be promoted and how respect for workers' rights can be ensured.</p>

<p class="contents">It is less than a year since Parliament ratified the Interim Agreement on the basis that the human rights clause it contained would be a test of the Mexican Government's seriousness in ensuring human rights cooperation was central to relations with the EU. We also expected that human rights issues would play a central role in negotiations between the Mexicans and the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile the human rights crisis in Chiapas, southern Mexico, continues to deteriorate, and we have no evidence that the negotiations for clear mechanisms for the application and monitoring of the democracy and human rights clause have been included in the negotiations.</p>

By dealing with the proposal now, the European Parliament has not kept to what it said earlier. In its report of April 1998, Parliament said that it would not approve the overall agreement until it was clear exactly what it contained. At the moment, the European Union is in the middle of negotiations with Mexico, and the substance of a number of provisions in the overall agreement will not be established until the end of this year. We feel that Parliament has acted irresponsibly by voting on the report now, as this will simply be signing a blank cheque and we will have no further influence in the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from these procedural objections, there were also aspects of the substance of the report that led us to vote against the agreement with Mexico. The rapporteur has seriously misrepresented the human rights situation in Mexico. She talks about recent progress in the field of human rights and lists all kinds of formal measures that Mexico has taken. But in practice the protection of human rights in Mexico is still far from perfect, as we can see from the unlawful executions and the continuing gang warfare in Chiapas. The overall agreement contains no mechanisms for enforcing compliance with human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second objection concerns Mexico"s environmental policy, which the rapporteur does not even mention, although we and others provided her with information about it. The planned construction of an enormous new salt production plant threatens not just a Unesco‐protected nature reserve but also various species including the grey whale, which comes to these waters to calve. If Mexico persists with these dangerous plans, then despite the trade agreement we must keep the option open of imposing a trade boycott in the form of an import ban on Mexican salt.</p>

<p class="contents">Although the Treaty of Amsterdam extended the scope of codecision between the Council and the European Parliament, it certainly did not make it the general rule. Above all, it did not modify Article 4 of the Treaty on European Union, which gives the European Council (and thus the hierarchy of the different Councils) the role of instigating EU policies, nor did it modify Article 202 of the EC Treaty, which gives the Council the sole responsibility for determining the implementing powers that will be conferred on the Commission. This being the case, even if Parliament increases its influence, it is clear that the Treaties still place the Council at the centre of the institutional system.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore think that the Aglietta report, which claims for the European Parliament the right to interfere in implementing measures, particularly through the granting of the right to revoke a decision, contradicts the philosophy of the current institutions of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it is questionable whether it is actually in the interests of the European Parliament to claim such a right. Due to the lack of distinction between a law and a regulation at European level, the European Parliament is already forced to spend a considerable amount of time on trivial issues. If it also had to take part in implementing powers, the situation would be even worse.</p>

<p class="contents">The battle that I have been fighting since I was first given a mandate is finally bearing fruit, thanks to the perseverance of a rapporteur who has always been willing to listen and with whom I have had great pleasure in working.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments made to the Commission proposal that the Council is prepared to accept considerably improve access to information on the Community decision procedures; these procedures are too secretive, whether they concern the work of the committees, the documents submitted, the agendas, the list of participants or the committees" work schedule.</p>
<p class="contents">I also attach particular importance to the rule of adhering to the principle of making everything public, with confidentiality being the exception (Amendment No 31). I hope that once this principle has been laid down, it will not be reduced to nothing by a lack of serious motivation to determine the degree of confidentiality.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are some criticisms to be made of other aspects of the report. They are the aspects that extend <span class="italic">ad infinitum </span> the scope of Community regulation, and which now call for a simplification of the existing procedures, following the bureaucratic and administrative obstructions that they have caused. We should remember this lesson when the Treaties are next revised and come to an agreement once and for all on the scope of Community powers.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect for the principle of subsidiarity would be a first step, but that does not feature in the report. On the contrary, this supposed simplification is a pretext for reinforcing the supranational dimension of the European Union. The Commission, which already has a monopoly on initiative, would thus seize executive power in Europe to become the government of the European Union, with the Council being reduced to the role of a second parliamentary chamber, making decisions by majority.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a step forward for the committees to be working in an open and transparent manner, but to cut them off from national concerns in carrying out their duties in order to put them under the power of the Commission is a mistake which I reject.</p>

<p class="contents">This disastrous development of events, which is contrary to all the assurances that we were given at the start of the war, and contrary to the humanitarian objectives of the war itself, can only reinforce the doubts that we had expressed from the start concerning the strategy being used.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that Europe is adding another error to this initial one, an error that has very serious consequences for the future. Both from listening to the speeches made by Members during the debate that has taken place in this House, and from listening to the speeches made by the President of France, I am struck by the fact that analyses of the deterioration of events only implicate Slobodan Milosevic personally, his family and his inner circle. Although their responsibility is undeniable, we cannot restrict the causes of the conflict to those people alone. On the contrary, it is clear that the conflict was born out of very ancient disagreements that are deeply ingrained in the various peoples that are involved.</p>
<p class="contents">What is even more serious is that this error of judgement is in danger of guiding us towards the wrong solutions. Implicating solely Slobodan Milosevic and his entourage insinuates that it would be enough to overthrow them in order for everything to be put right, for the Kosovar Albanians to return to their homes and for everyone to live in harmony in a multi‐ethnic Kosovo. In our opinion, this would be delusive, or at least it would take a long time and a great deal of effort to achieve it. However, if we are willing to recognise that there are deep‐seated quarrels involving the people themselves, and that these are difficult to eradicate in a short space of time, we will realise that we need to also consider other solutions, certainly including, for example, the partition of Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call on the Heads of State and Government of the countries of Europe to rethink their strategy and to stop falling into line with the United States.</p>

<p class="contents">This war is governed by lies, unilateral propaganda, cover‐ups and omissions. To start with, there is the semantic confusion: the air war against the whole of Yugoslavia is described as the ‘situation in Kosovo". The NATO aerial bombing of civilian targets – power stations, television headquarters, schools and buses – is defined as an ‘involuntary error" or ‘collateral damage". The reciprocal ethnic atrocities are always attributed to just one side and not to the others. In the documents approved by the majority in this House, there is no mention of the terrorist activity of the KLA, armed, financed, trained and politically adopted by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.</p>
<p class="contents">And thus, although in the last few days some opportunities for negotiation seem to be emerging, with Ibrahim Rugova travelling freely to Rome and the three American soldiers being released, this Parliament, in its last few hours of work, opts to be led down the humiliating path of NATO propaganda with this vote on Kosovo, and fails in its political role.</p>

<p class="contents">1. My question to the Council H−0387/22‐4‐99 was considered, correctly and from a strictly procedural viewpoint, to belong to the general debate on Kosovo. However, this question remains unanswered and it is: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ Is the Council aware of the allegations and reports in the international media that NATO bombing and the war in Yugoslavia have destroyed or irreparably damaged monuments forming part of the European cultural heritage, including Christian Orthodox monasteries and churches?</p>

<p class="contents">a) what does the Council propose to do to stop this irredeemable loss and</p>

<p class="contents">The principal idea of this resolution is to give the Commission the role of driving force so that it can, and I quote, ‘ensure the consistency of the European political project – a role which it alone can play, ". That is a bad start. It is a typical reaction from technocrats to think that if they do not intervene, everything is going to dissolve into chaos. They do not consider the idea that there could be any other type of consistency than their bureaucratic consistency, for example, democratic consistency. On this false basis, the European Parliament"s resolution, which is concerned above all with the preparatory work for future reform, proposes that the Commission should launch, and then steer, the process, and that, without relinquishing its supposed political responsibility, it should entrust the task of drawing up an initial document to a group of experts, a formula that was previously used in preparing for Maastricht.</p>
<p class="contents">We are absolutely opposed to this solution. These experts, described in the resolution as ‘independent", are, as usual, going to be chosen in such a way that their conclusions will inevitably be oriented towards federalism. In any case, the very method of recourse to a group of experts, whether they are federalist or not, is to be criticised, because the document that they have prepared will serve as a basis for the discussions and those who wish to oppose it will be put at an immediate disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations believes that the approach should be fully reversed and that the people should be given a say right from the preparation stage of the reform.</p>
<p class="contents">For a start, the national parliaments should all be consulted and all of their proposals together should form the basic document to be discussed by the Member States during the subsequent negotiations. The Commission, the supposed experts, and the European Parliament, who will all be colluding from the start in order to strip the national democratic authorities of a little more of their power, have no place in that process.</p>

I congratulate him on this achievement, as he did not sacrifice the content in order to achieve the desired level of conciseness.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the fact that he starts by pointing out the importance of the investiture of the President of the Commission. Between Maastricht and Amsterdam, there have been significant modifications to the Treaties, and Parliament must take as much account of these as possible in order to ensure that their consequences are fully realised. During previous debates I had noticed that some of our colleagues had not yet registered Parliament"s new role in this investiture. This was also the case for a number of members of the national parliaments. Fortunately, there has been a gradual raising of awareness during the debates and through contacts. This is why I am pleased that the main points are once again being set out here.</p>
<p class="contents">The new role of the President‐designate in constituting the College of Commissioners is close to that of what we in Belgium call a ‘<span class="italic">formateur</span> ": his point of view will count alongside that of the Member States. Also, the need for the President‐designate to present his political plans to the European Parliament – what Mr Romano Prodi rightly called his ‘programme of government" – means that he must achieve a majority in Parliament on which he will base his actions. These new practices bring us closer to the situation that operates in our countries, and will be perceived by the people as a move towards democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the forthcoming institutional reform, it is highly desirable that Parliament"s voice should be better heard, and that, in contrast to the former method, which was extremely inadequate, reform should be based on real interinstitutional dialogue, something which is perfectly expressed in paragraphs 8 and 12 of our resolution. It is important that the opinions of the two legislative institutions of the Union should have equal weight, and consequently that the centre of gravity for decision making should be at an equal distance from the Council and from the European Parliament.</p>

Firstly, the financial perspectives for the next seven years do not provide us with adequate financial resources for the effective social and democratic Europe that we wish to see.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the flexibility instrument that was absolutely central to Juan Colom i Naval"s reports has now become only a marginal element and can only be used if there is a qualified majority in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the European Parliament is not in a position at the moment to conclude an IIA with an outgoing Commission.</p>

As you know I have just presented my report which Parliament kindly voted on this morning. This evening I will speak on the Malangré report as Socialist Group shadow. After the vote, when I returned to my office I found a fax from my Coventry office. This was a letter posted yesterday by the General Secretary of the Labour Party informing me that I had been suspended from my party. I am totally astonished by this, do not know what the reasons are and do not understand what I am supposed to have done wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently I need urgent clarification as to my rights and obligations as a Member of this House from the President. I wish to reassure the President that, in my view, my first duty is to Parliament and to my constituents and I shall carry on doing that to the best of my ability.</p>

<p class="contents">The events took place after the official deadline for tabling resolutions on urgent subjects, which is why I am informing you of it today. Mrs Danze‐Serfaty is the wife of Mr Abraham Serfaty, who was imprisoned for 17 years in Tazmamart as a political prisoner, and who was received most honourably here following his release, notably thanks to Parliament"s intervention and resolutions; however, Mr Serfaty can no longer return to Morocco, even though he is no longer accused of anything.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Danze‐Serfaty went to Morocco to request that the authorities allow her husband to return to his country and spend the rest of his days there. She was refused entry as soon as she arrived at the airport. I ask the President of Parliament to address the Moroccan authorities in order to protest against this refusal to grant entry to a French citizen and to demand that Abraham Serfaty be allowed to return.</p>
