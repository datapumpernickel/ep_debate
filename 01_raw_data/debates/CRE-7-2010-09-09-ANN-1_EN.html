<p>Reducing by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 forms one of the targets of Goal 7 of the Millennium Development Goals. This issue is very directly linked to the right to health, education, food, clothing, housing and work. Nonetheless, nearly one million people still do not have access to safe drinking water, more than 2 500 million do not have access to sanitation and a child dies every eight seconds from water-related sicknesses. A World Bank report says that by 2030 global demand for water will exceed supply by 40 %.</p>
<p>Does the Council think that recognising access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation as a universal human right can contribute to improving this state of affairs?</p>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the September I 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) The European Union is firmly committed to ensuring that the need for access to water and sanitation is better taken into account throughout the world. Aware of the issues at stake, particularly with regard to public health in developing countries, the EU has been fulfilling this commitment in various ways for many years, starting with the launch in 2002 of its major water initiative. The aim of the initiative is to provide a framework for establishing and financing strategic partnerships with developing countries regarding these issues, with a first partnership agreement signed the same year in Johannesburg between the EU and Africa. The Water Facility set up for the ACP countries will have a budget of EUR 500 million, which will be used in particular at local level, where it is most needed.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the European Union will support the work of the United Nations Human Rights Council on human rights issues relating to access to water and sanitation.</p>
<p>The Human Rights Council Resolution 7/22 of 23 March 2008 established the mandate of the independent expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation. This mandate is for three years and runs until 2011. Mrs de Albuquerque has, since then, been working to clarify the content of these obligations through studies and reports, and through field visits to identify good practices. The Human Rights Council has repeatedly adopted resolutions acknowledging this work. Moreover, the EU established a very close working relationship with the independent expert within the Council’s Human Rights Working Group in February 2010.</p>
<p>To celebrate World Water Day on 22 March 2010, the EU wanted to mark the importance of this issue by highlighting Member States’ human rights obligations relating to access to safe drinking water, which must be available, physically accessible, affordable and of acceptable quality.</p>
<p>The European Union considers that human rights obligations regarding access to safe drinking water and sanitation are closely associated with individual human rights such as the right to housing, food and health.</p>
<p>It is in this spirit that the EU is approaching the discussions under way in Geneva, and that it adopted a position in New York. A common EU position could not be reached last July on the Bolivian resolution recognising the right to water and sanitation as a basic human right. The EU is committed to ensuring that the independent expert continues her work in Geneva. The EU hopes that by clarifying the scope and characteristics of the obligations resulting from this right it might be able to reach a common position on this issue. The EU remains committed to ensuring that a consensus is reached on these issues with the entire international community, and it will continue to work along those lines with its partners.</p>
<p>Beyond these discussions, the EU continues to make a major contribution, within the scope of its development policy, to the efforts to improve access to water and sanitation in practice.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0382"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the September I 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) As you know, the European Union reacted immediately to the emergency situation following the earthquake in Haiti on 12 January by adopting a EUR 3 million emergency aid package on the very next day following the disaster. This was followed by an aid package of EUR 8 million. A rescue team was already at the scene in Haiti on 13 January and, on 18 January, a further EUR 19 million of emergency humanitarian aid was made available by the Commission to enable the partners of the United Nations, the Red Cross and the NGOs on the ground to help the victims. By then the Member States had already announced EUR 92 million of emergency humanitarian aid. In total, more than EUR 300 million were allocated in just a few weeks to meet the country’s immediate needs.</p>
<p>At the ministerial-level International Donors’ ‘a New Future for Haiti’, which took place on 31 March in New York, the EU pledged more than EUR 1.2 billion over 10 years for the recovery and reconstruction of Haiti, thereby reaffirming its long-term commitment to that country. The citizens of Europe and European civil society also took action to raise more than EUR 600 million to support the relief and reconstruction efforts.</p>
<p>I think that, all in all, we can be reasonably proud of the action taken by the EU as a whole to support the Haitians at a particularly difficult time.</p>
<p>With regard to the current humanitarian situation, it is true that, some seven months after the earthquake of 12 January, the humanitarian situation is still fragile for hundreds of thousands of people, in spite of the huge amount of aid given to Haiti by the broader international community. We do not have the time to list the needs and the challenges that lie ahead. The most important aspects of the challenges to come are described with sufficient precision in the situation report regularly updated by the ’s Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid (ECHO). I have also noted with interest the edifying findings mentioned in the mission report of the European Parliament delegation led by Mrs Striffler, which went to Haiti at the end of June.</p>
<p>As also pointed out in the European Parliament’s mission report, it is important to emphasise the positive aspects of the humanitarian action taken so far, especially the fact that this action, while indeed not perfect, has so far averted a serious health crisis and epidemics, the outbreak of which was very much feared in the aftermath of the disaster.</p>
<p>There is obviously still a huge amount of work to do, and I wish to reassure Members that the European Union of course remains mobilised.</p>
<p>The country must now begin the process of reconstruction in a tense pre-election context, marked by a worrying level of insecurity. One of the difficulties we will have to face in this context is associated, as you know, with the state of the capacities of the Haitian State itself.</p>
<p>Over the next six months, the emergency shelters will have to be maintained, given the delay in the implementation of a strategy for the construction of transitional houses. The internal displacement of people outside the zones directly affected threatens the survival of families taking in the victims. It will be important to provide these families with adequate support in the coming months.</p>
<p>The hurricane season started at the beginning of June. In the medium term, the national authorities and the international community will have to prepare, as far as possible, for this additional foreseeable threat.</p>
<p>As you will know, it is mostly officials from the European Commission and the Member States who implement the decisions and commitments of the EU and the Member States on the ground. I therefore invite the Honourable Member to approach the Commission, too, in order to obtain more information about the current humanitarian situation in Haiti.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0383"></a>

<p>(FR) Under the European ’s linguistic system, Irish is one of the 23 official and working languages of the Union’s institutions. However, for practical reasons and as a transitional measure, in accordance with the derogation provided for in  2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 920/2005<a href="#defann_3_1" name="refann_3_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the institutions of the European Union shall not be bound by the obligation to draft all acts in Irish and to publish them in that language in the Official Journal of the European Union. Nevertheless, the regulations adopted jointly by the European Parliament and the Council are drafted in all the official languages and, consequently, also in Irish.</p>
<p>The Council conclusions do not form part of this category of documents, so there is no requirement to publish them in Irish. That said, the Council would point out that it makes every effort to ensure that the Irish language is used in its documents.</p>
<p>Indeed, since the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 920/2005, the Council and its General Secretariat have constantly endeavoured to have a sufficiently broad team of Irish-language translators in order to provide the greatest possible number of translations. Since 1 January 2009 this team has been an independent unit within the language service of the General Secretariat of the Council and includes 14 translators, a national expert on detachment and 7 assistants. As the EPSO competitions did not achieve sufficient results, 10 of these translators and the 7 assistants were recruited, as temporary agents, by means of selection tests organised by the General Secretariat of the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Chagos islanders were removed from their home, the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), between 1968 and 1973 by the UK government, in order to clear all 65 islands of the archipelago of its population. The UK’s purpose was to give one of these islands, Diego Garcia, to the US military for an air and naval base, construction of which began in March 1971. In consequence, the entire population was forced onto cargo boats and set down in Mauritius and Seychelles, over 1 000 km from their homeland. They and their descendants have lived in exile in Mauritius and Seychelles. The community now consists of approximately 5 000 people, with only 750 surviving adult natives. All are British citizens and therefore citizens of the European Union. Some have emigrated and now live in the UK and France.</p>

<p>(FR) The objective of the European Union border policy, as laid down in the Programme, is gradually to develop the integrated management of the external borders. Several important measures have already been adopted by the European Union towards achieving this objective. These include, at the legislative level, the adoption of the Borders Code; at the operational level, the of the FRONTEX Agency; and, at the financial level, the creation of the Borders Fund.</p>
<p>In line with this objective, in its conclusions of 25-26 February 2010, the Council 29 measures for reinforcing the protection of external borders and combating illegal immigration. Among the main challenges facing the Union in this area in the foreseeable future, the measures list the improved efficiency of the Agency, the development of the European Surveillance System (EUROSUR), and solidarity and the integrated management of the external borders by the Member States.</p>
<p>The Council is closely monitoring the activities of the Agency as regards assistance and the coordination of operational cooperation in respect of the activities carried out by Member States to protect the external borders. It is currently examining the for a regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 aimed at revising the mandate of the Agency in order to enhance its role and operational capacities.</p>
<p>The Council will also examine the legislative proposals being drawn up by the Commission concerning the introduction of new technologies in the management of the borders, in particular the introduction of a system allowing the electronic recording of the dates of entry and exit of third country nationals and a system for the granting of Traveller status for fide travellers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0394"></a>

<p>(FR) The Council actively supports the holding of a referendum on the self-determination of South Sudan (in January 2011), which it considers a fundamental element of the 2005 Peace Agreement, to the implementation of which the EU steadfastly contributes. The Council has supported this position for a long time and has repeatedly affirmed it in its public declarations. At its meeting on 26 July 2010, the Council stressed that the EU was ready to support the referendums to be held in South Sudan and in the Abyei region, by providing substantial technical and financial assistance, as well as the implementation of the Peace Agreement, by reaching an agreement on post-referendum issues and by working towards long-term stability in the region.</p>
<p>The Council also supports the work of the African Union High-Level Implementation Panel on Sudan. It promotes building and support to help Sudan the challenges it is facing, well as efforts to combat insecurity and to conclude a lasting peace agreement for Darfur. The Council also supports the work of the Criminal Court and the provision of humanitarian and development assistance throughout the entire country.</p>
<p>We are determined to act in close coordination with the Sudanese parties, the African Union, the United Nations, the Authority on Development (IGAD), the United States and other national, regional and international partners.</p>
<p>Funds from the Instrument will be used to organise the referendum. The EU is also to respond favourably to any invitation from the Sudanese authorities for it to send an EU mission to observe the referendum process, including, if possible, voter registration.</p>
<p>The Council has taken note of the opening of an investigation into allegations that certain persons working for a Swedish consortium of oil companies, including LUNDIN PETROLEUM, were involved, during the Sudanese civil war, in violations of human rights, in breach of international law. However, it is not appropriate for the Council to express an opinion on a matter that is under legal investigation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0384"></a>

<p>(EN) Both the Member States and the EU need urgently to do more to improve the employment situation of young people and to tackle long-term unemployment, and this is recognised clearly in the EU’s Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. One of the five Europe 2020 headline targets seeks to increase the employment rate of women and men aged 20 to 64 from the current 69% to at least 75% by 2020. The Commission believes that, despite the current economic situation, meeting that target can realistically be achieved by 2020 if the Member States implement the necessary structural reforms of the labour market.</p>
<p>The headline target for employment reflects one of the strategic challenges that will face the European Union over the next decade: the ageing of the population, which involves a growing numbers of people of retirement age who will need to be supported by a smaller active working population.</p>
<p>The Europe 2020 strategy’s key tools for meeting the headline targets are the Integrated Guidelines and a series of seven flagship initiatives. The Integrated Guidelines, and in particular the Employment Guidelines, set out a number of policy priorities for implementing Europe 2020 in terms of combating youth and long-term unemployment. Guideline 7 aims to increase labour-market participation and reduce structural unemployment by means of adequate flexicurity policies, improving job quality, reviewing tax/benefit systems, active ageing, gender equality, work-life balance policies and combating youth and long-term unemployment. Guideline 8 concerns the development of a skilled workforce that meets the labour market’s needs and the promotion of lifelong learning. Guideline 10 calls for the promotion of social inclusion and support for groups at risk, including elderly women and men.</p>
<p>Various actions have already been taken at both Member State and EU level, for example through the mutual-learning programme as part of the European Employment Strategy. This involves the exchange of best practice at EU level and improving the transferability of the most effective policies, in particular targeting long-term and youth unemployment. Further measures to support vulnerable groups, including young people, by stabilising and alleviating the impact of the crisis on them were introduced through the coordinated response discussed most recently at the Employment, Social Policy and Health and Consumer Affairs (EPSCO) Council meeting of 7 June 2010.</p>
<p>EU policy-makers in the field of youth also put employment high on their agenda. The Trio Presidency (Spain, Belgium and Hungary) has chosen youth employment as its common priority until mid 2011 and it is the central theme of the Structured Dialogue with young people. The Youth Council adopted in May 2010 a Resolution<a href="#defann_7_1" name="refann_7_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on "the active inclusion of young people: combating unemployment and poverty".</p>
<p>The Commission will present a Communication on the flagship initiative ‘Youth on the move’ in September 2010. It will set out in detail the action needed in the coming years to improve the situation of young people in Europe. In particular it will cover action to improve young people’s transition from education to the labour market, a crucial concern of those looking for their first job with little or no work experience. The Communication will also outline the way such action, which falls largely within the Member States’ responsibility for education and employment policy, can be supported by EU funding, in particular the European Social Fund (ESF).</p>
<p>The ESF plays an active role in supporting young people. When targeting youth unemployment, actions financed by the ESF focus on various projects in the Member States and regions either to facilitate transitions from education to work or to help young people back into education in order to raise their skill levels and combat early school-leaving. According to the latest data available, around one third of ESF beneficiaries are young people (the ESF helped 2.5 million young people in 2008). The ESF also allocates EUR 8.3 billion directly to reforms of Member State education and training systems which mainly target young people: this represents about 11% of the overall ESF budget.</p>
<p>The ESF’s priorities also include combating long-term unemployment, which it does by stepping up access to employment for job-seekers and inactive people and promoting their sustainable inclusion in the labour market. Actions to prevent long-term unemployment and facilitate the re-integration of the long-term unemployed into the labour market form part of the operational programmes at Member State or regional level. During the current programming period, about 30% of the overall ESF budget (EUR 21.7 billion) is devoted to improving access to sustainable employment, which covers programmes for the long-term unemployed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) More than 70% of Africa's poor and hungry live in rural areas where agriculture forms the main economic activity. In these areas, small-scale farming is dominant with around 80% of farmers in Africa, many of whom are women, working less than two hectares of land.</p>
<p>In its recent Communication on food security in developing countries<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission expressly stated that investments in the smallholder sector have to be prioritzed since they yield the best returns in terms of poverty reduction and growth. A stronger investment in rural development can play a key role in reducing inequalities and conflicts and in slowing down migration from rural areas to cities.</p>
<p>By giving priority to support for small-scale farmers to increase production in a sustainable and efficient manner, the Commission strives to reduce poverty and hunger as well as desertification and depopulation of large areas. This approach is supported by Parliament and the Council<a href="#defann_8_2" name="refann_8_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>One of the objectives of the EUR 1 billion Food Facility, an initiative of the EU as a rapid response to the soaring food prices in developing countries in 2007-2008, has been to mobilise farmers and smallholders in target countries in order to increase productivity. Of the EUR 1 billion, all has now been committed, and so far EUR 625 million have been disbursed. A very large part of this goes towards helping small scale farming.</p>
<p>A good example illustrating this is a project in Zimbabwe, where the Food Facility has helped supply 176 000 small-scale farmers with 26 000 tonnes of seeds and fertilizers for EUR15 million. Another example is in Lesotho, where the EU is assisting over 36 000 farmers with more than 715 tonnes of seeds. This assistance will lead to 10-18 000 additional tonnes of crops harvested, which is a substantial boost compared to the total cereal production in 2009 of 86 000 tonnes.</p>
<p>However, other types of projects may also assist, such as the Pesticides Initiative Programme (PIP) programme, helping small scale farmers in Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries to meet European regulations and standards. So far 100 000 small farms in ACP countries have been assisted, helping them to keep their market in EU countries.</p>
<p>The Commission is convinced that by supporting small scale farming, providing them with the right inputs to increase productivity in a sustainable way, it can make a real contribution to the overall goal of catalysing a green revolution in Africa.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The revised Cotonou Agreement does not, however, specifically cover non-discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, despite an increasing incidence of state-sponsored homophobia.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission rejects and condemns any manifestation of homophobia as a blatant violation of human dignity. It also pursues a determined policy of opposing homophobic actions and campaigns for the decriminalisation of homosexual relations, both in the United Nations, but not least with partner countries. The Commission and the EU will continue to maintain pressure on partner countries to have legislation compatible with the international principles on non-discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Although admittedly far from ideal, in the revision of the Cotonou Agreement, the EU did manage to ensure the amendment of Article 8.4 in a positive way, introducing the concept of "discrimination of any kind", based on several grounds among others "sex or other status". This formulation is literally based on the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, and did not exist in the Cotonou agreement before. The EU will now make use of these changes through all political dialogues with partner countries.</p>
<p>As an example of the commitment to the principle of non-discrimination, the Commission can mention the active role that both the High Representative/Vice president and the Commissioner in charge of Development played earlier in 2010 in a trial against a Malawian same-sex couple, as well as the Commission services, which made numerous approaches in Malawi at all levels of government and society. The couple was later pardoned by the Malawian president, at least in part due to European intervention.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the EU's Political and Security Committee endorsed on 18 June 2010 the Toolkit to Promote and Protect the Enjoyment of All Human Rights by Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered people. This will now be used by all EU Delegations and geographical services.</p>
<p>Civil society in African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries is obviously a critical actor and it is supported both under the European Development Fund and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.

<p>At the end of May a Commission study concluded that a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases in the EU by 30% (compared with 1990) was affordable and technically feasible. However, the Commission - represented by the Commissioner responsible - took the view that the time was not yet ripe to proceed unilaterally with this more ambitious target. On 15 July the three biggest Member States called, however, on the Commission to increase the EU's target for reducing emissions to 30%. That is needed in order to stimulate the necessary investment in green technology and to keep the value of tradeable emission rights high enough to encourage a change in behaviour.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider that circumstances are now favourable, with a view to the climate negotiations in Cancun, for pressing ahead with an emission reduction target of 30%? What steps will it take? And what role does it see in this for the emissions trading system?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The support from the French, German and United Kingdom ministers for a decision to move emission reduction beyond 20% is a very welcome contribution to the debate which the Commission launched with its Communication in May 2010<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>It shows increasing recognition of the fact that this question is not just about commitments and burdens and international negotiations – but also about what Europe as a society will base its welfare and growth on in the future.</p>
<p>And let us be clear: while other countries have not yet signed up to sufficiently ambitious targets in the international context, some of them are moving very fast in any case. For example, in July 2010 it was announced that China may spend USD 738 billion on developing clean energy in the next decade.</p>
<p>But as far as the international negotiations are concerned, the EU is at present the only large emitter that has binding legislation in place on targets after 2012, bringing emission down in the EU to -20% by 2020. Regrettably, the other key industrialised partner - the United States - doesn't seem likely to adopt ambitious legislation any time soon.</p>
<p>However, it is clear that the EU should prepare itself for the situation when the Commission, Council and Parliament see conditions right to increase the target beyond -20%.</p>
<p>The 20% by 2020 target was always an intermediate one, and from the Commission's perspective there is no doubt that emissions will have to be reduced by 30% and even much more at some stage – the question is only by when - and when we take the decision.</p>
<p>In answering this question, one should not only look at what the outside does in the international negotiations, but also look at the self interest of the EU.</p>
<p>On this level the Commission very much welcomes the statements by the three ministers. In line with the Commission's analysis, they emphasise elements such as potential future oil price spikes, energy security, green growth etc. In other words, they agree with the argumentation in the Commission's Communication that this is also about the EU's self-interest.</p>
<p>The Commission hopes that the Communication and its rich analysis will get similar attention in Parliament. It would be good to get input from Parliament on the type of policies the Commission should consider when assessing in further detail the impact of going to a -30% target.</p>
<p>With regard to the implications of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), the Communication outlined some of them. A possible option for the EU to use the ETS to implement a 30% decision would be to tighten the emission cap over the 2013-2020 period by setting aside EUR 1.4 billion allowances that would otherwise be auctioned. This would ensure a cost-effective contribution from the ETS sectors to such a target. This effort would be complemented by emission reductions in the non-ETS sectors.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission recognises the importance of energy security. One of the consequences of the 2008 Climate and Energy Package and other supplementary measures will be to lower the energy intensity of the European economy and thereby contribute to energy security.</p>
<p>For the time being and up to 2012, Member States from Eastern and Central Europe have to reach less ambitious targets under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is not necessarily a direct link between CO2 emission reduction target and increased dependence on natural gas. The EU climate policy offers flexibility to Member States that may choose between various options to reduce their emissions. Beyond the mere promotion of natural gas, alternative options to reach the reduction target include renewable energy production (including biomass), carbon capture and storage for fossil fuel power plants, international credits, or energy efficiency.</p>
<p>For the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), harmonised rules are put in place as of 2013 to avoid competitive distortions in the internal market, including for electricity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the perspective of new Member States - several of them rather coal dependent countries - has been given ample recognition in the Climate and Energy Package, via:</p>
<p>- the option to derogate until 2019 from full auctioning in the power sector for existing power plants (new plants for which the investment process has not been physically initiated before 31.12.2008 are not eligible to avoid competitive distortions). Under this provision the new Member States shall invest corresponding amounts in retrofitting and upgrading of the infrastructure and clean technologies, also with a view to the diversification of their energy mix and sources of supply;</p>
<p>- the redistribution of 12% of auctioning rights to the new Member States, which will increase the revenues for governments from auctioned allowances (these revenues can be used for a combination of investments in energy saving, improved energy efficiency, increased use of biomass and other renewables);</p>
<p>- less demanding effort in terms of emission reduction outside of the ETS (effort sharing decision) and renewable energy targets.</p>
<p>To conclude, the Commission is well aware of the close link between climate action and energy security aspects. The specific situation of some of the Central and Eastern European Member States was taken into account when adopting the 2008 Climate and Energy Package, including through differentiated CO2 targets and special measures for the states concerned.

<p>(EN) The Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) is a priority for the European Union. Since its launch in July 2008 and despite difficult political conditions prevailing in the Middle East, the 43 partners eventually managed to successfully implement the preparatory and transition phase for the setting-up of the Secretariat in Barcelona. Recently the Secretariat has signed a grant contract with the Commission covering 100% of the Secretariat’s provisional budget and making it possible for the latter to start its recruitment procedure and preparatory work on the project guidelines.</p>
<p>This being said, it also has to be acknowledged that the Union for the Mediterranean is not operating in a political vacuum. Political setbacks in the Middle East Peace Process obviously constitute a major obstacle for regional integration and the UfM process as such. The resolution of the Middle East conflict is therefore essential if we are to progress towards regional integration and sustainable peace.</p>
<p>Since 2008, the EU has lent its support to the UfM. In July 2009, the EU decided to provide funding (EUR 60 million) for five project priorities identified at the Paris Summit. We all have a vested interest in developing the institutional capacity of the Union for the Mediterranean, in particular its Secretariat, to promote regional integration projects and spur investments. The Commission is determined to help the Secretariat to deliver on its mission. Funding is available already in 2010 and additional funding can be made available for successive years once the cruising speed of the Secretariat is reached. The Commission is doing its utmost but financial support from other UfM partners will be important.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0365"></a>

<p>The Nord Stream gas pipeline is under construction, and the sad example of the Gulf of Mexico oil slick must alert us to the risks of this multinational project. That is why I would like to put a number of questions. There has been an obvious lack of appropriate responses by BP. Is the Commission familiar with the crisis management procedures provided for in the event of an accident at the Nord Stream gas pipeline? Is the Commission prepared to help Nord Stream with crisis management if any accident occurs? What state would be responsible in the event of an accident, and who would finance action to rectify damage caused by a disaster? Furthermore, Russia has not ratified the Espoo Convention, though it is a strategic and essential Nord Stream partner. What is the Commission's assessment of this situation, bearing in mind that, in his speech on 8 July 2008, Commissioner Stavros Dimas gave an undertaking that 'we always put pressure on third-party countries to ratify agreements of environmental interest'?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission would like to inform the Honorable Member that Nord Stream has been subject to an environmental assessment in accordance with Directive 85/337/EEC<a href="#defann_15_1" name="refann_15_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, as amended (the “Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive”), as well as with national legislation transposing the Directive in each of the countries through which it passes. Under the EIA Directive, the likely significant effects of such proposed projects on the environment should be assessed and the necessary measures to prevent reduce and, where possible, offset any significant adverse effects on the environment should be identified prior to the development consent.</p>
<p>In addition, as a cross-border project, Nord Stream has been subject to an EIA in a transboundary context, on the basis of the UN/ECE Espoo Convention. The Russian Federation has complied de facto with the Espoo Convention. The international consultation process lasted three years. All countries around the Baltic Sea were involved, and consultations as well as formal meetings among all the stakeholders, experts, administrative bodies and the public concerned took place in a transparent way. The EIA is part of the authorisation process and is a pre-requisite for granting permits to construct the pipeline. The competent authorities of all countries concerned have taken the results of the Espoo procedure EIA into consideration when issuing their respective national construction permits. The project received all required environmental and construction permits by the concerned countries (Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Germany and Russia) and the construction started in April 2010.</p>
<p>The position of the Commission is that the Espoo procedure is the most appropriate procedure to assess the environmental impacts for this kind of trans-boundary project and that its ratification by the third-party countries shall be encouraged. Thus, on various occasions the Commission has reminded the Russian Federation of its view that Russia's formal ratification of the Espoo Convention would be a constructive step towards a further enhanced common responsibility for the environmental protection of the Baltic Sea as a particularly sensitive maritime basin. Russia agreed to abide by the rules of the Espoo Convention and a full EIA satisfying the requirements of the Convention was carried out, following which the necessary authorisations were granted by the authorities of the States concerned. This in essence means that for this particular case it did not make a difference if Russia had not ratified the Espoo Convention.</p>
<p>As a general remark, the Commission would want to note that the case of the Nord Stream pipeline cannot be compared to the risks that led to the oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Nord Stream will carry natural gas and no crude or refined oil. Natural gas supply can be very easily controlled at the supply source. Therefore, in case of crisis, such as a rupture of the pipeline, the gas supply can be immediately shut down by the supplier. Consequently, the environmental risks are not similar to those of deep-sea oil drilling.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission is not informed about crisis management procedures provided for in the case of projects planned and proposed by private developers, as is the case of this gas pipeline. This is the responsibility of Member States concerned. The Commission encourages the decision to set up a joint monitoring system for the Nord Stream pipeline by the countries concerned, as proposed in May 2010 during the meeting between the Prime Ministers of Finland and the Russian Federation. Furthermore, in the absence of a legal framework, the Commission always advises pipeline operators to define precise responsibilities and to conclude on the applicable law in advance. The Commission is ready to assist any project, upon request, to achieve legal certainty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Freight Transport Logistics focuses on the planning, organisation, management, control and execution of freight transport operations in the supply chain. According to information available to the Commission, the sector accounts for 14-15 % of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Given that transport alone accounts for 7 % GDP, this figure might well be realistic. On the other hand, given the very broad scope of activities which could fall under "logistics" it might also be too low.</p>
<p>The Commission has set out its main objectives with regard to logistics in the Freight Transport Logistics Action Plan, adopted in October 2007. The Plan, which covers 35 actions, has already delivered some tangible results (ITS action plan, freight-oriented rail corridors etc) and will be subject to a review during 2010 so as to keep it up-to-date.</p>
<p>The Action Plan gives due importance to the key contribution that professionals make to the performance of the logistics industry: 2 among the 35 actions of the Freight Transport Logistics Action Plan, focus on the social aspects; namely on the qualifications, training requirements and on the attractiveness of the logistics professions. The Commission is addressing these issues with the cooperation of social partners, professional associations and other relevant stakeholders.</p>
<p>As concerns the integration of transport modes, this is an important objective of the EU transport policy, to be reflected also in the forthcoming White Paper on transport policy. Therefore initiatives that support the integration of physical goods flows and information flows will be prioritised in the coming years. The on-going review of the TEN-T guidelines will target multi-modal infrastructure projects. The Commission is also moving forward in developing information systems for the logistics sector, in close collaboration with the developments ongoing in the customs area. Finally, in the context of FP7 a number of research and development projects have been addressing the issues of information and communication technologies in transport and logistics, both on EU and global level, notably "SMART-CM- Smart container chain management<a href="#defann_17_1" name="refann_17_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and INTEGRITY<a href="#defann_17_2" name="refann_17_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>- Intermodal global door-to-door container supply chain visibility.</p>
<p>With regard to the specific studies related to logistics, the Commisson would like to refer the Honourable Member to the impact assessment of the Freight Transport Logistics Action Plan that can be found on the Commission's website.</p>
<p>In conclusion the Commission can confirm its interest in promoting smooth cross-border logistics. Businesses' need for seamless logistics services requires a more integrated policy, which combines different modes of transport and different processes such as customs. This will be an important theme of the White Paper on Future Transport Policy which the Commission plans to put forward in a few months time.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the damage to cultural heritage in the northern part of Cyprus and takes note of the concerns of the Honourable Member. It is clear that a comprehensive settlement in Cyprus would enable issues of cultural heritage to be adequately addressed between the two communities.</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission appreciates the establishment of a bi-communal Technical Committee on Cultural Heritage which notably confirmed in press statements that it is the primary responsibility of the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots to protect the endangered cultural heritage of the island.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to inform the Honourable Member that recently it launched a study under the financial aid programme for the Turkish Cypriot Community to compile a list of the immovable cultural heritage of Cyprus according to a common methodology. The Commission is ready to see how it could help further once this first study has been successfully completed by the end of 2010.</p>
<p>Concerning the questions on Turkey, the Commission recalls that the Copenhagen political criteria for accession include the respect for and protection of minorities, cultural rights and freedom of religion by Turkey, as by all candidate countries.</p>
<p>The Commission monitors closely Turkey's position on Cyprus and its compliance with the political criteria, in line with the 2005 Negotiating Framework for the accession negotiations with Turkey. Its assessment is presented in the annual Progress Report. The next report will be adopted in November 2010.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0377"></a>

<p>(EN) From 2006-2008, the EU imported on average EUR 63,8 billion of agricultural products (chapters 1-24 of the EUs Combined Nomenclature, including fish products) from the 176 countries benefitting from the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). EUR 11,2 billion of those EUR 63,8 billion were imported under the GSP preferences (under the three GSP schemes: GSP, GSP + and Everything But Arms – EBA). In addition, 67 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries currently benefit from full duty and quota free access to the EU market for all products (with the exception of sugar which is subject to special provisions) under Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). Overall, 40% of agricultural imports from the GSP beneficiaries entered the EU market duty free under the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) regime, 18% with GSP preferences and 16% with preferences resulting from bilateral agreements, including EPAs.</p>
<p>The impact of the EU's agricultural concessions to developing countries under the GSP scheme, as part of the wider universe of goods, is regularly scrutinised by the Commission, using both internal experts and external consultants.</p>
<p>The last available study by the external consultant CARIS on the mid-term evaluation of the EU’s GSP scheme<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> noted there was some positive evidence of the effectiveness of the scheme. In particular, the studies noted that the EU‘s GSP preferences can be effective in increasing Least Developed Countries' (LDCs) exports and welfare, that GSP utilisation rates are typically high, and that LDC exporters tend to benefit from preference margins received. Still, the analysis also notes that a number of factors, centred on some structural features, such as the generally low level of EU MFN tariffs and the structure of LDCs' trade, constrain to some extent the effectiveness of the GSP regime. The study includes sector-specific analysis showing that imports under the GSP regimes rose for vegetables and prepared foodstuffs. Sugar imports also increased under the EBA regime.</p>
<p>In the context of its Aid for Trade strategy the EU provides development financing seeking to integrate local farmers to regional and international markets. The Commission also regularly informs the beneficiaries' countries about the conditions required to fully seize the advantages of preferential access. In addition, the Commission created the Export Helpdesk, in 2004, as an online service about exporting to Europe, intended at facilitating market access for developing countries to the European Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Directive 2001/29/EC<a href="#defann_20_1" name="refann_20_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society provides the European legal framework for exceptions and limitations to copyright. Article 5(2)(a) of the Copyright Directive states that Member States may provide for exceptions and limitations to the authors’ reproduction right. The condition for such an exception is that authors receive ‘fair compensation’.</p>
<p>The recent opinion of Advocate-General Trstenjak in the case SGAE v. Padawan (C-467/08) interprets the requirements deriving from Article 5(2)(b) of the Copyright Directive, but large parts of the Opinion also apply to Article 5(2)(a). In her recent Opinion, the Advocate-General has made it clear that the Directive (2001/29/EC) can be interpreted as prohibiting levies to compensate for illicit copying (§ 78).</p>
<p>Fair compensation should hence not cover damages caused by reproductions of copyrighted works other than those falling under the legal exception, such as unauthorised reproductions of copyrighted works (i.e. piracy), or reproductions that have been explicitly authorised by the copyright-holder. Authors have the right to obtain compensation for such copies, either in court (for unauthorised reproductions), or by contract (for explicitly authorised reproductions).</p>
<p>Is it the Commission’s view that only legal acts of copying fall within the scope of the exception provided for by Article 5(2)(a) of Directive 2001/29/EC and that these are therefore the only copies that should be compensated for? Given the diverse interpretation and application of Directive 2001/29/EC across the EU, what measures does the Commission plan to take in order to address the negative consequences for the internal market?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society provides that rightholders must receive fair compensation for exceptions and limitations from the reproduction right such as those relating to reprography (Article 5(2)(a)). As the Honourable Member points out in his question, as soon as Member States provide for an exception from the exclusive reproduction right for the purposes of reprography ("reproductions on paper or any similar medium, effected by a photographic technique or by some other process having similar effects"), only acts that fall within the scope of the definition of the exception are lawful acts. In addition, only such acts allowed by the exception can give rise to a claim for fair compensation.</p>
<p>Acts of reprography that are not covered by either a license or a statutory exception would be an infringement of the author's right of reproduction. For example, the reproduction of sheet music is specifically excluded from the scope of the exception. The unauthorised reproduction of sheet music therefore remains an illegal act and the copying of sheet music cannot be rendered lawful by the payment of fair compensation. In this respect, the Commission is cognizant of the need to fight piracy and counterfeiting. It is actively pursuing policies in consultation with all stakeholders on how best to address this phenomenon. Any solutions must be based on a coherent approach that does not undermine the legitimate interests and concerns of rightholders and consumers alike. This also means that fair compensation for lawful acts of reprography has to be distinguished from illegal copying.</p>
<p>The Commission has, in the past, undertaken a variety of initiatives to ensure a coherent interpretation of the above mentioned copyright exception. At this stage, the Commission is still engaged in a stakeholder dialogue aimed at clarifying such matters.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>By drastically cutting public expenditure on health services under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding with the EU, ECT and IMF, the Greek PASOK government is endangering public health and driving wage earners towards private health and insurance schemes, an extremely lucrative sector for multinationals. The findings of the Public Health Inspectorate regarding contracts between public hospitals and Siemens from 2002 to 2009 support complaints by wage earners of massive corporate profits from the plethora of supply contracts. Siemens, as well as being the principal supplier of the EU institutions, also enjoys a virtual monopoly in the supply of public hospital equipment maintenance services. As a result of privatisation and the deregulation of services in the name of competition, the EU and the Greek PASOK and ND governments have effectively blocked public services from the hospitals in question.</p>

<p>The Memorandum of Understanding regarding terms of credit for Greece, to which the Commission is a signatory, specifies the closure of loss-making railways.</p>
<p>For decades, successive Greek governments have systematically failed to meet their financial obligations towards the Greek Railways Organisation (OSE) forcing it to have recourse to state-guaranteed loans. National contributions to co-funded rail projects have also largely taken the form of loans which has not been the case for other transport infrastructures.</p>
<p>The closure of railway lines is the result of practices designed to attribute to the OSE a public debt of €9 billion and of unfair competition at the expense of the railways.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission provides support to the Greek government regarding the implementation of the different Memoranda of Understanding of May 2010 in order to stimulate growth and employment and to remedy the financial problems of the State.</p>
<p>The Greek rail sector features cost recovery, productivity and traffic intensity at levels of 30 to 60% lower than most other European railway companies, whereas the ability of the State to provide financial support is evidently limited.</p>
<p>Funding arrangements for infrastructure under the Structural Funds are not linked with obligations regarding arrangements for the provisions of transport services. Where particular passenger services cannot be operated in profitable way, the State may decide to compensate a railway undertaking on the basis of a contract. Otherwise the latter decides on the services it would like to provide. Nevertheless, the Honourable member should be informed that the EU regulations foresee the rules on durability of operations co-financed by the Funds, in this case the availability of the infrastructure for using it. In the 2007-2013 programming period, Article 57 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 provides for a maximum period of 5 years past completion of an operation co-funded by the Funds during which the said operation should not undergo significant modifications affecting its nature or implementation conditions. In the 2000-2006 programming period, the durability of operations is regulated by Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
