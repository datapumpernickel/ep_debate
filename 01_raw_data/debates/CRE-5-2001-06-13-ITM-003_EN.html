<p class="contents">First, because there is no official Commission proposal on the gradual abolition of tobacco subsidies, merely a reference by the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, to the debate on sustainable development. The wording of paragraph 23 is therefore incorrect.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, because abolishing tobacco subsidies in order to combat smoking is a hypocritical approach. It is hypocritical because any such measures in a European Union with a tobacco deficit will achieve two objectives: first, they will punish tobacco farmers in southern Europe and, secondly, they will strengthen tobacco farmers in other, third countries, from which tobacco will be imported to make up the resultant tobacco shortage, which in turn will affect the balance of trade of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, because there are areas in Europe, such as the prefecture of Xanthi in northern Greece, where the rare Basma variety of tobacco has been the only crop cultivated for several generations and where it is the sole means of support for over 20,000 farmers who work in small, remote, mountain plots measuring between 30 and 300 square metres, where nothing else will grow, and who will be plunged into total poverty if the ideas being promoted are put into practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Military and civil "crisis management", the fire which has broken out in the Balkans and the increasingly acute destabilisation of the area and the enlargement of the EU are just some of the items on the agenda. They will also receive the President of the USA in order to carve up the world and broker an understanding with him on the new Star Wars.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in reality, the summit will be held under the shadow of the recent referendum in Ireland, in which the people rejected the Nice Treaty. However much the leaders of the EU try to play down the results of the Irish referendum, they cannot alter the fact that the Irish people have spoken out against the barbaric and inhumane policy being imposed by the interests of big business on our continent. Their reactions show exactly where the limits of civic democracy lie. They have provocatively stated that the timetable for ratifying the Treaty will be adhered to, the results of the referendum notwithstanding, thereby confirming that their democracy is a dictatorship of big business.</p>
<p class="contents">The state of the European economy, the fall in the euro and other economic issues will be addressed with even stricter anti-grass roots measures than before, at the expense of the workers, by speeding up capital restructuring and hitting the insurance systems, so as to safeguard the competitiveness and profitability of big business in Europe, thereby creating more poverty, unemployment and insecurity for the people of Europe. This is the Europe of their visions; by no stretch of the imagination is it the Europe of the workers. The reference to the environment and what is euphemistically called "sustainable development" is a smokescreen to hide the fact that neoliberal policy is invading the collective sector which we call the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution by the European Parliament not only accepts these guidelines, it goes even further. It distorts reality in a desperate bid to convince the people that all this is for their own good. It plainly commends the militarisation of the European Union and expresses the hope that the Rapid Reaction Force will start demonstrating its operational capacity before the end of the year. It calls for the Member States to spend vast sums on military expenses and on the European Council to approve a strong and efficient conflict prevention programme. It hypocritically condemns terrorist action by the KLA and applauds the pressure being exerted on the government of the FYROM via Mr Solana and Mr Patten. And to prove just how meddlesome it is, the European Parliament has seen fit to commend the Commission's proposal that tobacco subsidies gradually be abolished.</p>

<p class="contents">Some of those who want to pursue the ratification process as though nothing had happened have questioned the 'relevance of the referendum', on the grounds of the low turnout. Perhaps they think that decisions taken by Eurocrats alone are more democratic? At any rate, the low Irish turnout was due mainly to the demobilisation of the ‘yes’ voters, which is, of course, something else to be put on the debit side of the Treaty of Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">The second misinterpretation is that the Irish said 'no' for specifically Irish reasons, i.e. because they wished to retain their neutrality in relation to defence, did not want to become a net contributor financially, wanted to retain their restrictive legislation on abortion, and so forth. But these individual explanations do not suffice. There is only one real reason for the open or underlying 'no' vote: the Irish people's wish to retain their freedom of decision faced with an invasive Europe, which would become even more so with the Treaty of Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">The third misinterpretation is this: we are told that in rejecting Nice, the Irish rejected the intergovernmental method of negotiating treaties on the grounds that it is too obscure. That may be true, but we certainly must not conclude from this that in future we will have to take these powers away from the governments and introduce more supra-national methods of preparing or reviewing treaties. On the contrary, we must give the nations greater powers.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, worst of all, perhaps, are those who regard the Irish vote as a reaction against a Europe that is indifferent to its citizens and explain that the only remedy is to establish a European constitution, as soon as possible. Of course, this remedy would only make things worse by reinforcing the supra-national aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us take a sober and simple look at the result of this referendum: it signals the rejection of a federal Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not one political party campaigned against enlargement. Only one non-party organisation did so. The Irish people have spoken on Nice and their decision will be respected. The people of the other 14 member states are also entitled to have their say on the treaty in accordance with their constitutions. For them it will be expressed through their democratically elected parliaments. They must not be denied that right.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />As a democracy where the people are sovereign, the Irish people are also entitled to decide to revisit their decision to confirm it or to reverse it. It is my view that we now need a sustained debate on Nice and for those parties who supported Nice to seek a mandate at the next general election, which will take place by June 2002, to present a new proposal on Nice to the people before December 2002.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />Myself and my colleague, John Cushnahan have published a seven-point initiative on measures, which we feel could help to clarify the issues and to assuage fears in Ireland. I am happy to report that one of those, the establishment of an Irish Forum on the Future of Europe, has now been adopted by the Irish Government. It should, in my view act in parallel with and interact with the European Convention proposed by the Socialist Group and which Minister Lindh has this morning supported as a proposal for Gothenburg.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not easy to discern the myriad of concerns, some domestic, some European, which gave rise to the No result. There is however one overriding and general concern: The sense that people are losing control of their government and their lives.</p>
<p class="contents"> People know that the European Project is necessary and important to them. But people are at a loss to know how they fit into the scheme of things. The bottom line is that if we want people in every European country to initiate a new experiment in sharing their democracy, sharing their sovereignty, sharing the benefits of their freedoms, then we as their elected representatives have to lead courageously by spelling out in great detail how it will all work.</p>
<p class="contents"> The rights of each and every nation state and each and every single person who lives in Europe must be guaranteed. I believe that can best be done through a New Federalism, based on a European Constitution. So far, we only have the vaguest outline of what that might look like. We have a mountain to climb but I am confident that the people in Ireland and the rest of Europe will rise to the challenge when they are given a chance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With reference to paragraphs 35 and 36, I do not believe that a military alliance which is based on the possession and threatened use of nuclear weapons can be a force for "security and stability".

In a democracy, the results of a move such as this must be respected. We must, therefore, review the content of the amendments to the Treaty, which were adopted in Nice and not insist, which is what happened recently with the vote on the report co-signed by the socialist Member, António José Seguro, on speeding up the process of the federalist integration of the European Union. This would endanger various fundamental aspects of national sovereignty and the interests of the smaller countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that, in Gothenburg, the opportunity of the Summit has not been taken to reflect on the need to review the current process of integration, which is neo-liberal, federalist and militarist, including the rather undemocratic methods that have been used. We must insist on a new direction, grounded in respect for cooperation between sovereign and equal States, in promoting peace, and in responding to people’s real needs. It is, therefore, essential that in Gothenburg we see progress on support for peace in the Middle East, on respect for the rights of the Palestinian people, on protecting the environment and on sustainable development.</p>

<p class="contents">Ireland’s recent rejection of this treaty shows, once again, that Europe cannot be built without the consent of its people. We need to hold referendums on the future of Europe and we need to review and amend the Charter of Fundamental Rights.

Whenever the people of a European Union Member State have the chance to express their views on further European integration, it turns out that about half the voters reject that development. It has already happened in France and Denmark, and now it has happened again in Ireland. The same thing will happen in Sweden and the United Kingdom in the next few years. Last week, 54% of Irish voters rejected the proposals put forward at the Nice Summit at the end of 2000. Not because they have anything against the people of Eastern Europe, but probably because, for example, they understandably do not like the idea of being caught up in NATO’s military ventures.

This week, the European Union is dedicating a whole Council meeting to it in Gothenburg. Next year, the international community will gather in Johannesburg, at the ‘Rio+10’ Summit, specifically in order to update its strategy for sustainable development. Let us not be under any illusions, however. The international frenzy about this fundamental idea – sustainability, which is the same as saying solidarity with the generations to come and solidarity between peoples – is more the result of complying with a timetable established several years ago than of having fulfilled a strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Ten years after the Earth Summit, which took place in Rio de Janeiro, and which instituted the worldwide commitment to a form of development that could bring together not only the economic and social dimensions but also the environmental dimension, we can still clearly see the signs of a lack of sustainability. From the increase in global warming to the reduction of the ozone layer. From a lack of food safety to the growing resistance to antibiotics. From the proliferation of chemical products, especially organically persistent ones, to the destruction of biodiversity. From the accumulation of industrial waste to congestion in the cities. And we must not, of course, forget that terrible sign of the lack of sustainability of our growth model: poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this context, the Gothenburg Council is of very special importance. It will have to both adopt new policies for sustainable development for the European Union and also launch the bases for the worldwide strategy that is to be adopted in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I state my political wish list for Gothenburg, I should like to briefly broach the institutional issue. The fact that the Swedish government has decided to end its Presidency of the European Union with a Council dedicated to sustainable development deserves our applause – it could be said, in fact, that in terms of the political agenda, this Presidency has been a genuine breath of fresh air. Equally worthy of applause is the document drafted by the European Commission as a basis for that Council, ‘a Sustainable Europe for a Better World’. It is unacceptable, however, that the European Commission’s extremely late submission of this document should have prevented the European Parliament from being able to contribute properly to this discussion. Coming back to political issues, I have three wishes for Gothenburg.</p>
<p class="contents">1) The Gothenburg Council must produce a global strategy for sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has an obligation to lead the worldwide debate on a new growth model, based on new methods of production and consumption. This must be a model that does not make economic growth and social wellbeing dependent on the intensive use of resources. Gothenburg is the appropriate setting to open this worldwide debate. It is not only absolutely ridiculous that the 15 Heads of State should dedicate themselves to contemplating the European Union’s navel a few months away from a World Summit, which is being held with the aim of putting this model of global development into perspective; it would also be a complete waste of time. In these times of globalisation, we need European policies and targets for sustainable development that are designed to support and strengthen worldwide policies and targets for sustainable development. It is to be hoped that in Gothenburg, people will be focussing on Johannesburg...</p>
<p class="contents">2) The Gothenburg Council must give a political commitment, with clearly defined targets and actions, to correct the lack of sustainability in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Gothenburg must be geared towards action, with clearly defined targets and timetables. I therefore hope that the Council adopts the following targets:</p>
<p class="contents">- a 30% reduction from 1990 levels of European greenhouse gas emissions by 2020;</p>
<p class="contents">- the elimination of subsidies for the production and consumption of fossil fuels by 2010;</p>
<p class="contents">- in 2010, alternative fuels must represent more than 7% of all fuels used in road transport and, in 2020, this proportion must rise to more than 20%;</p>
<p class="contents">- to implement, by 2004, the new Community policy for chemical products and ensure, by 2020, that all chemical products that are harmful to the environment and to human health are completely eradicated;</p>
<p class="contents">- to adopt, before the end of 2001, a plan covering agricultural and health policies, to break down human resistance to antibiotics.</p>
<p class="contents">- to fully stop the depletion of biodiversity by 2010;</p>
<p class="contents">- to adopt legislation on allocating environmental responsibility by 2003;</p>
<p class="contents">- to promote public road transport and rail and maritime transport so that, by 2010, levels of road transport use are lower than 1998 levels;</p>
<p class="contents">- to encourage the use of renewable energy sources, with a view to achieving targets of 12% of energy coming from renewable sources by 2010, and 50% by 2040.</p>
<p class="contents">3) The Gothenburg Council must launch the bases for the ‘greening’ of the European Union’s common policies.</p>
<p class="contents">There is little point in defining more ecological targets if policies, especially common policies, which are the means of achieving these targets, are inadequate. It is, therefore, crucial that the Council indicates ‘when and how’ the European Union’s common policies that lack sustainability will be reformed, starting, of course, with the common agricultural policy, and covering the fisheries, transport and energy policies too, as well as the rules for allocating sums from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For the first time, environmental issues are the main issue before the European Council this week in Gothenburg. The strategy of sustainable development will create a real content for the Union’s policy, particularly by uniting the economy, employment and the environment. This is an important step in the development of the EU in becoming a responsible player also in international cooperation, a good example of which is the visible defence of the Kyoto Agreement. It must be ensured that the strategy for sustainable development will not be overshadowed by other issues at the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">In Gothenburg, the leaders of the EU must do their utmost to change the negative decision on Kyoto made by the US. As the US National Academy of Sciences agrees on the necessity of the agreement, the Bush administration should not have a problem returning to the ranks of responsible states.</p>
<p class="contents">Serious consideration must be given to the Irish decision to vote against ratification of the Treaty of Nice. We must reassess the way the Union works and increase openness. When, according to researchers in the field, not even the Heads of State who took part in the negotiations are fully aware of the consequences of the Treaty of Nice, we might ask ourselves whether it is possible to reach a sensible decision on this issue at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Every support must now be given to an open preparation model as the forthcoming reform of the Union gets underway. Citizens must be able to follow what is happening in the Union and the institutional reform cannot be made an exception to this principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In a sign of complete disregard for the dignity of the people, even before knowing the final result of the vote in which the Irish people expressed their views, Commissioner Verheugen dared to make the peremptory statement in relation to Ljubljana that an ‘Irish veto’ would in no way prevent the enlargement of the European Union as provided for in the Treaty of Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">Still on the subject of commissioners, the sight of Mr Barnier shamelessly pretending to speak for the Irish people and learnedly explaining to the readers of <span class="italic">Le Figaro </span>on 11 June the three reasons for the Irish ‘no’ vote, which, according to him, have nothing to do with the Treaty of Nice, reflects the same total disregard for the sovereignty of nations. The Irish, who very scrupulously respect their Constitution, are the only Europeans to have had the privilege of being able to express an opinion on Nice in the most democratic way possible, i.e. by referendum. That meant they had the benefit of a real national debate on the content and implications of that treaty. Nonetheless, Mr Barnier declared that ‘the Treaty of Nice itself was not at issue in the Irish vote’…</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Védrine, caught up in the system after initially opposing the draft treaty, now rises pathetically to its defence, accusing the Irish of having succumbed to a kind of withdrawal instinct. Mr Moscovici is broadening the debate by welcoming the absence of a referendum in France: he dismissed this eminently democratic procedure by which the sovereign people are asked to state their views as a ‘pretext offering the coalition of ‘noes’ an opportunity to speak out against Europe’. As for the Foreign Ministers’ Council, since 11 June it has dismissed any possibility of renegotiating the Treaty of Nice to take account of the clearly expressed wishes of the Irish people.</p>
<p class="contents">This kind of stance very much gives the image of a Europe that despises its own peoples and is resolutely opposed to democracy; a Europe that is being built in a deliberately abstruse manner so as to be immune to the wishes or scrutiny of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">To pretend now that the Irish ‘no’ to Nice prevents enlargement is a nonsense. It is the Treaty of Nice that creates the problem here. On the contrary, thanks to the Irish vote, it is now possible, as Philippe de Villiers has proposed, to proceed with enlargement without confiscating national sovereignties. This can be done on the one hand by abandoning the supranational part of the treaty and including its annexed provisions on enlargement in future accession treaties, and on the other hand by enabling the candidate countries to join the European Union immediately, without the need for a supplementary treaty, by offering them accession to the intergovernmental part of the treaty as it stands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It marks the end of an impressive presidency by the Swedish Government and I congratulate my Swedish colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">The Göteborg meeting of the Heads of State and Government will primarily be about enlargement. The most important issue for this summit is to achieve a breakthrough in the enlargement negotiations. The challenge for Europe in the 1980s was to build a single market. The challenge in the 1990s was to create a single currency. The challenge at the beginning of this millennium is to enlarge the EU in a way that creates stability, peace and prosperity for all.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is crucial for increasing trade, employment and prosperity for all, for helping to improve environmental standards and reducing cross-border pollution, for promoting effective cooperation in the fight against crime and drugs, for improving minority rights, and for enhancing peace, democracy and stability in Europe. This is an important message to take to our citizens in the European Union, who should be aware of the advantages and consequences of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much hope that this Summit also makes strong progress on the issue of the environment. Environmental issues are a top priority for our citizens across the European Union. We need to prioritise limiting climate changes and take clear leadership in global cooperation. We also need to agree on working towards concrete goals for the use of clean energy sources, a sustainable transport system, tackling threats to public health and improving our use of natural resources.</p>
<p class="contents">To make Europe truly a people's Europe, we must "green up" our act and look closely at an innovative strategy for sustainable development. Furthermore, we must tell people about the biggest challenge currently facing the European Union and its citizens, namely enlargement. For far too long we have not told them this story, and it is high time we let them know. After all, it is a good story to tell. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What, I regret to say, is not healthy is destroying part of the protective layer of ozone which is in the air, causing an increase in radiation from the sun and the climate change that we all fear. If this should happen, as we are well aware, that would be harmful – as it already is – to all the citizens but, especially, since it is mainly a question of the air we breathe, to the elderly, many of whom suffer from respiratory problems. I therefore hope that the European Union will genuinely continue to work to combat air pollution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that it would be appropriate if, without introducing unwanted censorship, cultural programmes were also to be made which would be educational for viewers and serve the community as a whole, so that we had something to watch other than violent films and spectacles which do nothing but destroy the values that the elderly still have but which young people, I regret to say, have lost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It replaces 15 different national rules governing VAT invoices with one simple set of rules. This demonstrates yet again Europe's commitment to create an environment for entrepreneurs and businesses to flourish across the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Different rules for VAT invoices in EU Member States often hinder many businesses, particularly small and medium-sized companies. Not only does this proposal replace national rules for VAT invoices with one set of rules, but it also covers electronic invoicing and there is provision for the use of advanced electronic signatures. By introducing uniform measures in business transactions across Europe, small companies will gain confidence in trading, not just across Britain, but right across the European Single Market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Single Market is essential for jobs in the North West of Britain. Nearly 40% of small and medium-sized business enterprises in the region have trading links with other EU Member States. As a member of the European Single Market, they will have access to over 370 million potential customers – over 6 times more than in Britain alone.</p>
<p class="contents">I and my Labour colleagues are determined to make the Single Market work for British business. By giving businesses from Bury to Blackburn the confidence to reach into these markets, this measure will contribute to this aim and will increase trade, growth and employment across the North West. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It confirms that the importance formally attached to human and democratic rights must not remain a dead letter, that the progress achieved (or not) in this field must be assessed at regular intervals and that political consequences must be drawn from these findings. It also calls for strengthening the inter-parliamentary process, so that the governments and heads of enterprise do not have a monopoly over the Asia-Europe 'dialogue', by involving the elected institutions. All this could help us strengthen the impact of independent and cooperative intervention by the social movements and the citizens of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the resolution also has a very negative aspect. Paragraph 26, which called for respect for the ILO agreements on trade union rights and workers’ rights, has been deleted. ‘Migratory flows’ are once again associated, in the same sentence, with ‘transnational crime’ and ‘terrorism’. The resolution also wants to impose, as a ‘priority’, respect for the ‘world trade order’, in other words, submission to the dictatorship of the WTO and neo-liberal dogmas. In that spirit, it highlights the ‘central role’ that is to be devolved to the ‘Asian-Europe Business Forum’.</p>

In this sense, therefore, the category of young people is particularly concerned, and the text we have adopted today must be addressed first and foremost to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report is also valuable in that it stems directly from the action of citizens bringing the issue to Parliament’s Committee on Petitions – an opportunity available to anyone in the EU where they have concerns about EU legislation and its implementation, or the lack of such legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The petitioners were people concerned, often directly, about the harmful impact of silicone implants for their health. They spoke movingly to the Committee, research was commissioned via STOA, and this report reflects the outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group welcomes the recommendation for further, more specific research. We also welcome the recommendation for a minimum age for such surgical intervention. It is of great concern to us that many young women feel the need to resort to cosmetic surgery in the search for a more perfect body in order to feel that they fit in to society, rather than society being willing to readily accept people, whatever their size and shape.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need in a number of member states for cosmetic surgery, particularly that offered privately, to be effectively regulated and for all patients to be given full information. The patient register is an important proposal as it will help in future research but also to reach women who may be felt to be at risk in the event of any future problem with a particular implant.</p>

By using silicones it is possible to improve their physical appearance. The problem is that after five years, half these breast prostheses start to leak and after 20 years, it is over 95%. Toxins enter the women’s bodies and can cause inflammation, attack the auto-immune system and damage the connective tissue. In the circumstances, it is better to stop using the silicone implants and to focus on developing alternatives. France has now banned the implants, but other Member States are wavering and indecisive. I agree with those who submitted the petitions that silicone breast implants should not be used until they have been proved not to be harmful. The rapporteur’s solution, which is to improve information and registration, is certainly a step in the right direction in that it might reduce the number of victims, but it is inadequate because it means that there will be more victims even in the future. It is still vital to give women better protection against the manufacturers and make sure they do not sacrifice their health for the sake of appearance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
