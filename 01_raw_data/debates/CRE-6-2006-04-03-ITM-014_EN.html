<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Georgios Papastamkos (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, we are sorry that the competent Commissioner, Mr Mandelson, is not present. The weighing of obligations is an objective exercise and, in all events, the onus of it is upon the chooser. We are, of course, delighted that the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs Wallström, is present.</p>
<p class="contents">The successful conclusion of the current negotiations within the framework of the World Trade Organisation constitutes a major challenge to the global community, given that it is expected to strengthen significantly the global economy, growth and employment. It is also expected to make the international trade system fairer, more balanced and more effective, for the benefit of all trade partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the agricultural sector has, so far, been at the epicentre of the negotiations. Nonetheless, the Union continues to come under pressure, even though, as we know, it submitted a very important offer concerning market access last October. Suffice it to say that the European Union is, globally, the biggest importer of agricultural products from developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The general framework of limitations on duties must be evaluated in conjunction with: firstly, the important offer made by the European Union to eliminate the Community export refund system, secondly, the drastic reduction already made to internal Community aid and, thirdly, the comparatively disadvantageous position of European farmers and producers due to their obligation to comply with stricter rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that further unilateral EU concessions at this stage would clearly jeopardise the implementation of the reformed CAP and be of little or no benefit to those countries for which the development agenda has been designed.</p>
<p class="contents">Development should not be confused with the single-sided advancement of the interests of large agricultural exporters. At the same time, substantial progress is needed in other important sectors, which are sectors of offensive interest par excellence to the European Union, third industrialised countries and developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">On ΝΑΜΑ, the final agreement should guarantee new, real market access opportunities through substantial cuts in applied rates in both developed and dynamically developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In services, further substantial liberalisation is needed with, of course, full respect for national policies and the right of the Member States to regulate their public services.</p>
<p class="contents">Emerging economies need to take their share of responsibility and contribution. It is precisely these countries that maintain the highest levels of protection and hold the key to the development of the poorer countries through the promotion of South-South trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The differentiation between developing countries is not only fair, but is also required for the benefit of the weaker developing countries. The full exemption of all developing countries from the need to make commitments would operate as a disincentive for reforms and for addressing the endogenous factors behind their delayed development.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I believe that externalisation and the more active participation of developing countries in multilateral negotiations, commensurate with their level of development, would contribute to the more effective integration of these countries in the global economy. Of course, the necessary precondition is the granting of adequate targeted technical assistance in meeting their new obligations and effectively implementing WTO rules. Guaranteeing an ambitious and effective Aid for Trade programme is particularly important.</p>
<p class="contents">The failure of the multilateral negotiations and, by extension, the return to bilateral regional agreements could lead to an unequal process of liberalisation, uneven development and uncontrolled trade disputes. The European Union is rightly remaining by its commitment to the multilateral approach of trade policy and its support for the WTO, as the organised expression of world trade governance.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr Mandelson asked me to update you on how he sees the state of play on the round in light of this weekend’s events. Unfortunately, the talks in Rio did not lead to a significant breakthrough. However, they were an important further step to get a better understanding of each other’s positions. We need to understand the pressures on, and aspirations of, our partners. It is not about forcing others to move to our position. It is about understanding where everybody stands and then seeing how our positions can be brought to meet in the middle in a way that brings sufficient gain to all of us. There are still differences, but key players are not talking over one another’s heads as much now. There has to be simultaneous movement now.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the timing and the deadline to agree on arrangements for agricultural and non-agricultural market access by the end of April is concerned, that is still a possibility. However, the contours of the potential deal are not yet fully there. Mr Lamy summarised the state of play after the Rio meeting by calling on Brazil to be prepared to open its industries to foreign competition and by calling for the EU and the US to sweeten their offer to open farm markets. That shows that the European Union finds itself in a better position than it was before and in the immediate aftermath of the Hong Kong Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Members now realise that an advance on the EU’s agricultural offer is not currently in the making and that the success or failure of the round cannot depend on that one factor, but on overall balance. The equation to solve between the competing interests of the WTO members is not easy. However, our objectives and our ambitions remain unchanged: creating genuine new business opportunities in agricultural and industrial products and services in developed and advanced developing countries, as well as contributing to development; restructuring trade in agriculture; and strengthening multilateral rules.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only attain our objectives through a broad and ambitious round. We are paying into the round with proposed real reductions in agricultural tariffs, as well as trade-distorting subsidies, if these are matched by real cuts in industrial tariffs and genuine additional services liberalisation by those who can contribute. We also need to preserve the single undertaking outside of agriculture and industrial goods.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect we would to thank Mr Papastamkos for his excellent report. We thank you for the support for an ambitious and a genuine development Round. We agree with the approach taken by the rapporteur, who has underlined the need to make progress on all issues in this wide-ranging agenda, with a clear emphasis on the objectives of poverty reduction and sustainable development. We very much appreciate the support of this House in pursuing them. However, by referring to a genuine development round, let us not fall into the trap of simplification and generalisation that dismisses the fallacy that agricultural liberalisation would only be a magic recipe for development.</p>
<p class="contents">As laid out in an interesting study by the Carnegie Endowment, the bulk of the benefits of agricultural liberalisation are limited to developed countries and a core group of highly competitive farm exporters, especially Brazil, Argentina and South Africa. Other elements should be taken into account such as the impact of preference erosion in poorer developing countries. For all those reasons, the key gains for developing countries in the DDA lie not in agriculture, but in trade in industrial goods, especially in labour-intensive industries such as shoes and textiles.</p>
<p class="contents">Another fallacy which your report rightly breaks is that within the developing country group all countries are equal. They are not. If we want this round to truly deliver its development potential, then that needs to be taken into account. Contributions to the round should be based on capacity to contribute. Developing countries do not have identical interests and capacities in trade. That is a matter of common sense. We accept that developing countries should, as a general rule, contribute less in terms of market access than developed countries. However, advanced developing countries should provide a meaningful contribution through genuine new market access in non-agricultural market access and services, albeit less than developed counties. They should only do two-thirds of what we do. That is what we call the principle of less-than-full reciprocity.</p>
<p class="contents">As for other developing countries, we agree that they would take up fewer commitments in line with their level of development or, as far as least-developed countries are concerned, even no commitments at all.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to continue to work for trade justice. One of the main achievements of the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference last December was the acceptance by other developed countries to follow the EU way of granting a duty-free, quota-free access to products originating in least-developed countries. But, as you report rightly points out, it is to be regretted that the decision still allows rich countries to exclude 3% of tariff lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Since we are approaching the end phase in this round, we now need to deal with all negotiating areas simultaneously. That requires an intensification of quiet contacts with key partners – like the meeting held last weekend in Rio – to map out potential final packages. At the same time we must continue to reach out to the entire WTO membership, in particular the LDCs and the mid-range developing countries, to build multilateral consensus. Mr Lamy has a crucial role to play there.</p>
<p class="contents">The final deal must serve the interests of all WTO members and especially the least-developed countries and the other weak and vulnerable members. Even though this is becoming increasingly challenging, we will continue to work towards deadlines agreed in Hong Kong, such as that concerning agreement on the arrangements for agriculture and industrial tariffs by the end of April. At the same time we will ensure that other issues in this round that will take longer, such as services, rules and geographic indications, remain part of the single undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to inform you and listen to your views on the major developments in this round. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development, I am pleased that the development component has been given the prominent position that is its due.</p>
<p class="contents">That trade can make a contribution in the areas of development, poverty reduction and achieving the Millennium Objectives is not a matter of dispute. It does remain a tricky subject, though, because whilst the interests of the different countries do not always run parallel, law and order do remain important in world trade. Everyone benefits from fair rules in trade. That is why the multilateral trade framework remains of vital importance, particularly in the case of developing countries, and that is why we must make an all-out effort to finish this year’s Doha round on a positive note.</p>
<p class="contents">I was hopeful of this, but am now growing increasingly worried. We are nearly four months down the line and hardly any progress has been made, and Rio has not yielded enough results either apparently. A great deal is left to be done in many areas, including, as the Commissioner has already pointed out, the working out of a special and differential treatment for support to the least developed countries, in particular, to enhance the trade and negotiating capacity with regard to trade-disruptive subsidies, such as internal support, etc. These topics need to be further negotiated and none of this should depend on a result in agriculture or Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lamy warned us recently that failure to achieve the three key targets by the agreed deadline of 11 April is a recipe for the round’s failure. He mentioned in this respect internal support, market access for agricultural products and industrial tariffs. Europe, the US and more developed developing countries should shoulder their responsibility in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I am still hopeful of a positive outcome this year. Europe’s commitment is solid, but without efforts on the part of all key players, no result can be achieved at multilateral level that can make or break the weaker developing countries. Let us continue to work for a successful round with a good result, especially for the sake of the poor countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, regrettably, this report and frequently the talks themselves fail to devote sufficient attention to solving European Union services sector problems in trade, while the European Union services sector accounts for 70 per cent of the European Union's gross domestic product. To emphasise this sector's importance and its importance for international trade services, I will just touch on two aspects. This affects financial sectors in particular. In developing countries, the lack of opportunity to take advantage of various progressive financial products, especially for small and medium business, where the largest proportion of these countries' populations are employed, hinders the modernisation of their economies and the transition of labour from agriculture to areas of higher productivity. On the other hand, the institutions of the European Union cannot exploit the potential of the huge financial services industry. We are very competitive in this area. And we are encountering problems when trading with developing countries in agricultural products. That is, in truth we must strive to change the structure of trade so that it is easier to work and so that a more modern economy is a more modern global economy. That is, we ought to encourage trade in financial services, which would allow developing countries to modernise their economies and would in turn make the international trade structure more effective. Of course, this means that we must discuss the introduction of standards covering the regulation of trade, company management and the regulation of financial services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, too, would like to see a successful conclusion to the Doha Round – but not at any price. It is not acceptable that the few should get all the benefit while many others are left behind. What we need is fair trading conditions. I welcome the report’s insistence on the necessity of a fundamental reform of the WTO. It is not enough for the WTO to be given the main objective of extending trade. Environmental standards, consumer protection standards, animal welfare standards and social minimum standards must also be laid down as goals for the WTO. It is not acceptable that the ultimate winners from the WTO negotiations should be those who plunder nature and exploit people.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfair that European farmers engaged in food production should be required to comply with one requirement after another, while such requirements do not apply to imports. Helmut Kohl, the former German Federal Chancellor, once said that he would like to see apply to food imports what already applied in the case of the motor industry, with cars from Japan, the USA, and Korea being allowed to be imported into Germany, but allowed to be driven on the roads only if they comply with the high technical standards that are imposed here. If foodstuffs meet the same high standards as we European farmers do, then we need have no fear of global competition. </p>

We can count ourselves fortunate that, in Hong Kong, a political framework was achieved that now, <span class="italic">de facto</span>, determines the form that the negotiations in Geneva will take. Politics has, after all, achieved something, but it is now for the experts in Geneva to work out the substance, and we can only hope that they do it as quickly as possible. We know that that will not be easy, but we are under a certain pressure of time, without which, as a rule, solutions are not arrived at in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">For the small and medium-sized enterprises, of course, the primary concern is with the opening up of the market, which should be ambitious and, above all, founded upon mutuality. I believe that it is in this area that the ‘development box’ – a programme for SMEs, designed to bring together small family-run businesses in the developed world and in the least developed countries – would be a good way for both sides to be successful in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">For that, of course, we need the parliamentary dimension in the various WTO countries. As we know, every parliament includes both government and opposition, and it is the opposition that could make very considerable headway where these issues are concerned, for, in the least developed countries, the opposition and, of course, the media, are of particular importance when it comes to making progress in negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally – and this, I believe, is not without significance – there is the trans-Atlantic relationship. This is where talks are needed, particularly with regard to agriculture, and I can do no other than concur with Mr Deß. We need a framework here that promises a winning chance for all. We need the world market, and so may it be in future too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our group will propose a few minor changes and then support his work tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">The results in Hong Kong were modest — we debated this back in January — but a road map was drawn up, with established time limits, the first being this 30 April.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to focus my speech on our course towards Geneva. It is encouraging that the negotiations have been rebalanced and that the discussions are no longer exclusively about agriculture. Progress is being made in terms of NAMA, services and trade facilitation, and development issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We still want this Round to close at the end of the year with an ambitious and balanced agreement in all fields of the negotiation. We fully support the Commission’s strategy and we still defend the principle of the single undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">Success essentially depends on the political will and flexibility of the big players. The time has come to move ahead. We are counting on the negotiating skill of our competent Commissioners to persuade the United States to present new proposals with regard to internal aid to their farmers and to the emerging countries, in particular Brazil and India, to be flexible in terms of their positions and to present proposals leading to a genuine opening up of their industrial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to NAMA, bearing in mind that the Swiss formula has been chosen, an appropriate number of coefficients should be defined and the principle of less-than-full reciprocity applied, in order to ensure that the developing countries can protect their fragile industrial sectors and that European industry can strengthen its competitive position in access to the industrial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of services, we must continue in the direction embarked upon in the recent plurilateral negotiations and the requests presented on 28 February must be accompanied by serious revised offers on 31 July, always bearing in mind that a balance must be maintained between the liberalisation of the markets and the member countries’ full right to regulate activity in this sector, particularly in the field of essential public services.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, in Hong Kong, we parliamentarians had a magnificent view of the bay, but we had to use binoculars in order to follow the work of the Conference. There is a gorgeous lake in Geneva. I hope that the same thing will not happen there.</p>

His approach has allowed us to reach right across the Chamber in order to produce a very fine piece of work that I believe moves this issue forward for Parliament, the Commission and the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The WTO has taken concrete steps to improve the transparency and democratic participation in its decision-making processes, yet there remain basic flaws, which many of my contributions to this report have sought to address.</p>
<p class="contents">In Hong Kong some 450 meetings were organised, yet elected observers were invited to just a handful of them. Only two featured the whole WTO membership and the majority were exclusive and secret ‘green rooms’. This may make for efficient negotiations, but leaves little opportunity for public oversight of the most vital institution in the global trading system. This culture of closed decision-making is a major setback in the fight to peel back the layers of secrecy, one which parallels our own struggle with the European Council. Whilst conference leaders congratulated themselves on a transparent and bottom-up process, there are no records or minutes of these meetings. Who said what, which countries were invited or present, will never be known by the public. These concerns only increase with the organisation of mini-ministerials and ‘super green rooms’ where the majority of developing countries are either uninvited or unable to attend.</p>
<p class="contents">Increasing membership and consensus-based decision-making, whilst seemingly more democratic, still does not compensate for the influence of industrialised countries compared with that of their developing counterparts. Despite over three-quarters of the membership being developing countries, the WTO still pits heavyweights against flyweights.</p>
<p class="contents">Lack of access led to the collapse of talks in Seattle and Cancun when ministers exercised the democratic right and said ‘no’. Yet lessons were not learned. The 2005 talks were still structured so that discussions took place in different sites at the same time. This benefits the large EU and US delegations, but leaves some developing countries’ ministers – those unable to split themselves in two – feeling helpless, often knowing less than the omnipresent NGOs and corporate fat cats.</p>
<p class="contents">NGOs have forged a greater role for themselves in the WTO negotiations on the basis that they represent civil society, but do they? Who are their constituents and how can they possibly benefit from narrow, single-issue-driven campaigns? More importantly, how can democracy prevail when non-elected NGOs enjoy more privileged access to the key players than democratically elected representatives?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission may have made conscious efforts to communicate with observers in Hong Kong, but that is no substitute for the direct input of elected parliamentarians to redress this clear democratic deficit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Making this a normative requirement was a milestone in the history of international trade relations, and it was and is the right thing to do. What that means is that the continuation of the talks must be considered from the perspective of development. </p>
<p class="contents">This is what makes it all the more alarming that the renowned Carnegie Foundation should now come out with a report pointing out that the development content of the current round is virtually nil. We must take this analysis, and this judgment, very seriously, and in the light of them it is incumbent upon the Commission, in the negotiations, to use what is termed ‘special and preferential treatment’ as a way of finding and supporting flexible solutions for the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters now is that what came out of Hong Kong should not be made any worse in the current negotiations. That is why we Greens reject the proposal put forward by Mr Papastamkos in his report that the number of coefficients in the Swiss formula be kept as low as possible. That, in essence, goes against the spirit of the Hong Kong compromise and would deny the developing countries greater scope for independent development, yet it is this flexibility that they need, and I call on the Council and the Commission to disregard proposals of this kind and to adopt a negotiating strategy that is favourable to development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The large number of amendments tabled in committee testifies to the fact that there can be very different views of the value of accommodating differing interests and, of course, of setting a variety of priorities. </p>
<p class="contents">Turning to agriculture, it is clear that the common agricultural policy is in need of reform, although it must retain its multifunctional character, one of the consequences of which is that farmers in the European Union must continue to receive support, while care must, however, be taken to ensure that grants for socially and environmentally sustainable regional development must be put to work in rural areas rather than big agribusiness and the banks being given preferential treatment. I might add that I do not regard the European Union’s offer to abolish its export subsidies by 2013 as part of CAP reform as being particularly generous; indeed, it is no more so than the cautious reduction in internal support.</p>
<p class="contents">As for NAMA, I regard the Swiss formula for non-agricultural market access, as currently proposed, as utterly inadequate, for ‘equal’ is not the same thing as ‘fair’. All states, and developing countries in particular, must be accorded the right to industrialise themselves at a speed of their own choosing, which means that they must also be allowed to protect vulnerable industries. Moreover, let me sound a strong warning of the negative economic consequences that the sudden breaking off of customs revenue can have for such countries, since customs duties are often a vitally important source of income for their state budgets. </p>
<p class="contents">As for services, the same applies to them, albeit to an even greater degree. During the past week, no less a person than Pascal Lamy, the director-general of the World Trade Organisation, has once more confirmed that the GATS rules allow all states the free choice as to whether or not to liberalise their services markets, and, should they wish to do so, to do it as and when and to such an extent as they shall themselves choose. Not even Annex C of the ministerial statement can, or should be allowed to, interfere with that in the area of services of public general interest such as education, culture, health, infrastructure and energy. </p>
<p class="contents">If I may move on to preferences, it is the case that the report addresses the problem of the erosion of preferences and the falling prices for raw materials, but this is where Parliament, in view of the expiry of the ACP/EU agreement, should additionally insist on greater emphasis being placed on the development goals in the course of negotiations on economic partnership agreements. </p>
<p class="contents">Then there is democracy: as regards the democratic dimension, what I regard as definitely necessary is greater consultation – not only within the Inter-Parliamentary Union, but also with this House, with national and regional assemblies and with the public.</p>
<p class="contents">TRIPS: I welcome the agreement on the amendment of TRIPS to give the developing countries better access to medicines, but I do not regard it as sufficient. If all people are to be guaranteed access to medicines, then further changes will be needed in respect of mandatory licensing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Zbigniew Krzysztof Kuźmiuk, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the UEN Group</span>. – <span class="italic">(PL)</span> Mr President, we are debating the report of Mr Papastamkos on the assessment of the Doha round following the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong, which took place in 2005. Even the preparations for the Conference and the action taken during that period by the Commission and the Council caused great concern in the European Parliament, especially in terms of the future of agriculture in the European Union. I should like to draw Members’ attention to two facts relating to that period.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, on 18 October, at the European Union Foreign Ministers Meeting, Commissioner Mandelson said that the European Union must make concessions to other countries during the WTO negotiations, because the European Union will gain more on the export of industrial goods and services than it will lose on weaker protection of agriculture. This statement suggested that there may be a wish to sacrifice the interests of EU agriculture in return for vague gains in other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in December 2005, before the relevant reports were adopted by the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council hastily announced a reform of the sugar market, which will probably not help the poorest countries exporting sugar to the European Union, but will deliver a painful blow to the European Union’s sugar beet growers, especially those in the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Those two facts demonstrate that before the Hong Kong conference took place, the Commission and the Council wanted to show the world their willingness to offer concessions during the negotiations, especially in agricultural matters. As it turned out, other WTO members have shown no such far-reaching desire to offer concessions, and what is more, they have blamed the European Union for the lack of progress in the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems therefore that during continued negotiations, which will take place in 2006, European Union institutions will have to abide by the following principles in relation to agriculture: concessions made during WTO negotiations must not undermine either the food self-sufficiency of the Union nor the European model of agriculture, nor its multifunctional character. Offers of agriculture concessions must be conditional and must be withdrawn if there are no satisfactory offers from other WTO partners during the negotiations that follow. Thirdly, because of the considerable reduction of duties on agricultural products, only products not associated with economic, environmental or social dumping practices should be granted free access to the European Union market, whereas agricultural products produced in conditions involving breaches of human rights and of international treaties on environmental and animal protection must be subject to additional charges or special protection clauses.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the costs to be incurred by European farmers in ensuring the appropriate animal welfare standards have been assessed at approximately EUR 10 billion, we must demand that animal products originating from outside the European Union meet similar standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference Commissioner Mandelson made significant concessions on European agriculture in exchange for, I suppose, the hope of concessions in non-agricultural market access from the other big economic powers but, as we know, they did not concede much.</p>
<p class="contents">In the exchange of agriculture for services, Irish sugar beet farmers have lost their crop, and we have now lost the last of our sugar factories, in Mallow, in my own constituency, which closed just two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Irish farmers are worried that beef and dairy will be sacrificed next, in an effort to get trade concessions in services.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">James Hugh Allister (NI). –</span></span>   Mr President, although the current round of multilateral trade negotiations has been going on since 2001, the ambition to conclude them this year looks increasingly unobtainable, certainly if we judge it by the incremental effect of Hong Kong. Hong Kong failed to make any substantial headway on the liberalisation of the international trade in services or non-agricultural market access. The EU got nothing that matters in return for its commitment to eliminate export subsidies by 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">This concession, which comes on top of the pain of CAP reform, involves sacrifice for Europe’s rural communities. For example, in Northern Ireland our milk production industry is heavily reliant on export refunds available on whole-milk powder. This concession should be taken off the table in a short period of time if there is no reciprocal response on non-agricultural market access and on services.</p>
<p class="contents">My second area of concern is the lack of real democratic control over what is negotiated on our behalf by the Commission. As one of the terms of EU membership, each state surrenders control of trade policy to Brussels so that no Member State can independently negotiate trade agreements with any country anywhere in the world. National interests are made totally subservient to what is perceived to be the EU’s overall interest. That involves a massive surrender of national power, compounded in its folly by the lack of real control over what the Commission then does in our name. Yes, we debate it here, but realistically we can change nothing. There is no effective mechanism to hold Commissioner Mandelson to account. Such democratic deficit is one of the design defects of this EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is quite astonishing. It is quite clear that Ireland is the greatest success story of the European Union. And yes, trade is an exclusive competence of the European Communities, but basically Member States sit around a table, make a decision by qualified majority, and give the Commission a mandate to negotiate. Of course, if you wanted a federation, perhaps you would do things a bit differently, but I have not heard anything of that sort. Anyway, I am sorry, I could not hold myself back.</p>
<p class="contents">I have several points. First, I would like to welcome the report, which I have to do because Mr Papastamkos is sitting in front of me and if I do not he would turn around and punch me in the face! I think it raises key issues. I also think that globalisation is the best thing that has happened to us over the past 150 years. It has raised global welfare; hundreds of millions of people have improved their living conditions. Our great challenge, within the context of the WTO, is how to find a key role for the European Union and how to get everyone on board.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if Doha failed, we would probably survive in the short term; after all, we are a global trading power – over 20% of world trade comes from us, over 20% comes from the United States. We could have some bilateral trade agreements with other parts of the world. But in the long term I do not think it would work out. In the long term protectionism works like an ostrich; you are trying to hide from reality in many ways.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and this is for Mrs Wallström – and through her for Mr Mandelson – I agree with those who say that we have already given many concessions, especially on agriculture. I think the Commission is doing a great job, but the reality is that, at the end of the day, we will most probably have to make a few more concessions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that we need to finish these negotiations in 2006, because after that we are not going to have the United States on board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, of course, I have to thank Mr Papastamkos, but I would like to include in that expression of gratitude Mr Moreno Sánchez, a member of my own group and its shadow rapporteur. Both of them, along with all the other Members who have acted as shadow coordinators, have done excellent work in achieving – to some extent jointly – a good compromise and a credible report.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a couple of important points to make, which relate to the aspects that you, Commissioner, addressed. We find ourselves in a very tricky situation. London was not a success, Rio was not a success, and next comes Geneva. Are you ready and able to say something about the prospects for these negotiations? Will Geneva happen? How will it work out?</p>
<p class="contents">A second point that we have raised with the Commissioner several times already is whether the Commission will, this time, be willing to acknowledge, in the final statement, the role of parliaments. There is recognition already for civil society, but the role of parliaments is still passed over in silence. Only if it is mentioned will it be possible to give better guarantees, in future, of the parliaments’ involvement and of their ability to exercise a monitoring function. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that he has put a great deal of himself into it and has been personally involved in the work on it, so I warmly congratulate him on this document.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points to which I would like to draw attention. The first is that of geographical indications of origin. It is to be regretted that neither the Commission nor we Europeans as a whole have succeeded in resolving the issue of geographical designations of origin, important though it is, and we are talking here not only about places and names, but also about the knowledge contained in the products that come from these places. In very many cases, Europe is the original that many others imitate, and we should make them pay us for that. </p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to discuss is the one that Mrs Mann, Mr Karim and others raised, which has, fortunately, had some influence on the report. It is not acceptable that 130 parliamentarians from 80 countries should spend three days negotiating and then not be mentioned even once in the final <span class="italic">communiqué</span>, whilst there are six references to non-governmental organisations in the same document. That is an invitation to put a question mark against this assembly's democratic legitimacy. To whom, if not to democrats, should it refer?

The first of these is that there is no alternative to the multilateral trading system. Bilateral agreements always benefit the stronger party. We must focus on the developing countries, which benefit most from straightforward multilateral systems that allow them to free themselves from dependency on the colonial powers. Secondly, the report states that the EU must show leadership. This means that we in the EU must necessarily accept that we are going to pay for the agreements. We must get away from the quid-pro-quo principle and not focus on what we in the EU can get out of agreements in the short term. Agreements that combat global poverty are of most benefit to us too.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is agriculture. The decision to phase out export subsidies is all well and good, but we must also look at the rest of the subsidy arrangements, including subsidies for rural districts. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), such arrangements are very problematic for the world’s poor. Finally, I want to say how gratifying it is that the report alludes to the ILO and environmental standards, even though it does so in unduly broad terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the fact that it has been labelled the development round, it is precisely developing countries that will end up being the main losers, as, moreover, it transpired from a report commissioned by the World Bank itself from an independent group.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the continuation, until 2013, of the European export subsidies for agricultural products and of the US subsidies for the cotton industry will cause a further social disaster in developing countries. The wealthy countries’ request that the developing countries’ tariffs be abolished or greatly reduced will further accentuate the negative trend for those regions. Moreover, the possibility of keeping import tariffs on 3% of the products that are currently protected will enable the United States, for example, to reinforce the tariff protection on as many as 420 products, and it is very easy to imagine that the products safeguarded <span class="italic">in extremis</span> will include those very products that are of the greatest importance to the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not to mention the review of the TRIPS agreements which, aside from all the rhetoric, will make it even more difficult for all those countries in the south of the world to gain access to medicines. In conclusion, I believe that the report neither highlights those aspects nor points out that the WTO in fact represents an unfulfilled promise of an essential form of multilateralism designed to distribute wealth more effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why the EU has come away virtually empty-handed from the negotiations on designations and services. It is because the EU must prioritise progress in these areas that I am delighted with the amendment in which the rapporteur calls on the Commission to draft an alternative action plan in case the negotiations fail. This bears witness to more realism than simply insisting on the round ending in 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">A second element which I would like to highlight in this otherwise sound report is the role of China. Europe needs to give attention not only to the protection of intellectual property and to dealing with illegal state support, but also to access to the Chinese market. I am therefore delighted to learn of the increased cooperation between the EU and the United States which has resulted in a common complaint about the imports of car components into China.

We are therefore all in favour of multilateral rules, but which rules, and to benefit whom?</p>
<p class="contents">We are told that free trade benefits employment and growth. Yet, have the rules applied to trade until now made nations wealthy? Here is the answer: in Mexico, 94 free trade agreements have been signed and they have not brought about prosperity; in Ecuador, the indigenous people of the Andes are against the free trade agreement; currently, in France, three million secondary school students are demonstrating because there are no jobs; and, where I live, the wine growers are poverty-stricken, people are committing suicide and yet there is free trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The observation demonstrating that the current free trade rules do not lead to economic prosperity indicates two possibilities. The first possibility is that free trade is the secular name for Christianity, whereby the wine growers of Europe, the small farmers and the workers must climb onto the Cross in order to atone for their worldly sins. In that case, let us continue and, in exchange for our concessions, Brazil and India will not open up their markets, and the Anglo-Saxon world will not recognise our intellectual property rights in relation to our agricultural designations. Thus, Commissioner, we are persevering on the poverty path which, after ten rounds of GATT and WTO negotiations, has done nothing for Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The other possibility is that, finally, we stop making mistakes and follow the path of subscribing not to the archaic technique of reducing or abolishing customs duties, but to the modern technique of deducting customs duties. We will make the technological leap by inventing deductible customs duties because, in the form of tax credits that are offered to exporting countries and that can be used in the importing country, we shall have customs duties that ensure economic neutrality, and we shall resolve the tragedies brought about by globalisation.</p>

<p class="contents">The greatest success of the Hong Kong Conference was the fact that it was not a failure. The stage that we are now at is crucial for the Earth’s balance. I have two proposals and one remark to make. Firstly, as regards the suspension of export subsidies in 2013, I should like to return to the proposal to set up an independent audit of all forms of tangible and intangible aid, and this so as to put a stop to the hypocrisy governing this matter. Furthermore, we must place emphasis on important planning efforts, enabling quantitative and qualitative assessments to be made of the economic and social impact in Europe, in terms, for instance, of employment in the context of these negotiations. Some of our important economic sectors, such as the agri-foodstuff industries, are very vulnerable in these negotiations, and the least we can do is to provide them with information.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we need to tackle the issue of the link between international trade, wealth and poverty because it is vital that economies – particularly those in the West – which create their wealth by adhering to market principles, help implement real mechanisms for eradicating poverty in the world. If we, as democrats, do not do so, then we will pay a very high price in political terms, not least by witnessing a rise in extremism. There are Members in our European Parliament who believe that international trade creates poverty and not wealth. As far as we, in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, are concerned, we believe that the opposite is true. In the past, the world dealt with its great upheavals by means of wars, and, today, military wars have been replaced by economic wars, with two differences: instead of people dying, we have people out of work, and we do not know who the enemy is. In this affair, and faced with the rise in national self-interest which, at the end of the day, is only the sum of individuals’ self-interest, the European Union has a great deal at stake. During the debates on our European Constitution, we had explained that we needed a more political Europe in order to exist in a world that is becoming more complex by the day. If our fellow citizens do have any doubts about the usefulness of the European Union in this global trial of strength, then this will be yet another blow to our great European project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Admittedly, the round is making progress, but it is not keeping pace with the clock counting down to the moment when the US administration’s negotiating mandate will expire and, unlike in the case of the previous rounds, we do not have the opportunity on this occasion to extend the debates by two or three years, unless we jeopardise the entire multilateral structure. I believe that, if we are enthusiastic about this multilateral framework, we now need to call on each of the parties to make one final effort. After the computer simulations in London, and after the spring-like beginnings or preliminaries in Rio, it is now time to act.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, industrialised countries, Europe and the United States must make decisions and commitments and they must make the necessary gestures, because this round is a development round. Admittedly, the G20 countries - the emerging countries - will themselves also have to make a number of concessions in the area of industrial tariffs, but we know that there will be less than full reciprocity. We cannot demand that they jeopardise a number of fragile economic sectors or industrial or service sectors that are still not necessarily ready to be opened up to international competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that, despite everything, this round deserves to be concluded and I perhaps differ in that regard from some of my friends, such as Mr Agnoletto, who was pointing out its inadequacies a short while ago. There are certainly inadequacies, and the European Union’s energy must be focused on making sure that the commitments made to promote development are respected. Yet, there is also the question of the abolition of export subsidies. The implementation of this process must start before 2013 and, above all, it must be accompanied by a commitment and monitoring mechanism that guarantees that the other industrialised countries, and not just the European Union, move in the direction of abolishing all export subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">Developing countries will, all the same, have greater access to the market of wealthy countries for their agricultural produce, and the list of sensitive goods must be reduced. The least developed countries must be able to access the market free from duties and quotas, but a proportion of the 3% of tariff lines that will enable some countries, such as Japan or Australia, to avoid making this effort must be abolished; the TRIPs agreements on access to medications must be amended; and provision must be made for a development package including trade aid that must not be substituted for the aid already provided for in the context of the official development aid earmarked for the Millennium Development Goals.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For ten years now, the WTO has been overseeing the complex business of international trade. The quantity and quality of this trade is growing at an exponential rate. It is therefore becoming crucial to develop a strong, uniform regulatory framework that guarantees transparency and eliminates inequalities. The multilateral system is the only form of negotiation that is likely to guarantee a balanced approach among all the members.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that Europe can defend this position within the new negotiations and work hard to conclude the agreements by the end of 2006, since a further failure would weaken the entire system and give rise to serious consequences, especially for developing countries. It is these countries, in particular, that we need to defend, and the industrialised countries’ renunciation of export subsidies is a major step in this direction. Naturally, if an initiative of this kind is to have positive results, it must be duly supported and retabled by the other members of the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">For the sake of the development of the least developed countries, it is also important to ensure that the liberalisation of other sectors, such as services, does not cause irreparable harm to the economic and social structure of those countries and, in particular, that the delivery of public services is not subject to the competition rules and commercial pressure of companies from the North.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, however, I urge the Commission to ensure that our production is protected, especially in those sectors in which the burden of counterfeiting and illegal importation is becoming intolerable for thousands of industries. The Commission must insist that the rules in force are strictly applied against these activities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The US lags behind in terms of the agricultural reform act; the EU is unforthcoming about further restrictions of car-sensitive products and the restriction of ‘blue’ services, and the G20 remain behind in terms of the reduction of the industrial tariffs. Africa and the least developed countries are at risk of being at the receiving end of this. They deserve the permanent right to protect their own agriculture, because the livelihoods of seven in ten people in those countries depend on this sector, and they deserve liberal access to the growth markets of the EU, the US and the G20.</p>
<p class="contents">Two weeks ago, Pascal Lamy, the WTO’s Secretary-General, did not mince his words when he said that unless we persevere in Geneva at the end of this month, the round will end in failure. This would cost Europe economic growth and jobs, and Africa would lose out in terms of economic development and would fail to achieve the Millennium Objectives in the areas of basic education and health care. So let us combine Europe’s and Africa’s interests; I would urge Commissioner Mandelson to go as far as he can with scrapping and restricting agricultural subsidies, and to support the Europe of the 21st century and not to turn Africa and our citizens into prisoners of past choices! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although a great deal of progress is yet to be made in the negotiations, at least people are still talking, which is a blessing in itself. I should like to make three points which, to my mind, will remain of critical importance in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is the need to involve the poorest countries. Many delegations, in respect of the poorest countries that stand to gain the most from this round, find it difficult to remain involved in the negotiations at an expert level.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is these developing countries in particular that must benefit from world trade. After all, it is not for nothing that we talk about the Doha ‘development’ rounds. I should therefore like to call on the Commission and the EU Member States to translate this fine principle, one that has been referred to in many speeches, into action both during and after the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the liberalisation of trade in services. The way in which those negotiations are being conducted is changing, and I regard that as a dangerous development. In my view, abandoning the bottom-up approach cannot be reconciled with the idea of a development round and the report could have been more hard-hitting on that point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I would like to thank you for this debate, which I found very constructive and balanced and indeed very interesting. Thank you for not shooting the messenger! I will indeed make sure that everything that has been said tonight is immediately forwarded to Mr Mandelson, who will also appreciate, I believe, that I did not go into depth on all the details of this Doha Round.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to comment on the overall process. As you will understand, this is being regularly reported and discussed in the Commission. As several Members asked, what happens if Doha fails and what should we then say about the overall process? It is true that this process is not easy, but it is not blocked either, and we are still committed to concluding the round by the end of the year and to the principle of the single undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been mentioned, we have proposed real cuts in agricultural tariffs, but they must be matched by real cuts in industrial tariffs and services liberalisation. We have a few weeks left before the end of April and we will continue to discuss with our partners, step by step, so as to agree on the arrangements within the deadline that we set ourselves in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a few words about MEPs’ participation in the next WTO meeting, because I think this is very important to all of you. As far as I understand it, the April meeting of the WTO is likely to be a General Council meeting in charge of negotiating procedures; it is not a ministerial as such, so it is not the same set-up and therefore the Commission does not foresee a fully-fledged official EU delegation such as that which we usually send to ministerial meetings like Hong Kong. If the INTA Committee here in Parliament sends MEPs to Geneva during that meeting, the Commissioner will be ready to meet them and provide a debriefing as usual. The Commission delegation in Geneva will also provide the support we usually offer to MEPs on the ground when they are on official business abroad. That is what we can say for today about MEPs’ participation.</p>
<p class="contents">Again I thank you for the discussion and I will make sure that your views are immediately forwarded to Mr Mandelson and to the Commission as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
