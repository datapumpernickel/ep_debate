In finally presenting this report to plenary on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee, there are many people I should and will thank, but there is one whose inspiration I would especially like to mention because I hope it will set the scene for our debate tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">As a young lawyer in London in the early 1980s, I was privileged to work with a then elderly German lady, who was one of those remarkable German-Jewish immigrés who came to London in the early war years and entered the English legal profession. This amazing lady not only qualified as an English solicitor, having previously qualified in Germany, but, as a true European of her own generation, she also obtained a doctorate from the Sorbonne the title of which was the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments. She inspired me with an interest in this area of law and as she gradually retired and handed over her practice, I became more and more familiar with the workings of the Brussels Convention as it came into force in the UK. I hope she would approve of where we have got to today, and how the European Union is now able to allow lawyers to move and practise in other Member States by choice rather than force of circumstance and that by this regulation our committee will further assist a step forward in giving greater access to justice to our citizens across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to use this occasion to say something about the importance of what we are doing here. The original EC Convention on Jurisdiction and Judgments of 1968 was an important landmark in this field of international private law, marking a departure from a previous patchwork of mainly bilateral treaties between various countries. For the first time, by way of an intergovernmental convention, the EC gave itself a special, unique and comprehensive regime of recognition and enforcement.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now participating in the next important landmark in that process – seeing what was a convention become a Community act, a regulation, in one fell swoop bringing a previous area of private international law into Community law and more importantly into the internal market. How fitting that it should be our committee, with its new competence in this legislature bridging the themes of legal affairs in the internal market, that should have had to deal with this new Brussels regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee has been at pains throughout this process to point out and highlight the importance of the internal market dimension of this proposal which gives us a chance to ensure even more strongly than before that our businesses and citizens can have confidence that contracts and obligations they enter into across the Union will be upheld by a common framework of procedural law on jurisdiction and enforcement. We are making progress towards a system of civil law and justice that will give ease and certainty of access across Member State boundaries, at last beginning to make a reality of the area of freedom and justice proposed at Tampere.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue that has, of course, taken most of the committee’s time and attention has been the fact that this proposal for a regulation has coincided with the growth of e-commerce which in itself offers enormous opportunities to business and consumers within the internal market. The committee has, as the Commission will be well aware, grappled long and hard with the issues raised in Articles 15 and 17 of the proposed regulation. That is to say where there is a dispute between a business and a consumer, whose court should the parties have recourse to. These two articles, in whatever combination, have to be read together.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal in line with previous consumer protection legislation took the view in dealing with Article 15 that all such disputes should go to the consumer’s court whilst willing to defer to a general proposition that contracts concluded at a distance should fall under this category. The committee has been searching for a way of protecting Europe’s growing e-commerce sector and especially small businesses from exposure to 15 different and diverse legal jurisdictions. The committee has therefore opted by a small majority in favour of the option of Article 17a which modifies the general principle in Article 15. This modification allows parties in a B to C contract to contract in favour of the seller’s jurisdiction. This was felt to uphold the freedom of contract of the parties but addition there is another element to which I will now turn.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the committee’s most fundamental contribution to this debate will be the introduction of the reference of such B to C disputes to ADR or EDR. This has been generally agreed to be the best way to neutralise the difficult discussion about whose jurisdiction can apply. There can be no doubt that the Brussels Convention made enormous strides in simplifying the jurisdiction rules applicable to cross-border disputes but they are still a lawyer’s dream and a litigant’s nightmare. They have not created real ease of access to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The opening up of a simple effective system of cross-border disputes is the committee’s goal in introducing the concept of ADR and we welcome the way in which this has already been picked up and worked on by the Commission. There was also agreement in committee that in this evolving area we remain deeply concerned as to the impact of legislation on Europe’s e-business. Therefore, in line with the E-commerce Directive, we have asked for a two-year review.</p>
<p class="contents">I have covered the main aspects. I wish to conclude with a note of thanks to my colleague on the committee, especially to our chairman who I know feels as passionately as I do about this area of law, whatever our differences, but my biggest set of thanks must go to the committee secretariat and to Mr Robert Bray for all his help and advice throughout this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">deputising for the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.</span> – Mr President, firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur of her presentation for what is a very fair and balanced report. On behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I am pleased to be able to deliver this opinion, on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Hazan, who unfortunately cannot be with us tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">My committee considers it important to give a positive response to this Commission proposal, which strives to make the recognition and enforcement of judgments between Member States almost automatic. Not only does this regulation build upon the judicial cooperation between the States it marks an attempt to put the citizen at the heart of the Europe – the citizen, not just big business, money brokers and others, with perhaps profit purely as their motive.</p>
<p class="contents">My committee also considers that the provision of the regulation which seeks to protect the weaker parties in a contract should be approved. This will enable consumers, workers and insurers to be safeguarded by effective European regulations that can be automatically applicable across the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Following this logic, it seems clear to us that there are no legitimate grounds to exempt e-commerce transactions from consumer protection rules. The rapporteur has referred to this, but e-commerce is an area which is set to grow. To differentiate between the rights of those buying on line and those shopping in the high street would go against the valuable work that the European Parliament and the EU in general has already done in championing the rights of the citizens. E-consumers, in common with all weaker parties to a contract and indeed European citizens in general, deserve and should be given the right to a fair hearing.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my committee welcomes the introduction of alternative dispute resolution procedures and hopes that this regulation can enter into force as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rarely have I felt as proud of my position as I am today in relation to this report, due to the work that has been carried out in committee over the last year. The fact that it has taken a year does not mean that Parliament has not been interested. On the contrary, there has been intense and fruitful debate between the members of the Committee, as well as people from the academic world and all the interested parties.</p>
<p class="contents">I warmly congratulate Mrs Wallis on having made this work possible, as rapporteur, and of course I thank the secretariat of the Committee on Legal Affairs for the work they have done and, in particular, as Mrs Wallis has also mentioned, the work of Mr Bray. We have had disagreements, Mr President, but I am sure that whatever the result achieved in this House tomorrow, the work of the Committee on Legal Affairs will have moved this issue forward significantly.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now continue, Mr President, on behalf of the PPE. As you well know, and as the rapporteur has reminded us, the main question being debated deals with judgments by the competent court on contracts concluded with consumers on the Internet. I would like to say once again how proud I am at the balanced and detailed nature of this report. It proposes pragmatic solutions, which are likely to increase consumer protection and at the same time allow businesses, in particular small- and medium-sized ones, which make up the social fabric of Europe, to offer their services and products to consumers resident within the internal market. The internal market must be a genuine domestic market, both for businesses and for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the consumer, it is proposed that the scope of the special system be extended to those who sign contracts at a distance within the internal market with no distinction whatsoever between directed and undirected activities and, as the rapporteur has highlighted, it incorporates the extrajudicial resolution of disputes into the regulation. With regard to the promotion of cross-border electronic commerce, it is proposed to allow businesses, under certain very specific and very restricted circumstances, to insert jurisdiction clauses which the consumer could accept.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am convinced that Parliament’s opinion will have a real impact on the Justice and Home Affairs Council. In fact, as Mrs Wallis has said, Parliament has done what neither the Commission nor the Council has dared to do, which is to hold a realistic debate on the basic question, on the protection of consumers in the 21st century, not the protection of consumers in the 19th century, nor the 20th century, with all the interested parties and taking account of all the interests involved.</p>
<p class="contents">When we examine the history of this issue, we realise that the Commission, in making its proposal, has limited itself to a draft review of the Brussels Convention, carried out by a committee of experts before the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, i.e. when this was an intergovernmental matter, very close to international public law. Furthermore, Mr President, that committee worked alone, with no transparency, with no interministerial consultations and without consulting the interested parties. It is clear that the Justice and Home Affairs Council expected that, given the weak institutional powers of this Parliament in this field, even after Amsterdam, the final adoption of the regulation by the Council would be a mere formality.</p>
<p class="contents">The clear unwillingness of the Justice and Home Affairs Council to open a debate on this question indicates that in recent times Parliament has been subject to every type of pressure. After more than one year of discussion in the Committee on Legal Affairs, I can say simply that the arguments levelled against its report lack foundation and are more the result of intimidation and demagoguery than of basic reasoning. Let us look at this briefly.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people are trying to politicise the debate, hoping that that will create a left-right division, trying to take the consumer hostage, saying that the report would prejudice their protection. This argument is both demagogic and unjustified and is ultimately based an antiquated form of protection, which is ineffective and grounded in a nationalist view that runs counter to European construction.</p>
<p class="contents">The solutions that have been adopted offer much more protection than those proposed by the Commission or – and here I disagree with Mrs Wallis – those presented to Parliament, which in reality limit the protection solely to consumers targeted by an Internet site, by a business.</p>
<p class="contents">Pseudo-legal arguments have also been put forward, such as the supposed incompatibility with the directive on abusive clauses or with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice. Well, there is no incompatibility with that or with anything else and allow me to quote the report, issued by the SANCO Directorate-General on 20 September 1999, which says, and I quote in French because it is the only version that exists: “The jurisdiction clauses are therefore possible and legal, within the meaning of this proposal, provided that certain conditions are guaranteed”. It continues: “It is therefore necessary for the consumer to be clearly informed before signing the contract”.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely for this reason, Mr President, that the Committee on Legal Affairs requires strict conditions of transparency. It is therefore not true that this report goes against an intended Community objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, and perhaps this is the most cynical of the arguments, people say: “Well, this creates difficulties for small- and medium-sized businesses, but they should be insured”. That is like saying: “There should not be firemen in towns or cities. If a house burns down, the owners should be insured”. We must create good legislation, which is balanced for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">To end, I disagree with Mrs Wallis’ solution, despite the fact that we have shared this adventure, because I believe that at the end of the day her solution does not offer more protection to the consumer, since it only protects the consumer which a company has targeted. A lawyer could spend years and years pondering which jurisdiction should apply in the case of active or passive sites or directed or undirected activities.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, it seems to me that in this field of judicial cooperation Parliament must send a clear signal to the Council and the Commission that it will not accept being sidelined or manipulated by dogmatic arguments that represent purely nationalist interests. Instead, by dint of its thorough work, Parliament has here a great opportunity to demonstrate that pragmatic and reasonable solutions can be found to rebalance this proposal whatever the result tomorrow in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McCarthy (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, we all know that the development of the Internet as a shopping channel can bring great benefits: new opportunities for small businesses, for Internet start-ups and opening up the single market to our consumers right across 15 Member States. It can lead to lower prices for them. It can lead to a range of choice and we all support that, but we also know from surveys by national consumer councils, particularly in my Member State, that consumers do not yet have sufficient trust and confidence in the new technology to shop on-line. I am pleased to see that businesses recognise that consumer confidence is critical to the growth of this small-business e-commerce network. They recognise it is a precondition for persuading the consumer to shop on-line and therefore our key objective has to be to encourage that trust and confidence which in turn will benefit business by broadening their customer and consumer market base.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that in committee this debate has declined in some ways to business versus industry. Both business and industry can gain from a common sense approach to this. We can only recognise the full potential of business-to-consumer e-commerce if sufficient trust and confidence is there. The way to persuade those consumers to take the plunge is to ensure that their rights are intact and this has to include, in my group’s view, the right to take action in their own national court.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a view that consumers are only engaging in buying CDs, books, low-value items, but of course we know that e-commerce is taking off in such way that soon they will be buying financial services, they will be buying cars. In my constituency they want to buy cheaper cars from France and the Netherlands. These are serious amounts of money and, as we encourage more consumers to go on-line, we really must give them the right to sue in their own courts so that we do not expect them – particularly poorer consumers – to go to courts abroad. In reality we know that regulating the e-commerce world in the interests of both business and consumers requires a more innovative approach. It needs a fundamental legal framework with innovative, non-legislative solutions and that is why I support Mrs Wallis’ proposals: looking at the potential of ADR systems, looking at trustmarks, supporting small businesses in voluntary codes of good conduct, and finding mutually satisfactory ways to solve disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">Internet service providers have a role to play in this. America Online, for example, runs its own merchant business programme where it guarantees to support the consumer in getting legal redress from any of the businesses that use them as a provider. The reality is that none of these systems, of course, are in place in Europe, nor are they even really developed. Even in the US, where only 8% of websites have trustmarks, there are still considerable problems gaining legal redress. ADRs, therefore, cannot be a replacement for legal remedy. The consumer cannot be bound to lose his right to go to court by contracts, as inserted in the report that is before us from the Legal Affairs Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">More work needs to be done in the area. We need to create trust but, until these new systems are in place, there is no reason why consumers should not enjoy the same rights on-line as they do offline.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot deprive my constituents of their right to sue in their own courts. They are entitled to their own system of justice and we have to continue to support that.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not support jurisdiction clauses because my group also believes that these are in contravention of the unfair contract term legislation, by causing significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations under contract to the detriment of the consumer. This we believe would create more legal uncertainty, more court cases, more money perhaps for lawyers, but that cannot be in the interests of business or consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that in my country the CBI has backed Mrs Wallis’ approach. It is a sensible position in helping us to work with business and consumers that we can ensure that court action is only the last resort and we can find better ways to resolve disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a matter of some regret to me that members of the Legal Affairs Committee seem to have forgotten that it is our committee which bears the responsibility for the legal protection of the consumer. It cannot, therefore, be right that we respond to the challenges of the new world of e-commerce by seeking to limit or constrain those rights. This will send a bad signal to consumers. It will not support e-business development and it will mean that we will not develop the e-commerce business-to-consumer sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal, therefore, for some common sense in this debate. I know that no legislation is perfect. We are all struggling in the e-commerce world to get legislation that is right, to get the right balance between self-regulation and a regulatory framework which gives minimum guarantees. That is why I believe also that this two-year review clause is sensible. It will allow us to look at legislation, how it is impacting on SMEs and now it is impacting on consumers. The idea of setting up a case book and collecting evidence is an excellent idea. We now have to work to find practical and effective ways to resolve disputes. This cannot be at the expense of consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I now speak on behalf of my group, in respect of the amendments tabled by them and other political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The shared aim of all of us is to try to find a balanced way of protecting consumers and shielding SMEs from differing Member State jurisdictions. This problem has been exaggerated totally out of proportion. From the evidence available, such cross border B to C disputes are few and far between and the hope is that most of them will now be weeded out by ADR systems. But, where they go beyond that, it is the consumer who is most disadvantaged. The bigger businesses will be able to afford legal assistance. The astute and sensible SME can insure for a modest premium. That leaves the residue of unsuspecting businesses that may get involved in a transaction outside their Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances it is not unreasonable to build on the previous content of Article 15, use the concept of “directed at”, acknowledge that this is a concept also found in American jurisprudence and utilised by WIPO. It is not simple but it has been used and there is no simple solution here. This, in combination with a modification to Article 17, which allows freedom of contract to choose ADR but respects existing consumer rights in the form of the unfair contract terms directive, presents a much more workable, legally certain package that will promote confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a mark of the balance that we have achieved in these amendments that they have won the support of the CBI in my own country and more than partial support from consumer organisations. They certainly prefer this package to the committee one.</p>
<p class="contents">What I did not refer to when I spoke previously was Parliament’s role in this legislative process. We are consultees. We know from what has been said on this subject by Commissioner Byrne that he will not accept the type of formulation proposed by the committee at Article 17a. I believe that Commissioner Vitorino shares his view.</p>
<p class="contents">From the Council’s perspective, the UK Government expressed a similar view. It seems unlikely that a French Presidency, which is highlighting consumer affairs, will take a different view.</p>
<p class="contents">We could say that, because we are only consultees, we can say what we like. We are merely signalling a political direction but it is important that we should signal a legally certain and workable solution, not one that will create as many problems as it seeks to solve.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament should behave responsibly as a grown-up legislator, not as a petulant child. We have the opportunity to build on the already substantial achievements in the committee’s final report. I hope that we will go further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Commission has made a proposal which would ensure that consumers would have the right to take action in their own national courts and legal disputes arising from cross-border e-commerce transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments from the Legal Affairs Committee before Parliament would take that right and make it subject to unreasonable conditions and I cannot support those amendments. The amendments shift the balance in the report towards traders and away from consumers. Consumers can agree – prior to the conclusion of the contract – that they cannot bring proceedings against the other party in the courts of the Member States where they are domiciled. The main problem with this approach is that it assumes that consumers first read the small print in such contracts and, even if they do, that they fully understand the implications of agreeing to forego the right to sue in their own courts and the differences in relation to costs incurred, legal systems, the choice of language used and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unlikely that the average consumer understands or is aware and we cannot agree to their full legal rights being abrogated in this way. I agree with Mrs Wallis that Commissioner Byrne was right to say that he would not accept this, and I hope that Commissioner Vitorino feels the same way, because this would be a disastrous outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee did, however, agree to take a coherent approach to the law relating to the internet. Under the proposal, key information contained in the court files in the Member States would be copied, using a standard form, to a centralised database for on-line access by interested parties. Such a system will also promote the convergence and coordination of the different national legal systems and enable parties to check on the status of trading partners and suppliers, especially in an age of on-line trading.</p>

I broadly welcome this report and I want to focus in particular on Amendment No 20, Recital 26 (new), which states that the Commission will consider proposals for the establishment of a Centralised Electronic European Union Causebook and Judgment Registry Database.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been justified very clearly in the report. It is pro-citizen and it is pro-consumer and I would strongly urge the Commissioner to consider this proposal favourably, particularly in view of the fact that it is so pro-consumer and pro-citizen. I would strongly urge the Commission to consider it favourably as we now live in a global network with a global economy, global companies.</p>
<p class="contents">But we have yet to establish an infrastructure to enable the Brussels Convention, as amended and extended, to benefit our EU consumer citizens and to attract inward investment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary to establish the causebook which has been inspired by a proposal from an Irish lawyer, Twinkle Egan who has worked diligently on this initiative for some years. At the expense of repeating myself, this will ensure that it is to the citizens’ advantage. This system has the advantage of having already been vetted by many reputable institutions including the International Bar Association. The system has the attraction of being capable, of extension, to synchronising the international legal system of the global world in which we now live and trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The system would enable citizens of the Community and others to have prompt and easy access to authoritative and up-to-date information in relation to the existence and progress of trans-border litigation in which they may have a legitimate interest.

<p class="contents">This evening's debate may appear to be very technical at first sight, but it does actually contain major political elements. One of our tasks is to establish ground rules on the working of the market and regulating the relationship between two of its fundamental players: the service provider and the consumer. It is too simplistic to say that we are protecting the consumer by laying down that the applicable law and competent court are in all cases, without exception, those of consumer's place of residence.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, the market, especially the market of the new economy, is a complex environment where the commercial relations between the actors and the variety of different ways in which it is possible to conduct a transaction are driving out all inflexibility. Any of us, while we are here in Brussels, could buy something from Hong Kong over the Internet and have it delivered to Buenos Aires. To imagine that we can adopt a regulation laying down a fixed rule for establishing the competent court, the applicable law and the place of residence of the consumer does not, in actual fact, seem practical. If the person buying the goods were resident in Italy, it could well be of interest, for it would probably be an improvement on our Stone Age legal system. However, in our opinion, the market requires the rapid settling of potential disputes by the transferral of these disputes to alternative systems of justice where experts are called upon to find solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, new players are emerging in the construction of international market rules. Consider, for example, the influence of the large law firms and global players in international transactions. It is they who introduce new rules and new ways of settling disputes. Written law is increasingly being replaced by unwritten law, which interprets the flexibility of the markets and provides solutions to specific cases. The globalisation of markets is producing a plurality of legal systems created by the same social groups which they are intended to serve. They are an expression of the market's constant need to move forward and expand. There is interaction between regulation and self regulation. The principles of sovereignty and territoriality, on which the nation state is based are, in reality, dying out. What can businesses do, faced with the handicap of rigid regulations, especially the small- and medium-sized businesses? Either they do not operate outside their own country in order to avoid excessive legal expenditure, or they put prices up in order to offset the potential cost of disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, the cost, in the form of reduced availability of goods and services and higher prices, is borne by the consumer, who is at the mercy of our regulations. What is more, we would be holding back the economic development and increase in employment which should, apparently, come with the new economy. This is what is being advocated today by certain sections of Parliament, whose amendments display a purely demagogic approach. We do not support this approach, considering also that, in the directive on electronic commerce adopted a few months ago, we laid down rules governing the signing of on-line contracts and confirmed the validity of the principles of the internal market, rule of origin and on country control.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, my group fully supports the position of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market – which tends precisely towards greater flexibility – and throws down one final challenge: legal solutions for the markets now require global responses, especially in the context of the regulation of the new economy itself. Of course, the European Union does need to produce its own model, but we must be aware that, without an international agreement, it is unlikely to be very effective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I only do so when there is a reason. Today, we do have reason for thanking Diana Wallis for displaying what has most emphatically been the patience of a saint and the stamina of an athlete in drawing up this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise that the majority of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports her and the amendments she has tabled on the Group’s behalf. I also want to point out that the debate has been frustrating to some degree. If the same energy had been put into developing confidence-building systems instead of into lobbying which has not always been very professional, I believe that a lot would already have happened to create the confidence and confidence-building systems which are required if consumers are to have the courage to begin trading.</p>
<p class="contents">One great merit of this piece of work is the importance which the rapporteur and Parliament attach to consumer-friendly dispute-resolution mechanisms and the pressure they have brought to bear in order to obtain these. This is important, and I do not believe that the same weight would have been given to this issue if this work had not been done. As has been repeated a great many times, the biggest dispute, as we all know, has been about which court is to have competence in matters relating to electronic commerce. This is an issue which will set a precedent, and that is why we have seen such vigorous lobbying. It is a question with which we shall be confronted many times in connection, for example, with tax issues and cyber crime. We must resolve the issue of which is to be the competent court. I believe that there is a lot to indicate that, in the future, we must have clearer rules specifically in connection with places of domicile. We cannot proceed as often on the basis of where events have taken place. This also emerged yesterday from our seminar on cyber crime. What is to be taken as the domicile address? That is why it is important that we should establish today that it is the consumer’s domicile address which matters in the end.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to ask those who are going to support the majority of the committee in the vote how they can look consumers in their own countries in the eye when the latter become aware that the view of the majority of the committee will, in practice, lead to their being denied access to their own courts.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like finally to strike a biblical note. I once met an old man who said, ‘I am in no doubt at all that, when I speak to my God, I can speak in my own language. I also hope, however, that the same will apply in the courts I may be called before’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, when we look at the difficulties which have arisen with regard to this report, when we look at the disparate views – the so-called purists on behalf of the consumers or the other so-called purists on behalf of business and e-commerce – we sometimes forget that a lot of small- and medium-sized enterprises are consumers themselves, who will be trading with larger companies or larger suppliers and who deserve the same protection that I, “as an individual” or anybody else, as an individual consumer, would have.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, what is most of all required within the new framework is certainty with regard to the protection available and the responsibilities of the people who are trading on-line.</p>
<p class="contents">I look to other legislation to see what analogies or what benefits can be drawn from it. Under the various insurance directives, for instance, non-national insurance companies are required to have an agent in each Member State to deal with insurance claims that may occur in that Member State. Why not put in place a similar requirement on on-line trading companies?</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, under the consumer credit directive, the provider of the service is required to inform the consumer of certain rights, certain entitlements, certain get-out clauses as well. It is not difficult to transpose that kind of ideology into a direct consumer-service-provider relationship also.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, more than anything else today, we need to put this regulation in place. We do not need to defer it any longer. We do not need to put any more mud into the water. We need to enable Europe, which is lagging behind in e-commerce and Internet business worldwide, to put in place new arrangements with regard to creation of on-line business and the protection of consumer rights and also to ensure that Europe takes its rightful place at the top of the world trading system of Internet and on-line businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is important that we should support the general opinion, agreed by the Legal Affairs Committee and as proposed by Mrs Wallis, concerning those areas over which there has been some conflict, I take note of what Commissioner Byrne said recently in his speech about the other opportunities. No consumer, “as an individual” or as a company, can be denied the ultimate right to take legal action but that does not mean that this should be the first course of action. There should be an agreed dispute-resolution mechanism available at local level, which can reduce the cost of settling consumer disputes because, as has been pointed out by many speakers this evening, there is the question of added costs with regard to resolution of disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would once again like to thank the rapporteur and the Commission representatives for their work and remind all Members that there is another way under the Brussels I Convention and we can put other mechanisms in place. Let us agree on this report and then make changes in other areas as they come before us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Inglewood (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – As Mrs Wallis knows only too well I have not agreed with a number of things that she has said during the time she has been rapporteur for this important report but I would like to put on record my appreciation for the very considerable work and effort she has put into what she has done for this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As spokesman for the British Conservatives and the Legal Affairs Committee, I want to begin by endorsing the remarks made by Mrs Palacio, chairman of that committee. The process of which this debate is a part is, as has been explained already, a component of the so-called Amsterdamisation of the Brussels Convention. It is an unusual process but one in which Parliament has to give the message from its consultation that the Brussels Convention must not merely be transformed into a regulation it has to be brought up-to-date to meet the needs of the contemporary world.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention itself is old: it antedates my own country’s joining the European Economic Community. It goes back to an era before not only the Internet but even before the commercially available personal computer. It is therefore tragic that the Commission and the Council have been so timid in getting to grips with the reality of the modern world for we are in a world which is moving away from that of national jurisdictions into the world of networks. In the world of networks traditional jurisdiction-based disputes-resolution procedures are of no real help to consumers and traders when things go wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that the jurisdictional aspects and arguments must be squeezed out of disputes. ADRs which are a form of bona fide privatised law, agreed upon by the parties and legislators, must be the first and the main means of resolving disputes. They cannot merely be the pre-trial steps before a disappointed consumer takes refuge in his own legal system for, if they become that, myriads of SMEs will boycott the Net for business, thereby reducing their own profitability and their contribution to society and the national exchequers.</p>
<p class="contents">It will seriously reduce Europe’s citizens’ choices, thereby reducing their quality of life and standard of living. I hear my opponents say: there is Lord Inglewood representing the forces of reaction, flying in the face of the Community’s honourable tradition of consumer protection and arguing at variance with the detailed terms of existing European Community consumer protection legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking the latter point first, I argue in the way I do because existing legislation no longer meets the consumers’ needs. After all, a later statute succeeds its predecessors and, if the form of protection the consumer is given needs overhauling, earlier legislators cannot and do not stop the draftsmen and their successor legislators.</p>
<p class="contents">When it is time for change then it is the time for change and that time is now. The world has moved on. We have got to move on with it and nowhere is this more clearly seen than in the debate we have had about the so-called directed website. Such a thing is a contradiction in terms since the Net is a shop window at every terminal link to the network and, to argue in some contrived way, that a site can be directed at some and not others is linguistically facile, commercially nonsensical and technologically illiterate.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an opportunity tomorrow to vote for the 21st century, its consumers, traders and citizens by voting for the committee’s report or we can look at the future and then turn our back on it and find superficial comfort in the last century by voting for the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">We, in my delegation and in this group, shall be voting for the 21st century’s solutions to 21st problems and supporting the committee’s report.</p><p class="contents" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:center">⁂</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report, as it was approved within the committee, is in my view a fine example of a document which has struck a fine balance between the interests of all parties, both small- and medium-sized businesses and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be regrettable if this balance were to be disturbed by tomorrow’s vote, besides which, it is highly unlikely in my view that the Council would be able to agree on the tabled amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to explain why. The terminology, as it is currently before us, is clear. We talk about ‘contracts concluded at a distance’, terminology which, even to a lay person, is far more transparent than ‘directed activities’, as is currently used in the amendment. Let me illustrate this with an example. If a French winegrower recommends his crémant in French, a French consumer may well enjoy protection under the Brussels convention, because the winegrower’s ‘activities’<span class="italic"> </span>are ‘purposely directed in a substantial way’, but the English, Belgian or Italian consumer will not enjoy this protection because the activities were not purposely directed in a substantial way to those consumers. This creates considerable legal uncertainty and will lead to various procedures having to be thrashed out before the courts where each case will need to be examined individually to establish whether the activities were purposely directed or not.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is crucial in my opinion that the report offers parties themselves the opportunity of building a competence clause into their contracts. Contractual freedom is a fundamental principle. If we deny a party contractual freedom and, with it, the constitutional right to go to court, I can foresee various procedures needing to be instituted on account of denial of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the Brussels convention is of major strategic importance for the development of e-commerce within the internal market and it will also have a major impact on the success or failure of small- and medium-sized businesses. I therefore hope that this report, as approved in the committee, will be adopted in its unamended form in the plenary tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Harbour (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, as I have said in this Chamber on previous occasions, I have the privilege of working in a very interesting Legal Affairs Committee and being one of the few non-lawyers on the committee. Diana Wallis as a distinguished international lawyer has been the ideal person to work on this very complex file. I would like to thank her for the way she has done it and the way she has so freely shared her knowledge with us. I have certainly learned a great deal from it.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to pick up on what is a central point for me: we are, as my colleague Lord Inglewood said, trying to reflect a new world in which we want small businesses to take advantage of the most powerful, international marketing tool that they have ever been offered. There are many business that we want to use the network, the Internet, to sell to consumers all over Europe. Many of those small business will have no experience of exporting, they will not have a network of lawyers, they will be uncertain themselves about how they are going to deal with consumer complaints. The way that the committee has finally structured its approach strikes exactly the right balance.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear, that what we have proposed in these alternative jurisdiction clauses is not something for the larger businesses. Large businesses, even medium-sized businesses, will have offices all over Europe, they will have lawyers, they will be able to deal with consumers in that respect. The basis of consumers being able to go to the court of their domicile to receive justice in the event of disputes still remains intact. Listening to some of the speeches you have heard this evening, you would think that option was under threat. We have had Mrs Ahern – I am sorry she is not here – saying it will be a disastrous outcome if the committee’s report is voted through. I fundamentally disagree with that.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have done is offer small companies the alternative of doing something else. They can offer consumers alternative jurisdiction but only under very specific conditions. A double lock is built in there, because they must agree to incorporate an alternative dispute-resolution mechanism before they can use the alternative clause and the terms must also be made very clear to the consumer concerned before he accepts them.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us think about this on-line world, ladies and gentlemen, and those of you who have shopped on-line will know that you are offered the conditions and you must positively accept them. You press the button, you move your mouse, you make a conscious decision. How many of you, when you last had your gas or electricity bill, turned it over to look at the small print – the conditions? How many of you realised that you were accepting them? In the on-line world, we must think differently. We are thinking in the old world here – some of our colleagues are thinking in the old world.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need to do tomorrow is to accept the committee’s report and move forward. That is our role as a grown-up legislator: to think about new ideas, encourage change and not necessarily, as Lord Inglewood said, go along with an accepted wisdom that has been with us for many years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No barriers to the market should be set up, either legislative or technological. A Europe without borders is to the benefit of consumers. If the amendments made by the committee to the report now being discussed were to be rejected tomorrow, the future of <span class="italic">e</span>commerce in Europe would be in jeopardy.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as nice as it would be for the employment situation for our legal profession, it would be an enormous burden for small- and medium-sized enterprises in Europe to take account of the legislation that exists in all EU countries and the signatories to the Locarno Agreement when they are engaged in e-commerce. Presumably this would also mean that any respectable companies that want to be responsible and look after their consumers’ interests, will not become involved in <span class="italic">e</span>commerce at all. As a result, there will be less on offer to the consumer as a whole, as Lord Inglewood earlier mentioned. On the other hand, irresponsible rascals would remain in the market and they would look after the consumer only until the clink of money is heard in the seller’s bank account, and no longer.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, according to a proposal by a consumer organisation, marketing could be directed at just one country or just certain markets, which is not technically possible in the world of the Internet. The electronic world knows no national frontiers. Besides, this would discriminate against consumers, as the consumer must have the right to order products from anywhere to go anywhere. This kind of interpretation would probably also run counter to the principle of the free movement of goods and services as referred to in Article 49 of the Treaty of Rome. A company engaged in <span class="italic">e-</span>commerce cannot normally even know what country the consumer is in. It would therefore be impossible to require a company to find out beforehand about the consumer protection legislation that exists in the customer’s country, as that country could be anywhere. Instead it would be reasonable to create alternative procedures for resolving disputes. The e-commerce players should, however, have the right to choose between normal court procedures or an alternative way to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also ask the Council and the Commission to still take time to reflect whether it would be worth considering this charge-back mechanism, which Mrs de Palacio mentioned again in her amendment to the report. It could increase bureaucracy from the point of view of the consumer. In this the committee’s position is not absolute but it would seem that the majority in this Chamber support it and that tomorrow it will be upheld as Parliament’s position, which is a good thing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I disagree with Mrs Wallis’ suggestion that, because of some criticism from David Byrne of the result reached in the Legal Affairs Committee, we should give way now. I would say it is our democratic duty to stand up for what we believe is the right solution for consumers and for e-commerce in the European Union regardless of whether that gives distress to Mr Byrne or not.</p>
<p class="contents">I would give my wholehearted support to the conclusion reached in the Legal Affairs Committee. It is a common-sense balance between, on the one hand, protecting consumers and, on the other hand, ensuring that those same consumers have access to the low prices and wide choices that are available with the truly competitive market. We have to decide, in a new era where physical location has become almost meaningless, where a dispute is eventually litigated, where a dispute is eventually solved. To allow consumers and businesses the freedom to make that choice themselves is the most pragmatic and the most common-sense solution and this gives the maximum certainty both to business and to consumers. It does not strip consumers of their pre-existing rights. It gives them choices and it reflects their enhanced status in a new Internet world, which gives them more power and more choices than ever before.</p>
<p class="contents">If small businesses are driven out of the market because of the proposals from the Commission or if we adopt Mrs Wallis’ amendments tomorrow then it will be consumers who suffer because it will leave them at the mercy of the large global players and it will deprive them of the low prices that they deserve under the new Internet economy. Even more importantly, it will also threaten the new economy and the e-economy in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are sadly far behind the United States and, if tomorrow we support the amendments proposed by Mrs Wallis, we will stay far behind the United States. With the Commission’s proposals, we certainly have the worst of both worlds. We have uncertainty and legal risk for business without genuine consumer protection, because in many cases the right to sue in your own home court may be illusory if you cannot enforce the judgment without going overseas and incurring the same inconvenience as if you had to go overseas in any event to litigate this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Legal Affairs Committee has come up with a pragmatic solution. It is a common sense balance to a difficult issue and I would appeal to the House to support the resolution as put forward by the Legal Affairs Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The "Amsterdamisation" of the Brussels I Convention is, as you know, one of the priorities of the French Presidency. From the Commission’s point of view, the issue is to adopt a legal instrument which will enable us to define clear and transparent rules which everyone can accept. These rules are necessary if we are to be able to harmoniously apply the principle of mutual recognition of legal judgments, which will, of course, involve a debate on determining the principles and rules that apply to the competence of the Member States’ courts when they rule on trans-border disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">The scope of this regulation is therefore very broad. First of all, it contains a principle which I believe is universally accepted today: that of the jurisdiction of the courts in the Member State in which the defendant is domiciled. To achieve greater flexibility and to adapt more efficiently to the specific needs of the parties in a given dispute, the proposal for a regulation lays down alternative rules for jurisdiction, essentially the jurisdiction of the courts in the Member State of the place where the contract was concluded or of the place where the damage was done in the event that an offence has been committed. The regulation also lays down rules for the protection of the weaker party to consumer contracts, that is to say the consumer, but I shall return to this subject in greater detail later. It also lays down rules for the protection of workers and insurance policyholders, who are deemed to be the weaker parties to such contracts. As long as certain conditions are met, these parties have the right to bring a case before a court in the Member State in which they reside. This is the broad legal framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand – and I feel that it is important to make this clear to the House – that the proposed regulation is a horizontal instrument, which can be applied, in a general way, to both civil and commercial matters. It covers both contractual and non-contractual matters. It is therefore worth bearing in mind that in the field of contracts, we are dealing with legal rules on general contracts between companies, between companies and consumers, and even contracts between private individuals. Various types of special contract, such as employment or insurance contracts, are therefore dealt with separately. Having said this, my concern is to emphasise the fact that although we recognise that the debate has naturally become polarised around one aspect of the regulation’s implementation, namely that concerning the new rules on e-commerce, this regulation covers more than just this one area. There is an enormous and immediate advantage in moving towards adopting a regulation on this matter on the basis of civil judicial cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us move on now to the issue that has aroused the most passion in the debate, which concerns consumer contracts concluded electronically, in other words, the amendments to Articles 15, 16 and 17. First of all, I wish to say, on behalf of the Commission, that our proposal, which defines rules for judicial competence, is not seeking to come down on the side of judicial procedures at the expense of an alternative dispute-resolution system. This is not a dogmatic proposal seeking to enshrine the legal approach and to reject the choice of extrajudicial approaches to dispute resolution. Quite the contrary. The Commission shares the concern that honourable Members have expressed about the fact that perhaps in an increasingly general way, but particularly where e-commerce is concerned, the extra-judicial resolution of disputes is, without a shadow of a doubt, a much better solution in most cases than resorting to judicial procedures. This is not only because in most cases, in this type of contract, the sums involved today are, as we know, relatively small. Also and above all, it is because the speed with which these contracts are concluded by electronic means is in stark contrast to the excessive formality and slowness with which courts tend to act when resolving these disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not, therefore, recognise itself in the portrait that you might wish to paint of us, that is one of a nineteenth century dinosaur, or an even older one, if you prefer. We do not see ourselves in this light because, as you know, anthropologically speaking, dinosaurs no longer existed in the nineteenth century. We are not dinosaurs, fiercely resisting the adoption of alternative methods for resolving disputes and obsessively pursuing the notion that the courts are always the solution to all ills. This is not the Commission’s position. I even think that the extremely intensive work that we have been carrying out, which I will shortly discuss in greater detail, to promote alternative means for resolving disputes at European level is tangible proof that instead of merely making grandiose statements, we are working on the ground to implement mechanisms for alternative forms of dispute resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we are convinced that it is possible to make use of new communication technologies, such as the Internet, the new network concept and flows to facilitate extrajudicial dispute resolution. That is why I would say that the commitment to responding to the challenges that have been set for us here is not so much a question of a making a dogmatic choice of legal solutions. It is rather a question of our ability to give credibility to alternative mechanisms for dispute resolution and to give consumers and business people confidence in these mechanisms. Probably the greatest tribute that we could pay to this debate would be to say in a few years’ time that we wasted a great deal of time on a highly legalistic debate that in practice was shown to have no real importance at all.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the best way of honouring this debate would be to see if we can create a system for dispute resolution that renders the debate on access to the judicial process almost obsolete. Why is it that we cannot avoid discussing the issue of the judicial approach? It is because the Commission does, in fact, share the idea that extrajudicial resolution must become the rule but that, in order to provide an incentive for people to seek recourse to this extrajudicial approach, there must be clear principles for the alternative, that is the judicial route. There must therefore be rules on the jurisdiction of the courts in those cases – which the Commission hopes will be rare – where an alternative form of resolution is not possible or does not produce a satisfactory result.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, with regard to consumer contracts the Commission found the discussion in the Committee on Legal Affairs extremely useful and takes the view that the second part of Amendment No 23 contains a principle which is considerably clearer and more reliable than that contained in our original proposal. The phrase ‘directs such activities to’ is an ambiguous one, which could cause problems by being open to interpretation and could drag us into a never-ending discussion on what are positive, active or passive web sites. We therefore feel that it would be helpful to replace this phrase with “contracts concluded at a distance”. We are prepared to incorporate this phrase into the amended proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">This action would, however, have two consequences for Article 15. First of all, its wording needs to be adapted so that it does not limit the scope of Article 15 to contracts concluded in the consumer’s home, which is an impossible condition to establish for contracts concluded electronically. We are therefore not inclined to retain the first part of Amendment No 23. Secondly, it is important to point out that, because of the amendment I have just mentioned, “presential” contracts are also covered by Article 15. By “presential” contracts, I mean those that are concluded face to face. I am thinking here of situations in which the vendor, even if he or she has been contacted by the consumer, via the Internet for example, has gone to the consumer’s home in order to conclude the contract there. I also have in mind contracts where the consumer has been given an incentive, at the initiative of the other party, the co-contractor, even to leave the state in which he or she is domiciled in order to conclude the contract, as happens, for example, in contractual situations involving holidays organised by the suppliers themselves. If these stipulations are guaranteed, we feel that the phrase “contract concluded at a distance” would be much more appropriate to the situations I have been describing.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we have problems with Amendment No 24, which concerns Article 16. Our view is that this amendment would mean applying the general rule of the jurisdiction of the Member State in which the defendant is domiciled and using the courts to override all of the common provisions of European Union and Member State consumer law as they stand today. As I see it, such an amendment would, in fact, render useless any provision in the field of consumer contracts, notably Article 15 itself. Apart from this, unless I am mistaken, this would leave consumers in a worse situation than that of an operator who is bound by a business-to-business contract, and who would be able to choose between having the case heard in a court in the defendant’s state of domicile and a court in the place where the contract was concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">The same thing applies to the amendment seeking to open up the system laid down in the Brussels Convention on jurisdiction clauses in consumer contracts. I am referring here to Article 17. The Commission feels that Amendment No 26 is unacceptable since the clauses that are proposed would, in our opinion, be systematically used by the supplier, unless, of course, they were based on free and individual negotiation on the part of the consumer. The new Article 17(a) that has been proposed seeks to replace the guarantees provided by the courts by an extrajudicial and binding system of dispute resolution. The issue of the binding nature of these decisions is extremely important. My view is that this proposal would create a compulsory arbitration system for resolving these consumer disputes. As I see it, however, arbitration generally follows more complex procedural rules than those applied by the courts. I feel that the solution put forward in this proposal would present legal problems with regard to the law applicable and to the implementation arbitration awards.</p>
<p class="contents">This concern on the part of the Commission would also apply to Amendment No 39, to which various Members have put their name. We understand the intention of this amendment, which establishes the freedom of the parties to agree upon a ‘get-out’ clause for an extrajudicial mechanism for dispute resolution, and lays down that this mechanism, which may be binding on both parties and which has the Commission's approval, enables the supplier to refuse to enter into the transaction if the consumer does not accept the clause. Presumably, whether <span class="italic">juris tantum</span> or <span class="italic">juris et de jure </span>applies, this would always be in accordance with Directive 93/13/EEC on abusive clauses. I believe that this amendment would raise similar difficulties in law. I shall not go into further detail about the idea contained in this amendment that an abusive clause would never be involved, but the truth is that by relying on the binding nature of the decision of the ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) body on both parties and therefore on the consumer, we would be opting as a general rule to compulsorily replace the courts with extrajudicial dispute resolution mechanisms. Such a solution would, in fact, raise constitutional issues in some Member States, in which it is not possible to prohibit access to the courts, even if only as a last resort, and would open the way for an interpretation of what is a question of law and what is a question of fact in this type of contract which, in my opinion, would vitiate the efficiency and speed of the system.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s view is that this regulation should not depend on the adoption of a package of legislative and non-legislative measures on e-commerce between companies and consumers. We feel sure that actions we have already launched and which are now up and running will enable alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to be put in place shortly and will enable us to provide a rapid response to the challenges of settling disputes arising from e-commerce. I would remind you of the revision of the Commission’s 1998 recommendation on the principles applying to alternative dispute resolution bodies, which in fact form the basis of what is known as the EEJ-Net – the European Extrajudicial Network – which has already been launched. Similarly, under the e-Europe initiative, which was adopted by the Feira European Council, the Commission is currently actively working on formulating proposals for codes of conduct, trust marks and extrajudicial procedures for the extrajudicial resolution of disputes arising from e-commerce. The Commission has also been given the task of preparing a Green Paper solely devoted to alternative methods of dispute resolution, as was decided by the Justice and Home Affairs Council of May of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this is currently being done and is part of our short-term work programme. In another area, that of minor disputes heard by the so-called "small claims" courts, we have already initiated work in line with the Tampere mandate, to simplify and speed up the processing of trans-border disputes involving small or uncontested sums. We are therefore convinced that these initiatives, which are already under way, and on which there will have to be a full debate with civil society, with interested parties, with associations representing industry, business and consumers and, of course, with the European Parliament, will enable us to put in place, in the short term, a legal reference framework which will establish alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. We therefore think that, in order to allow this process some time in which to develop, it would be appropriate if the entry into force of this regulation were postponed for a few months. We propose that this should wait until six months after its publication, not only so as to enable operators to become fully conversant with the regulation, but also so as to enable the work that is currently under way on alternative means for dispute resolution to be concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Commission wishes to state that it is able to accept Amendments Nos 3, 27 and 30 on the introduction of provisions on trusts, with the reservation that some small changes are made to the terminology used. We can also accept Amendment No 22, on group insurance contracts, Amendments Nos 28, 29, 33 and 34, which allow notaries to be included in the authorities that are able to take part in the <span class="italic">exequatur </span>procedure. We also accept Amendments Nos 18 – in part – and 29, but we have difficulty in accepting Article 55, which seeks, for the purposes of compulsory implementation, to give extrajudicial dispute resolution the same status as authentic acts that have been recognised by a body which has public authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, forgive me for being more of a bore than I usually am, but the valid arguments and especially the passion of the criticisms that have been made deserved a frank answer from the Commission. The Commission is humble enough to say that it has learnt from this legislative process and that you can be quite sure that this work will not end here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
