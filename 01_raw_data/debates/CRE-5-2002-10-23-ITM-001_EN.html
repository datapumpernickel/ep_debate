<p class="contents">This meeting will play a central role in further work during the Danish Presidency. As we know, the agenda will be dominated by the important topic of enlargement and also, in this connection, the subject of Kaliningrad, in which the European Parliament has of course taken a great interest. The outcome of the meeting will be of great importance as regards the possibility of realising the common goal of concluding enlargement negotiations with up to 10 countries. Therefore, the important thing is for the European Council to reach as many decisions as possible, so that as little as possible remains to be done in Copenhagen. It is true that what remains could be really tough going.</p>
<p class="contents">At the European Council meeting, the Chairman of the Convention will inform the European Council of the status of the Convention’s work, and the President of the European Parliament will also speak to the European Council. Let me start with the latter. The meeting with the President of Parliament has become an established tradition which I know is valued highly by Heads of State and Government in the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind the agenda before us, it will of course be particularly interesting to hear the views of the President of Parliament on the issues the Council will be discussing, that is, enlargement, and also the related subject of Kaliningrad, which I shall come back to. It is very convenient that the discussion with the President of Parliament is taking place immediately before the working meetings on enlargement and Kaliningrad. In addition to the contribution of the President of Parliament, it is of course our hope that the meeting, including the opportunity to exchange information and ideas for use in further work, will prove beneficial to the President of Parliament and Parliament as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I now wish to say a little about enlargement. It is strongly to be hoped that decisions will be taken in Brussels on a number of very important subjects that could pave the way for enlargement. It must be decided which of the candidate countries will be able to conclude accession negotiations this year. The starting point will be the Commission’s progress reports on the individual candidate countries and the Commission’s strategy paper on enlargement as a whole, which was presented on 9 October by Commissioner Verheugen, who is also present here. On the basis of a comprehensive evaluation of the progress of each individual candidate country, the Commission concludes that 10 countries will be able to meet all the criteria by the start of 2004, and on that basis it is recommended that accession negotiations be concluded as planned here this year. At its meeting in Copenhagen, the European Council will also discuss those candidate countries which are not expected to be able to conclude negotiations this year (Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey), with a view to making decisions on the further course of the accession process for these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Decisions are also to be taken in Brussels on the outstanding issues in the accession negotiations in connection with the financial package. There was agreement on the institutional issues at the General Affairs Council yesterday, and the European Council will amongst other things lay down, as part of the financial package, the total amount to be allocated to enlargement, candidate countries’ participation in the common agricultural policy, including their share of direct income support, and the total aid from the cohesion and structural funds to the candidate countries. The European Council should also take a decision on the matter of the net position of the candidate countries in relation to the EU budget, and agreement has been reached as to the basis for these calculations.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on these subjects to date has shown that it will not be easy to reach agreement. The European Council in Seville concluded that the EU’s positions concerning the outstanding, financially onerous, chapters will be presented to the candidate countries at the beginning of November. That means that the Brussels European Council must take decisions on these matters if the timetable laid down in Seville is to be met. The Danish Presidency will insist on this, and so the meeting must go on until a solution has been found. As I have said, we can expect it to be very difficult. It will require a willingness to compromise on the part of everyone concerned, but a solution must be found.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Kaliningrad will be discussed, and on this point, too, significant progress was made at yesterday’s meeting in Luxembourg, from which both Mr Verheugen and myself have just returned. The matter was discussed in Seville: the Commission was asked to study the possibilities for an effective and flexible solution to the question of transit; a solution which would be in conformity with the <span class="italic">acquis</span> and would have the agreement of the candidate countries concerned. The Commission submitted its communication on 18 September. This has been discussed twice in the Council, and it was also discussed here in Parliament only last week, on 15 October. Together with the Commission, the Presidency has held a series of talks with Russia and consulted Lithuania, in particular, which is the candidate country most affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above the principles on which the Seville mandate was based, the EU has emphasised Lithuania’s sovereign right to control its borders and to reserve the right to refuse entry. Furthermore, it has been laid down that a solution must not hinder or delay Lithuania’s full membership of Schengen. The Council has agreed to give Lithuania a guarantee in that respect, and ultimately the Council agrees that Lithuania must be compensated for any additional expense arising from a solution to the transit question.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia has pressed home its desire to obtain the right to visa-free transit by train through Lithuania. This is a solution which entails many problems of a technical, economic, legal and political nature. The EU has not, however, ruled out examining the possibility, and the Presidency will continue to work towards a solution which satisfies all parties to the greatest possible extent and can win the support of the European Council. The guidelines I mentioned here were followed at yesterday’s General Affairs Council in Luxembourg. Agreement was reached yesterday on making the provision I referred to: that Lithuania must be able to become a member of Schengen at the same time as the other candidate countries if it wishes; and it does. This is the EU’s position, and it seems to me, therefore, that the 15 governments have prepared themselves as well as possible for the discussions which are to take place at the European Council meeting in Brussels, and also for the subsequent talks with Russia which are to be conducted by the Presidency, and which will culminate in the EU–Russia Summit in Copenhagen in November.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the Convention, the European Council, in conformity with the Laeken Declaration, will hear a report at the Brussels meeting from the Chairman of the Convention, Mr Giscard d’Estaing, on the progress which has been made with the Convention’s work. Helping the work of the Convention along is an important ambition of the Presidency’s. The Convention has got off to a good start, and has now moved on to the important analysis stage. The number of proposals is rising, the mounds of paper are growing, and it seems to me that we have been witness to an extremely exciting debate on the future of Europe, both in and around the Convention. It has been a pleasure to see the firm commitment on the part of the members of the Convention, not least those members hailing from Parliament, who had been armed to the teeth, and who have made a particularly deep mark on the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In the shape of the Convention, we see for the first time – and in the full glare of publicity – something as extraordinary as a genuine debate across European borders. This is not something we are accustomed to. As a rule, European politicians aim their contributions to the European debate at the public in their own, rather than other, countries. That is not, however, the case where this debate on the future of Europe is concerned; and this, I believe, bodes well for our ambition to create European cooperation which is more democratic and has grass-roots support.</p>
<p class="contents">As will have been clear from my statement, we have an extensive and ambitious agenda for the Brussels Summit. It is my hope and belief that all the countries will now show the necessary willingness to compromise and help to take the important decisions which I have spoken of here; and I shall not, of course, conceal the fact that the questions that remain are particularly tough nuts to crack, and here I am of course speaking of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to repeat and underline that the European Council is looking forward to hearing what the President of Parliament, Mr Cox, has to say and to exchanging views with him. The importance of Parliament to the enlargement process is undisputed. Speaking almost with one voice, Parliament said very early on, first in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and then in plenary, what was to be done. This has contributed to the momentum, the driving force, which means that the enlargement process cannot, we hope, be halted at the last minute. This is something for which, on behalf of the Presidency, I wish, moreover, to thank Parliament most warmly.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, now that the Irish have voted in favour of the Treaty of Nice, the last political barriers to ratification of the Treaty have been overcome and the way to enlargement is open. I congratulate the Irish people on their decision. It demonstrates their openness and sense of responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">What is true for Ireland is true for us all. It is in all our interests that enlargement should proceed without delay. The forthcoming European Council in Brussels is therefore crucial. The debate will focus on our proposals regarding the ten candidate countries with which we recommend winding up negotiations by the end of the year. The date for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania and the next stage of Turkey's candidacy will also be discussed. The agenda will include the issue of Kaliningrad too. We may have the opportunity to review the international situation, focusing particularly on how best to continue combating terrorism in the light of the recent tragic events in Bali and the Philippines. We will also hear what the President of the European Convention has to report and we will hold our customary exchange of views with the President of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The first item on the Council's agenda will therefore be enlargement. I would like to spell out once again the compelling reasons behind our recommendation to the Member States to conclude the negotiations with the ten countries. We have a historic and moral duty to share with our European neighbours the stability and prosperity we have built up over half a century of integration. Peace, stability, democracy and the rule of law are the essential ingredients for political stability. All this has worked very well for us in the past. It will work for the future Member States too.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement will extend European governance and standards to the entire continent. We expect to see a positive impact in very many areas: more efficient public administrations, more robust judicial systems, greater protection of minorities, more effective crime prevention, especially where cross-border crime is concerned, more stringent controls on illegal migration, enhanced monitoring of products on the market and, in particular, of food safety, and, lastly, stricter environmental standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s greater size will increase its political potential on the world stage. This will bolster our policies in the fields of trade, financial markets, the environment and security. Europe will be in a better position to defend human rights and to help reduce the North-South divide. If we succeed in uniting faithfully and speaking with a single voice, we will be able to make a difference in issues such as climate change and managing the impact of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of that, however, the first wave of ten new Member countries will bring enormous economic benefits for the Union as a<span class="bold"> </span>whole – for both current and future Member States. The increase in the Union’s population will strengthen the single market: the population will be increased by approximately 75 – 77 million, bringing the total number of citizens in the Union to 453 million. By way of comparison, consider that NAFTA – comprising the United States, Mexico and Canada – has a population of around 400 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Some say that, after the ten candidate countries join the European Union, the Union’s GDP will grow by only 4 or 5% while the population will increase by 20%. There is nothing negative in that. These statistics highlight the fact that we alone are achieving a process of democratic globalisation, even if only at regional level. They are by no means negative, for they are evidence of huge potential for growth, considering the trends displayed by these countries. Indeed, we must not forget that the ten candidate countries are already growing at a consistently higher rate than the present 15 Member States. Year on year, this was 2.4% in 2001 compared with 1.5% for the current European Union and a remarkable 4.1% in 2000 compared with our 3.4%. Most importantly, the ten candidate countries will bring highly qualified human resources to the Union. It is true that the enlargement countries will increase the Union’s population by 20% and its income by only 5%, but the percentage of science and engineering students graduating in these countries each year corresponds to 25% of our total. This is a resource which will contribute greatly to the increase in development.</p>
<p class="contents">Interpreting all these factors intelligently, we see that the candidate countries are our new frontier. European industry will have new scope for development and expansion because there will be a great need for new technologies and because the new Member States will provide a market for our goods and services.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, those are the benefits enlargement will bring. It is now time to address the remaining problems. First, however, I would like to make one minor general point: we must take great care not to jeopardise the success of enlargement by wrangling over details, as often happens in political decision-making. The unification of Europe must always take precedence over narrow sectoral and national interests. We need to concentrate on the larger picture and never lose sight of the opportunities I have just described.</p>
<p class="contents">The ten countries have made enormous progress in recent years. The Commission's Regular Reports presented recently make this abundantly clear, and I want to emphasise that these analyses were neither overindulgent nor overoptimistic. The Commission's confidence in the candidate countries is based on facts and thorough analysis. The progress already made is the guarantee that all ten countries will be ready for membership in early 2004, including in those areas where the work undertaken still – of course – needs to be completed.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, despite our total confidence in the candidate countries, the Commission has undertaken to monitor their final preparations and progress even after accession. To this end, we have prepared safeguard clauses for the internal market and justice and home affairs, which are the areas with regard to which our citizens have the most fears and the least confidence. The safeguard clauses will take effect should pledges given not be respected – an extremely unlikely scenario but one which is still possible, and we must make provision for it.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, the key points that will be on the table in the debate between the Heads of State and Government relate to the financing of enlargement. These last remaining issues are nonetheless highly significant. The issue that meets with the broadest agreement is net transfers. There is clear unanimity on two principles: firstly, on accession, the ten candidate countries must not find themselves in the position of net contributors; and secondly, all expenditure commitments must fall within the strict limits set at Berlin. We have adhered to these two principles, and I therefore believe that it will not be difficult to reach agreement on the exact figure at Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Structural Funds, too, there appears to be growing consensus on an annual figure of around EUR 25.5 billion for 2004, 2005 and 2006. Frankly, we can hardly offer our new fellow citizens less. It will mean that the per capita amount received by the cohesion countries – the existing countries – will be EUR 231 in 2006 while the citizens of the new Member States will be entitled to EUR 137 per capita. I do not think we can make the discrepancy any wider than this.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there is the issue of agricultural expenditure, with which we are all familiar. I know that some of the present Member States have reservations regarding the budgetary sustainability of these proposals and that they have asked for further guarantees. It is right to reflect on the Union’s future financial system – indeed, it is our duty. The Commission stands by its position: all our proposals are in line with the financial ceilings laid down at Berlin and are without prejudice to any future decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">On all the financial issues outstanding, I expect the Brussels European Council to give the Danish Presidency and the Commission a mandate to conclude the negotiations with a view to a final decision being taken at Copenhagen. On this I ask for your support.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless – and this is a final addendum – the biggest effort we need to make in this last phase of the enlargement process is in the area of information. The latest Eurobarometer survey, published two days ago, tells us that half the current Union citizens are in favour of enlargement while one third are against. The remainder is neither for nor against. These figures are fairly reassuring in one sense but, in another, they give cause for concern: 65% of those surveyed think that enlargement will bring an increase in drugs trafficking, international organised crime and unemployment, which is exactly the opposite of what, on the basis of analyses, I genuinely believe will happen in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, then, you may ask, should enlargement give rise to those fears? The answer lies in the last Eurobarometer figure: those who feel that they have been properly informed about enlargement make up only 21% of the population, whereas 79% feel that they have not received sufficient information. We clearly, therefore, need to make an effort to provide practical, sound, detailed information. Those who the statistics tell us do not feel well informed are not necessarily against enlargement – they tend to be indifferent. That, for me, however, is perhaps the most disturbing factor.</p>
<p class="contents">We must convince our fellow citizens that enlargement will bring solutions, not problems. That is why the Commission has launched an information campaign targeting both the present Member States and the candidate countries. The success of enlargement will depend on our ability to keep the public properly informed. We must not disappoint millions of Europeans in this respect. Indeed, the future of our Union depends on the enthusiasm, the vigour and the astuteness of our final endeavours to complete the process.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the signal we got from Luxembourg yesterday was a strong and positive one. The Council has accepted the Commission's recommendations that the negotiations with ten countries should be concluded. The Council did this because the Commission had been able to make a convincing case that our recommendations were not based on a political wish list. Our desire was not to take a politically desirable scenario and pronounce it realistic, but to declare what actually is realistic.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's statement that these ten countries will have completed their preparations by the scheduled date of accession is not a rough estimate, but rather a firm prognosis, founded on knowledge, experience and the actual stage that preparations have reached, and one that we will defend fair and square. I think it important to note that the Commission came to this decision unanimously and that all my fellow-Commissioners, who bear responsibility for the extent to which policies work, said unequivocally that there remain within their fields of responsibility no problems that cannot be rectified by the scheduled date of accession.</p>
<p class="contents">If one considers what has to be done in the remaining 12 to 15 or 18 months, as against what has already taken place over the past five years – for it is only then that the complete picture becomes apparent – it is very clear to see that we are not being over-optimistic when we say that the nature of the preparations will be such that we can tell the citizens back home that the enlargement is as well prepared as it possibly could be.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also took on board the Commission's proposals relating to monitoring and safeguard clauses. This is a very important point. This is not about any failure to trust the new members. This is where we need a new instrument, because we find ourselves in a completely new situation. The internal market and the single currency have, in the meantime made rapid progress and are almost fully developed. We are dealing with countries that are undergoing a process of transformation. Never before have we been in a situation in which we wanted to integrate ten countries at once, with a large number of them still in a process of transformation. This can give rise to problems that nobody can foresee. The Commission therefore considers it right and proper to have a very broadly framed safeguard clause, permitting us to intervene wherever unforeseen or unforeseeable problems crop up.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still a difficult stretch of the road ahead of us – that much is absolutely clear. As again became clear yesterday, however, political momentum is strong enough to carry us onwards to Copenhagen and make Copenhagen, too, a success. Not one Member State couples the threat of a veto to the demands and desires that are still present in this process. It is important that we hold fast to the fact that, yesterday, all fifteen again committed themselves to the goal of completing the negotiations. I would therefore like, briefly, to set out two expectations for the Council in Brussels to consider. The very least that we need from the Heads of State and Government is an agreement permitting us, in the time between Brussels and Copenhagen, to get together with the candidate countries and properly sort out those financial and agricultural policy issues that are as yet unresolved. The Commission does not believe it to be possible to reach compromises as late as the Copenhagen stage, as we would then be putting the candidate countries in a position where they would have to ‘do or die’, and we have to take the democratic rights of our future Member States seriously. The enlargement process cannot be forced, but must be the outcome of mutual agreement and founded on mutual trust.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussion of the financial problems connected with enlargement no longer focuses, essentially, on the financial issues of 2004, 2005 and 2006; we are indeed already doing the groundwork for discussion of the next financial perspective for the post-2006 period. Whilst this must be understood, it must also be said that the enlargement process must not be allowed to be taken hostage for positions that should be discussed only in the context of the next Financial Perspective. I also think we can agree that we of course have to carry on down the path on which we set off in 1999 in Berlin, which involves the requirement that the European Budget be consolidated rather than simply allowed to burst. I am glad that France and Germany in particular are currently making special efforts, including bilateral contacts, at coming to an understanding on this fundamental issue. I do not believe that Germany and France have a responsibility in this area markedly different from the responsibility shared by others, but it is certainly true that it was always good for Europe when these two countries took a common line on a great, important, and forward-looking European project. I would be very glad indeed if it proved possible for them to give this common line its final shape by the time the Brussels Council begins.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that everyone must take on their share of responsibility and do their share of the work involved in this. The Commission's work is, in essence, already done, but that does not mean that we can now sit idly twiddling our thumbs – I am not going to be out of a job for a long time yet. What matters now is that everyone should understand that the enlargement project is political in nature. Over the last few weeks, I have been in touch with a number of national parliaments and can say with all due caution that certain problems I have encountered there have something to do with a noticeable information deficit in those places. What President Prodi said on the subject of information is crucial. I draw for my concluding remarks on my experience of the Irish referendum; in Ireland, it became quite apparent that, if we are to be able to advance our European cause and gain public support for it, we have to really fight for this Europe of ours and for our European cause; we really have to be prepared to meet people halfway and tell them, in plain language, why it is right and necessary. It will not work if we think that it will take care of itself or that the media will do it all for us. Political leaders in all the European institutions, in the Member States' governments and parliaments, the economic, political and cultural elites in all our Member States – these must now take upon themselves the responsibility of engaging in dialogue with the public.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we unreservedly support the political objectives set out here both by the Council and by the Commission in the persons of President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen, but we must also point out that the European Union is in a very grave situation. What we have heard indicates that the prospects for the summit now being held in Brussels are not very rosy.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of our group, I would again like to make very clear that we had always envisaged a timetable according to which negotiations would be concluded by the end of 2002, with the treaties then being signed in March or April and the accessions formalised in 2004, so that the candidate countries would be able to take part in the 2004 European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, Commissioner Verheugen has just made reference to Germany and France. I agree on the importance of these two countries coming to an understanding, but, along with our group, I consider it a serious political error now to attach new conditions to the completion of the negotiations out of the desire for a new financial framework for the post-2006 period and perhaps even sooner. Mr Böge, who is an expert on Budget matters, has confirmed to me, and I would like to point out, that Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement states that the adjustment of the Financial Perspective, and hence the allocation of the funds that enlargement will require between 2004 and 2006, can be decided on only on a proposal from the Commission and by a qualified majority in the Council as well as an absolute majority of members and three-fifths of the votes cast in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This, then, is where Parliament also has a part to play. I very much hope that an agreement can now successfully be reached in Brussels, as both Mr Haarder and Mr Verheugen have said. For if no success is forthcoming from Brussels, negotiations will be held up. I have to say, speaking for my group, that we regard delaying the negotiations in such a way as irresponsible if it means that they cannot be concluded by the end of this year. That is why the appearance of these new conditions at this juncture is a grave political error. It would have been possible to discuss them at a much earlier stage. It would be a tragedy if the candidate countries were to end up losing out because insufficient agreement had been reached within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree wholeheartedly with what Commissioner Verheugen said about the candidate countries having done their duty over recent years, but it is the fault of certain of our Member States that we in the European Union have failed to do what had to be done. We would be in breach of the trust placed in us by the candidate countries if we were to fail to come to an agreement in Brussels now. I call upon all the parties involved to unite in Brussels and make the task of the Danish Council Presidency easier, enabling us to conclude the negotiations in time for Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference has been made to public information, and I can emphatically underline what both President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen have had to say on the subject. Commissioner Verheugen, Parliament also needs to hear what is actually being done with the funds that the Commission has allocated to information work, in order to give better information on the use made of these funds to our voters, whom we of course have to take with us along this road.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Haarder also mentioned how Kaliningrad will be a topic of discussion in Brussels. Whatever the necessity of resolving the problems Russia has with transit – and there is no doubt that Russia has a major interest in this – it is important for us that we make sure that Lithuania does not get the impression that we in the European Union are now making decisions over its head. On the contrary, Lithuania must be strengthened in its sense of its own sovereignty, and whatever is eventually decided must, of course, be subject to its agreement. The Schengen criteria must also be adhered to. It is on this basis, and also in relation to security, that we of course counsel flexibility in resolving matters with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue, however, is not only access to the Kaliningrad region, for beyond it, of course, lies Greater Russia. There are other problems with borders. Take, for example, the small amount of cross-border traffic between Poland and the Ukraine or that between Slovakia, Hungary and the Ukraine. I urge this House to bear in mind the need to, on the one hand, guarantee security, and, on the other, to use flexible solutions to make it possible for people on either side of the border to meet each other.</p>
<p class="contents">In Brussels, you will hear a report from Valéry Giscard D’Estaing, the President of the Convention. Our group and also our party – the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – is, as we have now confirmed at our congress, quite clear about the timeframe involved. We want the Convention to produce a result by the end of June 2003, with, after that, a short Intergovernmental Conference, so that, under the Italian Presidency, we may achieve a Treaty of Rome or a constitution of Rome, a basic treaty for the European Union by the end of 2003. This, therefore, is our call to all the parties involved: let us be ambitious, so that we may, adhering to this timeframe, bring into being the historic project, not only of enlargement, but also of a European constitution within the time allotted us.</p>
<p class="contents">This is our collective duty if our European continent is to have a good future.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are approaching the debate on the forthcoming European Council in Brussels with a certain amount of optimism.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office of the Council, the Danish Prime Minister, Mr Rasmusen, when he was kind enough to invite us to the Conference of Presidents in Copenhagen, spoke of the three stages of the Danish Presidency. We knew that the Irish referendum and the elections in various Member States (Sweden, France and Germany) would have to be overcome, and now the second stage is beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to clear up a few grey areas in Brussels and reach agreements in order, as Commissioner Verheugen has said, to be able to prepare for the Copenhagen Summit in time. That is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I shall address the question that I believe to be the most decisive: we must not only be able to talk about negotiations and money, which is always important, but we must also be able to provide a political impetus and vision for this entire process. Before a wedding, the pre-nuptial agreement can be significant. In Hollywood, some film stars sign pre-nuptial agreements over 100 pages long. It is also important to know which house the couple will live in, and that is the job of the Convention. Our main problem in the European Union, rather than in the candidate countries, however, is managing to muster political enthusiasm and historic vision. This is the responsibility of the Commission, the Council, and also our responsibility here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider this to be the most decisive factor, and I would say that this is the weakest point at the moment. We have talked about the budget, which is a summary of our policies. In my personal experience, in the process of the integration of my country – and also of Portugal – into the European Union, budgetary issues were extremely important and defined the current framework, the 1988 Brussels Summit, the MacSharry reform and the Edinburgh Summit. I believe we must start with the fact that it is good to have financial perspectives – I was the rapporteur for Parliament when the first financial perspectives were proposed – but these must not be restrictive. They must be interpreted according to a fundamental political principle: that the budget is adopted annually.</p>
<p class="contents">My group believes that we cannot wait until 2006, because there are important questions that need to be resolved. The first, as President Prodi has said, is that the candidate countries are not net contributors. This aspect is absolutely fundamental, not only in presentation, but also as a display of solidarity. Secondly, we need to talk about 80% of the budget. The Commission has put forward a proposal, which my group considers to be of interest and which we should debate, which does not refer to changing the ceiling of the common agricultural policy, but of making this a possibility in future, and, in particular, of introducing criteria of sustainable development and solidarity, which this policy is lacking. It is therefore our responsibility to address these problems now, without waiting until 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is true of the Structural Funds, which are a sign of economic and social cohesion, not total cohesion, but an important tool for the modernisation of these countries, as they have been for others such as Ireland – the country of origin of the President – Spain – my own country – Portugal, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make the effort to consider how we can achieve better agreements that enable us to protect our interests and, at the same time, extend them to the candidate countries. That is something that cannot be put off until 2006. We need to address it today, and it is important for agreements to be reached between France and Germany at the Brussels Summit, naturally – it is not good for one country to isolate itself from the rest of the Community – but also between all the current partners. This is also an extremely important signal.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, in this case we must also talk to the candidate countries knowing that we are on the threshold of a decision that involves a shared destiny in the future. And we must also make a joint effort in Parliament to be able to adhere to a complex timetable which is an obstacle course we must overcome with a common political will.</p>

Due in no small part to your efforts, Ireland's 'yes' vote has put us back on track for Europe to be reunited in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The decisions that remain will not be easy. As our esteemed former colleague the President-in-Office has said, decisions involving money rarely are. But the Heads of State and Government must not allow themselves to flunk this historic opportunity by fighting over how to pay the bill.</p>
<p class="contents">My group believes that enlargement can be financed under the financial arrangements agreed in Berlin. Some shifting between the different headings should be possible, within the overall limits. The final package must guarantee that new Member States will not be net contributors before 2007. Otherwise we will feed resentment and face the risk of more cliff-hanger referenda in the aspirant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Inevitably, the major area of disagreement is the common agricultural policy. While the Liberal Group does not regards CAP reform as a precondition for enlargement, it is clear that significant reform of our farm policies is essential to the success of enlargement and also for other reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">I hear that President Chirac expects the United Kingdom to bring its budget rebate into play, while he refuses to countenance reform of his farm policies before 2006. We support the Commission's proposals to phase in income support to farmers for the new Member States, but we also expect all existing Member States to commit themselves to far-reaching reform of the CAP, as proposed in the mid-term review.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major area of concern is the readiness of the applicant states to live within the disciplines of the single market and respect the European Union's values. We share the concern expressed in the Commission's progress report about corruption in a number of these countries and the need for progress in implementing EU legislation, particularly in the field of justice and home affairs. That is why it is right that there should be a reinforced monitoring system to ensure that countries fulfil their commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Commission called for enthusiasm and intelligence. Commissioner Verheugen's approach has demonstrated the latter, but a touch more enthusiasm in the Council for enlargement and for the new Europe it heralds would not go amiss.</p>

They have the right to expect that the EU does its share of the work and that no obstacle now arises to prevent the ten countries identified by the Commission being admitted into the European Union as planned. It would be an irony of fate if there were discord in the EU which ended up delaying enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group does not share the opinion that the Treaty of Nice was an absolute condition for enlargement. Enlargement could have gone ahead all the same, based on the old treaty. The Treaty of Nice is, above all, about strengthening supranationality and increasing the power of the large countries within the EU system. In addition, there is a problem with the Treaty of Nice as regards the distribution of power to the new countries. The Czech Republic and Hungary are in actual fact discriminated against in terms of the number of seats in the European Parliament allocated to them. It is our opinion that this should be adjusted in the Treaty of Accession.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said that the negotiations have gone well from the EU’s point of view. The candidate countries have worked hard to take over the<span class="italic"> acquis</span>. The important thing now is that they will not only take it over in theory but also in practice, and then not only as regards the internal market but also as regards the environment and social rights for workers. The question is whether the EU should not also adapt itself to having ten new members. I believe that more should have been done. It is our own inability to reform agricultural policy which has given rise to a situation in which the new Member States are actually going to be treated significantly worse than the previous Member States for quite some time. This is unacceptable. Any discrimination should be kept to a minimum and should be as short-lived as humanly possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In other areas, too, we must be able to revise our own policies so that they are suitable for enlargement. The Schengen Agreement is one such area: its strict border controls are in danger of becoming a serious obstacle to cooperation for new Member States and for countries which are not in the next wave of enlargement of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the Kaliningrad area, we wish to see a solution whereby Russian citizens are able to travel between different parts of their country without needing a visa.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the labour market, it is our opinion that everyone should be treated equally. It is crucial that workers’ rights are respected in all countries from day one, so that a situation does not arise in which we have social dumping or in which workers from the candidate countries are discriminated against on the labour market. Therefore, we regret that the Commission has effectively called this into question by means of a legal case in Finland which questions the contention that Finnish agreements apply in Finland from day one.</p>
<p class="contents">The important thing now is to avoid enlargement giving rise to an ‘A team’ and a ‘B team’ in the European Union. This would also require the ability on our part to make changes to the Union. Naturally, the candidate countries also have a choice. They can vote ‘yes’, or they can vote ‘no’. If they choose to vote ‘no’, the alternative is close cooperation with the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish a bit of this historical spirit and sense of opportunity would make itself felt at the Brussels Summit, to prevent it from degenerating into the horse-traders' fair that we fear it will become. There must be a willingness there to solve problems rather than keep putting them off. The candidate countries' impressive performance will leave the Council with no option but to confirm that ten candidates are ready for membership.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States' lack of solidarity, however, and unwillingness to reform is making living together in an enlarged EU increasingly problematic. It is thus that we discuss – as if it were the most self-evident thing in the world – how the candidate countries will in future finance the British rebate, even though they are barred from being given one themselves. In terms of the history of the EU, that is a one-off; previously, all net contributors got a rebate in their first year. The fifteen EU members benevolently welcomed the proposal by the Commission and the Presidency that they should get one extra year's payment from the Structural Fund. Why is this so? It is because the lack of absorption capacity means that the money ends up back in the Fifteen's treasuries. That is not the solidarity that the EU needs. We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance unambiguously reject such a continuation of bank-driven enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say something about agricultural policy. The disinclination to make reforms in this area stinks to high heaven, and the citizens of the European Union will no longer stand for it. It is not only because of enlargement that reform is needed; it is in itself overdue, and it is absurd to put it off any longer. Unconditional direct aid payments as extensive as these have simply outlived their usefulness and an enlarged EU will mean that they will no longer be workable. We have to make a start on agricultural reform now and work together to develop a fair structure for the twenty-five members that the EU will have in 2007. The maintenance of privileges must not be allowed to become a new condition for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say something about the Irish yes-vote. The Irish said yes to the Treaty of Nice, thereby removing the greatest obstacle to enlargement, but the reform of the European Union's institutions is still pending. The Treaty of Nice has not really moved the EU any further on. It is first necessary to create democracy and improve decision-making, and that is in the Convention's hands. I therefore want to argue that the Convention's draft treaty absolutely must be capable of being adopted in 2003. Functionality is not a prior condition for the enlarged EU, but it will be needed. President Prodi referred to a lack of public approval. And why is that so? The EU quite simply lacks transparency and democracy, and that must change!</p>

Enlargement, being the main subject on the agenda, has been very much at the heart of the referendum campaign on the Nice Treaty in my country.</p>
<p class="contents">The other issue – Kaliningrad – is also directly linked to enlargement. I welcome the measures proposed by the Commission to ease the direct transit of goods and people between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us have benefited from the in-depth and often intense debate on enlargement that has just taken place in my own country. The decision taken by the people of Ireland underlines their strong commitment to European integration and enlargement of the European Union. I welcome the fact that their decision clears the way for the conclusion of the accession negotiations for the first new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I support what Mr Poettering said. There must be no new conditions introduced or strings attached at this stage in the negotiation accessions. That would be a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">The lesson we can all learn from the recent debate during the Irish referendum campaign should not be taken lightly. I endorse very strongly what President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen have said on the need to keep people informed. The Irish electorate are making it clear that they will not be patronised or taken for granted by the political leaders and governments of the Member States, or by Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">It is frightening to hear President Prodi say that almost 80% of respondents in a recent poll had no idea what was going on. Mr Haarder said earlier that there is an exciting debate in progress in the Convention. It may be exciting to insiders, but outside, as he well knows, it is hardly mentioned in the newspapers. Remember that when we hold a referendum on this in the near future, the issues we will be asked to decide on will be of far greater complexity and importance than those related to Nice. And we recently had great difficulty reaching a decision on that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ireland has won an emphatic ‘yes’ to more jobs, to neutrality and enlargement, but there are neither jobs nor neutrality to be had from the Treaty of Nice, and, regardless of whether the Irish had voted ‘yes’ or ‘no’, enlargement would have gone ahead anyway, by taking Declaration 20 and moving applicant countries’ votes in the Council and seats in Parliament into the accession agreements. I will vote for this in the House, but future historians have to know that a people was harmed. Ireland is the most EU-friendly country there is. It voted ‘no’. Instead of giving other people the chance to express their opinion, the Irish were bullied into voting ‘yes’ using the fabricated contention that failure to do so would block enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Up to now I have had nothing but praise for the Danish Council Presidency. Today, however, I am sorry to say that the Danish President of the Council was party to the deception of the Irish voters. Would Mr Rasmussen have stopped enlargement following an Irish ‘no’? He would probably have pulled another proposal out of the hat and secured enlargement without the Treaty of Nice. The best that can be said about the Treaty is that it will only last for a year or two. Then, a new basis from the Convention of the time will be put to the vote. The Treaty of Nice is the worst mess to date. I have published it in consolidated form, but I can by no means recommend the book.</p>
<p class="contents">Nice is ill-suited to secure popular support in the applicant countries. It takes away the countries’ right to choose their own Commissioner, in favour of an EU government appointed by majority voting. Remove the stumbling block now and declare that there will still be a representative of each Member State on the Commission. The Irish voters by no means declared themselves in favour of losing their Commissioner. The subject of the Treaty of Nice was scarcely discussed this time and some skill went into ensuring that the Irish did not come to know about Mr Giscard d’Estaing’s first draft constitution. This was presented at a closed meeting last Thursday. The copies were numbered and were collected in again afterwards. Mr Giscard d’Estaing has a cure for referendums: if a country votes ‘no’ the next time, it will be left behind. Vote ‘yes’ or disappear. Countries permitting their population to vote ‘no’ will no longer be paid any attention. The EU state comes before the voters. In Mr Giscard d’Estaing’s democracy there is a choice between voting ‘yes’ and ‘yes, please’. No, thank you, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a problem, however: neither you nor they are ready.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission itself admits that only two out of the ten countries have an economy capable of contending with competition and administrative and legal structures in place capable of enforcing or respecting Community law. The Commission believes that the others will be ready within 13 months. This is not sufficient in terms of an analysis or timeframe.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither is the European Union ready to welcome these countries, and I am not referring here to the dangerous institutional conjecture by the Convention. I am talking about the total lack of basic consideration. Because of a semi-religious taboo surrounding the sacrosanct Community acquis, no one has asked themselves whether a Europe that has 25 Members should do the same things as a Europe of six, nine, twelve or fifteen. Suddenly, you are prepared to make second-class members of these countries. No one has wondered about the costs, financial or other, in terms of unemployment and economic and social disruption. Consider the costs of German reunification, twelve years down the line: the social and economic divide still exists in spite of the West providing financial assistance to the East estimated to be more than EUR 850 billion over this period.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the summit in Brussels will also look at beginning accession negotiations with Turkey. Turkey is a wonderful country, a bridge between Europe and Asia, but it is not a European country, geographically, linguistically or culturally speaking. Why then, should we now try to make it think it is? Is it because of blackmail by the Turkish Government over the future of Cyprus, or because of the incredible arrogance of the US Administration which was indignant that its Turkish ally did not feature on the Commission’s list of candidate countries? It is not us who have to bear the consequences of the US Government’s Middle East policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Very briefly, this Europe which is handing over the interests of nations to oligarchies that have interests so different to our own …we do not want it for our countries nor do we want it for our counterparts in the East. They are emerging from the nightmare of Communism. We must not relinquish their freedom simply for the benefit of a new empire. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency of the Union recently indicated that, if necessary, it would prolong the summit which is due to take place in Brussels on 24 and 25 October, so that it could complete all the items on a particularly demanding agenda, as President Prodi reiterated earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">On Monday last, Commissioner Verheugen expressed regret that France is not adopting a more flexible attitude regarding the possibility of reducing direct aid to farmers, before deciding on the amount of aid to make available to the farmers of the future new members, and he considered that the sudden increase in agricultural expenditure would make the CAP a logical area where money could be saved. With respect, I would like to say to the Commissioner that I find this view particularly unbalanced.</p>
<p class="contents">President Jacques Chirac yesterday called for a solution to be found that is acceptable to everyone for financing the enlargement of the European Union, and for this to be done at the end of a working meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Rasmussen. The French Government believes all planned expenditure in the EU budget must be examined and a limit on this expenditure must be imposed. By undertaking a thorough review of the financial commitments of all the Member States and by ensuring they are fairly balanced, we will succeed in finding a solution acceptable to all, so that enlargement can be carried out under the best possible circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that France is very willing and will shoulder its part of the effort that is required in finding a fair solution as soon as possible. This could not be achieved, however, by sacrificing a sector of our population, in this case, farmers and the rural community. The financial contribution that is justifiably anticipated must be divided equally between all the Member States of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Less than 50 years later, the European Union has become the third greatest power in the world in terms of population, rivals the United States in terms of GDP and is the greatest trading power in the world. The European Union is the only example in history of a power that has grown through the voluntary accession of its neighbours. This extraordinary example set by Europe must be maintained when the Community is enlarged to encompass a further ten countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not enough, however, to grow in body; one must grow in mind as well – this European mind that the German philosopher Karl Jaspers characterised as ‘the meaning of History, Science and Freedom’. Let us add solidarity to this list. We must develop the European spirit and prevent this spirit from being discredited at the forthcoming Brussels Summit by ridiculous displays of haggling and national self-interest, by arguments about who should pay more and who should pay less. This does not mean that the financial offer to be made to the candidate countries should not be substantial and significant. Nor does this mean that the future funding of the Union should be of a redistributive nature. A Union in which so many inequalities remain must concern itself with this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not, however, confuse the matter. President Chirac is mistaken. The CAP is an unfair, imbalanced and damaging policy from the ecological point of view. It cannot be compared with cohesion policy, which really is a fair policy and a policy that strengthens Europe’s internal unity. Comparing the two policies is a serious mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, we must consider the case of Turkey: the most basic sense of loyalty obliges the European Union to set a timetable for negotiations with Turkey. Linguistic, cultural and religious arguments cannot be used to keep Turkey out of the European Community, when this country has been hoping for so many years to achieve this and has made considerable efforts to do so. This is a question of the EU’s loyalty and honesty towards its partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The transit permit, or Kaliningrad passport, as proposed by the Commission, is in my opinion a good solution for both sides. It would make it easier for the Kaliningrad Russians to travel to their mother country than is the case with normal visas, but it would also safeguard Lithuania’s sovereignty. The option of establishing a train corridor has been put forward. This idea, however, does not tie in with current reality. The point is, how many of the present Member States would agree to have a train tearing along through their own country, coming from another country that does not belong to the European Union and whose passengers could not be checked? Would Belgium, Spain, Italy or France agree to this?</p>
<p class="contents">It is good that the Council since yesterday has had a common position on transit arrangements for the people of Kaliningrad. In examining the way opinion has been formed I have noticed that the further away from Kaliningrad a current Member State is, the more unrealistic the points it has put forward to solve the problem. This is, frankly speaking, go-it-alone irresponsibility. Russia’s suggestion for visa-free travel between herself and the EU has also, unfortunately, gained the support of some Member States. It is regrettable to find that people are unable to view the drawbacks or dangers which that would bring realistically. If we want to start relaxing visa policy radically should we not start with Turkey, which at least has candidate country status? Visa-free travel is not, however, today’s issue. For that reason, it is rash for just one individual EU country, for example, to promise such a thing, and I seriously fear that merely discussing the issue would harm the favourable attitude the citizens of countries applying to join the Union have towards the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I nevertheless give my wholehearted support to policy with regard to Russia that backs that country’s long-term development and makes it possible for visa-free travel to be introduced one day. Incidentally, I would like to suggest that it might be worth asking the Russians why, as they have renounced Lenin in Leningrad and Stalin in Stalingrad, they still sully a major area of European culture with the name of Mikhail Kalinin. Immanuel Kant’s Königsberg should once again have the honour.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to raise the matter of the Eurobarometer. The Commission is quite right to say we must share this information, but 70% of our citizens expect to hear the truth and information from their national governments. Why do they do nothing? This is hardly a speech by the opposition, as I am a member of the party in government in Finland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that both President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen concluded their inspired interventions by speaking of information based on the latest Eurobarometer surveys. Only one in five Europeans feels ‘well’ or ‘very well’ informed. This does not make pleasant reading. Nor does it come as much of a surprise, because we have been aware of the problem for many years. I have said it before in this House, and I will gladly say it again: EU information and communications policy is in need of improvement. We must be prepared – as Mr Poettering mentioned – to find the necessary means. Information forms the basis of understanding and thus of the popular grass-roots support that the EU needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The enlargement negotiations have now passed the point of no return and there must be no new demands made. Admittedly, there is need for a radical reform of agricultural policy, but let us first put all the arrangements in place. I am pleased with the results from the meeting of the Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg over the last couple of days, and it is particularly good news that agreement has been reached on the fact that none of the new applicant countries can under any circumstances start their membership of the EU as net contributors. Anything else would have been unreasonable. I am confident that the Council, headed by the Danish Presidency, will be able to accomplish this great historic task in Copenhagen in December. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This step needs to be taken in a decisive and realistic manner which overcomes any petty perceptions and subsequent moves need to be determined by this step, not the other way round. I have just two or three comments to make as time is so short.</p>
<p class="contents">First, Kaliningrad. Obviously, this problem needs to be resolved, not with a Gordian knot but with a clean sweep, by which I mean a harmonious, rational, functional solution that respects nations and states.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the widely discussed issue of the budget. We must not be mean and tight-fisted and we must not forget that the countries about to join the European Union have manpower in abundance but, unfortunately, limited resources. However, abundant manpower is what determines development and development is what we need to see.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in connection with other issues which may have prospects or require decisions, the European Union of the 15 or of the 25, or of however many other members there may be, must remain an area of social cohesion, development and democracy. Clearly, therefore, any solutions to budgetary questions need to be resolved on the basis of these priorities. In other words, they must be predicated on the need for the European Union to maintain the values which it has already acquired and which must continue to apply, they must be predicated on peoples' priorities and not on petty political perceptions which, in the final analysis, are short-lived and are sometimes to do with antagonism of one sort or another, which gets us nowhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said which, I am positive that two new steps forward will be taken over the next two days and, as we continue on this course, we at the heart of the European Union, the European Parliament, must generate the political spirit and climate which, unfortunately, tend to be lacking, reducing the debate from a debate on overcoming problems to a mean, tight-fisted debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This enlargement will heal a rift between Western, Central and Eastern Europe. This rift came about before the Second World War and was reinforced by an iron curtain and a wall after the Second World War. The healing of this rift is a jewel in the crown of the present European Union and also of the acceding countries. They have been adapting their democratic systems, their economies and their legislation since 1989, which has required major efforts. I therefore lend my wholehearted support to the ten accessions proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">A crucial debate on the topic of enlargement is taking place in the Dutch Lower House today. The Dutch Government is in support of enlargement despite the opposition of two coalition partners, namely the Liberals and the Fortuyn group. I regret this deeply, but there will still be a democratic majority in the Lower House today prior to the accessions, which means that the Netherlands will not necessarily put a spanner in the works. We may have our Social-Democratic friends to thank for this. If a number of conditions have not yet been met, however, the acceding countries will be required to make a final effort and, if necessary, introduce safeguards in areas such as food safety, the internal market and justice and home affairs. Incidentally, I am pleased that Mr Prodi has stated that these safeguards will actually be put in place should this prove really necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">It would also be much better if a financial agreement were to be reached, so that there would be more clarity about the financial costs involved in the enlargement, as this is an area which our citizens are particularly concerned about. It would also be preferable if better agricultural agreements were concluded. These should not be a pre-condition, but I agree with those fellow MEPs who claim that they are required as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">I now have a question for Mr Haarder. Would it perhaps be possible for you to have a frank discussion with our Liberal colleagues in the Netherlands, who are your fellow party members, to ensure that this issue does not complicate matters at this time and that it is not misused in the Dutch elections? The Netherlands has always been a pro-European country. The political parties that are trying to turn the Dutch into eurosceptics are taking on a major responsibility. The enlargement receives the support of both the Christian-Democrats here and the Christian-Democrats in the Netherlands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This removed a serious obstacle to enlargement. Enlargement is a historic occurrence for which, in my opinion, both the Commission and the Danish Presidency have prepared the ground most competently. The applicant countries have made a tremendous effort to prepare themselves for accession to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I sense that the remaining problems are clear. Now, therefore, it is up to the Heads of Government of the 15 countries to show leadership and responsibility in order that the Presidency can in the coming week obtain the required common mandate to conclude the negotiations with the ten applicant countries on the basis of the Commission’s January proposal. No new conditions for enlargement should be imposed. Agricultural and funding reform should not be tied up directly with enlargement. On the other hand, of course, as we well know, the present and future members of the EU should be able to agree at the Copenhagen Summit in December on at least some of the principles for future agricultural and funding reform, which, as we know, will be necessary from 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that the outcome of negotiations we are aiming at is fair on the applicant countries, and that we bring about a fair competitive situation, possibly with slightly shorter transitional arrangements in the field of agricultural subsidies, so that referendums in the new Member States can obtain a ‘yes’ vote.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Kaliningrad issue, I also hope that a good enough solution can be found, so that the little enclave does not become a conflict region, but instead a positive player in the Baltic region; a solution which of course fully respects both Lithuania’s sovereignty and its desire to become a member of Schengen. A ‘corridor’ solution, which brings back memories of earlier solutions to similar problems in Europe, must be avoided at all costs. We should be able to solve the transit question in a different way, possibly by means of a special passport system. But I extend my thanks to the Danish Presidency for its competent leadership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are still a few countries in which they need to have their voices heard, which will cause the necessary problems, as there are still questions on this score. The politicians, however, must now roll up their sleeves as a matter of urgency, not as carpet dealers, as Mrs Schröder mentioned, but with the necessary vision and courage.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask a specific question with regard to the information which President Prodi mentioned. In my many dealings with the public, I have noticed that the same questions arise time and again among the people in Flanders and Belgium. I think that they are entitled to an answer. There is the answer about the vision, and you can win people over with this. However, there are other questions that keep being asked in my country. Will horizontal enlargement not obstruct vertical enlargement? In other words, will this enlargement not spell the definitive end of our growth towards a community? Will this be intergovernmentalism's final victory? This question has been raised in Belgium and has, for example, prompted the Socialist Party – which is, after all, the key government partner at present – to question the meaning of this enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask a second question which people keep asking me – at least people in our regions. They naturally visit the countries that will be our future partners, and in that sense, Europe is already growing in the hearts and minds of the people, but they notice that those countries are experiencing major problems, abject poverty and problems involving minorities. We are also experiencing a time of economic decline and a time when the spectre of unemployment is once again looming large in the EU countries themselves. Then people want an answer to the question whether we will be able to fight the unemployment that is now threatening us. I am convinced that future enlargement will make this possible. I do believe, however, that we should not merely present people with a vision and good news; we should also produce specific answers to the questions that are being raised on a daily basis, questions concerning the costs and also, of course, questions that I have raised myself and that will need to be resolved in the Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think, though, that we ought to make clear that, whatever else we might rightly or wrongly desire, no new conditions for the enlargement of the European Union must be allowed to be imposed. That has to be made clear and – as you, Commissioner Verheugen, know better than any of us – those things that were neglected when negotiating Agenda 2000 cannot now be put right again a quarter of a year before Copenhagen. We will have to do that at a later date. Now that Saturday's events make it possible for us to get back to discussing Nice's critical aspects, it is right and proper that we make it clear that, in structural policy for example, the Convention must accept majority decisions, thus giving us better decision-making structures for the reforms in 2006, and enabling us to implement the necessary reforms at the right point in time. The actual content of that can of course be prepared by the Commission and in the debates, but here too, we have to do the necessary homework if we are to make progress in 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly address the Kaliningrad question, which, I believe, encompasses some of the political issues that remain to be dealt with. We have to take account both of Lithuania's sovereignty and Russian sensitivities and make clear that big countries cannot ride roughshod over small ones when they engage in negotiations. Part of our picture of Europe is, after all, that small countries have a value of their own. It is evident that any solution here has to be practicable and makes allowances for everyone's sensitivities, and I believe that what the Commission has presented and yesterday's decision by the Council of Ministers provide a basis for negotiations, one on which we can proceed. I take the view that, in today's battle order, the Commission and the Council are indeed doing their best to achieve a result in October.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me a final comment. Information work and information campaigns will be of great importance, both in the Member States and in the candidate countries. I hope they will be better organised in the latter than they currently are in the former; in my own country, they involve little more than putting the Federal States' ministers for Europe on display, and have little relevance to the actual work of informing people. Perhaps, Commissioner Verheugen, we could at some time discuss how we can change this.</p>

<p class="contents">The ten countries have made considerable progress since last year and will be ready in 2004. I believe that the justifications contained in the report will also be included in the report currently being drawn up by Chairman Brok, and that they will not be very different from what has already been said.</p>
<p class="contents">I represent a fairly straightforward case – Slovenia – which would actually appear to be pretty representative of other small countries in the sense that, without the hard schooling from Europe, these countries would have been psychologically much, much further away from Europe than they are today.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic, administrative and political problems and the desire to respect the Copenhagen criteria have placed Slovenia and other countries among those which have recently tackled the various chapters on reconstruction of the administrations and the economy most vigorously. Of course, they need to continue to concentrate on restructuring the economy and they need to improve their insolvency legislation, but, at the same time, I would point out that a large number of experts have been drafted in and that some banks which were completely state-owned have become 76% private in the space of a year. This would appear to be a great achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">By agreement with the European negotiators, the country has opted to remain a single region, not least to avoid feeling, after Vienna and Belgrade, that it is under the yoke of yet another foreign power. There is a possibility that this may change in 2006, depending on national feeling.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important thing, however, is to keep the citizens informed, something which has been the subject of much discussion today and which is poorly organised. I feel that more needs to be done in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does not surprise me at all, but of course there are, and were, Members who doubted the Danish will and ability to carry out enlargement of the EU. This really has now come to nought. To listen to Mr Bonde, one wonders if he is not dreaming that he is back in the ‘good old days’ of the GDR.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Monday I was in Bratislava, in Slovakia. There, it emerged that people felt very unfairly identified as an unreliable candidate country in connection with what had been said during the Dutch Government crisis. Other countries have also been named. I would like to say to Mrs Maij-Weggen that there are actually many Dutch liberals who share your opinion, as Mr Cox also quite rightly said. The last word has not been said on this subject. In order to reassure people in Bratislava, Warsaw, Riga and Vilnius, I wish to say that the President of the Council and the Commissioners confirm that there is no cause for concern. There is no information in the country reports to demonstrate that, in general, any countries are in a worse position than others. As Commissioner Verheugen emphasises, there is nothing today to show that there are any problems in any of the ten countries which cannot be solved. It is true that there are difficulties, but they are not insurmountable.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is extremely important that the Council and the Commission are clear on this subject. The historical and moral reunification of Europe is irrevocable.

We owe it to the presidency, the European Union as it stands now, as well as the candidate countries to be able to take some serious decisions. Crucial decisions will need to be taken within a few months, and in my view it is especially regrettable that we are still finding out that 79% of the people in Europe are claiming to be badly informed.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not only regrettable, but also very dangerous, because a huge number of people in Europe – indeed in all the Member States – feel uncertain and unsafe. This uncertainty and lack of information about enlargement only serves to intensify these negative feelings. I think it is high time we explained to people that enlargement could be a springboard for a safer Europe, a Europe that gives them greater security, and it is also high time we reassured them that Europe need not become less social, less prosperous or even less democratic as a result. It is high time we told them that – and started working on that.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, just as our group chairman asked the President of the Commission, I should like the Commission to tell me exactly what its information plan looks like, and I should also like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether it might not be a good idea to discuss this with the government leaders at this important European Council after all? Large-scale European information campaigns with sizeable advertisements in major newspapers may help to some extent, but the euro campaign has taught us that we should make use of decentralised information methods.</p>
<p class="contents">We must involve the governments and civil society in the Member States. If we do not, people will never be sufficiently informed. Are there such plans in the pipeline? Are there plans afoot to quickly set up a campaign in this way? Mr President-in-Office of the Council, taking into consideration the fact that quite a number of governments in Europe have left a great deal to be desired in this area, will you be quizzing your fellow government leaders about this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Economic cooperation ended up being a formula for the European Union's success, and this formula is to be applied more widely to give us stability in the sense of peace – not only external, but also internal and social peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Great economic insecurity lies in store for the candidate countries, and we have to get them to understand that we know what difficulties they will face. For example, we have been able to learn from the Economic and Monetary Committee's delegations what advances have been made, and which have proved difficult, in such areas as, for example, competition policy or the control of aid payments. This has also had an effect on jobs in the candidate countries and cannot be organised without it running the risk of rejection.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, then, well aware of the credit that is due to the candidate countries for their efforts, but it is also evident that they, when they join, must not only be capable of functioning as market economies; they must also be able to stand the pace of competition. There is still room for improvement in this respect. I want to give just two examples of this – steelworking and shipbuilding – and propose to mention energy only in passing, even though it is equally important. That is why the Commission was right to insert safeguard clauses. I think the candidate countries will also be able to handle these, and we must see to it that these safeguard clauses are inserted in such a way that they do not affect this or that country in an arbitrary way.</p>

The criteria for the accession of new Member States were drawn up at the Copenhagen Summit in 1993, and the process is to be concluded at the Copenhagen Summit in December. It is irrational that this should be a matter of pride for the little nation, but it boosts our self-confidence, and that is of course always good.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is, of course, simply that so many issues are still unresolved. The Belgian negotiator of the Maastricht Treaty, an economist by profession, has stated that there is a long series of funding problems which have not been solved. Everyone wants enlargement, he says, but no one wants to pay for it. Why, for example, should the British keep their rebate while the much poorer candidate countries pay full price?</p>
<p class="contents">This is one problem. Another problem, which has been completely overlooked, and which is under the extremely roomy carpet under which problems are swept, is the question of the reliability of the progress reports. I cannot find a single instance in these analyses of a sober attitude to the decisive question of the last and crucial Copenhagen criterion, according to which the candidate countries not only have to comply with the <span class="italic">acquis</span> <span class="italic">communautaire</span> but must also have the administrative, legal and political structure which is a prerequisite for its effective implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">A Swedish report last week pointed out that these problems are extremely serious. Simple mathematics demonstrate that the legal and administrative personnel simply do not have the training. The whole basis for actually implementing the <span class="italic">acquis</span> <span class="italic">communautaire</span> is absent. These problems have not been dealt with, and the question to my Danish friend and former colleague, the Danish Minister for European Affairs, is: what do you intend to do about this badly neglected problem? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, when the whole of the EU institutional machinery is focused on the enlargement process, do not forget that there are other European countries with very legitimate cultural and historical links to Europe. They feel aggrieved that their ambitions for EU membership in the long term are being ignored and decreed unrealistic, particularly by the Commission. I have in mind particularly Ukraine, which is locked in a political struggle between westernisers and those who wish to see it join a reinvented economic union with Russia and the eastern republics.</p>
<p class="contents">As soon as this round of enlargement is over, we must reconsider our policies to other countries in Europe. I am thinking here of the Balkan states in particular and neighbouring countries such as Ukraine which need anchoring in peace, prosperity and western security. Since the break-up of the former Soviet Union ten years ago, they have moved some way towards democracy, human rights and good government, although a great deal remains to be done. If Turkey has been granted candidate status, surely a country like Ukraine has just as much, if not more, of a claim to be a candidate for the European family of nations in an enlarged, wider and looser European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is of course a large number of problems associated with enlargement. The opportunities outweigh the problems, however, although obviously we do need to solve the problems. They should not be allowed to overshadow the opportunities. It is a question of our children and children’s children. It is a question of creating a Europe of peace and democracy for our children and children’s children. It is a question of a better environment. Sweden shares a border with many of these countries: we have the Baltic in common, for example. If we wish to tackle the problems of the Baltic region for the future, we can simply do it together.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a question of workers' rights in countries bordering on ours, so that these countries cannot practise social dumping, and so that they have fairer conditions and stronger trade unions. All of this is our responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The President said that we need to have information campaigns. Of course we do, but this is first and foremost a political responsibility. Now is the time for us, the politicians, to get out of the conference room and hold a dialogue with the people in our Member States, with a view to convincing them of the importance of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see a change in agricultural policy. We need a change in structural policy, but this must not be made a condition for enlargement. It is not the candidate countries’ responsibility, but our responsibility – the responsibility of all of us – to make a change in agricultural and structural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">A brief word about Kaliningrad. I hope that a solution can be found, particularly so that the people are able to move freely over the borders. We should not forget another aspect, which is that there is a risk of the gulf between Kaliningrad and Lithuania widening when Lithuania undergoes improved development as a Member State. This could potentially lead to tensions in the border regions. It is important, therefore, to make efforts in the social and economic fields for the people in the Kaliningrad area, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not possible to make everything dependent on everything else, nor is it possible to force through an agricultural reform with enlargement in the offing. Time must be found for that later on. It is not possible to be willing to pay more for enlargement and, at one and the same time, to compel others to pay less. I think it must be clear that the costs of enlargement, within the bounds of reasonable perspectives, should rather be planned to be below the level of Agenda 2000 as set out in Berlin. We should be looking seriously at proper finance for agriculture, making it possible for there to be stable conditions for farmers by 2006, but we should also be clear in our own minds that not everything has a final solution. There will be no pre-enlargement agricultural reform without postponing enlargement for ever and a day, and nor can we prejudice future, post-2006, Budget frameworks.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with this in mind that I can say that we in the Austrian People's Party, and I as a representative of it, take the line of 100% support for enlargement. I know that your team in Brussels is empowered to act properly in the interests of the European Community and of Austria. We hope, of course, that there will be sensitivity for our concerns about transit and support for border regions, but we are all aware that enlargement is a great chance – a chance that must be made use of. This must be guaranteed in a policy and a procedure that means that the candidates for accession are not forced into a ‘do or die’ situation, about which we have heard so much. So I ask you this: how do you intend to go about finding a method whereby, on the one hand, the Brussels Conference is prevented from degenerating into a secretive conclave and, on the other, there is enough space left for negotiations with the candidates for enlargement?</p>

It is important for both the Greens and the Social-Democrats, who are in opposition in the Netherlands, to help the Netherlands move in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased that the European Union is still on schedule concerning enlargement. Given the years of preparation and the importance of enlargement, we hope that we can complete the process with all ten candidate countries within the next eighteen months. The frank Commission reports, for which my congratulations, confirm that a few things still need to be resolved. The European Parliament has also pointed out the weaknesses on several occasions. Most candidate countries are still lacking in areas such as implementation capacity and the fight against corruption. The further agreements concluded between the Commission and the acceding countries will therefore need to play an important role in the European Parliament's final assessment. It is too early to rest on our laurels, but at the same time, the European Union must remain reasonable. We cannot ask more from the candidates than what we can accomplish ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">All this also applies to Slovakia. Until 1998, Slovakia lagged behind the other countries, but has since then largely made up the difference – in fact to such an extent that it now has every right, in my view, to feature on the Commission's list. The rate at which reforms have taken place over the past few years gives me hope that the remaining problems can be resolved quickly. ‘Keep at it!’ is the message we should like to pass on to the new Slovakian Government. Fortunately, it was set up promptly after the elections in September and, like the previous government, will be able to work well with the European Union. I should like to urge this House, but also mainly the Council, to put the Meciar era behind us. It is over, and it is unfair to keep reminding Slovakia of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Bulgarian pensioners fought in the Second World War, they lived under the yoke of communism for very many years, and now that they are old, living on miserly pensions, they hope that their quality of life will improve when they too become part of the European Union in a short while.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore wonder, and I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission, whether, seeing as the Stability and Growth Pact too has to be interpreted intelligently and flexibly, is there any hope that the decision of the Community organs to defer Bulgaria’s accession to the European Union until 2007 might be reviewed? And, above all, is there a possibility that the decision to close units of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant within the set time frame might be reviewed, allowing Bulgaria to keep them in operation for a little longer in view of the enormous harm their closure will do to the Bulgarian economy? Lastly, would it be possible to reflect on the need to proceed swiftly with and put more funding into the development of corridor 8, linking Puglia to Albania, Macedonia and Bulgaria and terminating in Varna and Burgas? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can inform my fellow MEPs that as a member of the Convention on the future of Europe, I have the privilege of already working very closely with our colleagues from the candidate countries and that their commitment and enthusiasm for the European project are a pleasure to behold. What Mr Gollnisch said, namely that nobody in this Convention has given any thought to what a Union with 25 Member States would need to do, and whether this would be different from 6 or 15 Member States, is incorrect.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, however, concerned about another matter. If we want to make a success of this Union of 25, I do believe that the Convention members should aim a little higher in terms of a strong and democratic Europe with proactive institutions. It is also very important, in my view – and I am addressing a point made by Mrs Thyssen here – that our enthusiasm for this enlargement and this political European project does not remain confined to European political élites. The people must also be involved. I was therefore particularly pleased with Mr Prodi's call for information campaigns intended for the public at large. We at our end all do our utmost to explain to the citizens what enlargement is about, but we cannot do this alone. There are, however, sufficient arguments to suggest that enlargement will offer answers to people's questions rather than raise new problems. I would therefore like to join those fellow MEPs who ask how the Commission, the Member States and the Heads of Government can help us in our duty to inform.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of monitoring and safeguard clauses are of particular importance as a way of reassuring the public because it demonstrates, Commissioner Verheugen, that we take enlargement seriously. You spoke about monitoring in the context of police, justice and the internal market. I would like a guarantee from you that this monitoring procedure and the safeguard clauses also apply to social policy and environmental policy, as these are, after all, very closely connected to the internal market. It is particularly in these areas that you could offer reassurance to the public, in my view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And, despite all that, the shameless celebrations continue.</p>
<p class="contents">The hastily convened summit in Brussels is being called on to contain the differences between the powers that be in the European Union and quell the disappointment of the citizens of the candidate countries, who can now see through the promises made to them by the propagandists of enlargement. The intense and exorbitantly expensive advertising campaign to sell integration cannot mask the harsh reality, which is that, even in the run-up to enlargement, these countries have given the shirt off their back to the mandarins of the European Union. It is now becoming clear that not only will certain candidate countries have no net income; they will be funding the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">As agricultural spending is cut and subsidies are abolished in order to release funds for imperialist policies, direct farm subsidies will start to fall at something in the order of 25% to 35% per annum, with unpredictably disastrous consequences for farmers in both the Member States of the European Union and the candidate countries. And from what we have heard today from the members of the Council and the Commission, the people of Europe have nothing to gain from enlargement. The trade deficit of the candidate countries is several times larger than the funds being allocated to them from the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Cyprus is another issue altogether. The Cypriot Government is being coerced in the run-up to integration into accepting solutions which go against the interests of both communities and the Cypriot people in general. The way in which integration itself is being handled basically legitimises the disgraceful state of partition, never mind its drawbacks for the people of Cyprus. We, the Communist Party of Greece, oppose all these procedures and we shall stand with all our might shoulder to shoulder with the people fighting for their rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He made every effort to point out to his Dutch fellow party members that their attitude towards enlargement was totally untypical of true Liberals, because we know that the Liberals have always been keystones of European integration, that they are particularly kindly disposed towards extending the international rule of law and have always used this as a basis of their movement on principle. I am delighted that the bookkeeping obsessions that are currently doing the rounds in the Netherlands in combination with frightening scenarios in those circles have been contradicted in a way which can be described as truly impressive. I am indebted to him for this. His words will help ensure that, with the support of Her Majesty's constructive opposition, the Netherlands will certainly not be adopting a conflicting position. I have to say that the European Parliament, from all manner of quarters, has also done what was necessary in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also listened with great interest to our good friend Mr Berthel Haarder, who spoke about Kaliningrad and said that the interests of the Lithuanians should not be trampled underfoot. Considering it was a speech made by the Parliament's presidency, I think it was worthy of imitation. After all, if we set up a joint committee together with the Duma to discuss issues surrounding Kaliningrad, the Lithuanian parliament will also need to be represented in this committee, not with a view to putting Lithuania under any pressure, but so that this representation could clearly protect Lithuania's interests. The way we view Lithuania and its sovereignty is a litmus test for the way the enlarged Community will deal with small Member States in future. This is why the speech by Mr Haarder strikes me as particularly important and I should like to thank him for it.</p>
<p class="contents">My final comment is about Turkey. Needless to say, there is still a difficult issue to be addressed there. I would plead strongly in favour of Turkey being treated in the same way as the other candidate Member States. This means that, since Turkey is very different from the other candidates in terms of meeting the political criteria of Copenhagen, we have to put another problem to Turkey. If we apply the same criteria, we would need to treat Turkey in exactly the same way as we have treated Slovakia and any other country in the past. This may be difficult for the Turks at the moment, but in my view it is of major importance for Turkey to clearly develop in the direction of a democratic constitutional state that functions well as such, and for them to realise that they cannot participate in the game until they have reached that stage. It should also be a matter of honour for Turkey not to want to take part as a token member, having made half a pledge concerning the constitutional state. As far as I am concerned, we can look forward to the European Council with confidence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Danish Presidency has demonstrated clearly that it is Europe’s servant, and that it is not pursuing specifically Danish goals. It is the European goal which is being pursued, and, as usual, it is the small, eager, competent countries which are pursuing it. No new conditions for enlargement should be imposed. It has been said time and time again, and our political group obviously shares this view of the matter. No new conditions. It is clear that a debate on agricultural and funding reform will follow, but, as so many have said here in the House, these must not get in the way of enlargement. This is something that must be solved in stages.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been discussing the provision of information to our citizens on enlargement. Is it, however, the Commission which is going to do that? In my opinion, it is all very well for the Commission to supply factual information, but in actual fact it is us, the politicians – our governments and the parties in our countries – who have to solve the problem of information. I think we have to realise this, because different countries see things in different ways. Some things are more important in the north, other things in the south, but the common thread must be that we are carrying out enlargement because we wish to have peace in our territory; peace for when our children and children’s children grow up. It is a very simple message, and I think that it is the pivotal element in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">Many issues have been raised along the way, and one which is raised in at least some of the countries is the question of whether widespread corruption exists, which will undermine the fair distribution of EU subsidies. It is not an insurmountable obstacle, however. We must of course invite the applicant countries to participate in the existing system of subsidies on an equal footing with the present members. We should have faith in the applicant countries’ governments, too, being minded to do their best to prevent the misuse of common funds. They are equal members, but if it should be established that there is any corruption or fraud involving EU funds, the Commission should, in a transitional period, step in and take over the administration of subsidies, so that the money is paid out to those for whom it is intended.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish for many things, including that the democracy which we are developing, and which is developing all the time, be strengthened by the accession of the new countries. They bring with them a wide range of highly educated, extremely interesting people, who will enrich immeasurably the territory we are shaping together, and it is precisely their contribution to the creation of a new treaty which is absolutely crucial in ensuring that this takes into account the many cultural and national aspects which should go into building the new Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Titley (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, there is a saying in the United Kingdom that you should not 'spoil the ship for a ha'porth of tar'. I think we would all do well to remember that in the coming weeks. The financial arrangements are going to be difficult to agree and I do not underestimate them, but we must keep a sense of perspective. The money for the candidate countries up to 2006 represents one thousandth of the GDP of the EU and is 10% of what Germany has spent on its own unification. The costs are nothing compared to the economic benefits that will flow from enlargement. The costs are nothing compared to the costs of not enlarging and are nothing compared to the costs of trying to maintain the stability of the continent by other means.</p>
<p class="contents">The original six Member States would do well to remember why they formed the Community in the first place and the economic benefits that flow from it. Those of us that joined later should remember why we joined and the efforts that other countries made to integrate us successfully into the Union. We should remember the economic benefits that have flowed to us from EU membership. We should all remember that the financial and human effort needed to construct today's Union was the most efficient investment ever made on such a scale by countries of a whole continent. Now is the time to bring that investment up to an entirely new level for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned that this debate seems to be taking it for granted that the ten countries are already in, when they are not. We in Parliament have to give our assent and we will scrutinise the final treaties very closely. It is vital that the candidate countries maintain their efforts to come up to the required standards. We welcome the three-fold safeguards set out by the Commission in the form of economic safeguards, internal market safeguards and justice and home affairs safeguards. But we expect Parliament to be involved if these safeguard clauses are ever invoked.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the Commission's proposal for a further progress report six months before accession. We must all be prepared, if that report is negative on any particular country, to take the appropriate action. The Socialist Group will also be monitoring the social component of enlargement, because we must make sure that enlargement makes things better for people and not worse.</p>
<p class="contents">If I could turn to Kaliningrad, Mr Haarder mentioned negotiations with Russia. Could I gently remind Mr Haarder that Russia is not a Member State of the European Union, nor is it a candidate country. I should also remind you that many of the problems in Kaliningrad are of Russia's own making, not least the refusal to allow many countries to set up consulates there. They cannot have a veto on the future of the EU. What we must respect absolutely is Lithuania's sovereignty in this matter. Nor must we try to find solutions with negative historical connotations, such as train corridors. We must also ensure that whatever solution is reached is practical and that we are prepared to give financial and other support to enable Lithuania and Poland to enforce it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish referendum taught us one important lesson. The 'no' vote actually stayed the same, the difference was in the 'yes' vote, and this was the result of the positive engagement by politicians with their people. In preparation for enlargement, we all have a responsibility to engage with our electorates to ensure that they welcome enlargement and recognise the benefits rather than worry about the costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the wall which symbolised the division of Europe, the hostility and the distance between East and West. On that day, we shall celebrate the fact that it is 13 years since the joyful masses clambered over a crumbling wall, and the long journey towards reconciliation and unification began. Now we are almost there. We are approaching our destination. The Commission’s report confirms that ten countries can become members in just over a year. It is a fantastic feeling, but the joy is tempered slightly by a nagging unease. We are getting there. We are approaching the finishing line and are noticing that quite a few of us are becoming nervous. Support for the candidate countries is waning, and several Member States, leading politicians and parties are speaking of waiting or postponing on the grounds that ‘we are not ready’. Internal policy considerations are overshadowing the historic task of unifying Europe for the first time ever; by means of agreements, negotiations and compromise, not by means of threats, tanks or invasion.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, many people around Europe are asking themselves questions about how cooperation will work and how it will develop. Difficulties and problems will arise. After all, who believed that it would be easy to unify Europe? This anxiety must be taken seriously, and we must discuss it. We must demonstrate our genuine intention to reform and open up the EU. It is towards this that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is working most actively in the Convention – because it has to succeed. We must also become much better at bringing the results of the Convention’s discussions out of the conference rooms in Brussels. Above all, however – and little has been said about this in the debate – it is leadership which is required: from us, from the Commission and from you in the Council. It is deplorable that internal policy considerations, mean-mindedness and populism are what are communicated to our citizens instead of talk of visions, opportunities and Europe’s big chance.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the politicians, have an enormous responsibility to explain, educate and guide opinion. Forked tongues arouse distrust in our countries and the candidate countries. I hope, therefore, that the Council meeting over the weekend will be crystal clear and unanimous in saying: ‘Yes, you are most welcome.’ </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our group has always followed it and played its part in shaping it; we have been active in doing this, but have kept a critical mind. There are real fears that the hopes enlargement has nurtured over many years – for social improvements and an economic upturn – will not be fulfilled in precisely that way. The stertorous political utterances, heard over and over again in this Parliament, about overcoming of the division of Europe and doing away with the inheritance of Communism, block out any more sophisticated view of Europe's post-war history and, there being so many different problems in the central and eastern European states, go over people's heads.</p>
<p class="contents">People are hardly being involved in the process at all. The process went ahead along largely administrative and technical lines and was seen by Brussels as having to do with the acceptance of the acquis communautaire. The governments of the candidate countries were sometimes not allowed to say much, and their parliaments were programmed to give approval after largely uncritical debates. The acquis communautaire, which every country is to adopt and transpose, constitutes a paper mountain of over 80 000 pages. If – as is the case – officials are scarcely able to get an overview of this, how can the public be expected to?</p>
<p class="contents">Under such conditions, there was little chance of the debate on the future of Europe, which we are often told we should be having, really getting going, either in the Fifteen or in the candidate countries, and little desire that it should do so. That there is particularly deep-seated frustration among rural communities is no secret. If you examine the differentials resulting from enlargement after previous accessions, you cannot fail to see that parity is to come about only in 2003. Coupled with that, it is intended that the cooperative firms, alleged to be relics of the Communist command economy, should have the ground cut from under their feet by new directives designed to improve efficiency. Let me say in blunt terms that European integration will not be made to work well by means of a reheated anti-communism, which cannot do other than target a fair number of the leading politicians elected by the peoples of the candidate countries. I could name to you several good acquaintances of mine who fall into this category.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems necessary, in view of the dangerous lack of information, that we ask as a matter of priority, what effect the European Union has on the public's everyday lives and how we are meant to discuss it with them. What is demanded of us is to talk less about transparency and democracy, and do more about them! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To tell you the truth, I have been rather embarrassed over the past few weeks about the attitude of the Dutch Government. It has wavered long, far too long, over adopting a final stance and abandoning the veto. As fellow MEPs have already pointed out, this was mainly due to the Liberals, who are conspicuous by their absence in this debate, and who, in my view, have adopted a small-minded bookkeeper's attitude in a bid to obtain short-term electoral victory. Fortunately, an attitude of this kind cannot count on much support from other European Liberals.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyway, it will all be all right in the end, I think, not least because the opposition of the Social-Democrats and Greens will come to the rescue of the distressed Christian-Democrats in the debate that is being held in the Dutch parliament today. Another reason why it will be all right in the end – and I do want to add this – is because we have before us a sound report from the Commission which is very open and honest about the long list of shortcomings which candidate countries are still displaying – something which I think is very brave – but, crucially, which also offers solutions to all the problems that still exist. As has been mentioned by many fellow MEPs, the vital element needed to find those solutions is monitoring – monitoring the accession process and safeguard measures for two years. I should like to put a question to Commissioner Verheugen on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verheugen, you spent the past two weeks in the Netherlands, you talked with the Dutch Government and you were undoubtedly informed of the Dutch Government's stance. I should like to ask you for your observations on two specific points. As you know, the Dutch Government proposes not to restrict those safeguard measures to two years, but possibly to extend them to three and four years. What is your personal opinion about this and what is the Commission's opinion about this?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it has been proposed to lift these safeguard measures only in the event of unanimity in the Council. I should like to have your opinion about this too and, with regard to this last point, I should also like to hear the comments of your former colleague, Mr Haarder, current President-in-Office of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word on Turkey. For reasons that are incomprehensible, the Commission has not adopted a stance on this matter. I should again like to ask the Council, and Mr Haarder in particular: is it conceivable – and I am choosing my words carefully – that the Council could reach a different conclusion regarding the setting of an accession date for Turkey? For example, because Turkey could play a very positive role in the case of Cyprus in the next few months and because it is able to prove that it is taking the reforms seriously. I would urge both the Commission and the Council to remain critical about Turkey, as we are doing, but also to continue to reflect on how the reform process can be promoted rather than frustrated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am very pleased at the outcome of the Irish referendum and I am convinced that it was Parliament that established the conditions which enabled the Irish people to review their positions. I am particularly impressed with the work of the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, who explained to us in his report this morning that it is important and necessary that Europe improves its north-south relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, it is on precisely these issues that I would like to focus, particularly the question of the south. When I hear about the arrangements we are making for the Structural Funds, where – it would appear – we are giving EUR 231 per capita to the citizens of the current Member States and EUR 137 per capita to the citizens of the new Member States, I feel that we are disregarding the fact that there are distortions. I have already had occasion to discuss these with President Prodi, and Parliament needs to reflect on the matter. What will be the consequences of enlargement for southern Europe? If I consider my native Italy, there is a large region in the south of Italy – Abruzzo – which is already excluded from the Commission’s Objective 1.</p>
<p class="contents">Would it not be appropriate, therefore – this is my question to President Prodi – to review the Objective 1 and Objective 2 parameters? Is there not a need to prevent enlargement, which we all want, having a negative impact on southern Europe? This position, outlined by President Prodi, needs to become a major effort to bridge the gap between northern and southern Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many of the candidate member states still have a great deal of work to do in order to be able to join the EU by 2004 in a proper manner. The question also arises whether the EU would not in any case become unmanageable with so many new member states. The necessary amendment of agricultural policy and structural funds alone places the current Member States before well nigh insurmountable problems. What are the odds of the candidate member states actually complying with the EU's <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>?</p>
<p class="contents">These problems cannot simply be brushed aside. It is, however, surprising how often the discussion is typified by unilateral thinking. The argument that ‘not enlarging’ or ’enlarging at a later date’ also carries a hefty price tag is heard very rarely. Or the fact that the candidate member states have already made huge sacrifices. Enlargement is not a matter of meeting a certain number of technical requirements. It is an act of solidarity, of historical awareness, of strategic and economic importance. It is a process that cannot be changed or broken off at this stage without major damage being done.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore to be hoped that the Council will be able to reach a deal on the financial package, the CAP and the institutional issues without delay. Particularly in the institutional area, it is important to be vigilant of large Member States practising new power politics in respect of the small ones.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the major achievements yet to be accomplished by the candidate member states, the safeguard clauses proposed by the Commission are unavoidable. The Commission must table specific and unambiguous text proposals promptly in order to make these clauses concrete. It has been suggested that the period of application of these safeguard clauses be extended from two to three or four years. The question does arise, however, whether the Commission intends to actually deploy these sensitive instruments if necessary. Its current stance concerning the equally 'hard' Stability Pact is not very promising in this respect. Needless to say, this is at present not the right signal we are giving the candidate member states. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been able to see how we have come closer to our goal with every passing week. The week before last there came the Commission’s recommendation, which won the support of a substantial majority yesterday in Luxembourg. Last week there was the massive support for the enlargement project shown by the Irish. Yesterday, we achieved common positions on Kaliningrad, on the institutions, on certain calculation methods and, of course, also on the choice of countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It must therefore be said that there are now extremely high expectations for the meeting in Brussels on Thursday, Friday and possibly Saturday, in which economic aspects are to be finalised, as Commissioner Verheugen so clearly put it. The economic position of the present Member States should be laid down in order to make time for negotiations with the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Poettering, Mr Brok and many others for the unconditional support which the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has given to this whole enlargement project. I would also like to thank Mr Watson and many others for supporting the view that there must be no new conditions imposed. This was echoed by Mr Lund and Mr Andersson. Mr Barón Crespo was quite right in saying that, just as a marriage must be built on love, so enlargement must be built on popular support. Many people here have spoken about this and it could be a subject for my meeting with the Conference of Presidents at lunch, as it is of course up to Parliament in particular, and naturally also the Presidency and the European affairs ministers, to now get this public debate under way and garner popular support for the project.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I have to say that I was not impressed by the extremely unclear speeches made by Mr Sjöstedt, Mr Bonde and Mr Modrow. It was a good thing that the Irish voters did not pay any attention to this unholy alliance of old EU opponents, who have taken advantage of every single opportunity in their attempt to stall the European project. For that I thank the Irish voters.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Suominen I wish to say that we are maintaining close contact with Lithuania and Russia. Yesterday, the Council gave us a mandate to negotiate with Russia; and this is a mandate which fully respects both Lithuania’s sovereignty and its right to join cooperation on Schengen at the same time as its neighbours. The Presidency will do all in its power on Thursday, Friday and possibly Saturday to establish a common position on economic issues, too, which will make it possible to conclude negotiations with the new countries in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be sleeping with our clothes on so that we do not miss a single opportunity to reach a compromise. Without wanting to jump the gun, we are incredibly pleased with all the progress made, which has brought us closer to a solution with every passing week. We must not now let the process be taken over by cold financial calculations of microscopic significance compared with the gains to be had by us all from enlargement. We must not end up stalling the whole process by investing our energies in small financial details. Perhaps we, the parliamentarians and governments, should try a little harder to explain to our citizens how little it costs per head. If we have to sit there on Friday evening and night discussing whether it is 50, 35 or 75 cents per head, how long would that take? One rapporteur said that the total cost of enlargement will be one tenth of the cost of German reunification. Another mentioned that, in total, enlargement will cost one tenth of one per cent of our GDP. This must not be allowed to compromise the historic task which awaits us. Warm thanks to the rapporteurs, the President of the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen. Thank you to Parliament for today reaffirming that there is a momentum in this historic process.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I will respond briefly to certain questions which I feel are extremely important: briefly not least because I was very pleased to see the extensive support for the enlargement process, which really has united almost the whole of Parliament in the political operation which I consider to be by far the most important part of my entire mandate and the mandate of my Commission. I cannot think of anything else which is as valuable in both human and political terms as what we are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore start by responding briefly to Mr Modrow. Mr Modrow, the appeal to the will of the people for support for enlargement might not have been as successfully carried out as it could have been, as in all political processes, but what I found most remarkable, what struck me the most, was this new striving to implement the principles of democracy, solidarity and respect for minorities which has transformed Eastern Europe. It has been an extraordinary experience for me to witness the continuous endeavours of the parties in the parliaments of these countries, parties which might be at loggerheads over other issues but which are in agreement regarding enlargement. I am sorry that we are in disagreement on this very fundamental point.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement has been treated as an ethical and political matter as well as an economic matter. Indeed, in many cases, although the economic dimension has been discussed, this great sense of turning over a new page in our history, this great sense of having unified Europe – not reunified but unified Europe, for Europe has never been united – is extraordinarily powerful. We have – I repeat this too time and time again, and I learned it in the parliament of one of the countries soon to become part of our Union – unified Europe on a different basis, which means we can attract smaller countries too, we can attract minorities as well, for ours is a Union of minorities, it is a Union where no one person or body is in command: that is the immense, unique splendour of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Poettering and Mr Barón Crespo mentioned two important elements. Firstly, the need to take the final step as regards the financial framework. There is no alternative – we cannot jeopardise this great historic process for the sake of EUR 3 per head. Clearly, Parliament and we at the Commission must push for these last steps to be completed. Secondly, the problem raised by Mr Barón Crespo of how to avoid the candidate countries becoming net contributors. We should also be showing a minimum of solidarity with purely formal measures. I reiterate: let us take stock of the situation. As the last speaker said, it is a question merely of a few euro per inhabitant. That is not asking much. Just now, I read out the figure which the Member States will receive under the cohesion chapter and how that differs from the amount the new countries will receive. There are reasons for that discrepancy – life is complicated, we have limited budgets – but it is a discrepancy which we do not condone, which offends our sense of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, as Mr Bigliardo pointed out, we clearly have to behave with the same solidarity in the future towards the Objective 1 regions. That was our aim in not rushing into a mathematical calculation to produce a figure for the accession of the new Member States but, once again, waiting in order to be able to resolve the issue within a politically appropriate and intelligent way.</p>
<p class="contents">My last comment concerns the issues of the provision of information and the citizens’ appreciation – matters raised by Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mrs Maes. We need to make a greater effort to reassure our citizens and the citizens of the Member States. Mrs Maes explored individual, specific areas such as enlargement and poverty, minorities and the economic crisis. I have to say that the Commission launched a communication strategy as early as the beginning of 2000: all the questions and answers which we have received today have been posted on the Internet in all the languages. For this campaign, for 28 countries, we set aside EUR 150 million for a period of five years. This is a modest affair, then – we are prevented from having recourse to the mass media by the limited size of the budget. This provision of information is carried out in cooperation with the Member States and, most importantly, using the structures of civil society and supporting them by using them to promote our action. Nevertheless, the campaign will not have the desired effects if the political leaders of the Member States do not work together with us to set up a debate on these issues, as Mr Rovsing said in his speech on this matter. Clearly, therefore, I am calling for Member States’ campaigns to be given more support, and maybe we could use some of the resources earmarked for 2004 and 2005 in 2003, which will be the busiest year.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, however – and I apologise to Parliament for this – that the new Eurobarometer statistics only reached me this morning because they were only published this morning, and that they are remarkably more encouraging than those I read out a few hours ago. People usually present statistics to Parliament which are better than the reality, but, in this case, I had come with statistics which were actually less encouraging. These new statistics reveal a radical change, which is due to the fact that the matter has been debated, that the press have brought the issue to the surface, with the result, for example, that 68% of German citizens are in favour and as many as 72% are in favour in France, the most Eurosceptic country. This shows that, when problems arise, when a clear decision has to be made – ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – it would seem that the peoples of the countries realise that they are in a situation where they are deciding the course of history and are extremely aware of the importance of European Union affairs. I would stress that we will analyse these statistics more thoroughly, for I only received them on a sheet of paper a few minutes ago and I would not like to mislead you. In any case, they reveal that the people become more aware of the importance of European Union affairs above all when they are faced with a historic event. Therefore, with all due reservations, considering that I am relying on a sheet of paper for information,<span class="bold"> </span>I believe that this is a genuinely positive sign, for it means that we are working to change the course of history and we are working with the support of the citizens. It is for this that I want, much more deeply and much more directly, to thank Parliament, the social partners and the great politicians who, after the fall of the Berlin Wall and, in some cases, even before these events, awoke in us this dream of a unified Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, bearing in mind the incentives we have regarding some of our neighbours such as Ukraine, it is clear that, while we now have the great task of completing this enlargement, we must also open the debate on Europe’s borders, on its roots, on all these issues. I remember talking about this the first time I spoke before this House. It is not, of course, a debate which can be held today or tomorrow, but, clearly, enlargement raises the issues of our identity, our roots, our history and, by extension, our future.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I wish to answer briefly the questions that have been put to me directly, starting with the weaknesses to which the regular reports have drawn attention. I want to reiterate very clearly that we have been tasked with producing regular reports only on the future member states. I do not know what would emerge if we were to write regular reports on the current Member States, applying the same yardsticks and using the same instruments. Do you think we would come to the conclusion that there was no corruption anywhere? Do you think we would come to the conclusion that privatisation was carried out in a transparent manner everywhere? Do you think we would come to the conclusion that concentration in the media had no adverse effects on the free expression of opinion? Or do you believe that I could not show you, in any city in any of our Member States, a district in which people live in the same degradation that one finds in a settlement of Roma in Slovakia, Bulgaria or Romania? I just think that consideration of the social reality in our own societies gives us no reason to feel superior.</p>
<p class="contents">The mere fact that there are no reports on progress in the Member States does not in the least mean that they must in every respect be superior to the countries that now want to join us. This question demands of us that we keep our feet on the ground to some degree and be fair in passing judgment. Nor do I believe that it might be possible for a member of the Commission to call on the head of a Member State's government to join with him in seeking out the worst civil and social blackspots and to announce to the nation's media that he is ashamed of these conditions and that he will do away with them. As to whether any head of a Member State's government can be found willing to do that, I have serious doubts.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If I may turn to the monitoring of the safeguards, the monitoring instruments are many and varied, and they will all continue to be applied. It is of course the final monitoring report six months prior to accession that is crucial. The political pressure alone that this report will exert will be so strong that we really can safely assume that the remaining deficits will be dealt with by then.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation as regards the safeguards is that I have told both the Council and, as recently as last week, the Dutch Government, that the new instrument on safeguards, which we are proposing, must be of limited duration. The point must come when, again, it is the Treaty's ordinary instruments, rather than derogations, that take effect. The two-year period that the Commission has proposed does not yet, however, exhaust the possibilities offered by the law. Perhaps I have expressed that in rather complicated terms, so, to put it another way, there is still a certain amount of room to manoeuvre as regards the timeframe, and the Commission has no objection to the Council making full use of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, though, like to say quite definitely, that the instrument as a whole will be of no use if complicated procedures have to be involved and we need such things as unanimous Council resolutions in order for it to be applied. In that case, we can forget it.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">And, in that case, we will not need it. Putting it bluntly, this is about having something that enables us to deal with smaller problems very quickly and not always having to set in motion the big weapon of infringement proceedings. If, then, the products of a slaughterhouse in one of the countries are below standard, we have to be able to close the place down the next day. By that I mean the very next day, and not only after the Council has come up with a unanimous resolution on the subject! It is simple, practical things like this that are at issue, and the European public will not be mollified if we have to tell them that such an instrument can only be applied if it has gone through a procedure lasting for months. Let me say this in all frankness: nothing is any use unless it can be put into action quickly and decisively.</p>
<p class="contents">Passing on to the matter of scope, the concept of the internal market applies to everything that has economic effects across borders, or to everything that has an effect on competition. The honourable lady did indeed ask whether environmental and social matters might be included here, but I have my doubts as to how that might be justified. If we find somewhere where the environmental <span class="italic">acquis</span> is not being fully transposed, I do not know why we should have, in the candidate countries, a fast-acting instrument whilst having to use normal infringement proceedings as regards the present Member States. There are now thousands of infringement proceedings every year, so it is not the case that the problem of non-transposition of the acquis in the present EU does not exist. I think, then, that I would have difficulties with us actually restricting this instrument to the internal market. Apart from that, there are safeguard clauses in every imaginable policy area of the European Union, food safety being one example. The safeguard clauses that already exist will continue to do so, and they will, of course, be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me end with a brief comment on Kaliningrad. What very much worries me about this whole debate, is the fact that the Russians have not, to date, been prepared to talk about the real problem. I do not believe that the issues of access, visas and transit constitute the real problem and agree wholeheartedly with what Mr Brok and others have said. Looking at the conditions on this border, you cannot actually believe that easier access is the real issue. I think the real problem is how to conduct a policy that prevents Kaliningrad from remaining socially and economically backward in a region that is developing very rapidly – which this region will do. The inevitable consequence of that will be the growth of economic and, eventually, political tensions. Everyone in this Chamber is capable of imagining how political tensions can vent themselves in a geographical situation like this one. That is precisely what has to be avoided, and we will do it by engaging in a dialogue with Russia on how we can give Kaliningrad a share in the benefits that European integration offers to the Baltic region as a whole. I hope that, when this vexatious issue of visas and transit is sorted out – which I believe it will be in a matter of days – the way will be open for us to discuss this question, which is of such importance to the future of Europe.</p>
