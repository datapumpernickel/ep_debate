Strict observance of these rights is an essential condition of our association agreement. The Euro-Mediterranean partnership cannot be strengthened, therefore, by denying this indispensable and irrevocable clause.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1981, Egypt has been under<span class="bold"> </span>an emergency law which grants extensive powers to the authorities, with a total disregard for human rights. Freedoms are increasingly restricted and subject to the tightest control by the police authorities, which are approved by the judicial authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Saad Eddine Ibrahim and his colleagues from the Ibn Khaldoun Centre have been sentenced on the pretext of misuse of funds or<span class="bold"> </span>of procedures, but the real reason for this is that they are defending democratic freedoms, as Nawal El Saadawi or other human rights activists have done in the past, whilst individual freedoms are also flouted, several homosexuals having been sentenced.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore urge the Egyptian Government to put an end to the emergency law to allow all citizens to fully enjoy their lawful rights, to allow sexual orientation, freedom of religion and freedom of opinion to be expressed without being equated to crimes and to allow the freedom of association to be guaranteed so that civil liberties campaigners will no longer be persecuted. We want the State of Egypt, like the other States which have signed the association agreements, to understand that the democratic clause in Article 2 is not a luxury, nor is it an option. We want our friends to know that we are not interfering, not acting out of a notion of superiority, nor a wish to preach, but we are in fact acting out of duty, a duty to denounce and condemn violations of freedom wherever they occur.</p>

<p class="contents">The first question needs to be considered in more general terms, since the Constitutions of some of these countries – in particular, I would recall the recent modification in Tunisia – contain an article to the effect that the citizens must not carry out any activity which may be directed against the state, which can even be interpreted as conspiracy. Moreover, this is applied to freedom of speech, and therefore an opposition supporter, a journalist or any free person who criticises the government may then be accused of activities against the state. This is a very serious issue, which requires a more general response.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the offence of fraud, however, checks, will, of course, have to be carried out, but according to our records, as Commissioner Patten has said, there has been no fraud with regard to the use of the Community funds which Professor Ibrahim’s institute has administered on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we are dealing with a case of defence of human rights and I therefore feel that the European institutions should exert every possible pressure on the Egyptian authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We accordingly have a duty to give our support to a man, Professor Ibrahim, who has worked in the tradition of Ibn-Khaldoun, and we should make it clear – and this is also something that we owe, as it were, to the heritage of Ibn-Khaldoun – that there are not two concepts of human rights, one for Europe and one for Egypt, but that there is a single concept of human rights here, which is also appropriate in common cultural and historical terms and which should apply universally today.</p>
<p class="contents">That is precisely why we owe it to both Professor Ibrahim and the Egyptian people to get involved here. First, to get Professor Ibrahim released and second, as his health is poor, to secure help for him. However, the third issue is for us to very clearly advocate close cooperation between Egypt and the European Union. Egypt is one of our most important partners in the Mediterranean area. As is evident from the current political crisis, Egypt, alongside Morocco and Turkey, is our most important ally in the Islamic world in the Mediterranean area. Precisely because Egypt is a partner and an ally and not a debtor country or a country we do not want anything to do with, and precisely because Egypt is an important ally, we should not mince our words in talking to them, as is usual between friends, and we should plead the case of persecuted minorities and persecuted people in general. Above all we should support those people within the Egyptian State and within the Egyptian Government who want to strengthen human rights rather than demolish them. Egypt has a great tradition of which I have personal experience from the times when Anwar al Sadat and President Mubarak addressed this House. We are taking about important partners, and I believe that we should continue along that path and support Professor Ibrahim.</p>

Fine words like peace, stability and prosperity will degenerate into empty slogans if partner countries continue to sacrifice the constitutional state on the altar of unbridled political power. The intensification of economic cooperation cannot be seen as a separate issue from progress in the areas of human rights and democracy. Many Arab leaders refuse to realise that openness, power-sharing and fair judicial procedures will promote rather than hinder stability and economic development. A properly functioning civil society is not a threat, it is a necessary precondition for decent government.</p>
<p class="contents">Egypt is a big and important country with a rich history. She must play a leading role in the political modernisation of the Arab world. In order to achieve this, she must set an example that other states can emulate. Unfortunately, there is no evidence of this as yet. Openness and democracy still leave much to be desired, and the constitutional state is often violated. Thus Dr Ibrahim’s recent seven year prison sentence is a flagrant breach of every legal concept. The accusations of fraud with EU money are not only unsubstantiated, according to the Commission, they are completely unfounded. This sentence therefore undermines the cooperation treaty. We are therefore urgently appealing to President Mubarak to do everything in his power to reverse this injustice. Good relations with Egypt are also of vital importance for us. The European Union is willing to inject new life into the Barcelona Process, but this can only be done if our partners stop flouting the principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are dealing with a so-called moderate regime, Egypt, as a way of hiding all our shame and cowardice. We are talking about Professor Saad Ibrahim, who is one of the most ardent Egyptian supporters of democracy in his country, and we too should be much more determined in our quest for democratisation in the Arab world.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Commissioner Patten for his clear statements in defence of Professor Ibrahim and refuting allegations of any kind of fraud. I believe that all possible checks have been carried out and that there is therefore no excuse: we must fight for his release. Lastly, I would also like to thank all those who have supported his nomination for the Sakharov prize. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, the trial of Dr Saad Eddin Ibrahim and his colleagues has aroused widespread international interest and concern, not least among those who, like many of us here, consider ourselves true friends of Egypt and the Egyptian people.</p>
<p class="contents">When Dr Ibrahim and his co-accused successfully appealed for a retrial last February, we hoped that the best traditions of justice would prevail, not only on the merits of the case, but because of the evident damage to Egypt's international reputation caused by the handling of the case by the Egyptian authorities. We were therefore profoundly shocked on 29 July when Dr Ibrahim was again sentenced to seven years' imprisonment with hard labour, a cruel sentence for a man in his frail physical condition. A further four defendants were also sentenced to prison and the remaining 24 have suspended sentences.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if the charges were credible, and we do not find them so, these sentences are completely disproportionate. The following day I personally voiced my dismay and repeated that, despite careful monitoring and a mid-term external audit, the Commission has no evidence of financial or other wrongdoings by Dr Ibrahim or his co-defendants with respect to the two NGO contracts managed by them. We made this clear in an affidavit submitted during the appeal.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I repeated then and I repeat now that we deplore the use of state security courts and procedures to pursue cases of this nature. Even the Court of Appeal has misgivings on the use of Military Court Order No 4 under which this prosecution was brought.</p>
<p class="contents">We were disturbed by the decision to retry the defendants after a successful appeal and despite Dr Ibrahim's failing health. We are troubled by the conduct of the trial and the speed and manner of the court's decision. This unseemly rush to judgment did nothing to improve the court's credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The case has been closely followed by the EC and Member States and we made our concern clear at the highest levels from the beginning. With respect to the charge of accepting foreign European Union funds without authorisation, the Commission insists that direct grants to civil society are perfectly proper and are covered by the EU-Egypt Framework Convention on Financial and Technical Cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">At the conclusion of the first trial last year, the severe sentences led to an EC statement on 23 May and the presidency declaration two days later, expressing deep concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, as now, the European Union stressed the importance it attaches to the development of civil society and reiterated that actions to this end are an integral part of Barcelona and bilateral programming which Egypt has signed up to.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to the claimed misuse of EU funds, the Commission is, to say the least, surprised that the Court has reportedly ruled as irrelevant the views of the Commission, the alleged victim, that its normal monitoring procedures, including an external mid-term audit, gave no cause for concern whatsoever, financial or otherwise. We have no access at present to the NGO files, which have been confiscated by the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has always hoped that due legal process and justice would prevail. We have scrupulously avoided any intervention that might prejudice that expectation. The Commission's affidavit during the appeal was strictly factual and correct. We are concerned that the Court, in its written explanations, is reported to have implied the contrary.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Member States continue to follow the case closely. The Cairo-based Troika has already visited Dr Ibrahim in prison and the Swedes visited again this weekend. We are in close touch with the family. If, as first press reports indicate, the Court's formal explanation of its verdict, which still has to be translated, misrepresents the European Union's position, we will not hesitate to rectify it.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal process is not finished and I understand that the defendants will appeal. The Egyptian authorities are well aware of the wider implications of a judgment that is perceived as unjust and politically influenced. Only the due process of law in full transparency can prevent further damage to Egypt's international standing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ibrahim case raises issues of real concern, but the overall human rights situation in Egypt is complex and not entirely clear. There is some cause for optimism, for example, in relation to women's rights, judicial control of general elections and social legislation. But there are also some signs which give cause for concern, such as the new law on non-governmental organisations, the alleged harassment of homosexuals referred to earlier and the further arrests of members of the Islamic opposition. What we have to do is discern the trend and react accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ibrahim case casts a long, but hopefully temporary, shadow over the Egyptian human rights and democracy movement. Although the international outcry at the verdict has provoked a strong reaction in Cairo, many influential Egyptians accept that Egypt must adopt the highest judicial and democratic standards if it is to achieve its developmental and political ambitions. We can only agree with that.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to use appropriate measures to express our concern on individual cases. We shall discuss the broader issues concerning human rights and the promotion of democracy within the context of our cooperation programming and the enhanced political dialogue that must characterise the new and privileged relationship between the European Union and its Mediterranean partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I confirm directly to the Member who raised this question that I shall certainly be discussing the matter when, God willing, I visit Egypt myself next month.</p>
