<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Over the past year, the Commission has had numerous contacts with the UN at political level. President Prodi met with Secretary-General Annan in October 2000 and visited Geneva in January this year. I have met the Secretary-General and most of the Heads of all the UN agencies over the last 18 months. In January this year, I paid a very successful visit to New York, where the Commission for the first time accepted an invitation to speak in the Joint Executive Boards of UNDP, UNICEF, UNFPA and WFP.</p>
<p class="contents">So relations are close, and on both sides there is a strong political will to strengthen them. Over recent years, a consensus on the fundamental objectives and strategies of development cooperation has emerged on the global scene. This must result in better coordination and more coherence.</p>
<p class="contents">The EC finances activities carried out by UN agencies at an average of EUR 354 million per year. This is a rather modest amount compared to the globality of what we are doing. Nevertheless, it is an important contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Many UN agencies, funds and programs possess reservoirs of professional skills and know-how as well as broad-based information and data systems. Making better use of those assets is one of the reasons for presenting this communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither side has been able to draw maximum benefits from the existing cooperation. Different administrative cultures and regulatory obstacles are among the reasons for this situation. I have described this situation as the war of accountants: this war is still not over but we can see solutions on the horizon.</p>
<p class="contents">The Communication sets out a number of fundamental principles for strengthening the working relationship:</p>
<p class="contents">Selectivity: The EC will be a positive, but demanding multilateral partner. The Commission will seek to focus on strengthening cooperation with those UN entities that work in the areas identified by the EU and where working at the Community level provides added-value.</p>
<p class="contents">Predictability: By clearly setting out long-term priority areas for cooperation, both the EC and UN will be able to enjoy a more predictable flow of EC financial contributions. We have to move from projects to programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Active presence: The EC will further exploit the already extensive opportunities for active EC participation in the work of the governing bodies of priority UN entities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Communication focuses on the administrative environment necessary to reach these objectives. We need:</p>
<p class="contents">– A successful conclusion of the ongoing negotiations on a Verification Clause, giving the EC controllers satisfactory access to information about the use of EC funds.</p>
<p class="contents">– A re-negotiation of the 1999 EC/UN Framework Agreement to focus, in co-financing operations, on output-based budgeting and upstream programme funding.</p>
<p class="contents">– A speedy Council approval of the Commission’s proposal on the recasting of the Financial Regulation [<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2000&amp;nu_doc=0461">COM(2000) 461</a> of 17 December 2000]. I would like to draw this point, in particular, to the attention of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Communication adopted today sends an important message to our UN partners:</p>
<p class="contents">– The EC is proposing to intensify cooperation on EC priorities that match key capabilities of UN agencies. To ensure smooth cooperation on this, strong UN inter-agency coordination is required.</p>
<p class="contents">– The EC is suggesting amending legal and administrative provisions governing EC/UN financial cooperation. The Commission hopes and expects that this will be met with flexibility from UN negotiators in recognition of the special role and status of the European Community in the work of the UN institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">– The EC is proposing to provide programme funding to selected UN agencies. It is a prerequisite that UN agencies continue efforts to further UN reform and to improve their quality of delivery.</p>
<p class="contents">This in turn should lead to an improvement of our own efficiency and effectiveness, both in the policy and operational domain, and in turn, to a sizeable improvement in the quality and impact of EC development and humanitarian policies and activities.</p>
<p class="contents">But let me conclude by stating one thing quite clearly: this is not about giving the UN system a blank cheque! This new approach by the Commission can only succeed if we can count upon active collaboration from the United Nations. Improving EC/UN policy and operational cooperation in the development and humanitarian fields is conditional to the UN strengthening in-house coordination, focusing its thematic strengths along the lines of its ongoing reform process and pursuing negotiations on the legal and financial cooperation framework.</p>
<p class="contents">We are fully committed to upholding the fundamental principles of sound and transparent management of the resources of the European taxpayer. We will make clear to the United Nations that the Commission is prepared to reduce or even suspend its support to individual UN partners, which fail to perform to an acceptable standard.</p>
<p class="contents">But, to relate in a more open and cooperative manner within the UN system is also an element in making our own development cooperation and humanitarian activities more efficient. There is a limit to the kind of relationship we can enter into. It is called the United Nations, it is not called the United Commission. We will remain different, but what we are proposing to do will improve and normalise the way we can work together with these partners also at country level and this is what we want to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sorry that the discussion about one Member has taken so long that once again the discussion about the poorest countries of the world and how we can more effectively aid them has been relegated and diminished. I have personally been involved in Europe's support for UNHCR for UN aids. It is the best quality support. I totally support what Mr Nielson has said about the financial regulation and given that Members of other committees than the Development Committee are here and are part of the process for agreeing such legislation perhaps he could elaborate on that more.</p>
<p class="contents">My questions to him are as follows: first, how will the communication actually change matters on the ground in countries so that in emergency situations better coordination takes place. Secondly, how will the communication ensure that together we better meet the UN goals on development, for example, halving world poverty by 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, reflecting on his point about United Commissions or United Nations, how far will the Member States go along with this. Too often in the past they have wanted to keep the European Union and its institutions away from the UN rather than ensuring effective collaboration. Can he count on their support in achieving this communication? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some of the United Nations programmes which deliver on the ground are very effective, and sometimes more effective, than what the European Union has been doing so far.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to ask two questions: first, what level of complementarity are you looking at when the Commission is trying to set an arrangement in place to work with the United Nations, or are we merely going to give the United Nations the money they require and they will do the delivery on the floor? This is a point that has taken prominence in Indonesia and in the Jaffna area of Sri Lanka where the UNHCR has been doing an excellent job in trying to rehabilitate and give support to people. The second question is really more broadly addressed to Parliament: are we going to set up a permanent standing liaison committee of MEPs involved with development and cooperation to report to the General Assembly of the United Nations each year on our joint cooperation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, I note with satisfaction the incredible importance of cooperation on particular themes.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the feeling in UNICEF is that the organisation has been given assignments to carry out only for as long as there has been no special European organisation that has been able to do so. As Mr Howitt mentioned, thematic cooperation must include education and the fight against poverty. I hope that we shall be able to see a significant increase in the EU’s contribution to high-quality education for women and girls. We know that this has been a topic taken up by the UN, and it will be a topic at the UN’s special session on children in September 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">We have obtained a communication from the Commission concerning the EU’s contribution to the conference for the poorest countries, but I wonder: will there also be a communication from the Commission about the efforts being made to prepare for the special session in September 2001? The EU’s input will be required in this area too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we look at Kosovo, they were given the mandate of coordinating all humanitarian support, but the Commission was not allowed, and would still not be allowed, to do core funding, so they had very great difficulty in defining specific projects that we can legally fund. But if we can have a broader definition defined by goals of what we can fund, we can make it possible for them to do their essential work of coordinating on the ground better. We need that also to give security to all the NGOs working in these humanitarian theatres, therefore predictability and better planning is what we can expect from the changes.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the larger goals, certainly our influence on policy-making in UN bodies is increased when we have a more normal ongoing discussion instead of the hit-and-run operation of funding a project here and a project there.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Deva, we will not just give the money. We are not contemplating core funding. This is something the owners of the UN organisation, its Member States, should do, but where we are now is inadequate, it is too much split up on individual projects without predictability for the World Food Programme or for UNICEF, as was mentioned. They need a quality partnership with a major donor like the Commission and, by doing what we are putting forward here, we can bring ourselves into that role.</p>

It also has an impact on the demand that UN organisations have to meet, when all donors are more disciplined. We are also raising the expectation that members of the UN family will play their part more in consultation with other donors: this has worked with the World Bank to a reasonable extent in very recent years and this is the same disciplining.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the humanitarian side, it is quite different. There, the main reason why we should support the UN instances is that they very often have the special mandate to do things where they have access and where others may have great difficulties. We are trying to establish a balance using them and NGOs. The only thing is coordination, but for example UNHCR has a special mandate and we have to be careful not to leave them marginalised.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Miranda, quite frankly the Commission is not proposing anything today, which would surprise those who have been discussing these issues with me over recent years. This is very much in line with what I have announced as the next logical and necessary step. We will discuss it and it is important that we try to work out the same kind of well-informed consensus on this step as we managed to do on the overall policy paper. This is part of implementing those ideas and we will both manage to do things more efficiently, also having more influence. This ability is fine, but not enough and if it is a visible PR stunt, I prefer the kind of visibility that comes from professional respect and getting real influence on the global scene. This is what we are aiming at.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Khanbhai, this discussion about the global fund is in one way easy to understand and we can quite sympathetically step up the effort against communicable diseases to the extent that the creation of this fund actually mobilises new and additional money from new private sources. We welcome it and we may also participate, but the real problem is delivery on the ground. This is where the UN organisations need to answer our questions more directly and where we have to become better at actually doing things. This is the bottleneck of the fight against these diseases, not whether we are adding EUR 100 million from money which is already devoted to do this job. The reality on the ground is the bottleneck and we should never forget this in this discussion. There are many fashions of the month in the discussion on these issues and I will be quite stubborn, with the support from this House, and stick to what we have defined. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The tensions on the ground – here I would respond also Mrs Sauquillo's question concerning the relation between NGOs and UN organisations – have very often been a big problem. Things are better now than they used to be. There is more of an acceptance of the need for a professional manner of work also among humanitarian NGOs, and of the need and the obligation to accept coordination as part of our contracts with anybody we are funding. So from case to case it looks somewhat better today.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already mentioned protection and security. In Chechnya, the access to using radios has been discussed with the Russian government since the troubles started and only now is it possible to have that additional little element of security, but without the UN being there as those who can actually handle this part of the whole work, no one would ever get permission to have radios. This is good and clear and this is being discussed now more and more internationally. This is one of the aspects I mentioned in connection with the special mandate of some of these global UN organisations so we need a division of labour between specialised NGOs and the umbrella, in some cases, of UN organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">As a very large humanitarian donor, we need to be able to play on all the instruments available and by entering into a more structured relationship as we are foreseeing now, we shall also have a stronger voice in the discussion on these issues with the UN organisations, compared to just an on-and-off donor.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Corrie, the figure of how much we are allocating in the ninth European Development Fund of 90% covers both the least developed countries and the low-income group of countries. It is these two added together which is the 90%. On capacity building we need everybody who is able to do it, UNDP, World Bank and ourselves: this is such a big job that we should not even think of doing everything ourselves. Let me remind Parliament that in the overall development policy paper, we have specified areas of special focus, which also means that we will frankly have to rely on others doing more in the areas where we will do less, and we have Member States who will and can do this. But we also have the global system and it is in order not to exclude that type of partnership that we are doing what we are now.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional cooperation: we are using very clearly the Economic Commission for Africa and the other relevant UN players and they are extremely interested in the bold, ambitious line followed by the Commission in trying to organise the geo-economics especially of Africa. We have a good partnership in this and good support.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, that part of Mrs Sauquillo's question dealing more or less with visibility and clarity of our policy. This is the self-confidence. We could also look at this the other way around: we have now reached the point where we have some certainty and clarity and strong support for the line that we have defined. Now we feel we have the strength and maturity to discuss more globally with the UN system. We were not that organised before in this field, so we are increasing the ambition of influencing what goes on globally, and this is the thought behind it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first inspection is carried out at the General Assembly which is held between September and December. I should like to ask the Commission how this is done at the moment. Does the European Commission fulfil a coordinating role at that Assembly?

We have heard a lot today and we will rightly hear a lot more about one of the biggest challenges, Aids: two days ago, Kofi Annan was appealing to the world to play a bigger part in this. But there are other illnesses: TB, malaria, river blindness and the mental and neurological health area which this year was designated by the WHO as its key area.</p>
<p class="contents">Will he bring forward to this Parliament plans to do more work in that area? Mental health is the fastest growing cause of disability. For example, there are more people with epilepsy than with Aids – 40 million people live with it, but only 8 million of those 40 million are treated for it. That is a disgrace to the world.

In general, what the EU Member States are doing in the political negotiating processes in the General Assembly is quite well coordinated. However, when we move into the boards of the different UN organisations the level of coordination is lower, and this is where we, as a Commission, have a real presence in terms of being more of a practical partner, very much in line with what Member States are themselves, but where we have no voice except in a very few cases, namely the FAO.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not asking for a new legal basis. We are asking for a closer partnership. We do not need it, but it would be nice if it were to grow over time into a role where we play a more visual political role. We will gain political influence by the changes we are suggesting, but it is a matter of process and achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the money I mentioned, the control issue: given the existing legal framework for how we can spend money, this is one of the few outstanding issues being discussed with the UN organisations before we can renew and improve the framework agreement on how we do things practically. This is the final round of the war of accountants, but it is in fact still on. We need a little more responsiveness from the UN organisations to give access to our auditors and controllers to follow our money, to open up in a manner which is comparable to what we have obtained with the World Bank. The big thing is that to work well in a normal partnership, we should not insist on having everything done according to our rules. If it is good enough for a Member State to do this together with a UN organisation and have its reporting accepted, it should be good enough for the European Union to do basically the same. But we can only do this when we have the financial regulation changed. Until then we are in the terrain we have described in this communication and there is ample room for improvement on how to do things. I hope we will in this way be able to build up confidence and thus stimulate efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bowis, I agree that the issue of mental health is a very large one. I would add other sorts of disabilities which, in a very poor environment, are often totally ignored. From a human point of view this needs more attention. In the humanitarian phase, we are now giving much more attention to the psychological aspects of the victims, not only children and women, but in general: it is quite clear that the demobilisation of soldiers is impossible without addressing the psychological aspects. I am very pleased that you mentioned TB and malaria as diseases that we need to give the same emphasis as Aids. This is another aspect we have tried to include in our communication and the programme of action on these communicable diseases. This is as important as sticking to the line of giving prevention absolute priority. We are trying to keep the broad picture of all these diseases at the top of the agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
