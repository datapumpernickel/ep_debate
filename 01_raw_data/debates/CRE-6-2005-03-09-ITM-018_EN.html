<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Locatelli (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon European Council of 2000 marks an important turning-point for European politics in general and for research and the knowledge-based society in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The Prodi Commission project – developed particularly by Commissioner Busquin but even prior to that by the Italian commissioner, Professor Ruberti – to create the European Research Area by means of a number of measures was confirmed at Lisbon. That is a fundamental step if Europe is to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware of the current gap between Europe and its major competitors in this field, that is, the United States and Japan. The percentage of GDP devoted to research spending is 3.12% in Japan, 2.76% in the United States, 1.99% in the EU of 15 and 1.93% in the EU of 25. We have to close this gap, and the European Research Area is a step in the right direction. This project is within reach, but it needs determination to make it happen, the same determination that was shown when we created the single market and the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of the European Research Area is underlined by the new powers that the Constitutional Treaty attributes to the Union in this field, and we therefore call on the Commission to act in line with the new legal framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Weighing up what has been done and outlining future prospects, I must underline the importance of having continuity between the sixth and seventh Framework Programmes. The sixth Framework Programme marked a break with previous programmes, because it set itself more ambitious targets and introduced innovative instruments that encourage a greater number of stake-holders to become involved and to coordinate their actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The seventh Framework Programme presents yet another novelty, which is to set up the European Research Council. I am also speaking on this subject on behalf of our fellow Member Erika Mann, who could not be present at this debate. The European Research Council responds to the European scientific community’s increasingly vehement demand for a new body to be created to stimulate basic research.</p>
<p class="contents">Basic research is crucially important for successful innovation and will create European added value. Up to now, European added value has been defined through collaboration between research teams in different countries. As the Mayor report shows, however, it is time to provide a new definition of added value, making it possible for individual researchers or individual teams in any EU Member State to compete with all other researchers on the basis of excellence. That is the real mission of the European Research Council, which must be independent in its scientific evaluations, autonomous in its operation and adequately funded. In this connection, I call on the Commission to present a clear, precise proposal regarding the structure and composition of the European Research Council governing bodies as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The report pays particular attention to the subject of human resources, which are the EU’s real strength. In this respect, we have to create the right conditions so that European researchers can best express themselves. It is essential to foster mobility among researchers and to make that a widespread practice at all career stages. Two-way mobility between companies, universities and research centres, the harmonisation of working conditions and career structures and the creation of Europe-wide infrastructure are essential conditions for creating a fertile research environment. To achieve these aims, I call for the Marie Curie actions to be strengthened, as they have proved to be effective and to encourage mobility in the scientific world.</p>
<p class="contents">Still on the subject of human resources, I should like to point to the need to promote women’s access to the research sector, as well as their careers. We want to see a greater presence of women at all levels, including the highest, and we also want gender research.</p>
<p class="contents">The future of research and of Europe also depends on our ability to make science more attractive to young people. A closer link between educational courses and scientific careers is a precondition for us to have the numbers of researchers needed for the success of the Lisbon Strategy. </p>
<p class="contents">Another chapter in the report concerns technology transfer. The seventh Framework Programme should devote special attention to technology transfer, thus coordinating Europe’s research policy with its industrial policy. Technology platforms and joint technology initiatives are vital mechanisms for achieving this objective. At the same time, funding needs to be increased for instruments aimed specifically at small and medium-sized enterprises, which also require the streamlining of project selection criteria and of bureaucracy in general, which has often been an obstacle preventing SMEs from taking part in research programmes. On this last point, I believe the recommendations included in the Marimon and Ormala reports should be adopted, and not only in relation to SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to touch briefly on thematic priorities, without going into the merits of individual arguments. I think it should be emphasised that these thematic priorities reflect the strategic priorities of the Lisbon Agenda. In this context, I should like to make it clear that to implement the Lisbon Agenda we need to adopt a different approach to spending compared with the past. We must move on from a model of diffuse provision of aid – what in Italy is called ‘<span class="italic">aiuti a pioggia</span>’ – to a model that prioritises spending on investments that have a multiplying effect, that is, an effect of reinforcing growth. Lastly, I would stress that Parliament must not make concessions on research funds, and I hope that the Commission will be on Parliament’s side in this battle.</p>

<p class="contents">Let me thank Mrs Locatelli, the rapporteur, in particular, and all the committee members for the fruitful and intense cooperation demonstrated during this first month of our work together. I would also like to thank everyone present at this late hour for their real interest in and commitment to future European research policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the adoption of the Locatelli report. It constitutes the European Parliament’s formal position on our June communication and, what is more, will pave the way for preparing the Commission’s proposal on the new framework programme to be adopted on 6 April 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Before highlighting what I consider to be the key elements of the Locatelli report, I would like to share with you some thoughts about the general context of European research and our plans for the Seventh Framework Programme. Even if some of you heard this during the plenary debate on the question of the financing of FP7 two weeks ago, the context is clear. We want and need to relaunch the Lisbon Strategy. The intensive discussion this morning on the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy has allowed us to take the measure of the challenges ahead. Europe cannot compete on the basis of cheap labour or low social standards. We cannot compete on the back of our environment. We do not have the natural resources to sustain our prosperity; we only have our brains, intelligence and creativity. Knowledge, in the broader sense, is our strongest factor of competitiveness in the global, fiercely competitive market place.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, we need to become much better at producing knowledge through research, diffusing knowledge through education, and using and applying knowledge through innovation. That means that the knowledge triangle of research, education and innovation must function within favourable framework conditions, which reward the knowledge that is put to work. The Commission is already working hard to develop such framework conditions for knowledge and innovation. For example, we will come forward later this year with a revision of the state aid regime, work on fiscal incentives for research and development and innovation, guidelines on cooperation between industry and universities, re-evaluation of the profession of European researchers, and other actions. Only knowledge-based growth can leverage the resources that we need to sustain the cost of the inclusive society, with the high levels of care and protection that Europeans aspire to. Building the knowledge society is thus probably the best and maybe the only way to sustain the European model of society, without having to make a trade-off between economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this same Lisbon context that I will present our proposals for the Seventh Framework Programme. As some of you rightly stated during our debate on the oral question on the research budget in Strasbourg two weeks ago, FP7 needs to be the framework programme for the Lisbon Strategy. I could not agree more. I want it to be the programme for the growth and job strategy. The duration of the programme will be seven years, as in the case of the next financial perspectives. But given that we envisage a mid-term review, this allows us more stability, but also more flexibility. Both are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the structure, there will be more emphasis on themes and less on instruments. Cooperation projects, formerly known as collaborative research, will be more focused on industry needs and will therefore be more supportive of growth. I hope that you will all appreciate this new approach. There will be a strong focus on ideas, with actions concerning frontier research in the context of the European Research Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘people’ part of FP7 will strengthen the existing and well-appreciated mobility actions under Marie Curie. The ‘capacities’ part will deal with infrastructures, SMEs, regions, the research potential of all Member States, as well as science, society and international cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the management of the funds, which are to double, I am fully aware of the challenges ahead. But with their simplification and rationalisation on the one hand, and modernised management as well as externalisation of some of the activities – such as the European Research Council, SMEs and the mobility actions – on the other, we are prepared to rise to this challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the Locatelli report itself, a report that will make a significant contribution to the success of the forthcoming framework programme, allow me, firstly, to express my sincere gratitude for all the support you have given until now for the proposed doubling of funds for FP7. This is fully in line with the Commission’s proposal for the next financial perspective and firmly defends the proposal to set the EU budget above 1% of GDP. Let me make a personal comment here. I really appreciate this support. It is crucial. Together we have a real chance to start changing the structure of the European budget in favour of more growth- and competitiveness-orientated actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial perspective debate will thus be the moment of truth for the European Union. It will be then, and not later, that we must demonstrate that we are ready to address the challenges ahead of us fully. We should not miss this opportunity to prove that we are ready to invest in the future rather than look to the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, you rightly ask for simpler and clearer administrative procedures in order to improve efficiency and reduce the costs for participants, in particular SMEs and small actors. I have underlined the importance of simplification on several occasions, starting with the hearing last autumn, and I did not forget the message I was given two weeks ago in this plenary. We have been told since FP4 that there will be simplification. It is time to do something. The Commission will do all in its power to achieve this and I look to Parliament to support it.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, let me thank you for your support for the swift establishment of the European Research Council: I am using your exact wording. Let me underline two fundamental principles that I intend to strive for vigorously: autonomy and scientific excellence. I wish to assure you of my determination to guarantee this autonomy. Furthermore, autonomy will be the best guarantor of the highest level of scientific excellence, which should be the sole criterion for the selection of the proposed projects. What is more, the ERC needs to support at European level research in all scientific fields, from specific industry-driven research to social and human sciences. The EU needs high-level researchers in all research fields in order to grow and compete with the USA, Japan and other strong parties. In terms of the structure of the ERC, our current view is that an executive agency would be best placed to support such a council. Let me assure you that we are examining all possible options, including those based on a more mid-term approach, and will inform you of our decision in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, the report is fully aligned with the Commission’s intention in recommending a substantial increase of funding for Marie Curie actions and welcoming the Commission’s proposal for European technology platforms and joint technology initiatives. As you know, this will be an important part of the forthcoming proposal for the framework programme. Europe is weak in public and private partnerships, and this needs to be sorted out. Focusing the efforts of all the stakeholders around a few well-identified key technologies is of the utmost importance, and this is what we intend to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the report puts great emphasis on the regional dimension, by underlining the need for the participation of regions in order to increase investment in research and innovation. Let me add that the Structural Funds and European research policy share common objectives. The link between the regional dimension and FP7 is important in the sense that they should be mutually reinforcing. Parliament is fully justified in drawing attention to this requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that I consider the Locatelli report a strong encouragement to my current preparations for the FP7 proposal. I am happy to note that on all key issues we very much follow the same line. This is an encouraging signal for the legislative process ahead of us. I trust you will send a strong signal tomorrow in your vote on the Locatelli report. We need this strong signal. It would, and should, be widely heard.

<p class="contents">Research, which President Barroso has indicated to be one of the priorities of the revamped Lisbon Strategy, is the tool on which the knowledge-based society is founded. It is not just a strategic step but also an essential one for closing Europe’s competitive gap in terms of innovation and, consequently, economic growth, employment and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to catch up quickly, we have to invest greater resources, to the extent of doubling the funds available compared with the previous Framework Programme. Even then, that is not enough. In the context of the most ambitious objective, which is to provide the scientific community, industry and European society in general with the tools needed to strengthen and improve our research capacity, we need above all to use the funds better, with the aim of creating real centres of excellence that can attract our researchers, who are all too often forced to emigrate abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">Consolidating the European Research Area is important not only for our researchers and for their mobility, but also to attract investment, both public and private, European and non-European. That is a target that can be met primarily by directing resources towards traditionally strategic sectors for the European Union. With this report, Parliament hopes for thematic continuity with the sixth Framework Programme and an enhanced spirit of transnational collaboration. The European Research Area must be the catalyst for private investment.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, great emphasis has been placed on small and medium-sized enterprises, precisely because of the particular industrial structure of our economy, which is predominantly characterised by an industrial fabric made up of productive areas that are unable to develop independent research projects. It therefore becomes essential to strengthen the dialogue that SMEs or associations of SMEs have with our universities and with the many European centres of excellence. Such a dialogue should lead to a more effective and fruitful transfer of technology.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal to set up a European Research Council must be seen in this context. I support its aims, which include guiding basic research and guaranteeing not only its suitability but also its quality. I have, however, expressed my doubts both about the potential overlap with the remit of other European coordination bodies and institutes and about the funds to be devoted to setting up and running the Council itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I shall finish by issuing the common challenge that research must become a real beacon of European competitiveness, a real action plan. If Europe does not make this choice, it runs the risk of being regarded as a weary, lumbering colossus, a continent that gets bogged down in talk and all too often bends its strategies to the individual interests of its Member States. I hope that this will be the decade of research, just as the last one was the decade of the single market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is hard to believe that she has only just arrived here in Parliament. The Group of the Party of European Socialists strongly supports the report and appreciates the work that has been done so well.</p>
<p class="contents">Research is the key to implementing the Lisbon objectives. We do not have natural resources here in Europe: our natural resources are in our heads. That is why this is a crucial area.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a problem with basic research and technology platforms, collaborations and especially financing. It is sensible to finance European research when it produces genuine European added value. Accordingly, it is hardly appropriate to finance very small individual projects in the field of basic research. Instead, support should go to projects that are too broad, complex or risky for one single Member State to fund.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the technology platforms, the concept of cooperation with regard to new industrial research, the assumption that the private sector would put up two-thirds of the costs is not realistic in all cases. Private agencies and institutions will hardly be prepared to provide such a large share of the funding of organisations that have their sights on the distant future and technological revolution. Examples might be hydrotechnology and nanotechnology. In the countries that are the Union’s major competitors, such as the United States of America and Japan, the share of public funding in these sectors is as much as 80%. We cannot possibly afford to give the competitive edge to outsiders in this way. We therefore have to be ready, if necessary, to use public funds to subsidise projects which may only be of potential benefit in the long term. Consequently, the rules governing State aid should be reformed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, research and development must be made to benefit the SME sector. Small and medium-sized enterprises do not have the funds for sophisticated research. They are flexible, however, and can use the results of research and development work, and this might be the key to solving our unemployment problem. There are 19 million SMEs and we have 16 million unemployed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, of course I also thank my colleague Mrs Locatelli for her hard work and collaboration.</p>
<p class="contents">This document highlights three key elements in the forthcoming Framework Programme for research, which are the European Research Council, the new priority thematic areas for research and the technological platforms. Parliament thus recognises that basic research has an importance that transcends the Member States and requires a response at EU level, within the rationale of the Lisbon Strategy. Hence we need to promote a genuine development policy through specific research instruments, such as technology platforms, financed above all by private enterprise but also by public institutions, Member States, regions and local bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Research thus becomes an instrument, a core around which a general political proposal for economic and social development can be brought to maturity, alongside a monetary policy which is already in place. Private enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized ones, will thus be able to meet their research needs in order to become more competitive. These are strong, decisive new factors that will give European companies fresh impetus, supporting new sectors and innovation while also ensuring that conventional productive activities have a competitive edge.</p>
<p class="contents">By setting out these guidelines, Parliament is stating that it does not want to stand idly by and watch the deindustrialisation of Europe take place, and it is spurring the Commission and the Council to commit themselves more specifically to developing European research. This programme is the core of a development policy. It is pointless to think of changing the Stability Pact, which would just be a palliative measure, while the real cure is an economic and social development policy at European Union level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I understand that petrol prices have now reached USD 55 per barrel. According to the financial analysts, petrol prices are not likely to fall in the foreseeable future, which constitutes a threat to the economy. We need some pretty rapid responses. We need dynamic responses which will produce results within the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group considers that these responses need to be contained within the Seventh Framework Programme in terms of investment in energy efficiency and in renewable energy sources, both of which will help resolve the situation in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned about the priority being given to the hazardous energy sources of the past, such as nuclear energy, which are vulnerable to abuse by international terrorists. We are also uneasy about the massive investment focus on energy programmes like Fusion ITER, which will not provide a single kilowatt of energy in the next 40 or 50 years according to the scientists involved.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like the Seventh Framework Programme to improve quality of life and the social environment, public health, preventative health, to benefit sustainable urban transport and promote the social science required to provide a balanced overview of research and of the society we are creating. With this in mind, Commissioner Potočnik, we are glad that you recognise the importance of social science.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that in the future – and this is my last point – research will be very important, if that science is open and accessible to the general public and the scientific community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is like a shopping list. The European Parliament is prepared to buy the results of scientific research in these areas. My main message is this: our group is in favour of guaranteeing additional resources for scientific research work. The Commission’s proposal for additional funds under the Seventh Framework Programme is justified. There are fields which it would be beneficial to finance from common funds. It should not be just business that derives the benefit. There are many socio-political and ethical reasons for supporting basic research at university research institutes, which is unconstrained by the interests of big business and the war industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Joint research projects can be promoted in the best way if they lead to results for which the English would use the word ‘serendipity’. It means to find something by chance that you did not even know you were looking for. The right conditions for serendipity<span class="italic"> </span>have to be created, and those conditions are established best in international collaboration. The best example of a benefit jointly achieved through a jointly financed project is fusion energy research under the ITER project. That is an area in which the Greens confuse fission with fusion. No EU country would be prepared to undertake research into fusion alone. When there is collaboration, projects start up that would not otherwise. All participants can reap the benefits that result. In the case of ITER, the beneficiaries include countries not in the EU. We have to use the research framework programme to create the right conditions for ‘serendipity’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The principle of subsidiarity is not something merely to be referred to in formal contexts, but rather should direct all our activities. We all know that that is not how it works at all in Brussels and Strasbourg. Political power is continually being shifted from the Member States to the institutions of the EU. There are two driving forces behind this: the desire for a superstate, and a lack of political principle. A majority of the EU’s elected representatives and of its civil servants want to create a new superstate. For them, the principle of subsidiarity is not a guiding principle but rather an obstacle in their way. Lack of political principle means that the Members of the House are more often than not prepared to cooperate with decisions that are to their liking, even when it is obvious that these are strictly national matters. The end is allowed to justify the means.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Locatelli’s report, too, entirely neglects the principle of subsidiarity. It does not put the question of what the EU should do when the Member States are unable to deal with a task themselves. The question it asks is how the EU can drive forward the research that an establishment wishes to have. How are we to deal with small and medium-sized enterprises’ need for research? How are we to awaken the interest of young people and women in science? How are we to strengthen the links between research and industry? How are we to increase total research funding to three per cent of GDP? And so on. These are all things that the Member States themselves are better equipped to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">Finland and Sweden now already set aside three percent of GDP for research. If other countries want to set aside the same amount, they only have to do so. The research funds will not increase as a result of the Member States sending it via EU authorities. On the contrary, this will result in increased bureaucracy and additional costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Competition between countries to find good solutions to this type of problem normally results in faster progress than central management at higher levels. In the research world, this is known as institutional competition. Competition is important not just between enterprises, but also between institutions. Competition between countries in various areas is one of the most important explanations for the great progress made by the Western world in recent centuries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Locatelli should therefore have asked the question: what can EU institutions do for research in Europe that the countries cannot do themselves? There are many such questions. They fall into five categories, these being basic research, free movement of research staff within the EU, large-scale research in areas such as nuclear energy and space technology, infrastructure for research networks and common security issues for the EU. The EU’s research policy should be limited to areas such as these, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity that is fêted in banquet speeches and draft constitutions. EU research policy is on the wrong track. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means that a great deal of care should be taken when drafting resolutions on science and technology. I should like to thank Mrs Locatelli and express my admiration for the effort she has put into preparing this report.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that, on its own, the announcement that a European Research Area is to be established will change little. The announcement will need to be backed up by appropriate funding for science and research, which means that no cuts should be made to the EU budget. The funds will also need to be used in a rational manner, and this is a point I should particularly like to stress. There are a number of issues I would like to touch upon very briefly. Firstly, effective methods must be developed to identify talented young people and appropriate systems put in place to provide scholarships. Secondly, accreditation standards for Higher Education institutions ought to be implemented according to the guidelines adopted in Berlin in 2003. Thirdly, a simpler system should be introduced for awarding academic promotion, whilst ensuring that the criteria for granting grades and qualifications continue to be transparent. Fourthly, more extensive use should be made of private sector funding, both for applied and basic scientific research and for research in the humanities, as mentioned by the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Locatelli said that life would be made easier for small and medium-sized enterprises. That may well be the case, but how can measures aimed at introducing software patents be reconciled with such a statement? Someone once said that knowledge is power, yet given the state of the world today, it must unfortunately be added that ignorance does not mean a lack of power.

First of all, I must congratulate Mrs Locatelli on her excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems of the European Union’s competitiveness in relation to the new Asian giants, the drain of our best brains to horizons richer in opportunities, the difficulty in meeting the Lisbon targets in terms of employment, development and innovation, and the issues of energy supply and health – these are the subjects that fill our time in Parliament and on which the future of our economy and our social system depends. These topics are closely linked to each other, and their common denominator is the development of scientific and technological research.</p>
<p class="contents">Research actually means knowledge, employment and economic development, as well as a better quality of life. It is therefore essential to obtain a substantial increase in funding to make it our strong point. Research, however, is not just a matter of funds, instruments and infrastructure. Research is done by people. Any economic effort made by the European Union and the Member States will in fact be in vain without suitable human capital.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not alluding to quality, since our universities and our graduates are already the best in the world, but I am referring to jobs: opportunities to do research and to earn money. Paradoxically, while science and technology play an ever more decisive role in today’s global economy, young people are avoiding science subjects because of the limited job opportunities. As a result, many graduates are forced to leave Europe or to spend years living on grants that are totally inadequate for the current cost of living, while they wait for a stroke of luck.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years the number of young Europeans who choose to carry on studying science subjects has declined. European universities do not have enough staff in their science departments to replace lecturers reaching the end of their careers, and fewer and fewer science and technology graduates find work as researchers compared with their main competitors in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We must at all costs reverse this trend, bring our young people into contact with science from an early age, stimulate their curiosity and above all enable not just the fortunate few but all those who deserve it to use their knowledge to serve Europe, by offering them work, careers and decent salaries in exchange. If we want a future based on knowledge, we have to invest in our young people in order to train them and, above all, not to lose them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too should like to start by expressing my wholehearted thanks to the rapporteur. Not only has Mrs Locatelli presented a fine report, but she has also demonstrated a willingness to compromise. A unanimous vote by this House tomorrow in favour of this report will both send out a signal and provide our Research Commissioner with the backing he needs.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning we spent a long time discussing the Lisbon Strategy. The only way to make Europe competitive is to invest huge amounts in research and development in the future. The Commissioner frequently refers to a ‘moment of truth’, and I believe that he is right to do so. We must ensure that the research budget is large enough for us to achieve the Lisbon goal at long last. This will not be enough on its own, of course. Public funding is a good thing, but we must also encourage private industry and the private sector to invest heavily in research and development, and to make money available for this purpose. I was delighted to hear you say earlier this evening that you are planning to issue guidelines particularly aimed at improving cooperation between research and industry in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make one more point, one that I have raised in this House on a number of occasions, and to which you too have referred. It is pointless to increase funding unless this money is then spent on research in a truly efficient manner. It is also crucial that the correct lessons be learned from the Sixth Research Framework Programme, from the Marimon report and from the criticism that has been levelled at the Framework Programme. Programmes must be made simpler, more streamlined and less bureaucratic, and I would call on the Commission and on Parliament to do their homework on this matter. We must ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises are also successfully involved in European research. I look forward to the rest of the debate.</p>

<p class="contents">I think that our debates over the past few months on the shape of European research policy and the objectives of the Seventh Framework Programme have been very productive, and I am sure they will have lasting benefits for science in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We have clarified key objectives with a view to achieving longer-term European Union targets; we have also analysed the instruments available for meeting those objectives, and proposed some new instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to meet the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and the Barcelona Summit and to reflect the recommendations made in the Kok Report, the Seventh Framework Programme must include a clear and proportionate increase in resources within the scope of the new financial perspectives. In order to achieve these objectives and create a European Research Area we also need good coordination both at Member State and Union level to ensure that funding and activities are complementary and generate a multiplier effect.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to comply with the Lisbon Strategy, we also need to support excellent basic research as the driving force for technological development, growth and competitiveness. This entails making Europe more attractive to top researchers, from young and women researchers to highly-qualified scientists currently working abroad, and encouraging SME participation in every single thematic priority, in transnational collaborations, and in technology programmes through proportionate project funding and instruments tailored to their needs. We are all agreed on this much – for which I again congratulate the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Other slightly more controversial issues will require further discussion. For example, research priorities, which we believe should be extended to include other new priorities with major economic potential for the European Union, such as scientific research. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The entire resolution on the Lisbon Strategy that has been adopted by Parliament today with a very large majority – and which we in the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have put a lot of work into – is based on the knowledge that sustainable development is based not just on economic growth, but also on social cohesion and environmental considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">The research policy and the report that we are discussing today will help build sustainable economic growth through investment in excellence and technology platforms and will help create the social cohesion that we desire – for example between men and women, from a gender perspective, as well as between different regions. Moreover, they will help generate the funds needed for our security system and ensure that we can continue working on technological development that is driven by the environment.</p>

The reality is that if we do not invest in research and, more importantly, involve the business community in that research process, we will not upscale our economies.</p>
<p class="contents">The pan-Union coordination adds a clear value. So it is all the sadder that the Commission proposals – which I broadly support – are under threat from my own UK Government, with its insistence on cuts to the EU budget and with little detail on where the axe should fall.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the broad thrust of this report and would add my words of congratulation to the rapporteur, with the rest of the House. I have some reservations about the details and I hope that our amendments will strengthen the report tomorrow.</p>

I should therefore like to praise the efforts of all those involved, and especially Mrs Locatelli, as she has done a very good job of drafting her report, and this is why I intend to vote in favour of it during tomorrow’s vote. A further reason why I intend to do so is that the draft report is quite clear on the significance of space exploration and the role space research will play for the future Europe, or, more accurately, for its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my belief that backing must also be given to projects such as the Galileo or GMS Programme, because I know from my own experience that projects of this kind give rise to opportunities in a number of other related fields, and offer the chance of hundreds, if not thousands, of new jobs. The ITER programme should also provide such backing for the energy industry, as mentioned by my colleague.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw a comparison to conclude my speech. It may well be that we are on the threshold of decisions similar to those once taken by the Spanish kings when they decided whether or not to support Christopher Columbus’ project. In modern terms, his voyage was a scientific experiment to confirm that the Earth was round, yet it not only changed the map of the world – it influenced everything that has happened in the world since then.

<p class="contents">Firstly, how effective can measures at European level be if it is the Member States that have powers and responsibilities in the relevant fields? In the report, it is proposed that activities that take place in the Member States should be co-funded with EU resources. This proposal would provide EU funding for students, research institutes and facilities, as well as communication with the public about the importance of science; areas that the Member States promote many times more effectively, and so there are more effective ways of spending European funds in this area; consider how much of the red-tape and administrative burden could be cut in international cooperation and in the mobility of researchers.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission communication on research policy guidelines lacks, to my mind, a strategic statement about research that is punishable in the Member States. Surely it is unacceptable for Community funds to be used to support such research? Research involving the destruction of human embryos springs to mind. If Community funding <span class="italic">is</span> used for such contentious research, this means that Member States will not benefit equally from the European research initiatives. Can the Commissioner express a view on this?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the ambition of the European institutions to make their mark in the field of research does not necessarily lead to more and better research in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should also welcome the fact that these issues are being discussed in relation to the Lisbon Strategy. Yet I am afraid that this report will share the fate of the Lisbon Strategy, which failed to distinguish between economic and social goals. Consequently neither is achieved, even though both are crucial. We are all aware that the economy is flagging and that unemployment is on the rise. Yet scientific goals are unfortunately conflated with ideological goals in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it entirely incomprehensible that the report notes on three occasions that there is a particular need to promote the role of women in science. It is self-evident that professorships should be granted to those who have the qualifications needed to hold such positions. We can do our best to ensure that women gain these qualifications, but it is nonsensical to promote them by force if they do not. Furthermore, I must say that I was surprised to see that research on animals was the only area of scientific research mentioned in any detail. I am a great lover of animals, but this report is not the right place to deal with this issue to the exclusion of all others. I also find it unacceptable that ceilings are to be imposed on expenditure by the poorer countries. Poorer countries have traditionally benefited from the achievements of richer countries, and this should continue to be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a French proverb that says that ‘he who grasps at too much loses everything’. If too many goals are set, too little will be achieved, and we should take a clear and detailed look at this issue. Many thanks, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means that faster economic growth based on science and new technologies is needed in the European Union. A coherent research policy should be formulated to provide support for the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">The report sets out the key areas of research for the EU as a whole. In view of the huge differences in the research potential of the various Member States and regions, particular attention should be paid to poor countries and regions, which lack the necessary resources but which have enormous human potential, in order to ensure cohesion between Member States and harmonised development.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain groups have expressed the view that there is no point investing in science if the necessary resources are lacking, and steps should be taken to prove this view wrong. Special attention should therefore be paid to research policy in the countries and regions in question, in order to prevent the gap in intellectual ability and development opportunities widening instead of narrowing. The guidelines for EU research policy included in the report’s motion for a resolution highlight the key areas for the development of research. This is entirely correct, but the development of science and technology throughout the EU should not be neglected. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all aware that we face a huge challenge in achieving the Lisbon goals. Our aim is to spend 3% of GDP on research, of which two thirds should come from the private sector. Put quite simply, if we demand this of industry, we should be aware that 50% of gross national income is generated by small and medium-sized enterprises. Even more importantly, two thirds of all employees work for small and medium-sized enterprises, or in other words for companies with fewer than 250 employees.</p>
<p class="contents">The Sixth Framework Programme set a goal of 15%, which figure the major horizontal projects did not, in the end, achieve, even though the energy programmes were heavily oversubscribed. I should therefore like to ask Commissioner Potočnik to consider ways in which research activities can be prioritised in the field of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is also necessary to determine at long last where the responsibility lies for efficiency and evaluation in the field of academic research. Research generates know-how and values, and this process must be measured and evaluated. Greater transparency is needed, and I would specifically ask that an <span class="italic">e</span>-Research Programme be established. We must ask ourselves how the simplest possible methods can be made available on the Internet for submitting applications to research programmes and providing funding for these programmes, and how we can ensure that the Commission also complies with the Late Payment Directive, which is applied in all other fields, but which the Commission has so far refused to accept.</p>

Research in the Seventh Framework Programme is important to us, certainly in the framework of the Lisbon Strategy. A good working relationship between research centres and industry is essential. I should like to make three points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it goes without saying that science should be autonomous, but that is not the same as being noncommittal. Scientific priorities are not a pastime for scientists; they must be issue-driven. I fully share Mr Hammerstein Mintz’s view that the public research agenda must be guided by social problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the unnecessary red –tape, which has been mentioned before. It turned out too often that the chances of success in the Sixth Framework Programme were very minimal compared to the efforts that were being made. Certainly for small businesses and small institutions, it is a well-nigh impossible task to complete the paperwork and answer the questions. That is why we would ask for a two-step procedure, consisting of a brief description of the research project, followed by a selection procedure, so that the participants in the second round have reasonable certainty that their proposal will actually be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would urge you to combine forces. European research funds continue to be only a fraction of national budgets. Article 169 offers the opportunity of combining forces. We have already gathered experience in the area of clinical tests for developmental diseases. We can use this experience to carry out joint research into such things as the introduction of a low-CO2 economy, into hydrogen cells, and into improving energy efficiency. A bundling of forces is also what society wants, and that is what we have to work towards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to focus on just one of these priorities, which in all probability will be absent from tomorrow’s report, namely defence research. After consulting the rest of my group, I have withdrawn an amendment on this matter in view of the confusion it could have caused, <span class="italic">inter alia</span> in connection with the Council. Why have I decided to speak out in favour of defence research? Our future Constitution provides for the development of the common foreign and security policy, which means that we will need to carry out research in this field, some of which will be secret. We must therefore be capable of copying the Americans by adopting a ‘black box’ approach to individual projects. Yet we should step up transatlantic research cooperation in other fields where research lies in the interests of humanity as a whole. This will give rise to a research dialogue between equals that would be appropriate in the case of a number of other countries, as well as the USA. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to point out that the current Sixth Framework Programme is the first in the European Union’s history to have been drafted and implemented within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy. There is another new feature to the Seventh Framework Programme, however, as it has been drafted and will be implemented after enlargement, with the involvement of the ten new Member States. How can we use this enlargement to ensure that our science policy is effective and to implement the Lisbon Strategy, and what can the ten new Member States offer the EU as a whole? They can offer it three things, namely a highly-educated population whose knowledge is often wasted, lower research costs and a thirst for success after half a century of isolation from Western civilisation and development opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we make the most of these opportunities, and how can we improve the way we exploit the research potential of the new Member States? I have five proposals. Excellence should not be the only criterion used when determining funding priorities, and additional criteria should be considered in order to make it possible for research centres in the new Member States to be integrated. These centres have had limited opportunities to implement European research programmes in the past. Secondly, we are counting on smaller projects being approved, as our research centres are also smaller. Thirdly, procedures need to be made simpler. The new Member States are inexperienced in dealing with complicated procedures, and they find them a major burden. We are hoping that clear and transparent rules will be put in place to govern investment in research infrastructures in the new Member States. Fifthly and finally, integration also means a common market and full freedom of movement for persons and services. Until this is achieved, we will not be able to boost research or succeed with the Lisbon Strategy. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not a choice; it has become a necessity. Europe has already lost its pole position to Japan and America. The aim that we are promoting, that is, 3% of GDP within a period of five years, is ambitious. We are also stating that two-thirds of that funding is to come from the private sector – let us hope. But as with everything in life, it all depends on money. This is where the general discussion on the budget comes in.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must realise that if we do not invest, the rich will become less rich and the poor will become poorer. The policy of investment in research and development is not a matter of choice. As I said, it has become a necessity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish in my intervention to emphasise and confine myself to one amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, we all know that we are living in an age of uncertainty and increased mass risks, especially environmental risks. The recent catastrophic tsunami in South-East Asia should have convinced even the most incredulous among us that there is an immediate and urgent need to fortify our continent against this sort of catastrophic natural disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">The scientists who study these phenomena come from many and varied sectors: seismologists, geologists, oceanologists, forestry experts and others. I believe that it is very important for the safety and welfare of European citizens for strong momentum to be given to these areas of research, especially as they appear to be converging continuously and increasingly into a risk and crisis management model.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I think that we should make special reference to natural dangers. An amendment to this effect has been tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats; I refer to Amendment 8. An additional reason for this, no less important, is its link with the Lisbon Strategy. In fact, both the Commission communication on the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and the resolution we adopted today emphasise the importance of eco-innovation to sustainable development in Europe. This means that, in the revised Lisbon Strategy, environmental technologies and high environmental standards will hold an important position.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the amendment we are proposing does not simply set out yet another thematic priority; it aims to make express reference to a research sector which comes within the philosophy of the revised Lisbon Strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is something that has been highlighted on a number of occasions, as has the fact that our aim is to increase funding.</p>
<p class="contents">I should merely like to point out that the road ahead of us is a rocky one. Delighted though I am that Parliament and the Commission are agreed on the need for increased funding, I really am extremely concerned at the signals coming out of the Member States. As an example, I find it intolerable that the current government of Germany, my own country, has put forward official proposals to the finance ministers aimed at reducing the amount of money the EU spends each year on research in the European Union. This is the precise opposite of what we ought to be doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we agree, then, on the need to aim for increased funding, I do believe that we should nevertheless bear in mind that a great deal of money still comes from the national research budgets, and that the Member States should increase these. At present 5% of funding comes from the Commission and 95% from the national research budgets. Although the Commission may one day provide 10% of funding and the Member States 90%, this ratio is unlikely to change substantially.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows that European added value must be our main concern when selecting our priorities, and I would therefore ask you to vote in favour of Amendment 7 by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. I should, however, like to make it clear that I do not share the view of Mr Lundgren, who is unfortunately no longer present, that the measures taken to date have barely provided any European added value. There is a great deal for Europe to do; having studied medicine myself, I know that in this field alone European cooperation is needed, in particular in the fight against rare diseases and children’s diseases, and indeed to achieve any kind of success. We must therefore provide greater support for such cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The document before us starts from the recognition of that, and sees correctly that the EU needs the utmost effort in this field, so that it can stand its ground against ever fiercer competition. Because of this I hold this report as something to be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, however, in the short time at my disposal, to bring a worry to your attention. Perhaps not too far from this topic is a quote from Albert Einstein I would like to draw on: ‘there are limits to knowledge, but imagination is infinite.’ Now, when the Lisbon Strategy is on the day’s agenda, perhaps it is not churlish to put the question: what guarantee is there that the ambitious targets formulated in this document will not remain parts of the empire of imagination, rather than serving as a basis for true knowledge? From the Hungarian perspective, for example, the ratio of 3% of GDP, though appealing, still seems very distant today, and this is sure to be the case with most of the recently acceded countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my belief that there is only one way to dispel this worry. We must stimulate and support research and development in the new and the old Member States, each in line with their own and different situations. This is so that there should not be a situation where we keep funding for R&amp;D as something to be decided by each country’s level of economic development. This would preserve the existing differences and lead to a weakening of cohesion. It is also true that the Union is only as strong as the strengths and efforts of its Member States. If in this area there are no states or regions falling behind, only then will we be able to say that Europe has successfully faced one of the greatest challenges of the new century. And if that will be true, then it was worthwhile preparing this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Cooperation is the principal one: continuity in this area, a thematic approach but one that is based much more on industrial needs than in the past. The second is ideas: we want to create champions of thoughts and new-frontier ideas in the European Union, because we really need them. The third is people: there is no research without people and how good we will be in delivering and really creating depends a lot on how well we do in research. The fourth is capacities. All these areas need to be addressed in a proper way so that we will get the best for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything must be done with more flexible instruments than we have had until now. They must be transparent, understandable, simple and, I hope, efficient and based on a kind of upgraded continuity leading on from the Sixth Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you mentioned ethical questions. It is true that they are not easy. They are important in science because people’s perception of science is certainly crucial to the success of the issue we are discussing. These are definitely not easy questions that can be addressed in a limited amount of time, but I agree that we need to address them in an open and tolerant way. I also think that a special role should be given to the existing ethics committee, which discusses and considers all sides of these important and sometimes difficult questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Small and medium-sized enterprises have been mentioned. They are extremely important because the European Union has a different structure to some of our competitors. As a proportion we have more of them, and they should and could participate more in research than they do today.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding enlargement and capacities, I would make two comments. One is that enlargement happened first in the areas of science and research, as scientists from the new Member States were able to participate earlier in these areas than in any others. On the other hand, it is more difficult to have full integration in these areas than, for example, in the political field, where people can sit at a table and discuss vexing questions. So we need to do all we can to address that matter, but we also have to be clear that proper funds are required if it is to be addressed properly. I believe that science and research funds should primarily address the question of excellence. We need to have a highly competitive European Union. Only if the Union as a whole is competitive can we rely on all the issues connected with questions of solidarity being properly addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">I have listened carefully to all your comments. You have my promise that I will do my best. Your support is good for me, although it does not make my task easier. We all have high expectations, and rightly so, because the future of the European Union also depends greatly on the future development of the scientific and research field.</p>
