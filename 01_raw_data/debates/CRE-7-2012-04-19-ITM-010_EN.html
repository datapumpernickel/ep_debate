<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morten Bødskov, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA) </span>Madam President, Commissioner Kallas, honourable Members, thank you for the opportunity to participate in the debate on the European Convention on Human Rights. As you know, in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon, the EU is to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights. The EU’s accession to the Convention is a very important step for the protection of human rights in the EU. This matter is therefore particularly important to the EU itself, as well as being important to the Danish Presidency of the Council. I know that it is clearly very important to Parliament, too. This is clear from the declaration of 30 May 2010, in which Parliament expresses its clear support for the EU’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. I am personally very pleased that Parliament has once again emphasised the importance of this matter by placing it on the agenda for the sitting here today. I would therefore like to thank you once again for the opportunity to discuss this matter, and I obviously look forward to hearing your views on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to start by telling you a little about the status of the work on this matter in the Council. Since the Commission received the mandate in June 2010 to negotiate, on behalf of the EU, with the Member States of the Council of Europe concerning the EU’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, it has been working very hard to ensure that progress is made in this matter. As you know, the Commission has negotiated with the Member States of the Council of Europe on behalf of the EU. In this regard, the Commission has been in constant contact with the relevant working group in the Council with a view to ensuring that a common position can be reached among the EU Member States with regard to the draft accession agreement. The negotiations between the Member States of the Council of Europe and the Commission were provisionally concluded in June last year with a draft accession treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the necessary agreement within the Council on the draft accession agreement was lacking. Therefore, work has been going on intensively since October last year to produce a compromise proposal. The concerns expressed by individual Member States related to the competence of the International Court of Human Rights in cases relating to the common foreign and security policy. Another requirement that was the subject of in-depth discussions was the EU Member States’ voting rights in the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers. The compromise also contains a number of clarifications in respect of the fact that the EU is not a state, but an international organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Council’s decision on the EU’s accession is to be taken unanimously. In the Presidency, therefore, we have worked hard to draw up a compromise in which we have been able to find solutions for the concerns that have been raised. With a view to maintaining progress in these very difficult negotiations, the Presidency decided to place the matter on the agenda at the Council meeting here next week. It is our hope that, in the light of the political discussions in the Council – that is to say those taking place next week – it will be possible to resume negotiations with the other Member States of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to work during the Danish Presidency to ensure that there is progress in the negotiations on the draft agreement, and in this regard we will, of course, do our utmost to achieve a common EU position on the text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In July 2010 the Commission opened technical negotiations on behalf of the Union with a group of fourteen experts appointed by the Steering Committee for Human Rights of the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft accession agreement is based on five basic principles: accession will be neutral regarding the powers of the Union and its institutions; accession will preserve, as much as possible, the existing convention system; accession will be neutral regarding Member States’ obligations under the Convention; accession will not affect the autonomous interpretation of Union law; and accession will be on an equal footing with other parties to the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement introduces a ‘co-respondent mechanism’ to apply where Member States implement Union law and where the applicant before the European Court of Human Rights challenges that law. In such cases the Union may participate in proceedings before the Court. If the Court concludes that there is a violation of the Convention, the Union will be bound by the judgment and must change its law.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement also ensures the possibility of a prior involvement of the Court of Justice, allowing the European Court of Human Rights to assess the compatibility with the relevant Convention rights of the provision of Union law which is called into question.</p>
<p class="contents">The institutional rules of the accession agreement are very important. Firstly, a judge will be elected with respect to the Union at the European Court of Human Rights, with the same status and duties as the judges elected with respect to any other party to the European Convention of Human Rights. Secondly, the European Parliament will have the right to participate in electing all 48 European Court of Human Rights judges. Thirdly, the EU will have a voting right in the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in Convention-related matters.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be adequate safeguards to ensure that the Committee of Ministers can effectively exercise its supervisory functions under the Convention, even when the EU and all Member States are obliged to vote in a coordinated manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally there will be a flat-rate Union financial contribution to the expenditure related to the functioning of the Convention, borne by the budget of the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The results reached so far come very close to the position expressed by the European Parliament in its own-initiative report of 18 May 2010. Since September 2011, the draft accession agreement has been discussed by the special committee designated by the Council. Some Member States have requested changes to the draft agreement. Good progress has been made in solving the issues raised and I would like to thank the Polish and Danish Presidency for their work on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that the amendments envisaged preserve the overall architecture and balance of the draft accession agreement. The Commission, as the EU negotiator, will base itself on the orientations suggested by the special committee when negotiating the amendments to the draft agreement with the non-EU states of the Council of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must specifically thank the Commission for regularly informing the MEPs about the state of the negotiations, and for allowing us to express our opinions and make comments.</p>
<p class="contents">The criteria of added value and effective assertion of rights must be applied when making any necessary compromises as well. However, I would also advise against fuelling excessively high expectations among European citizens. Accurate information on what this accession will actually be about is crucial, since failure to provide it would similarly undermine trust in EU institutions. While seeking compromises in connection with the accession agreement we should still not forget about the flipside, that is, the reform of the Strasbourg Court which has been emphasised since the beginning, and about its necessity. I trust that the Brighton Conference which was opened yesterday will provide reassuring answers for both sides in respect of any problems arising in connection with this reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The accession can only be successful if it truly reinforces existing European institutions, as well as Member State judicial systems, and all existing means by which these facilitate the assertion of citizens’ rights, not just in theory but also in everyday practice, and if we consider this agreement as such a means. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Leading on from this double thank you, I have to ask the following questions: why are we debating this matter in Parliament now? Why have we included it on the agenda? The answer is because we are deeply concerned by the deadlock at the heart of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an agreement that benefits EU citizens and, when it is adopted, it will afford them a higher level of protection of their rights than the EU itself currently guarantees them, yet EU citizens are the ones who have limited ability to defend their rights because the process is making no progress at the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Many negotiations have taken place between the Commission and the Council and the fundamental issues have been thrashed out. Two remain, as the President of the Council has indicated: the issue relating to foreign policy and the other issue that has been referred to regarding the effectiveness of the common position of EU members in decisions under the convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us face the problems with a mind to resolving them, however, let us not use them as a means of deadlock so that the process makes no progress. It is more than two years since the Treaty of Lisbon was signed and it is time that it was applied to this point also. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am hoping for an open and public debate on the EU’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights and on the so-called reform of the European Court of Human Rights, as the two issues are closely connected.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the EU’s accession to the European Convention, today we are in a situation of being in violation of the Treaties, particularly of Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which makes accession binding. The file is stuck in the Council due to the objections of the UK Government and partially of the French Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the so-called reform of the European Court of Human Rights, the UK Chairmanship of the Council of Europe is now – as we speak – holding a conference in Brighton, where several proposals are being discussed. I cannot stress enough how worried the European Court of Human Rights, the NGOs and human rights defenders are about some of these proposals. If accepted, these counter-reforms would severely diminish the rights of the victims of human rights violations.</p>
<p class="contents">More than 60 MEPs have signed an appeal on these issues, which I have promoted in the European Parliament, and many national MPs have done the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also express concern about the fact that these two issues are being dealt with without any transparency. The Council examines session documents that are not accessible to the public and do not even appear on the registers. This is a violation of the Regulation on Access to Documents.</p>
<p class="contents">The Brighton Conference drafts are accessible only because of leaks. Neither the public nor NGOs have been consulted. This is not the way we should deal with fundamental rights issues in Europe. I think it is time for the Commission and the Council to make this clear to all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to the UK Government to change its position and to let the EU apply the Treaty of Lisbon obligations, and I trust that my colleagues here will do their utmost to ensure that this happens.</p>

Some of these judges have no judicial training – they are political appointees. Why should these foreign, unelected and unaccountable judges be able to decide on matters of our own national security and our criminal justice system in the United Kingdom?

Undoubtedly, some of the planned reforms will strengthen the European human rights apparatus. Thus, it would be very welcome if those states that do not implement the judgments made in Strasbourg were more consistently punished in future. However, the progress outlined in the draft Brighton Declarations cannot conceal the fact that the United Kingdom is attempting to use its Presidency of the Council of Europe to substantially weaken the influence of the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">If – as planned – national courts will be given greater discretionary powers in connection with the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights, this runs the risk of undermining case law. Within Europe, different human rights standards could prevail. In addition, the planned reforms are clearly seeking to give citizens fewer opportunities to take cases to the European judges individually.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States are therefore called on to take a firm stance against this attempt at weakening the position of the Court, which will also result in a weakening of the whole human rights apparatus. Moreover, the European Union has committed itself in the Treaty of Lisbon to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights. Mr Bødskov mentioned that Parliament called for this actually to be implemented two years ago. It is therefore high time that we set about doing this in a very decisive way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was designed to protect fundamental human rights – the right to life, the right not to be tortured and the right to a fair trial. The Convention has noble aims and my group supports them, but we do not support the conduct of the European Court of Human Rights. Far too often the Court departs from its role of upholding fundamental rights and interferes with how democratic governments govern themselves. The recent decision to prevent the UK deporting Abu Qatada is one example. The demand of the Court that prisoners be given the right to vote is another.</p>
<p class="contents">Such judicial activism brings the Court into disrepute. It must be reformed, with most cases dealt with at national level and national courts given a greater margin of appreciation for making decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is committed to protecting human rights, but we do not believe that the EU should sign the Convention. Given that every Member State is already a signatory to the Convention, what benefit is there in the EU signing as well? It seems to me that the chief beneficiary is the EU itself, which gets to use its new legal identity granted by the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an opportunity for the EU to strut on the world stage and make very little difference to human rights – and what difference it does make will be negative. We will have two courts adjudicating within the EU, introducing competing jurisdictions which will only complicate matters. It also raises the issue of the EU itself having a role in any future reform of the Court of Human Rights. Involving the EU is a recipe for ensuring that no further reforms ever take place. I would urge colleagues here, and in Westminster, to think again before granting the EU more influence that we will live to regret.</p>

The benefits of such accession are that it will close the gap in human rights protection in the EU, as applicants will for the first time be able to bring a complaint before the Strasbourg court directly against the EU for alleged violation of Convention rights (which you should applaud), enable the EU to defend itself directly before the Strasbourg court, create legal certainty, and so on.</p>

The coalition government replied that they were obligated to accede to it and that in any case it would not change the existing situation regarding the UK.</p>
<p class="contents">EU accession to the ECHR is required under Article 6(2) of the Treaty of Lisbon. Mr Cameron could have given the decision to the British people by honouring his promise, indeed his cast-iron guarantee, of a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">He reneged on that promise after the Labour Government had ratified the Treaty. But treaties are ratified by acts of parliament, and any act can be repealed. If he had wanted to, he could have repealed the ratification act and then submitted Lisbon to a referendum of the people. Instead he betrayed his promise and his guarantee turned out to be worthless.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the government tells us not to worry anyway, because it makes no difference. But this is not true either. Britain could not opt out of or reform the Convention even if it wanted to, because we are bound by the Treaty of Lisbon. As usual the Tories betrayed Britain. Now they are in denial about the consequences of that betrayal. They had a solution and they did not use it.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the only solution is the one advocated by the UK Independence Party, which is for Britain to leave the European Union.</p>

Perhaps if you took a little time to think about it, you would not want the United Kingdom to be a member of the United Nations in future, either.

<p class="contents">The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, was born of the horrors of the Second World War to protect citizens, including when States and their governments get out of control. The countries of Western Europe were particularly affected. They have long been pioneers in this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, for several years, particularly since the attacks of 11 September 2001, respect for human rights in these countries has been in retreat. The verdicts of the European Court of Human Rights are there to show this. A growing number of Member States are convicted there on an increasingly regular basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s adhesion to the ECHR is now a symbol and we can clearly see that a number of Member States see Article 6 of the treaty as nothing more than a piece of paper. There are debates on what falls under European law and what falls under national laws and there is the issue of compatibility between the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and the ECHR, with some Member States seeking to reintroduce the reservations that they put into the Charter in the debates on accession to the ECHR, even though all Member States are parties to the Convention. What then is the problem?</p>
<p class="contents">There are those who say that, if the European Union were to join, this must not call into question the powers of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Having met the current judges many times, I cannot see what the problem is. The CJEU has included fundamental rights in its case law since 1970. The integration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Treaty and membership of the ECHR will make it easier for it to enforce respect for the fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Others worry about the powers of the ECHR beyond the territory of the European Union. That, however, is its nature and I would go so far as to say that these issues should be raised when Article 6 is integrated. In reality, the problem is that some Member States are trying to call into question the very content of the ECHR and the role of the European Court, and to do so they will try anything.</p>
<p class="contents">On these benches, there are some of us who defend a universal, indivisible concept of human rights. We reject double standards where human rights are involved. We believe that, to be credible in the struggles that it hopes to undertake at the international level to promote human rights, the European Union and its Member States must start by getting their own houses in order.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, EU accession to the ECHR is a symbol and all of the current prevarication is symptomatic of the drift of some Member States in this area. These Member States who forever shirk the duties as regards human rights. It is not the Court that has changed, despite what I have heard, it is the respect for human rights by the Member States.</p>

<p class="contents">I am here to tell you that there is one deeply flawed law that, above all others, damages British life and puts our lives in daily peril. It is the Human Rights Act. It is a rotten law that Britain loathes.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights are worth protecting, and I am vocal in the protection of human rights. The Human Rights Act, however, was created in Britain by the Labour Party, which, despite warnings, was reckless as to the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this EU-backed – and soon to be enshrined – law is now routinely and regularly abused by those who can cause havoc in civil society. Terrorists, criminals and illegal immigrants, with and without cats.</p>
<p class="contents">More often than not, judges who apply human rights law decide that those rights trump those of the majority: decent, honest, hard-working British people. The case of Abu Qatada is attracting media attention. The human rights law, by allowing Abu Qatada to dodge deportation to Jordan, has inflamed the British public. Simply, the Court of Human Rights leaves Britain unable to defend its interests.</p>
<p class="contents">In a recent survey, 75% of British people said they think that the act should be scrapped altogether. It is the Treaty of Lisbon that allows the EU to sign up to the ECHR, which further imprisons the British public, who never got a chance to say no through a referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me tell you, the British public are shouting aloud: ‘No to the human rights law! Release us from these shackles’.</p>

They have not gone along with the public or the elected government. That has to be wrong. In a democracy it should be the will of the people that reigns supreme.</p>
<p class="contents">If you talk about human rights, Mr Cashman, I want to point out one Labour politician, our High Representative Catherine Ashton – a Labour Party card-carrying member – who refused to do anything about the corrective rape of lesbians in Palestine.

The committee that I am honoured to chair has worked quickly and I would like to thank Mr Guerrero Salom and my fellow Members who worked on this. A contact group has also been set up between the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly and Parliament and I think this link should be reprised once again. We now call upon Mr Bødskov and Mr Kallas to pick up the pace and come to conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not hide the problems, which are not structural – since you might say that we have already resolved those – but certainly substantial and procedural. They, however, can only be resolved in practice, once the Union has acceded to the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the substance, there is one particular issue. As far as I know, this is the only case in the world in which a declaration, a legally binding act on human rights, applies to a territory where there is another legal act – the Convention of the Council of Europe – which contains the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This certainly poses a few problems, especially in procedural terms: who will have the last word?</p>
<p class="contents">That is the major problem, but we cannot resolve it now. Meanwhile, let us get on with accession. The solution will emerge from case law, probably using the principle that the European Court of Human Rights applies, whereby all other remedies must already have been attempted before recourse may be made to the Court. In this sense, the European Court of Human Rights could be the court of last instance, even after the Court of Justice of the European Union.</p>

To start with, according to the Treaty of Lisbon, a mandate under the Treaty on European Union is not a suggestion – far from it. It indicates a mandate to conclude the accession of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights. We also have a negotiating mandate that binds the Commission, to ensure that the execution of that mandate becomes reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons are very good. The European Convention on Human Rights, as interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights, which guarantees it, has contributed fundamentally to a Europe-wide judicial culture that has improved the lives of millions of Europeans who have seen their demands met before the European Court of Human Rights when they had exhausted the judicial resorts available to them under their own legal systems to guarantee their fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that this presents difficulties. We have been negotiating for some time now. The time has come for us to carry out this mandate and bring about its fulfilment.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg should enter into discussion and this will undoubtedly be a complex issue. What is clear, however, is that this enhances the legal protection of European citizens’ rights and it is time, therefore, for the Commission to make every effort to resolve with the Council the obstacles that some Member States continue to put in the way so that European citizens finally see this mandate that is in the Treaty of Lisbon fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">There is not a single country that has not seen an improvement in the attention to human rights that are guaranteed by the Convention as a consequence of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and, insofar as there is an injustice that it has been possible to put right through the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, it follows that the mandate makes perfect sense and it is time to bring it to fulfilment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It now falls on all 27 Member States to bring that agreement to a successful conclusion – not least Britain, which used to be the pioneer and the advocate of fundamental rights but unfortunately now seems to be suffering from acute withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<p class="contents">The British are specifically demanding unanimity for Council decisions concerning the ECHR post-accession. This distorts the logic of the Treaty of Lisbon and weakens the role of the Commission in representing the Union inside the Committee of Ministers. Could I remind the Presidency of the Council that this Parliament must also grant its consent to the final agreement? I can assure you from the ALDE Group that if we are not entirely satisfied that the internal rules follow the logic of Lisbon, it is extremely improbable that we will be inclined to grant our consent.</p>

This is about accession to the European Convention, the European Court, rights for all within the European Union. It closes the gap which is there at the moment and which leaves EU legislation and actions outside the European Court of Human Rights. So the purpose of the Convention, the purpose of the Court, is that it requires governments to meet certain standards – just as many of us want it to require the EU to meet certain standards and to call governments and other authorities to account.</p>
<p class="contents">Now there may be judgments from the European Court that we do not like. There are some that I am not too happy about. But the whole point is that it is not a pick-and-mix. You do not simply take those judgments that you like and put them into practice, while with others you simply say: I did not like the judges who made that. If you do not like the judges, argue for the reform and training of the judges, and then when you are making those arguments, also remember that a lot of court findings are against countries such as Russia and Ukraine, the very places we have heard complaints about.</p>
<p class="contents">This is about the rule of law, within a human rights context; about how governments and other authorities respond to being held to account. That is something I want to see brought in for the European Union, not left outside.</p>

<p class="contents">The violation of the letter – as many speakers have pointed out – is the European Union’s boycott on acceding to the European Convention on Human Rights, which is clearly set out in the Treaty of Lisbon and is a essential complement to the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The violation of the Treaty’s spirit, meanwhile, relates to the project currently under discussion in Brighton to amend the Convention, reducing citizens’ opportunities to appeal to an unacceptable extent.</p>
<p class="contents">These are truly paradoxical proposals, not only because Protocol 14 has already significantly reformed the Court’s procedures, but also because, in more general terms, solving the problem of too many pending cases by reducing opportunities to appeal is like combating an epidemic by closing hospitals.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is not too many appeals, it is too many violations of rights in Europe and that is what governments should be worrying about. Parliament is therefore very concerned and highly vigilant. We think a reaction that prevents the kind of reforms under discussion in Brighton is of the utmost importance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I certainly speak for all Liberal Democrat ministers, parliamentarians and members. I think I have sufficiently refuted the suggestion by British Labour MEP Richard Howitt, whom I see in his place, in a debate two days ago that LibDems were somehow apologists for Tory hostility to the Strasbourg Convention and Court. But before I leave the intra-British debate, for which I apologise to other colleagues, I must remind Labour MEPs that their former Justice Secretary Jack Straw utterly failed to stand up for human rights, and once called the Human Rights Act a ‘villain’s charter’ in remarkably similar terms to Ms Sinclaire, whom Mr Cashman rightly criticised.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to express complete British LibDem support for strengthening the European Court of Human Rights. The Brighton Conference currently taking place – and I share Renate Weber’s dismay at the lack of transparency – must enhance the ability of the Court to issue robust and authoritative judgments. But the Court does need streamlining and relieving of its huge backlog. National courts must do the heavy lifting of implementation of the Convention, and that is why the Convention needs to be incorporated and remain incorporated in domestic law, as in the UK Human Rights Act.</p>
<p class="contents">The Strasbourg Court must not be a routine court of appeal, but an effective and respected watchdog for 47 states and the EU. I hope and trust that will be the result of the Brighton Conference tomorrow.</p>

<p class="contents">But I have sat in courts dealing with European Arrest Warrant cases, and one in particular where the European Convention was invoked because it was almost certain that, in being extradited to Greece, suspects would be held in the Korydallos Prison, where it was 100% guaranteed that their human rights were going to be violated. But the government prosecutor put the point that since Greece was a signatory of the Convention on Human Rights it could not be deemed to be in breach of it. The appeal court agreed and the suspects were extradited.</p>

<p class="contents">By the way, the Strasbourg court did not prevent the extradition of Abu Hamza to the United States.

I would like to make it clear that this represents a new option of legal remedy for those European citizens who can also take their complaints related to violations of fundamental rights within the EU before the Strasbourg Court, so there is added value. Or more precisely, they could take them before the Court if it were not for some Member States obstructing this accession. We have heard in this debate which countries these are, and which one is foremost among them. This gives just as much cause for concern as some of the proposals regarding the reform of the Strasbourg Court that have been put forward at the Brighton Conference taking place right now. These include the new admissibility criterion, according to which a case would not be admissible to the Court of Human Rights if it has already been investigated by a Member State court. This would severely hamper the enforcement of human rights and the right of access to legal remedy, in particular for the citizens of countries where the judiciary cannot be considered independent.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to see guarantees that easing the excessive workload of the Court of Human Rights will not be to the detriment of human rights guarantees. We are all aware of the excessive workload, but the solution should not be sought in the direction the Brighton Conference has taken. We hope that this decision will not be the final one. What we can support has indeed also been stated here today, namely the provision of sufficient funding for the Court of Human Rights. We must wait and see the effects of the reforms undertaken over the recent years, and we must improve the application of the Convention on Human Rights and the quality of legislation in the Member States. We must achieve the commitment of European governments to implementing the decisions of the Court of Human Rights. If we succeed in all this, then the excessive burden of the Strasbourg Court will surely ease, and it will continue to be able to fulfil its duty which we find so important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the accession of the European Union as an organisation of regional groupings, it is subject to certain conditions, which are different from those defined for the accession of countries. The wording of the Treaty of Lisbon states that legislative acts of the Union apply in their effects on individuals only by means of implementing or applicable national measures. With the Union’s accession to the Convention, it would therefore be necessary to transfer the specific characteristics of the judicial system of the Union within the framework of the principles governing the functioning of the control mechanisms established by the Convention, particularly the principle of subsidiarity. Given the complexity and scope of the changes resulting from accession to the Convention, I therefore respect the attitude of those EU Member States which are not subject to populist pressures in favour of the excessive acceleration of this challenging process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union is based solely on absolute fundamental universal human rights. Yes, the Court needs reform – nobody argues with that – but the way to reform it is by being engaged with it. In order to have coherence between national law and EU law, it is vital that the EU accedes to the European Convention on Human Rights. And of course, judges never deliver judgments which please politicians all of the time, and that is good. Because they are there to give a voice to people who are often trampled underfoot.</p>
<p class="contents">I want you to imagine that there are citizens living in one country of the European Union who are not allowed to serve in the military, who do not have a right to a family life, who have no succession of housing when their partner dies, whose very sexuality is criminalised, for whom there is not an equal age of consent, nor equal treatment. Their only recourse – those citizens living in the United Kingdom, those lesbians and gay men and bisexuals – was to the European Court of Human Rights, and because of their judgments, they were afforded – eventually – universality and respect for their human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Now if a government does not agree with the judgments, it also has the opportunity to derogate from the judgment, for it to go back to the national parliament. That is exactly what happened when the judgment was given that the ban on prisoners being forbidden the right to vote was in contravention. The UK Parliament merely had to note that and continue with what it was doing. But you know what? The world is a better place if somewhere like the European Court of Human Rights makes the lives of politicians more difficult. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have also heard the official Tories’ so-called spokesperson on human rights state in this debate that they are obstructing, and a Conservative MP from the South-West has stated that the party did not endorse the position statement produced by its own Foreign Office officials.</p>
<p class="contents">Apologies should be made. Liberal Democrats should apologise for their vote and admit the truth, Conservatives should apologise to their own civil servants, and I do apologise. I apologise to the Council for my country’s shameful breaking of its Treaty obligations, and to all those who fought in the Second World War to create freedoms for our continent, freedoms which their children seem prepared to diminish. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is important because, firstly, we are talking about basic EU values and a legal obligation that appears, as already mentioned, in the Treaty on European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic crisis is putting the European social model at risk. All we need is to show signs of weakness in the sphere of human rights as well, a sphere which is a symbol of European identity.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we are in the process of and on the point of reducing levels of protection for rights that seemed clear and that are now threatened by the process of reforming the European Court of Human Rights. Limiting citizens’ access to the European Court is bad news. For it to happen as a result of the penny-pinching attitude of some States strikes me as serious and troubling and for it to be done in a secretive way seems like a mockery at a time when we are celebrating the implementation of the European citizens’ initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I ask the Council and the Commission: what are the real reasons why France and the UK are blocking this Agreement? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If that is incorrect, his facts are wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no inside knowledge of what my Prime Minister, or any other minister of the Conservative Party-led coalition, does in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the subject, as we speak it is true that Ken Clark, our UK Justice Secretary, is indeed trying to convince 46 other ministerial colleagues in the Council of Europe to reform the intrusive powers of the European Court of Human Rights which, in my view, now seems far too often to champion the phoney human rights of the criminal or terrorist rather than protect the victims. This court is deeply unpopular and, in my view, brings the whole of the European Union into disrepute because, in the eyes of the Daily Mail readership, the European Court of Human Rights and the Council of Europe are one and the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no faith in the judges of the court, some of whom, as political appointees, have no judicial training. Presumably the Russian judge, who was politically appointed, takes his instructions from the Kremlin.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course my party defends fundamental civil and political rights for all of our citizens, but the accession of the EU to the Convention and to the Court of Human Rights will result in competing jurisdictions between the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights, cause extra costs and give extra powers to unelected and unaccountable judges. So I, like most Conservative MEPs, support the view that we should be doing everything we can to prevent this happening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In several EU countries and signatories to the Convention, people can be and are jailed for heretical opinions on academic subjects and for political opinions that are disapproved of by the political class. Perhaps the worst example is in the country in which we are now: France. France only this year passed a law prescribing a description of the killing of Armenians in 1915, backed up by criminal penalties. Furthermore people have been prosecuted for the careless use of a word such as ‘debate’ to refer to a historical event.

I remember that this was a topical issue 15 years ago in my own country, where the European Convention on Human Rights was already regarded very positively as a means of improving the judiciary and the legal system.</p>
<p class="contents">By acceding to the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Union will integrate itself into a pan-European legal space of fundamental rights protection. It will enhance its credibility by entering into a commitment under international public law to respect fundamental rights. The EU will submit itself to external judicial control. So accession also means that the EU reaffirms the pivotal role played by the Convention system in the protection of human rights in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has already been done on the way to accession. But some important steps still remain. Negotiations with the 20 non-EU States of the Council of Europe must be completed. Once a final text has been agreed, the Commission will submit the draft agreement to the Court of Justice for an opinion on its compatibility with the Treaties. After a positive opinion, the Council will have to adopt – by unanimity – decisions on the signature and conclusion of the agreement. The latter decision requires the consent of the European Parliament and will only enter into force if Member States approve.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding international law, the accession agreement has to be ratified by the 47 current state parties to the European Convention of Human Rights and approved by the Union. The EU legislature will also have to adopt internal legal rules to properly implement accession internally.</p>
<p class="contents">I am absolutely confident that the parties involved are fully aware that the governments and parliaments of all Member States made a promise to citizens, and gave a strong signal to the outside world, when they committed the Union to accede to the Convention. I can also add that the Commission agrees that it is necessary to work intensely on the internal rules from now on. Solutions must be workable in practice and respect the institutional order of the Union as defined by the Treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is safe to say that it has been a very spirited debate, which covered a lot of ground and, amongst other things, helped to provide an interesting insight into British domestic policy. These are good impressions that I will, of course, take back with me. I would like to try and draw out a couple of key impressions from the debate that I will take back to the Council. These must inevitably be the following:</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, I took note of the fact that Parliament feels very strongly about the EU’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. I have to say that the debate today has clearly and unambiguously confirmed that. That is a general attitude, which, as President-in-Office of the Council, I obviously completely understand, and in the Council we have taken note of both your concerns and your views. I would also like to emphasise that I, of course, share the view that we are under obligation to bring about the EU’s accession and that this should happen as quickly as possible. I therefore also look forward to the political discussions at the Council meeting next week. On the basis of these discussions, it is our hope that it will be possible to resume negotiations with the other Member States of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to say once again that we will continue to work during the Danish Presidency to ensure that there is progress in the negotiations on the draft agreement, and in this regard we will, of course, do our utmost to achieve a common EU position on the text. We will, of course, also do our utmost to ensure that this text lives up to Parliament’s expectations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I applaud that it will make a major contribution to strengthening the system of human rights throughout Europe, by providing citizens with increased protection, including in relation to EU legislation. This is not a new subject for debate. However, the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon provide the legal instruments required to implement this project. The European Union is founded on respect for human rights and already has a ‘Charter of Fundamental Rights’. However, a specialised judicial mechanism is also required to ensure that they are promoted and protected fully. The Court of Justice of the European Union does not have specific powers regarding this matter, whereas the court in Strasbourg has lengthy and varied practical experience in this area. While there has been informal consultation until now between both courts, which has ensured consistent practice, this accession will require technical harmonisation, both with regard to the status of the two courts and to the details of cooperation on jurisdiction. This will also entail significant benefits for Member States, providing legal clarity and avoiding potential conflicts of jurisdiction or discrepancies between the provisions of the ECHR and EU legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A particularly worrying aspect of this issue is the fact that these Member States, which oppose or are seeking to delay the EU’s accession to the ECHR, are also seeking a reform of the European Court of Human Rights, which would restrict citizens’ opportunities to approach the Court directly and would undermine this Court’s competence and powers. The European Parliament is already receiving letters from concerned citizens, for whom, even in our more democratic European countries of the 21st century, the opportunity to approach the ECHR directly and the fact that this Court’s judgements are binding on Member States, often represent the last chance for them to redress injustice done to them. Clearly we must welcome reforms that would speed up actions before the ECHR. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The UK relationship with the ECHR has always been independent from our membership to the EU. The debate in Parliament was juxtaposed with negotations at the Brighton Conference to reform the ECHR under the chairmanship of the UK. There is growing discontent that domestic sovereignty over controversial issues such as the deportation of known terrorists and the lawfulness of banning convicted criminals from voting is undermined by unelected judges in the ECHR who are not accountable to the public and override the British legal system with questionable judgments. EU accession to the ECHR would result in a tighter net forming around UK membership to the Convention from which Britain would struggle to be freed. It is essential that the EU and the ECHR remain entirely independent. However I fear the proposed accession of the EU to the ECHR is designed to pave the way for Brussels to become the primary legal power in Europe in association with the European Courts of Human Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Treaty of Lisbon provides for the EU’s accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR).</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the question that faces us today is less technical than political. The reservations expressed by certain Member States, especially as regards the Court in Strasbourg, call into question the very principle of the separation of powers. How can we expect Europe’s citizens to defend their fundamental rights if we impose the principle of subsidiarity and restrictive accessibility criteria on the European Court of Human Rights and considerations of ‘margins of appreciation’ on these judgments?</p>
<p class="contents">For me a strong Court, accessible to the citizens, defending their rights with the utmost neutrality, is essential if democracy is to work properly in Europe. I therefore call on the Commission and the Member States to show a strong political will to continue to ensure the integrity and the authority of the Court at Strasbourg and finally to make the Union’s process of accession to the ECHR accessible to civil society’s stakeholders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, there is absolutely no need for it, as we already have the fundamental rights judicature of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Individuals can submit an action for annulment in order to get legal acts reviewed. In addition, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we have had our own Charter of Fundamental Rights. Secondly – and I find this highly problematic – the EU will be subjecting itself to external scrutiny by the European Court of Human Rights. Quite apart from conflicts of competence with the Court of Justice of the European Union, how can we have a situation where our legal acts are reviewed by judges from Azerbaijan, Ukraine or Turkey? These countries are not in the EU, nor do they have much time for human rights. Lastly, with regard to content, do we really need a court that wants to nullify the Dublin II Agreement? Do we need a court that we have to fight right to the highest level in order to obtain permission to hang up crucifixes, a court that wanted to prohibit Italy from refusing to accept the influx of migrants into Lampedusa, or one that wanted to prohibit England from refusing to accept marriages of convenience? This far left judicature of the European Court of Human Rights is something we do not need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
