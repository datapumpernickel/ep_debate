<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Lancker (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, may I first and foremost thank my fellow MEPs and the Commissioner together with her offices for the excellent cooperation we have had in the framework of this report, and may I also seize this opportunity to express my gratitude for the contributions of the many NGOs, the social partners and the experts who have helped us formulate an ambitious social agenda on behalf of Parliament? It has often been said that ‘social policy is a productive factor’ and this is true, for a society with greater social cohesion is also a society which performs better. However, social policy does have its own rights; social policy must ensure that inequalities are ironed out, that social cohesion is promoted and that people’s quality of life improves. That is why this social agenda deserves a far more prominent position in European policy. The Lisbon Summit has given us the opportunity to lend more weight to social policy; we must seize that opportunity with both hands.</p>
<p class="contents">It was with great delight that I noted that the Commission and the French Presidency want an ambitious social agenda, and I believe, Commissioner and Minister, that we fully endorse the objectives. I would therefore like to use some of my speaking time in this debate to draw attention to a number of points which Parliament would like to reinforce in this agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point relates to the strategy. The social agenda must raise the profile of social Europe among the citizens, and that is why we are in favour of defining measures, priorities and instruments more clearly and with greater intensity. We must be able to see where progress is being made; this progress must be measurable and the social agenda must be afforded centre stage in the political discussion at European level. Hence our urgent appeal in favour of the introduction of a social scoreboard, similar to the one already in use in the internal market, which details specific measures, expiry dates and deadlines. Hence also our appeal in favour of having social agenda discussions at the annual spring Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to comment on the instruments. It is true that the open method of coordination, which has been used within the sphere of employment since Luxembourg, has brought fantastic new openings in fields which up to now were only subject to national authority. We would therefore ask that this method be reinforced and, as has now been decided by the Social Affairs Council, be applied to combat social exclusion and poverty. Furthermore, we would very much like to see this major innovative method being deployed to make progress in the modernisation strategy of social security.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is a ‘but’. Stressing the importance of this open coordination method does not mean that this method should replace social legislation, because we should lay down social rights in Europe too. We should have the nerve to formulate minimum social standards and draft social legislation which is necessary within the framework of a European internal market. Parliament is of the opinion that the Commission could lend a helping hand here and there, for example where individual and collective workers’ rights are concerned, where more security in new types of labour are concerned, or as regards the protection of health and safety relating to new risks in the workplace. In addition, we believe it is crucial that the European Commission should take the initiative to re-establish the link with the ’92 recommendations in order to underpin Member States’ efforts to guarantee everyone a right to a reasonable income. Only then can the fight against poverty be efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, the social partners are major players when it comes to achieving this agenda, where lifelong learning is concerned for example, or the organisation of working time, and new forms of work, and we hope that they will be prepared to negotiate within all these fields. However, Commissioner, if this consultation does not yield results, we would also ask the Commission to use its right of initiative to the full.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish off by making two remarks: as we endeavour to achieve the European social agenda it is essential to establish a close partnership, a partnership between institutions, and with the Member States, the social partners, but also with the many social NGOs which have a key role to play in the realisation of the agenda. Here too, we believe that Europe should take an initiative as a matter of urgency to reinforce this dialogue with the citizens and the dialogue with the social NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, social policy should not be viewed in isolation. It must be integrated into all EU policies. I am convinced that Europe will only be social when a social dimension is added to economic policy, competition policy, external policy and the entire enlargement discussion. I hope, Minister, that the Council will be inspired by Parliament’s expectations, and I hope that you will succeed in setting ambitious goals at the Nice Summit for a European social agenda, which we can work towards together over the next couple of years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This issue provoked intense interest in societies throughout Europe and the Committee on Women’s Rights has taken account in its opinion of the numerous proposals submitted by representatives of non-governmental organisations and civil society in general.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the application of the social agenda will also give citizens the chance to feel part of social Europe and to realise that the European Union intends to take positive action to continue raising standards of living, rather than merely guaranteeing minimum levels. We must also make it clear that the social agenda does not intend to impose a uniform social policy but to coordinate, support and boost national policies within a global framework for social development, because all Member States currently face common challenges, which are naturally of varying proportions, such as working structures, discrimination against citizens and gender inequalities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Women’s Rights maintains that the social agenda must focus all its ideas and projects on the qualitative and quantitative participation in the job market of women of all ages and from all social strata and must therefore give priority to any measures which facilitate access to work, the sort of measures to which we refer in our opinion, such as making it easier to combine professional and family lives or other personal choices.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Women’s Rights also proposes that women of all ages and from all social strata should have access to an adequate and dignified system of social protection. We must not forget that women are always the first to fall prey to economic crises and the majority of our fellow citizens who are victims of social exclusion and poverty are women.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion we also support dialogue and cooperation with civil society, especially women’s organisations in countries preparing to join the European family, because here too we must anticipate uniform development which follows in the footsteps and adopts the rationale of the rest of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am very pleased to be able to join you today for this important debate on the social agenda. I must also say, however, that Elisabeth Guigou, the current Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, would have liked to have been able to attend proceedings here today in this institution to which she too once belonged and of which she has fond memories, but her new duties require her to be in Paris today, and she has therefore asked me to present her apologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Before going any further, I should like to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker, and also the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and its chairman, on the report before us today, which testifies to the dynamism and great commitment of the European Parliament to the social agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the informal Employment and Social Policy Council on 8 July this year in Paris, the Presidency invited all the parties involved, the European Parliament, of course, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, both sides of industry, NGOs, Council groups and committees, to submit their proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament resolution on the social agenda which you are just about to adopt is a very ambitious contribution to our joint exercise. The French Presidency welcomes this text and undertakes to give it the utmost consideration in its work.</p>
<p class="contents">The informal Council meeting of 8 July, the September conference you hosted with the European Commission and Mr Briet’s tour of European capitals have provided the basis for a number of comments. Let me first make some general remarks on the social agenda before covering the various individual areas, in a very succinct way, as befits my allotted speaking time.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to be able to say that all the parties involved in social policy declared themselves in favour of drawing up an agenda. This is intended to give a higher profile to European social policy and to make it more effective, preparing the European Union for the great shared challenges ahead. The agenda is, of course, in keeping with the Lisbon conclusions and the future European Charter of Fundamental Rights, to ensure its effective implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">The areas of action listed in the Commission communication were also subject to general agreement. What debates there were did not involve the type of action to be undertaken but rather the method to be adopted in order to achieve the desired objectives. I think we should adopt a pragmatic approach and overcome any misguidedly ideological rifts.</p>
<p class="contents">As you very rightly suggest in your resolution, thereby supporting the approach proposed by the European Commission, we shall continue to use the entire range of Community instruments available to us: social dialogue, legislation, coordination, convergence, information exchange and financing under Community funds and programmes. It is up to us to determine, area by area and action by action, the instruments best suited to the desired objective.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to my more specific comments, and firstly my comments on employment. Employment is our number one priority, even if the method of tackling the problem is in flux. Here, too, I noted unanimity on the need to continue and step up the Luxembourg process in the context of the objectives established at the European Council in Lisbon. We are particularly committed to the objective of full employment. It is a false line of reasoning to set quantity off against quality, and Lisbon clearly established a twofold objective: more jobs and better jobs. It falls to us to define the key elements which characterise the quality of employment and then to be capable of measuring these.</p>
<p class="contents">You will understand, given my duties as a member of the French Government, that I was particularly pleased to note that, firstly, the equality of men and women and, secondly, lifelong training are two areas which receive very strong support. The subject of lifelong training was unanimously adopted as a priority area. Moreover, the two sides of industry have undertaken to work on this subject. We must encourage them to do so in order to ensure that initiatives by collective agreement are taken to promote lifelong training within the shortest possible time limits. Let me, at this point, remind you that there will be a European Seminar on this subject on 4 and 5 December in Biarritz, which I shall be chairing.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the equality of men and women, many Member States stressed the need for a better coordination of work and family life, particular with regard to childcare. This is indeed a key issue, both in order to increase employment rates and in order to make progress towards male-female equality.</p>
<p class="contents">To stay on this subject a moment, your resolution provides for many measures in favour of women and contains one general objective to include the concept of male-female equality in all the sectors covered by the agenda. I support this method.</p>
<p class="contents">As you perhaps know, on 27 October, I am holding a ministerial symposium on this subject. I already spoke at length on this subject at your plenary sitting on October 5. I shall not therefore remind you of the three areas that we shall be debating at this meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">You will shortly be discussing the fifth gender equality programme for 2001-2006. I should like to thank you most sincerely for responding to the Presidency’s invitation by working very quickly and very successfully, enabling us to adopt this most important programme, which proposes both an integrated approach and specific actions, on time. You can count on me to make every effort to complete the task successfully and to support the financial commitment of EUR 50 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in order to step up the integrated approach to equality, the Presidency was in favour of implementing this concept in a number of meetings of the Council of Ministers. This is something that will be done under the French Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The social agenda has many more objectives. Let me just mention the mobility of workers. Freedom of movement must be encouraged, while ensuring that career paths are safeguarded. I should also like to briefly point out our fight against insecurity and insecure employment. This must be dealt with better.</p>
<p class="contents">Both sides of industry pointed out the need for common definitions. I am thinking in particular of non-standard work. Plainly, a number of Community Directives on European works councils, transfers and mass redundancies, for example, need to be updated. I also noted a strong desire for definition of a genuine Community strategy on the working environment, particularly concerning health and safety. Existing directives must be simplified and adapted to technical progress, but practical proposals must also be made on emerging risks or dangerous jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say something about social protection. We all agree that we should pursue the strategy of cooperation in social protection, paying special attention, as we were urged at Lisbon, to the issue of pensioners.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Employment and Social Policy Council held on 17 October, a great deal of progress was made in the fight against exclusion by defining appropriate objectives for the fight against poverty and social exclusion, which will serve as a foundation for national action plans. The agenda could also give an opinion on the follow up to be given to the 1992 recommendation on minimum resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the next few weeks, the Presidency intends to draw up a general report on all these subjects, in the light of the contributions submitted to us. We should be able to successfully complete a document intended for the Heads of State and Government by the time of the Employment Council on 28 November. This document should express some real ambitions for the next five years. Quite clearly, the European Parliament will have made a significant contribution, and I thank you for this.</p>

I would like to warmly thank Mrs Van Lancker and Mrs Kratsa for the huge effort they have made in order to set down thoughts from within Parliament on paper. I would like to make two observations in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we used to debate the social action programme, and an action programme implies that something is done. We are now discussing the social agenda and this <span class="italic">could</span> mean that something is done, but not necessarily, and so this is one of the aspects which we need to continually bear in mind. We are dealing with a Socialist-inspired Council, so chances are that there will be a lot of talk and little action. I hope I will be proved wrong. What matters is that something is put on the agenda <span class="italic">and</span> that something is done. This is the aim of this report and we have tried to emphasise this in a number of amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are discussing social policy, as the rapporteur pointed out earlier. In our Group, we have always set great store by the social market economy as a basis for everything we do, also within the framework of the European Union. Fortunately, we have largely managed to bring about the common market. We have also managed to bring about a few things in the social sphere, but not everything, and this was because the Treaty of Amsterdam had not taken effect at the time; so, in this light, the social action programme or this social agenda is of particular significance. We need to try to list and identify the gaps left in the system, and at least put them on the agenda. The importance of drafting an agenda is that we can include items which we hope the Commission will develop further. A number of such points are included. It would have been very wrong on the part of this Parliament not to make any mention of these points, but I am aware that we have not yet solved all the problems related to these points. It is thus something which we are passing on to the Commission for further examination.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to the point of open coordination which I believe is crucial. In fact, I would also like to refer to the recommendation made by Mr Cocilovo, which admittedly is not being discussed here but which will be voted on later. In particular, his recommendation responds to Parliament’s observations on employment. This is why little mention is made of this in the present report. However, these two recommendations should actually be seen as one entity for the picture to be complete.</p>
<p class="contents">I think there are some problems left unsolved, but these will need to be addressed in the course of the votes on the amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have heard from some quarters that having read the report, they agree with the diagnosis but not with the prescription. I take the view that unless we follow this prescription then the prognosis is not good for the stated aim of the social agenda, which is to make sure that social policy has a full and equal place alongside employment and economic policy. This is the prescription we need to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Socialist Group there are many very important points in this report. For us the open coordination method is very important. We want to see it strengthened in relation to employment. We want to see it also applied to social exclusion and social protection. I am glad to hear what Nicole Perry had to say to us today in that respect. Open coordination seems to be regarded by many as a soft option and I have no doubt that is why it is being supported in certain quarters. It cannot be a soft option. We will insist at every possible opportunity that it has to entail indicators and benchmarks and proper peer-group review and that there should be a part for Parliament in that procedure. We also support social dialogue but we insist that the Commission should manage that procedure properly and that where negotiations fail we should have an expeditious introduction of legislation where necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 14 lists a number of points we think are important. I cannot go into them all in the time available but let me stress for us the importance of those paragraphs relating to the need to update the framework of legislation relating to restructuring. Again I was pleased to hear what Nicole Perry has said today. I have not heard similarly encouraging things so far from the Commission in relation to, for example, the need to update the European Works Council Directive, or relating to collective redundancies and transfers. We also, of course, place considerable emphasis upon the general framework relating to information and consultation to make sure that industrial change is managed with social responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jensen (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, as far as the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is concerned, it is crucial that the Europe of the future should also be a social Europe. The political task is therefore to find the best way of achieving that objective. For us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, it is important that decisions should be taken as close to the people as possible. This applies especially to labour market and social policy. At the Lisbon Summit this spring, the EU’s Heads of Government adopted a far-sighted vision for the development of a social Europe. Importance was attached to promoting the EU’s position in the knowledge society, as it was to open coordination in pursuit of common objectives, but with flexibility and freedom in the choice of resources. This was established as a leading principle.</p>
<p class="contents">In its communication, the Commission has found a framework for the social agenda which I think admirably reflects the spirit of the Lisbon Summit. In our view, open coordination is the correct route to go down if we are to secure a social Europe. There may be a need for legislation in some areas, but we have no need for a host of bureaucratic and constricting rules which bring European cooperation into discredit without producing real results. I also want to express my appreciation of the major effort which Mrs Van Lancker has put into drawing up the report. Her contribution has been very constructive, and if my Group is sceptical about a number of the main elements in her report, that is because we disagree politically, and that is, of course, understandable.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not therefore share the report’s predilection for legislation at EU level. There are a number of areas in which we feel that too much detail is gone into. I want to emphasise that, in the EU countries, we have different traditions and different problems in the areas of the labour market and social policy, and the decisions of the Lisbon Summit acknowledge this. The Commission’s proposal strikes a good balance. Technological development and new methods of organisation call, of course, for flexible cooperation in which we concentrate more on objectives and on achieving results and less upon rigid regulation. Open coordination of this kind is not necessarily devoid of obligation. Of course, it must be binding, but it must be constructed from the bottom up and not developed by us specifying a host of rules and quotas centrally. Specifically, open coordination must be open both in the choice of resources and in the way in which everyone concerned is involved. It is therefore important that more public interest be created for open coordination and that the latter should be focused on to a greater degree, whether it be in employment policy or with regard to the issue of social exclusion which we are now addressing and to which open coordination can also be applied. It should not be secretive. The process should be much better known, and it is here that I think Parliament has something to offer. It can make the process more transparent and give it more public focus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The apparently technical term ‘social agenda’ in fact covers the day-to-day realities experienced by our fellow citizens. We must both respond to the urgent situation and give practical shape to what has been called the notorious European ‘social model’.</p>
<p class="contents">We have no right to miss this deadline unless we intend to shatter the expectations of all the citizens and the collective movements they have formed, which are the groups most motivated to establish a European Union which is a community of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues to be discussed select themselves: we simply need to respond to the urgency of the situation and bring in legislation to match the declarations made at the Lisbon Summit. We must give the people of Europe the tools and the public policies they need in order to fashion their own place within Europe, in order to ensure that their fundamental rights, including social rights, are safeguarded.</p>
<p class="contents">The urgency of the social situation and the need to defend the European social model call for initiatives that aim to establish rights: the right to an income, the right to a wage, the right to decent pensions for all within the European Union. Implementing the ambitions for society declared in Lisbon calls for an effort on the part of the Community, an action plan to create jobs in services, especially those related to the information society. As far as that is concerned, the directive proposed in the report in order to guarantee the social protection of new forms of working is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to ensure quality in health, an improved social situation, and an improved environment for everyone – the third system – and tax and legislative measures are essential in order to ensure both the economic longevity and the visibility of this emerging economy of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">We support Anne Van Lancker and Mrs Péry when they propose to quickly adopt the 1998 directive on employee information and consultation and to revise the European Works Council Directive. The fundamental notion of the general interest ought, moreover, to spur us all to approve the proposal to include recitals relating to employment in the regulations and decisions on the mergers currently dictated by considerations of competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">These three examples intended to combat poverty, support the development of activities for job creation, social liaison and quality of life, and to improve employees’ rights, should harness the support of a Parliament that is anxious to propagate the dream of a Europe of the Citizens, although these same citizens currently all too often feel that Europe is a machine commercialising all human activity.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of amendments betray the terror of some of our fellow Members who get their erasers out as soon as they see the word ‘legislation’. Are they going to go and explain to the people of Europe that Parliament deems it necessary to vote through directives to protect investment and liberalise general interest services, but not to define and regulate what has been described here as the labour market? Such a rejection of legislation, moreover, leads to a plain rejection of negotiation. We even have one amendment that goes as far as proposing to eliminate the objective of concluding European collective agreements between the two sides of industry.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this area that we can, in our opinion, find the kind of old-fashioned ideas attributed to those who expect a brave new world to spring out of a free market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Begging has returned to our large towns after having disappeared from them as long ago as the immediate post-war years. Even the private charitable organisations and their soup kitchens appear to be needed again. I must therefore welcome the purpose of the Commission’s work and of Mrs Van Lancker’s report. Many of her proposals are extremely commendable and deserve our full support.</p>
<p class="contents">Genuine social initiatives cost a lot of money, a factor which I think is discussed far too little in the report. These resources must come mainly from the Member States. It is therefore the social authorities in each country upon whom demands must essentially be made. Governments must set aside more resources, more social workers must be appointed and more resources must be given to the voluntary social organisations. Otherwise, the result will be fine words without any practical content.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Van Lancker’s report presents the Commission and its legislation as the real engine of social work. I believe that the impetus must come from below and that it is a question of providing aid at a problem level. The Commission can obviously make an important contribution, but the social problems have their roots in local conditions and must be handled with great sensitivity for the practical conditions concerned. The Commission can help set a high standard, but it is social workers, the unions and voluntary activists we must pin our hopes on, and not officials in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would just add that I am not a co-author of Amendment No 35 as stated in the document with the amendments. On the contrary, I am very critical of the amendment. The name Figueiredo should be there instead of my own name. The Secretariat must have made a mistake, and I would ask for this to be corrected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This received fresh impetus at the Lisbon European Council meeting of the European Union leaders earlier this year. Key priorities in this agenda include the following: an increased role will be given to the social partners in terms of drafting EU directives and regulations. Employee relations will be improved. There will be continued European Union support for local job creation programmes. New EU mechanisms for mediation, arbitration and conciliation will be drafted. A new EU charter for small businesses will be put in place. There will be improved coordination of policy programmes in the area of the information society. And there will be a modernising of telecommunications services and Internet-related activities.</p>
<p class="contents">From an Irish perspective I would like to say to the Members of the House that one of the reasons why there has been such strong economic progress in our country is the fact that we have had a system of social partnership in place since 1987. This has meant that the government has worked closely with the trade unions and employee groups on a whole range of economic and social activities in an effort to secure broad agreement in matters such as pay and conditions for employees in Ireland. This has certainly helped to reduce industrial unrest in our country and has contributed to increased inward investment programmes from abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also welcome the commitment of this policy agenda to the modernisation of telecommunications services. The European Union must take advantage of the new and evolving technologies which are coming on stream at this time. I welcome the publication of the new framework programme of telecommunications regulations and directives which was published in July of this year by the Commission. Parliament is presently deliberating on seven different telecommunications regulations and is due to give an opinion on these matters before Christmas.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards e-commerce, it is fair to say that the United States of America had a head start on the European Union. However, the European Union is catching up fast and the implementation of a broad range of telecommunications directives and regulations would certainly assist in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to commend the Commissioner for consumer protection, Mr Byrne, for his efforts in trying to secure an agreement on how best to move forward on regulating a vast structure for e-commerce transactions now and for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed we spoke of a European Economic Community. The priority was given to setting up a common market, with the principle of the free movement of property, goods and capital, the establishment of rules governing competition between firms and state aid. Social policy served to mitigate the most damaging effects of economic policies. The provisions enshrined in the Treaty of Rome were confined to the principle of equal pay for men and women (Article 141) and the freedom of movement of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication and Mrs Van Lancker’s report have the merit of remedying this imbalance by acknowledging the interaction between social and economic policy and employment policy. Mrs Van Lancker’s report is an ambitious one. The rapporteur effectively asks the Commission to intensify the agenda, chiefly in the following areas: Employment, with the framing of a European pact for employment and social cohesion, as concerns lifelong training and the introduction of prior cross-border testing of social and fiscal legislation. Next, in the area of social dialogue, this intensification would be expressed by adopting a directive on employee information and consultation, and the European Works Council Directive, with a revision of the directives on redundancies. Finally, in the area of social protection, it would take the form of pursuing a strategy of convergence. It is a veritable catalogue of measures which is more a declaration of intent than a plan that could be implemented in the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the objective of giving new impetus to European social policy in the face of globalisation, enlargement and an ageing population is a laudable one. It demonstrates that economic competitiveness and social cohesion are not mutually exclusive. The method used, on the other hand, seems more debatable. Regarding the financing of NGOs and their participation in Community policies, there is still no legal basis in the Treaty, paragraph 13. Similarly, with the new social agenda, there is a desire to pass legislation at Community level, at the risk of harmonising to minimum standards and short-circuiting social relations within the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, colleagues and I share her ideals for a better standard of living for all the peoples of Europe, for a better quality of life and for promotion of social inclusion. Where I part company is on her proposals or – as Stephen Hughes said – her prescriptions to secure that end, because her proposals will lead us further away from those ideals rather than towards achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">Various speakers have talked about the Lisbon Summit today. That was hailed six months ago as a very important summit. Mention was made there of a new direction for Europe: moving away from the social regulation agenda of the 1980s towards enterprise, innovation, competition and employment. However, the report says something slightly different: whereas Lisbon calls for a reform of the social model, it calls for reinforcement; whereas Lisbon calls for liberation of enterprise and more flexibility, the report proposes four new or amended directives and a number of legislative initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The report sets out the standard Socialist solution throughout the ages of legislation, legislation, legislation. What we need to pursue our common goals is not more regulation, but less. We do not want more burdening of business, we want less. We do not want more unemployment, we want less.</p>
<p class="contents">The original Commission proposal was much better left unamended – congratulations Commissioner. I propose that we leave it unamended and we reject the report, otherwise we will give the clearest possible signal that Parliament is continuing to pursue the old agenda. Surely it is time to move on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank the other Anna for the substantial work she has done on this matter, something we could not have done without.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate today and in the Committee shows that there are major political differences and major differences in ambition in this area, and I think it good that these differences should be clearly brought out. In this way, people have a clear choice when they vote at the next parliamentary election: a choice between those who want to see a social Europe and those who merely want the EU to regulate the internal market. A choice between right and left. Our fellow MEPs from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and, in particular, from the British Conservative Party, have re-tabled a series of amendments which would genuinely weaken the ambitions of this social action programme. Every time legislation is proposed, these Thatcher-inspired neo-liberals embark upon an ideological crusade.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe does not deserve dogmatism, however. What Europe needs is for us to assess pragmatically what regulatory tool will be the most effective in the practical situation. In some cases, we need the open coordination method. On other occasions, it is better for the two sides of industry to negotiate their way towards an agreement. We must not, however, be afraid to use legislation if this is what is required for us to achieve our objectives. I also want to raise another practical issue which this strategy has focused upon. This is the need to come up with a definite strategy for the working environment which would give us the opportunity to devise a coherent policy in this area. Within the area of the working environment, too, we must make a practical assessment of which tools are best for solving the various problems. Here, too, dogmatism is not the way forward but, rather, finding pragmatic solutions to real problems.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And in order to be a political entity, Europe must have a cultural and social, as well as economic structure. In my opinion, therefore, the proposal presented by the Commission on the social agenda is extremely positive. However, I do agree with almost all of Mrs Van Lancker’s report – and for this I am grateful to her – for I do not believe that when Mrs Van Lancker makes a specific reference to clear objectives, proposals for specific instruments and, in particular, precise deadlines, that she is reverting to the socialist logic of old, as somebody has suggested today. It is rather that she is simply reverting to a longstanding need, the need for cohesion in a situation which, from this point of view, is becoming increasingly difficult to regulate because it lacks any form of harmonisation. In discussing a Charter of Fundamental Rights and advocating a European Constitution we cannot shy away from certain issues: we have to insist that all the necessary measures must be taken, even if this means producing more accurate legislation. I do not believe that Mrs Van Lancker intends to create laws to regulate absolutely everything; I feel rather that she considers it necessary, when coordinating actions do not produce the desired results, when the citizens encounter inequalities between the States and when there is no social harmonisation, to bring about this harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of open coordination must therefore be tackled alongside a comprehensive action to develop social legal bases, for without them we will not be able to persuade the States to harmonise a social policy which upholds equality and equal opportunities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission communication highlights a raft of ambitious objectives, such as full employment, equal opportunities, training, etc., but there are many contradictions between the European Union’s declared ambitions and its political decisions. Among other aspects, let me cite the concern for productivity, which generally involves wage moderation as a priority. I would therefore like to join my fellow Members in congratulating Anne Van Lancker on her report, which opens up new perspectives, with an approach which aims for greater precision and greater coherence.</p>
<p class="contents">Her report appreciably builds on the Commission’s proposals by suggesting the harmonisation of social regulations and the coordination of national social legislation. It calls for a genuine European agreement to be framed in favour of employment and social cohesion and proposes initiatives on the gradual reduction of working time prior to retirement, the introduction of a minimum wage and cross-border supervision in relation to social and fiscal law.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all a specific encouragement to go beyond laudable intentions and actually take practical action. Moreover, at a time when a great many employees of major European industrial groups face redundancy plans in the context of mergers and restructuring, I think it important for the report on the social agenda to take a stand in favour of taking social clauses into consideration in competition policy, in favour of directives to this end and in favour of a revision of the European Works Council Directive as well as the directive on redundancies. This, I feel, is part of the consistent approach which we are lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to see, furthermore, that Mrs Van Lancker has included a number of amendments tabled by my Group, particularly that on factoring in the social dimension of enlargement and incorporating the right to strike into Community legislation. Together with my Group, I have tabled some amendments criticising the Commission’s approach calling for the adoption of wage restraint. I advocate the reduction of working times without a concomitant reduction in salaries. Having said that, I support Anne Van Lancker’s report, which has the great merit of adopting an ambitious social policy backed up by specific objectives which go beyond the usual purely formal declarations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I listened with pleasure to Mrs Péry’s brief summary of the Council’s social policy, which I firmly support. I am very familiar with the project and support all the work carried out by Commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou to date. She will remember that I asked her, one day, whether her attitude to pensioners’ issues was that of a fairy godmother or a wicked stepmother. Up until now, I feel I can say that she has been a fairy godmother: two weeks ago, she announced that the Commission had programmed a special undertaking to resolve the problems of pensioners by extending the directive on pension funds and via the proposal to regulate these European pension funds in such a way that they are used to benefit workers who have hitherto paid a large part of their salary to the State, to the different States, and who would have liked – and this is what I propose – their funds to be properly managed, just as, I am sure, Mrs Diamantopoulou manages the finances of her own family and as every bank, every British bank, in particular – and on this point I agree with Mr Bushill-Matthews – has done thus far. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an ambitious agenda, and I still have a clear recollection of the painfully slow progress that was made during the last legislative period in the sphere of social protection. The Council was not even prepared to discuss the matter at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">What is clearly new is that we have adopted an employment policy, based on the Lisbon Decisions, indeed an employment policy that should be of a qualitative nature. We do not want over-regulation – and I say this to the British delegate who spoke before – but the diversity of modern contracts of employment requires new forms of social protection, and not the rules of the nineteenth century. We also stand to gain a great deal from having a constructive and effective policy mix between economic and financial policy, and, not least, from developing the social economy and the services sector.</p>
<p class="contents">What is not so new, and the subject of repeated demands, is lifelong learning – which is something even the smallest Member States have done something about – as are the long overdue reforms to the European factory committee law, the legal protection of nursing and expectant mothers, and freedom of movement. I would like to raise a criticism in connection with the lack of initiatives produced in response to the new challenges we face in health and safety at work, employee participation and labour relations. Of course, I was delighted to see the French Presidency show such commitment to the issues of childcare, family and women’s policy. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that all three people responsible – in the Commission, Parliament and the Council – are women. But what we need now, in tandem with this, are instruments that allow for the involvement of fathers. That would be a new departure. Besides, this agenda should send out a signal to the candidate countries, and I therefore wish it every success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to dispel any lack of confidence, this social agenda must enable objectives and policies that have been postponed for years to be put into practice. The Council must not leave various specific proposals that have been postponed year after year simply hanging in the air. I have in mind proposals on decisions that are crucial to improving the rights of working women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and vital for improving workers’ collective and individual rights, including the right to information, consultation and participation, specifically in the framework of the European Company Statute and of the European Works Council. This is necessary from the point of view of guaranteeing workers’ rights and preventing redundancies as a result of successive mergers and relocations by multinationals in various European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur, Mrs Van Lancker, emphasises, although social dialogue is important, it must produce tangible results. Otherwise, the Commission will have to propose legislative instruments and the Council will have to approve the measures needed, specifically by amending macroeconomic policies and the Stability Pact, in order to give credibility to our fight against poverty and social exclusion and to our efforts to defend good quality jobs with respectable salaries and to advocate reforms that give employees dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I consider the social policy agenda to be an extremely important political document which identifies instruments, sectors of intervention and timeframes and guarantees positive, dynamic interaction between economic, social and employment policies. These instruments are intended to adapt the European social model in line with the changing reality. I fully support Mrs Van Lancker's report and I would like, in particular, to stress a point which has, moreover, already been raised by both the rapporteur and Mrs Péry in their speeches, and that is the need for all the instruments to be genuinely implemented at European level, and therefore for application of the open coordination method to go hand in hand with reinforcement of the legal dimension. This is what happens in many countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to give an example: last week, the Italian Parliament adopted a new law on welfare which was proposed by a Minister – a woman, like the three representatives of the three institutions. This is tantamount to a revolution, for the old law on welfare had been in force for over 100 years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But it lacks substance to some extent. Mrs Van Lancker’s outstanding report makes good the deficiencies of the Commission draft as regards content. We support a pact for employment and social cohesion, a European action plan for employment with a view to boosting the social economy and local employment initiatives, social regulations for new forms of working such as tele-working and new forms of self-employment, the minimum wage, and guaranteed income. The European Union has already stood idly by for far too long, watching poverty and social exclusion take hold in the Member States. Indeed Mrs Van Lancker’s proposals for improving the information available to, and participation of, female employees, and for social clauses in public contracts, mergers and international agreements, are long overdue. We object to the fact that the Commission and the Council are unwilling to make additional resources available for the social agenda. Social quality cannot be achieved free and gratis.</p>
<p class="contents">It sometimes seems to me that the concept of modernisation is often tantamount to the undermining of social protection. Extending people’s working lives is not modernisation, no more so is funding pensions by freezing or lowering the statutory pensions level, and advising people to take up investment opportunities on the financial markets. We need modern, European social harmonisation, not deregulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The working areas opened up in the social agenda must be given a coherent, and certainly conciliatory, legal framework: The policy of convergence and the policies of coordination which have been initiated, and also supported by legislative measures, when necessary, which in turn should be reinforced by genuinely stringent monitoring methods.</p>
<p class="contents">As for my third point, there are some rights that have simply been glossed over from the viewpoint of a social Europe: the right to a minimum income, the information and consultation of employees, the European collective agreement. These are points which, we know, are contested by the conservatives in Europe, but to which we, in our Group, attach great importance. Minister, Commissioner, we must continue to adopt an ambitious approach on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, Minister, that in Nice the French Presidency will succeed in pushing through an ambitious social agenda, since embarking on the construction of a social Europe is still the great hope of all our fellow citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall try very briefly to pinpoint a few political aspects of the four areas touched on in greater or lesser detail by all the speakers, i.e. the new political approach in the social agenda, secondly the content, thirdly the means and fourthly the procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the political approach is concerned, we need, I think, to highlight two new elements. The first is that, since Lisbon, the new approach to social policy is to deal with it not as a product or by-product of economic policy, but as a policy in its own right which needs to be exercised in tandem with economic policy and the employment strategy. In other words, this is the only way for us to deal with Europe’s objectives of competitiveness, given our constant concern for enterprises and the economy, and social cohesion, given our constant concern for our citizens and their welfare. The second element in the new approach is quality. Quality as a new political concept to deal with working conditions, employment relations and the services of the social state. These two political approaches underpin the entire content.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the basic strands which make up the content? There are three. A set of projects and proposals on employment. I think that what we are endeavouring to achieve through the employment strategy, by strengthening and enriching it as we progress – because the entire social agenda is a process of dynamic change – is to support competitiveness and entrepreneurship in the European Union and flexibility on the job market, alongside security, mobility and new working models, and to support and analyse new social partnership models and the impact of competitiveness and major restructuring on employment and the social state.</p>
<p class="contents">The second strand to the social agenda is a set of projects on social policy. Here I would like to refer to the proposal for combating poverty and exclusion, the new work which we have started on pensions and social protection, policies for people with special needs and, more importantly, I would like to pinpoint a particular political aspect, i.e. the need for a new approach to social policy. We must not simply calculate the cost of social policy, which is often seen from several political angles as an obstacle to economic development; we must calculate the cost of not implementing social policy. I think that this analysis will give us new, interesting results and approaches.</p>
<p class="contents">The third strand in the content is enlargement. To be brief, social policy, the new social standards and harmonisation of the social legislation of candidate countries with the Member States are one of the most important features of the enlargement procedure and we must not lose sight of that.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the third area which has engaged our attention today and throughout our cooperation: the means. I think that the discussion on deregulation and legislation, i.e. do we or do we not need legislation, is old hat. Clearly we have a fairly complete legislative system in Europe, but changes on the job market, changes in the economy, changes in the environment due to globalisation and the information society are throwing up new requirements. When we need to deal with these new requirements with legislation, we shall not, of course, have any hesitation in doing so. If we can deal with them in other ways and with other methods, we shall do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a scoreboard, for a specific method for monitoring the social agenda, is a huge challenge. The problem is that, because of the legal basis which it has in the Treaty, the social agenda does not constitute a set of laws, a set of directives with specific steps for the Member States. It is still hard for us to define European objectives which are equally valid for all the Member States because the situation on the ground varies. We therefore believe that, in the first instance, common European indicators, a project which is now nearing completion, and national objectives, i.e. the need for each country to have its own scoreboard and carry out monitoring, are a step along the road to providing us with specific results.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as procedures are concerned, I really must congratulate Parliament on its initiative in starting a dialogue with the civil society and the important contribution which this dialogue made to the agenda, as well as highlight the discussions which took place with Parliament, with the Member States and with the social partners at European and national level; this is how we were able to combine national idiosyncrasies and ensure, above all, that the Agenda is not merely ambitious but flexible and efficient. And one last comment: the question of sexual equality runs right through the social agenda as regards both the political approach and the content and means. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
