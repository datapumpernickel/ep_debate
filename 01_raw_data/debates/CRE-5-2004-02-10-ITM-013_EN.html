I also hope that this is an issue on which the whole House can unite on a cross-party basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject is not just about demographic trends in general. My oral question specifically asks for more attention to be given to issues associated with ageing. Too often, ageing is just seen as a problem; it should also be seen as an opportunity. Too often, the elderly are seen as people with disabilities and with needs; they should also be seen as people with abilities and with rights.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many aspects to be reviewed, but in the time available I will just focus on one: the opportunity for the elderly to continue in work if that is their wish. I therefore welcome the approach taken by the Employment Task Force chaired by Wim Kok. This report refers to one of the Lisbon Council conclusions that is often overlooked, that by 2010 the target is for 50% of 55-64 year-olds to be in employment. Currently, only Sweden, Denmark, Portugal and the United Kingdom have reached this target. Belgium, Italy, France, Luxembourg and Austria have employment rates for older workers of less than 33%.</p>
<p class="contents">Delaying the average age at which people leave the labour force is crucial. Luxembourg, Belgium and France among the current Member States, plus Poland, Lithuania, Hungary and Slovakia among the incoming Member States all have average work exit ages well below the EU average. They will be particularly stretched to meet the agreed target and their policies will have to change radically in order to achieve it. Will they grasp the challenge?</p>
<p class="contents">But even the EU as it exists today will miss the 50% target unless it can increase the number of older workers in work by seven million over the next seven years. This means that two-thirds of the current 46-55 age group must still be active in the labour market in 2010. This means in turn a significant change, because only half of those in this group and in employment in 1991 were still working ten years later.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reason I tabled this question. It is a matter for Member States, but the issue is: will Member States act on these employment task force conclusions within a defined and early timetable? Will the Commission put together an early progress report to present to Parliament, ideally by the end of this year? Finally, will Member States implement all the provisions on age discrimination in the employment directive without further delay? I hope the answer to all of these can be 'yes'. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Mr Bushill-Matthews and Mr Pronk, on behalf of the PPE-DE group, have submitted a series of questions to which I shall reply. Of course, I too hope that the answer to the last three questions will be yes, which means very close cooperation and decisiveness by the Commission and, more importantly, the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Your first question concerns what the Commission intends to do in order to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Summit, as far as demographic trends are concerned. The demographic problem is, at the moment, at the epicentre of our three basic policies, economic policy, especially public finances, the policy on employment and the policy on social cohesion. The question of ageing is now, as you will see, the basic element in the general orientations of economic policy and the guidelines of the strategy for employment, with specific targets. I particularly want to tell you that this year, in the spring 2004 report, we have set three priorities, one of which is the promotion of active ageing, which essentially means the extension of professional life.</p>
<p class="contents">We have three categories of action. One relates to abolishing economic disincentives, which essentially discourage workers from delaying their retirement. In many countries, the regime which exists today is that it is more profitable to retire than to remain in work, because you earn less. So there is the serious question of disincentives. The second is the promotion of access to training for all workers, but especially elderly workers, and here we have set specific quantitative targets. The third is improving the quality of work. The Commission, within these frameworks of efforts to put demographic ageing at the centre of its policies, is proposing to extend the open method of coordination to modernising the care system and the social protection system. Here we have a particular problem, which concerns the increased burden both from the economic point of view and from the workload point of view and, hence, from the point of view of serving very old people since, due to the changes in our society, it would appear that the health systems cannot play the role which they played in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Your second question concerns flexibility in retirement rules and is particularly topical. As you yourself said, we have set specific targets. We have set the Lisbon targets, to increase the employment rate of the elderly to 50%, and the Barcelona targets, to increase the average age at which workers leave the job market by five years by 2010. These targets are being monitored by the Commission. Every year, as you know, we publish indicators and tables and it is clear that the Member States are not making efforts to the same degree to give us results. At the moment, we are examining, together with the social protection and employment committees, how social systems obstruct or favour easy retirement. The final report is at your disposal, it will be submitted again in 2004, and we can see what the problems are in each system as regards incentives to retire, disability benefits, unemployment benefits, older workers and dependents' pensions, and how the logic of incentives rather than the logic of integrating these people into the job market has also distorted the job market, as well as efforts by people themselves to enter the job market. We believe that this report, which will be submitted to the European Council, is also an important tool in the hands of the Member States. I must of course tell you that the European Commission has constantly recommended the introduction of flexible retirement systems since 1980 and the response has not been as we expected.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as your third question on the results of the Wim Kok committee is concerned, we consider that they are extremely important, mainly because they go into detailed recommendations for each Member State. We have already included the Kok report in the strategy on employment and our recommendations for all the countries will take account of this report. I think that it is interesting that, in cooperation with both Mr Kok and the ministries of employment and social partners, we are presenting the conclusions of the committee to the Member States in an effort to achieve greater publicity and galvanise not just the governments but also the social partners into implementing them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has been a substantial rise in awareness of demographic ageing and its impact on the jobs market and social policy in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe faces an enormous challenge in this area. On the one hand, it is confronted with the possibility of failing to meet targets set at the Lisbon Council in the areas of employment, competitiveness and economic growth by 2010. At the same time, health care systems must achieve the three-pronged aim of health care access for all, higher levels of quality provided by these services and the financial viability of systems. There is, moreover, enormous pressure on Member States’ social security systems to meet and to guarantee, in the future, the provision of pensions to an increasingly aged population. The time has come, therefore, to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that the complex implications of the ageing of the population, along with low birth rates, cannot be solved on an exclusively national level. These problems affect different Community policies, so what is needed is to develop Europe-wide cooperation. The first issue that therefore arises is to know in what way the Commission will be able to support Member States to provide adequate responses to the ageing of the population, either at health systems level or at employment policy level.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions of the task force chaired by Wim Kok suggest various measures that may be adopted to maintain economic growth and to promote active ageing. A legislative and financial framework must be drawn up that might include such key measures as encouraging employers to hire and retain older workers, discouraging people from leaving the labour market early and increasing participation in life-long training.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the questions raised by Mr Bushill-Matthews, whom I congratulate for his question to the Commission, I should like to address the question of working women. The increase in the contribution of women to the labour market is a further response, but one which requires measures to be adopted that make it easier to reconcile working life and family life. I would ask the Commission, and especially Commissioner Diamantopoulou, whether it is in a position to develop the mechanisms required to draw up a framework directive establishing a lowest common denominator on reconciling working life and home life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all aware of the problem, and the Commissioner’s reply has also demonstrated that something is being done, and that naturally pressure is also being put on Member States as and where we can. I think your points, particularly the three requests, are expressed in too summarised a form to seriously tackle the topic as a whole and all aspects of demographic change.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Member States and the candidate countries are aware of the challenges. Let me refer you to the two reports our committee and Parliament have already approved in 2001 and 2003, which were produced by Mr Cercas and Mr Andersson. I think you will find the subject receives much more thorough treatment in those reports. We are not only talking about raising the age of retirement, as Mr Bushill-Matthews has reminded us. Clearly one issue is the need to remove the incentives for taking early retirement. Of course, we also need to get rid of the discrimination older workers still often encounter in our labour market, such as the fact that they are rarely allowed to participate in further training, the way their experience is often under-used, the way they have no chance of any kind of promotion. All this forms part of making the labour market attractive and reasonable for older workers. There is certainly a lot of catching up to be done, both by the Member States and on our side, which goes far beyond simply increasing the age of retirement.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, one other element, as Mrs Bastos has said, is to consider how we can promote child-friendly employment conditions in the European Union; how we can support women in combining work and family. I think there is a hefty contradiction if the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Demcorats have no problem with calling for a 55- or 60-hour working week, as they did yesterday, expects that, and never stops to consider that it completely rules out a child-friendly society. I think this is another important point.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and last point is that of course we need to have an unbiased, open and serious discussion about an active immigration policy. We should also seriously discuss the immigration strategy mentioned recently in this House by Kofi Annan. I think all this belongs to a policy which establishes a balance between the generations and welfare as well as showing intergenerational solidarity, as it is often called here. This is more important than simply talking about raising the retirement age. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Europe has an increasingly smaller and older population. It will be hard for us to compete if we do not have people suitable for work. I believe the time is coming when we must consider the introduction of a new criterion if we want possibilities for the future, a new criterion based on productive population density.</p>
<p class="contents">You are Greek, Commissioner. I have been looking at the map of population density in Europe, I have it here in front of me, and it indicates that more than half of your country, more than half of Greece, has a population of less than 50 inhabitants per square kilometre. They are areas with low population densities. However, what would you think if I told you that, as well as that, half of your population is over 50 years old? So we are facing a situation with practically no future.</p>
<p class="contents">We must start looking into this problem, which is arising in many regions of Europe, in Spain, in Scotland, in France, in certain regions of Italy and also in Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">The time is coming for us to begin to consider this concept of productive population density because it is necessary to competitiveness, because furthermore we are facing a repeated problem in Spain which we call ‘the fish that bites its own tail’. We cannot take companies to places where there are no people, where there is no productive workforce, and where the productive workforce does not go because there are no companies.</p>
<p class="contents">We must find a way of breaking this vicious circle. I will go further: in our region, in Aragón, we have tried to move immigrants to rural areas: Latin Americans, Rumanians, Eastern Europeans. Do you know what is happening? They stay for three, five, six months or a year and then leave, to a city or to the coast. We must find some way to break this vicious circle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
