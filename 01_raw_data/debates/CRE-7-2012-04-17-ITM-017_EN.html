<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Mr President, after decades of internal repression, we see dramatic and hopeful changes taking place in Burma. Here is a democratic transition unfolding in what looks like a peaceful, collaborative fashion, acclaimed by the domestic electorate and the international community. This is a rare case indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are seeing points to a government which is serious about change and wants to end its country’s isolation. President U Thein Sein shows courage and leadership. It would be a surprise, though, if he did not face resistance from some who have profited from the old system. Most importantly, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the President have established a relationship of trust.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we can measure the recent achievements against the three main items we have looked at in our policy review. First: national reconciliation; specifically, a willingness to recognise the special position of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and to see the National League for Democracy take its place in the political life of the nation. Here, our expectations have been more than met by the growing relationship between Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the government, and by the change in the electoral law that enabled the NLD to register as a party and take part in the recent by-election.</p>
<p class="contents">This made it all the more important that the by-elections on 1 April 2012 should be well conducted. It was remarkable and welcome that the government invited the European Union to send experts to witness the poll. I was delighted that we were able to associate the European Parliament with this historic event and that Mr Ivo Belet could join the EU team at the elections. We did not observe the campaign, but it seems to have presented a mixed picture. In the poll itself, there was no sign of fraud and there is no reason to doubt the results. The NLD won 42 out of the 43 seats they contested. Compared to the 2010 elections, which were marred by massive fraud, this represents huge progress.</p>
<p class="contents">These bare facts hardly do justice to the importance of the occasion and the meaning it had for a people who had waited fifty years for democracy and endured so many disappointments with so much patience.</p>
<p class="contents">Second: the release of political prisoners. A large majority have already been released, among them, prominent figures from the so-called ‘88 Generation’ and the National League for Democracy. It is difficult to be sure exactly how many remain, as there is a grey zone of uncertainty, but the number is significant, and we shall continue to work for their release. Again, there is real progress and a commitment to resolving the remaining cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Third: we wanted to see a real effort to achieve peace in the ethnic areas. All peace talks – with one exception – have brought ceasefire agreements. These are important steps, and we do not doubt the President’s commitment. The longest civil war in the world – the conflict with the Karen – may soon be over, even if the Kachin conflict remains a cause of great concern.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also progress on less visible fronts: legislation for trade unions, easing of media censorship – including unrestricted access to the Internet – and progress on the economic front, including liberalisation of the currency.</p>
<p class="contents">There is so much to do that the process of reform will inevitably take time. There are problems with human rights, with macro-economic management, and with health, education and energy. It is difficult to know where to start, but I believe that President U Thein Sein has made the right choice in beginning with the political problems. Securing ethnic peace is perhaps the most important and the most immediate challenge. But here, too, an effort that brings together all political forces can make a real difference.</p>
<p class="contents">We have followed these historic changes with respect and appreciation. In January, we suspended the visa bans on the government. At the end of this month, we shall do more. Decisions will be taken in the Foreign Affairs Council in a few days.</p>
<p class="contents">But we need to go further and build a partnership. I will travel to Burma next week. I have invited the Foreign Minister to Brussels. I know that the European Parliament made a successful visit in February. I hope that what we are now seeing is an opportunity for this country to move forward. We need to enter into active collaboration to assist the reform process and to contribute to economic, political and social development. We have secured more funding – EUR 150 million. In addition to ongoing programmes in health, education and agriculture, I have launched a programme to help the national human rights commission. We will strengthen capacity in the public administration at central and regional level. I also plan to offer cooperation with the election commission to build on the success of the by-elections, for which it deserves much credit.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I want to work to secure peace and stability for ethnic regions and to open a long-term perspective for their development. I hope that the honourable Members will support me in working with the authorities to turn ceasefires into durable peace. In all these areas, we will work with the opposition as well as the government. Indeed, we very much hope they will be working together.</p>
<p class="contents">Removing sanctions and increasing aid is not enough: we all recognise, too, the vital contribution that the private sector can make. We want to encourage European companies to look for opportunities in Burma and to bring the highest standards of corporate social responsibility with them. In a longer perspective, the European Union hopes to reinstate the Generalised System of Preferences following the International Labour Organisation’s assessment. I believe I speak for all of us when I say that we look forward to collaborating constructively with the government, the opposition and indeed the people to reinforce their unity and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me express the hope that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will soon be able to come to this House to receive the Sakharov Prize she was awarded 21 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Today is the first day of the Burmese New Year. I wish all the people a very happy New Year. Thanks to the determination of President U Thein Sein and the fortitude of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, there is a chance that for once, this wish might come true. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are, of course, also aware of the fact that everything is still very fragile in Burma. Is the reform process irreversible? Nobody knows. But we do know that the transparency and the openness of the by-elections of 1 April are not isolated factors.</p>
<p class="contents">Lady Ashton, you referred to the majority of the political prisoners that have been liberated. The presence of the international media and the international observers is a big step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Important steps still have to be made by the Burmese authorities. We clearly insist in our motion for a resolution, which will be put to the vote on Friday, that they must liberate all the political prisoners and that the real test of democracy will take place over three years, within which the general elections will be held.</p>
<p class="contents">But the fact is that today, we are faced with a unique window of opportunity, and we have to grab it. It is crucial that the authors of the reform process in Burma/Myanmar receive a clear, strong signal of support from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, High Representative, we ask you (and this is important) – indeed, we ask the Council – to start reviewing the restrictive measures substantially in order to support the reforms. A strict evaluation of the impact of such a review within a year could be part of that decision. I think that the European Union and you, High Representative, hold the key in this process. You referred to the renewed potential of the relationship between the EU and Burma/Myanmar.</p>
<p class="contents">We can and will benefit from an open economic partnership. It will be a win-win situation for both sides and, of course, we also rely on you to push for balanced development with full respect for the local population and the ecological richness of this country. We count on you, Lady Ashton, to take the lead in this process on a global scale and to start a new era for Burma/Myanmar. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The democratic transition, as you describe it, is clearly visible. So is an attempt to end the country’s isolation and so are the attempts to open up the country for more economic development, because Burma, due to its isolation for 50 years, was also economically a very underdeveloped country.</p>
<p class="contents">So there is an opportunity for Burma, and, of course, there is also an opportunity for us. I fully agree with you that we should take this opportunity and help the country as far as democratic development is concerned. You mention the election experts and the election process. Yes, those are the right things for us to do and also for this Parliament to do.</p>
<p class="contents">You mention lifting the sanctions. We support you in this regard. We should reward the reformers by gradually lifting the sanctions and giving them the opportunity to successfully complete the process of democratisation, and – as you also mentioned – the national reconciliation between the regime and the opposition, also as far as the ethnic minorities are concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To me, it was like a small miracle when President Thein Sein, a former member of the military junta, gave us a relatively credible explanation of his desire for reform. The critical test came at the beginning of this month, when the by-elections took place. It was very impressive to see how the opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who previously had to operate in secret, achieved an overwhelming victory, despite the fact that obstacles were occasionally placed in the way of her election campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">However, one thing must be clear to us. Her party, the National League for Democracy, is still a very small party. It currently has only just over 40 seats. Therefore, the way in which it develops over the next few weeks, months and years will be decisive. The crucial landmark will be the 2015 elections. This is when it will become clear whether the citizens of Burma really have the opportunity to elect their members of parliament and their government freely, fairly and without outside influence. Until then, the reform process must continue at a rapid pace. It is essential that those who are currently in power make genuine progress and go on with the work that they have started. They must release the remaining political prisoners, as Mr Belet has already said. They must come to a ceasefire in the feuds that they are having with different ethnic groups and ultimately bring about peace. They must offer their citizens full democratic rights, such as freedom of expression in speech and writing, including on the Internet, in schools and in universities. They must ensure that there is a free and independent press and an independent judicial system. They must begin the systematic process of establishing the structures of a social market economy. We, together with our private sector, can and must help them to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">As Burma introduces more democracy and freedom for its people, so the West can reduce its sanctions or even lift them altogether. It is in all our interests for Burma to free itself from China’s embrace and to overcome the mass poverty among its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to speak today about the challenges with regard to human rights policy. I think it is a very good thing that the EU is supporting the UN in Bangkok and helping the national human rights commission in Burma to become truly independent and to fine-tune the methods it uses. These are positive developments, but they are not enough. The follow-up to the ceasefire agreements in particular is a difficult issue, because these agreements must lead to peace processes with 16 different groups covering a huge area. I believe it is very important for the EU to take action in this area and to ensure that the people who live there and the internal exiles and refugees who return there have the right to education, jobs, homes and health care. These are regions which are highly underdeveloped.</p>
<p class="contents">The other question that I have is whether the members of the military who are not among the reformers, but who are very influential, and who, under the terms of the constitution, are the holders of political power, will simply give up this power after the elections in 2015. I found out when I was there that these people also have economic power and considerable resources, such as wood and precious stones, are under their control. Therefore, I would ask you when you are considering which sanctions should be lifted to investigate carefully and not simply to lift those sanctions which will benefit the non-reformers among the military. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course we can have nothing but the greatest admiration for the tenacity and courage of Aung San Suu Kyi over all these years. She is an enormous example to all of us, and there are many Members of this Parliament who have campaigned for decades – in fact, for longer than most of us have been here (perhaps not the sitting Vice-President this evening, but certainly the rest of us). This Parliament has campaigned for a very long time to bring about the sort of results that we are seeing.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to say a quick word, though, on the subject of sanctions, because some people are asking whether or not sanctions are ever useful.</p>
<p class="contents">Often, of course, they are the only recourse we have, short of armed conflict. In this case, I am sure they have helped. David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, was in Burma last week. He has spoken to Aung San Suu Kyi. He has spoken to President Thein Sein, and clearly they have all given certain messages to him which make him very confident that we should now suspend sanctions, with the exception of the arms embargo.</p>
<p class="contents">But we must be wary, because democracy has not suddenly happened overnight in Burma. There is a long way to go. There are still hundreds of political prisoners who are incarcerated and must be released, and I would be interested in your view, Baroness Ashton, as to whether Thein Sein faces any opposition in his own ranks and how strong his position is.</p>
<p class="contents">So we have to take care, but I think we must also be seen to respond very positively to these developments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The overwhelming support which she received during her election to parliament clearly demonstrates that she carries the hopes of the Burmese people. However, I would like to make it clear that the parliament to which she was elected does not have the power to take the country in a different direction from that planned by the military. In addition, the generals have adopted a constitution which guarantees that they retain control over parliament in future. President Thein Sein could give a clear indication of how serious his desire for change is by not attempting to force the newly elected members to swear to support this obsolete constitution before they are allowed to take up their mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to acknowledge that a series of positive changes have taken place over the last two years. However, I agree with all my fellow Members that the country still has a long way to go. The spotlight on Aung San Suu Kyi must not blind us to the fate of other political prisoners, to the ongoing military action against parts of the population, to the misery of the refugees and to the wealth of a small elite in a desperately poor country. Is real change now on the way or will there be new setbacks?</p>
<p class="contents">My group supports the call from Aung San Suu Kyi to suspend EU sanctions, but not to lift them permanently. This would give her country the opportunity to overcome poverty and encourage the military to continue along the road to democracy. However, it would also allow us to show that the European Parliament remains vigilant and that a return to dictatorship would have serious consequences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, many political prisoners have not been released and, although the opposition leader has entered parliament, this does not change the fact that the regime has committed serious violations of human rights. Her brilliant election victory and the frenetic enthusiasm of her followers are likely to give rise to resentment among many of the supporters of the military regime. A lot will depend on whether the gradual, joint transition processes that have been agreed upon go according to plan, on what is being done to enable people to come to terms with the past, and on whether political change will bring with it a more open economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that Burma certainly still has a long way to go before it becomes a fully functioning democracy, the indications that we have seen so far are positive and should be acknowledged by the West and by the EU. We support a gradual lifting of sanctions which takes into consideration the progress made towards reform. However, in my opinion, that should not apply to the arms embargo. Only if the new policy of openness is followed by positive changes to the economy and if the living conditions of the people genuinely improve can we assume that the risk of a return to a military dictatorship has really been averted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We formed part of a delegation from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) which visited Aung San Suu Kyi, the President and many members of the government. It was clear to us that it was the President who was responsible for initiating the reform process and not the sanctions. Therefore, we must support what he and what the leader of the opposition are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">The release of prisoners is an important move and this must continue. The reform of the constitution must not come to an end with the by-elections. There is much to be done and we know that a reform process of this kind will not happen overnight. It takes time. Even in a much simpler situation, such as that of the German Democratic Republic, which was previously a Communist dictatorship and which was reunified with the Federal Republic of Germany, the process lasted decades. Therefore, we must give it our support.</p>
<p class="contents">Burma is one of the richest countries in the world, but a small group of members of the military have exploited its wealth. Its population is currently one of the poorest in the world. This is partly because the sanctions, in particular, in the financial sector, have allowed the military leadership to put the billions earned from oil, gas and raw materials into the national budget at the old exchange rate of 1:6, while the actual rate with the US dollar is 1:800. In addition, less than 1% of the revenue has benefited the population and the rest has gone into the pockets of the military. This is where we must start. If we support this process and help to combat poverty, fill the gaps in the education system and develop the country’s infrastructure, and if we lift the sanctions gradually or for a specific period, we will be able to actively encourage Burma’s progress along the road to a genuine democracy. I hope that we and the Burmese people are successful. The ASEAN delegation will provide critical but positive support for this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union has to encourage this reform process and review some of the sanctions, although certainly not the embargo on arms and those sectors crucial to military power, particularly mines and timber, and provided that the Burmese regime continues to facilitate democratic and pluralistic openness. For this, it is essential that political prisoners are released unconditionally and the laws that enabled their arrest are repealed; that military attacks on ethnic minorities stop and there is an end to impunity for those responsible for war crimes and other human rights abuses. The European Union must liaise with civil society and, given the prospect of elections in 2015, must be present to assist in training administrative staff and preparing the necessary reforms for other sanctions to be lifted. These clearly must include the independence of the judiciary, the fight against corruption, freedom of the press and expression and unrestricted Internet access, protection of minorities, labour rights, environmental laws defending the interests of the Burmese people and, of course, support for economic and trade development without ever ignoring the central issue of defending human rights. Above all, we must not forget that the true test of democracy in Burma will come with the necessary constitutional amendment removing the power of veto from the military who now occupy 25% of the seats in the Burmese Parliament, thereby preventing them from controlling the government that emerges from the 2015 elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

President Thein Sein should be congratulated on the reforms he is presiding over, and we all in this House congratulate and salute the courage of Aung San Suu Kyi, who now is an MP again in her country.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, of course, still room for democratic improvements. Allegations of intimidation and bribery at the ballot box in the recent elections should be fully investigated and, as Ana Gomes said, the Burmese military should publicly fully renounce their role in politics.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, who, whilst in Rangoon, recommended that the more restrictive of the current EU sanctions should be lifted. Burma has tremendous potential and should be afforded the assistance of EU investment and political support to achieve all that it is capable of. For once, I am cautiously optimistic about this beautiful country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

President Thein Sein has introduced a good reform agenda which has led to democratic and economic progress. Even the local council elections have been positive.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think – as many of my fellow Members have already said – that these positive developments should be rewarded. Consequently, I believe that we in the European Union should take the lead. So, I support Baroness Ashton’s initiative to visit Burma next week and to open an office there. During talks with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs next week, we really need to discuss the easing of sanctions. However, I think it is still too early to abolish all sanctions. After all, there are still too many significant problems.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that Baroness Ashton should ensure that the arms embargo remains in place and that the visa restrictions for the junta are maintained. With this President and the democratic elections, Burma has definitely made a step in the right direction. However, this must be followed by economic and political support for the reforms, by the release of all political prisoners, by free and fair elections, and by an end to violence and human rights abuses in the areas where minorities still live at the moment. Only when all of that is accomplished will we be able, once the sanctions have been eased, to abolish them totally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is no longer possible to say that the regime is still a junta. There are moves under way towards democracy that we have experienced at first hand and seen the effects of. I believe that everyone who has been involved in the introduction of democracy on the ground in Myanmar has been impressed, relieved and filled with enthusiasm. In my opinion, this is particularly true in the light of the debate that we have just held and the developments in Syria, Mali and Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">What can the EU do to ensure that this process continues in Myanmar? Sympathy alone is not enough. We need to share responsibility for further development aid projects and give them our support. We should encourage the ASEAN countries and, in particular, Myanmar’s neighbour, Thailand, to continue helping, as they have already done for a long period. However, we also need to lift the sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">The following comment recently appeared in a newspaper: Myanmar is a gold mine with huge quantities of raw materials, gas and oil, and all of this is now available. The estimate is that growth will reach a level of 6%. We must also help to ensure – not alone, but the EU is partly responsible for this – that the growth and the wealth in what is still, in part, a very poor country does not end up in the capitals of America, Europe and China, but reaches the population. Only then will there be stable, peaceful and democratic long-term development in the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I had the pleasure of meeting Aung San Suu Kyi in her home and I can only echo the words of David Cameron when he said that everyone has been inspired by her struggle.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I was also struck by her very cautious attitude to the way ahead. She was absolutely clear that any rush to completely remove sanctions would be premature and reminded us what happened after the last ‘free and fair’ elections in her country – that is, within months, the entire cohort of successful candidates were in prison as the military junta cracked down. She has welcomed proposals to suspend rather than lift sanctions and I believe that this is now the appropriate way forward. Suspension will allow reform to continue and be rewarded but serve as a reminder that the world is still watching.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I would also like to stress that it is vitally important for the well-being of the people of Burma that we move quickly towards opening up the economy and encouraging strong and fair governance, both politically and financially. European companies can, and should, play an important part in harnessing the entrepreneurial flair of the Burmese people and I look forward to seeing them thrive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very glad that now, many of us will visit this country, we will work there and we will be supporting the democratic regime by our presence – no longer autocratic in that sense.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to pay homage to Aung San Suu Kyi because her victory shows the role of devotion to values and leadership in the transition to democracy. She is to Burma what Nelson Mandela is to South Africa and Lech Wałęsa to Poland, and someone whose struggles in helping to change the nation and the ideas of people in the region have been absolutely crucial in the transition to democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we have to remember that the Burmese transition to democracy has just started. The European Union should acknowledge the changes that have taken place up till now. I hope that this will be treated as a sign of good will, but we can only lift some sanctions, and lift them only partially.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very glad, Baroness Ashton, to hear that you are thinking about initiating many cooperative programmes with Myanmar because this country has been totally closed for so many years. At the same time, I think we should press the Burmese Government to ensure that a new democratic constitution and independent judiciary are introduced.

<p class="contents">Their victory is a positive signal that showed the support of the population for pro-democracy forces and gave hope for further reforms. But the fact remains that the military junta still has a dominant influence in Burma, and unless significant changes take place after the elections in 2015, the opposition will remain limited by a constitution that guarantees the dominance of the army. Many political prisoners remain in detention. The status of ethnic groups in the country is unsustainable. It will therefore be necessary to monitor whether, and how, further reforms will follow. There is also the question of EU sanctions. I think that the people of Burma deserve our support. The reforms that the country urgently needs will not be possible with a dysfunctional economy. With regard to the situation, however, sanctions should be lifted only gradually. First, those that affect the poorest sections of the population. It is also necessary for the EU to maintain pressure on the military junta and support the trend towards reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Aung San Suu Kyi has achieved more than a symbolic victory. Nevertheless, she can expect a long and difficult journey in the continuing struggle for democracy in Burma. We should support her in this struggle, and not just symbolically. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite all the celebrations, we must not forget that the military is still in power. The by-elections only involved 7% of all the mandates. The current constitution ensures that the military retains its supremacy. The President must come from within the armed forces and the ministries of the interior, defence and border control are reserved for members of the military.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 2010, Burma has been creating a civilian image for itself. However, it still has a long way to go before achieving true democracy. For this reason, we must be very careful in our trade relationships with Burma. The arms embargoes and travel bans for those who have committed violations of human rights must remain in place. Nevertheless, an important process is starting in Burma. Mr Cameron has already been there, but Baroness Ashton has not yet visited. This does not present a good picture of the EU, which wants to assert its status as a global player. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To achieve peace, it is not sufficient to put an end to ethnic unrest. More is required. Aung San Suu Kyi also believes that Burma’s peace and future depend on agreement with the national ethnic minorities. In her view, federalism, self-determination and regional autonomy are a satisfactory solution for the minorities, too. If we wish to take seriously the situation and fate of the world’s minorities, then we can only do so in a credible way. That means setting an example and taking seriously the fate of the minorities living in the European Union and the discrimination they face, as we mentioned earlier this afternoon in the report by Mr Howitt. Indigenous national minorities have their own individual needs too, and must be given real equality extending to all aspects of life, and I should add that this must be ensured within the EU as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Van Orden, I agreed with every word that you said as well, alarming though that may be for you.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Belet, can I thank you very much for the work that you did in the elections. I know from Robert Cooper what an important contribution you have made, and I must thank you for that.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the honourable Members that what we are seeing is not irreversible, but every step that is taken makes it much more difficult for that reversal to take place. It is less likely and it is less easy for them to go backwards. I agree, too, that we have a lot to do. We want to make sure that the people have the right opportunities and can make their own choices after years of being cut off and apart from us.</p>
<p class="contents">I will go next week, because that was the agreement that I reached with – amongst others – Aung San Suu Kyi, who asked me to go after we had made the decisions about sanctions and in order to open the office. I respected her request in choosing the timing of my visit. I should say too that we have listened very carefully to her, as have leaders, ministers and parliamentarians who have visited her, the latest being the Prime Minister of the UK, Mr Cameron, who sent me a message about what she had said. My envoy, Robert Cooper, who has known her for many, many years, has visited four times in the last few months to ensure that we have been able to remain in good contact.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with everything that has been said about our need to move cautiously but properly, and to understand that the possible transformation that we are witnessing is absolutely and truly remarkable. What is interesting is that I have not met anybody who has been there who does not come back and talk with absolute admiration for what the President has done and the opportunities that are being opened up. For those who have followed this country’s actions over many years, there is also surprise that we find ourselves able to have this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish the people of Burma/Myanmar very well. I pay due regard to the work that the President has done, I pay enormous tribute to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and I very much look forward to passing on to her and to the President your very good wishes when I see them next week. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The party of Sakharov prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi – the National League for Democracy (NLD) – was able to participate in these elections. The international community judged these elections to be free and fair. At present, the opposition has just 6.6% of the seats in parliament (42 out of 659). It is my fervent hope that the reform process will continue. This is very important for the future of Burma.</p>
<p class="contents">It is equally important for the Burmese democracy to be a civilian one. For this reason, we encourage the Burmese authorities to change the constitution and to discontinue parliamentary seats that are guaranteed to Army representatives. We count on dialogue developing and leading to profound changes. For this reason, we call on the Council to introduce a temporary suspension of the sanctions that are currently in place, with the exception of the arms embargo. Sanctions should be suspended for a period of one year. During this time, European Union institutions should carefully monitor the situation in Burma. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been following the situation in Burma closely now for years, and, from time to time, I have also been very critical. At the same time, I have supported EU sanctions aimed at improving the situation. Now, however, it is time to start rewarding Burma for its reforms. President U Thein Sein has done more for peace and democracy in Burma than anyone else in that country for decades. In Burma, they have now realised that an open, democratic society that respects human rights is the best alternative for everyone. The elections in April showed that Burma’s political leadership is prepared to make room for Aung San Suu Kyi’s party and other opposition groups, and that we are witnessing the start of a new era. The European Parliament has now made a clear concession to Burma, and it is now time for the EU to lift economic sanctions against the country. When we ask for reforms to be introduced and that is done, we also have to reward our partners. Nevertheless, the reforms should not end here. The EU must monitor the situation in Burma closely. The real acid test for Burma will be the elections in 2015, which I assume will represent a continuation of the policies that have now been inaugurated. Before that happens, we should not lift the ban on the sale of weapons. I would ask Baroness Ashton to take advantage of the rapprochement that has resulted from new diplomatic relations. We Members of Parliament should also strengthen our ties with Burma’s political leadership, the opposition and civil society. At the same time, I hope that Burma’s leaders will develop an ever more open attitude towards us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One such issue that is of great concern is the war that is taking place in the Kachin State. There are currently an estimated 70 000 refugees that have fled fighting near their homes to live in temporary camps by the Sino-Burmese border. Also, there were no elections in Kachin, due to the fighting, and it appears this conflict will not end any time soon. The ethnic Kachins are running out of food, and diseases such as TB and malaria are spreading fast, and yet the Burmese Government will not allow any aid agencies in to assist these people. Thus, I feel that we must be cautious with our praise until this situation is resolved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
