In recent days and months, a Greater Europe has truly been taking shape. In less than twelve months, it will be possible to conclude the negotiations with the candidate countries that have satisfied the criteria set for enlargement, which will mean that the Union will be able to welcome up to ten new Member States before the next European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">In less than three weeks, the euro, the strongest and most visible sign of both the economic and political union of Europe, will become a tangible reality. Lastly, before the end of the week, the Laeken European Council will take the decision to set up a Convention, which will do the groundwork for the reform of the Treaties and, for the first time, bring together representatives of governments, national parliaments, the European Commission and this House. This greater Europe which is taking shape is a united, democratic, forward-looking Europe. The Commission has been working towards this in the year now drawing to a close and intends to continue to do so in the year that will shortly commence.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, before moving on to the work carried out by the Commission in 2001 and our programme for 2002, I would like to stress once again my belief that full, transparent cooperation between the institutions is essential for the smooth running of the Union. With this in mind, as early as January this year, I told you of the Commission's intention to revitalise our method of working together in order to make cooperation between our two institutions even more effective and transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Before setting out these proposals, I would like, however, to go through the fundamental principles on which, I believe, our cooperation must be based. Firstly, the Commission's right of initiative must be safeguarded, as it is one of the pillars of the Community structure and the guarantor of its integrity. A strong Commission means a strong European Parliament. Secondly, the tripartite nature of interinstitutional cooperation must be safeguarded. Indeed, it will only be effective if the two legislative bodies – Parliament and the Council – can enter into dialogue with the Commission on a common basis of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to my proposals for revitalising the system, which, I am sure, will help to greatly improve dialogue between our institutions. Firstly, from this year on, the work programme will no longer be a catalogue of planned legislation for that year; it will, as you have requested, be a genuine political programme. This programme, which the Commission hereby undertakes to follow closely, sets out both the priorities for the year in question and the initiatives needed to accomplish them. I know that some of you were surprised not to receive an annex to the 2002 work programme listing planned legislation, as has been the case in previous years. However, I want to point out that we listened very carefully to the views many of you expressed in this Chamber on 13 February. You asked the Commission, quite clearly, to abandon the method of listing legislative proposals employed thus far and to adopt a new method. We have made sure we complied with that request.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, which were also set out in writing by Mrs Fontaine on 10 September, we have replaced the catalogue with the much more reliable instrument of quarterly programming, which is what the College uses to plan its work and of which you will be informed at regular intervals. To maintain perfect transparency, however, I have also asked the Secretary-General of the Commission to forward immediately to the Secretary-General of Parliament the preliminary list of proposals put forward by the Commission departments which formed the basis for the work programme for 2002. If this approach produces positive results, we are willing to use it in future years as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is equally important to point out that, in future, the preparation of such a programme will need to be based on a more structured dialogue between our institutions. This is why we have planned a multi-stage approach for the forthcoming year, with the preparation of the work programme for 2003 starting at the beginning of 2002. The two key dates for this political dialogue will be in February, when I will come to present to you the political priorities approved by the Commission for 2003, and November, when I will come to set out to you the work programme the Commission has adopted on the basis of these priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussions at the Conference of Presidents have shown me that we are in agreement on the broad outline I have just described. For our part, we will make a start as soon as possible on establishing the details and commencing practical implementation. Mrs de Palacio, who, at my request, has begun a dialogue with you on this matter, will continue her work and the dialogue with the aim of concluding our agreement next January. Lastly, I feel it is important to stress that breaking the process down into stages should not increase our respective workloads but should enable us to continue to assume our respective responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the 2001 budget, the list of what has been done over the course of a year is too long for me to give you a detailed account here and now. I shall therefore confine myself to focusing on the areas in which the Union, with a decisive contribution from the Commission, has achieved its greatest successes in 2001: the preparations for the changeover to the euro; the progress made in the enlargement negotiations; relations with the Balkan countries; the dialogue with Russia; the opening of a new round of trade negotiations at Doha; the adoption of a strategy for sustainable development which goes far beyond the mere adoption of a series of specific measures and which will gradually bring us to review all our internal policies; and lastly, the reinvigoration of the process of creating a common European area of justice and security, which has had a particularly high profile since 11 September. Throughout the year, in each of these fields, the Commission's actions have benefited from the crucial support of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking ahead to 2002, to give you a clearer picture of our tasks for the coming year, I am also sure that you will allow me to present the seven priorities indicated by the Commission in its work programme for 2002 by grouping them under four key headings. These four major areas are internal security, the euro and economic and social matters, enlargement and, lastly, the Future of Europe debate and the process of reforming the Union’s institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The annual strategy we drew up last February revolved around six priorities. However, the events of 11 September – and you will all understand that any programme must be flexible if it is to deal with unforeseen circumstances – forced us to adopt a seventh. Therefore, in 2002, the Commission will present a number of measures to combat terrorism and organised crime and to safeguard the security of our citizens. They will include the launching of an integrated system for external border controls, the development of civil protection, public health measures and steps to improve transport safety. As I have already had the opportunity to say, when speaking at Bruges on 12 November, improving judicial and police cooperation will lay the foundations for the creation, in the longer term, of an integrated police force to combat organised crime and terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Ever since the beginning of its term of office, this Commission has included among the four cornerstones on which its work is based, the aim to extend Union action, hitherto primarily economic, to cover economic, social and environmental concerns. The programme for 2002 will not depart from this objective. The introduction of the euro will be the most significant as well as the most tangible step towards European integration. In this connection, I am particularly pleased that it has been possible to overcome all the political differences regarding cross-border payments, with the result that President Fontaine will shortly be able to announce the adoption of a common position. Thanks to the efforts made to prepare for the introduction of the euro, our economy is now strong, stable and, at the same time, the most open in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">What would have been the impact of 11 September if we had not had the euro? Stability is the basis for our future policies and we must safeguard it. The current economic situation is, of course, by no means easy, but I feel sure we will be able to overcome any short-term problems. We have the instruments to do so, and here I am referring, in particular, to the Stability Pact and the broad economic policy guidelines. We must, however, consider the need to improve the coordination of the budgetary policies of the countries in the euro zone. With the introduction of the single currency, our economies have never been as interdependent as they are now. With this in mind, I said recently that it might be advisable to concentrate on developing a code of conduct which would take specific account of the interdependence of the budgetary policies of the countries in the euro zone and would improve the overall coherence and the credibility of our economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">My major concerns relate more to the long term. Europe does indeed need structural reform. It is the prerequisite for sustainable growth and job creation. We already have the right recipe. In two fundamental steps, both completed during the first part of this Commission’s term of office – at Lisbon in March 2000 and at Gothenburg in June 2001 – the Member States undertook to work towards sustainable development that can combine competitiveness, social justice and respect for the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s work programme for 2002 confirms this line of action. The implementation of the undertakings given at Gothenburg is one of the seven priorities identified for next year. Our commitment to preparing for and making a success of the meeting in Johannesburg on sustainable development is consistent with this course.</p>
<p class="contents">So where do these worries stem from? From the delays between the official adoption of the decisions and their practical implementation. The boulder blocking the course of the development of Galileo, an essential initiative and technology for the growth and competitiveness of the European economy, is only the latest on a list of obstructions that is now simply too long. There is no need to mention them all; one example will suffice: the European patent. The inability to fulfil solemnly given and announced undertakings and the lack of will to proceed along the road towards final completion of the single market are costing Europe very dearly. The cost of the failure to deliver on Europe, which we could call the failure to deliver on Lisbon, is rapidly becoming intolerable.</p>
<p class="contents">The annual economic report that the Commission will present in just over a month’s time, indeed as part of the preparations for the Spring Council, will contain a detailed analysis of the situation, and substantial progress will, at last, have to be made in Barcelona. However, as I pointed out in Bruges, on its own, the Commission can do nothing. The Member States need to assume their responsibilities and make the decisions that are incumbent upon them. Parliament too, moreover, will have to play its part: I am still convinced, for example, that the failure to reach an agreement on the new public procurement legislation has hindered the development of our financial markets. In this sector, the European economy is clearly weaker than its American counterpart.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the numerous factors that combine to make the economy healthy and, in 2002, it will present particularly important legislative proposals regarding banking and financial services. We will also present a strategy for consumer protection and measures to support private investment in research and development. One currency, one financial market and one economic policy, this must be our objective.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, our main worry concerns an essential requirement for social cohesion, employment. This will be the case in 2002 and will remain so for many years to come. This is why, in Barcelona, we will present a communication on the social aspects of the restructuring of companies, aimed at the social partners, as we are convinced that there is a positive correlation between social protection and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Completing the enlargement process and making it a success for the whole of the Union, that has been the Commission's number one priority since it first took office. It was on 13 October 1999 when, addressing this same House, I called upon the European Council to complete the reforms necessary for enlargement before the end of 2002 and stressed that the Commission was confident that negotiations with the countries fulfilling the accession criteria could be concluded by that date. Today, the date of 2002 has been formally endorsed by the Union. The progress achieved in the course of two years has been impressive. We still have before us, as I am only too aware, further stages in the negotiations that will be extremely sensitive – I need only mention the chapters on the Structural Funds or agriculture – but over the next twelve months, to those countries whose efforts have brought them to a state of readiness, the door will, at last, open, allowing them to join before the next elections to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Two thousand and two will be a pivotal year, then, and the Commission's programme faithfully reflects its importance. This is not only because, as I pointed out just now, we must forge ahead with the negotiations and bring them to a successful conclusion; it is also because we must gradually begin to identify, for each of the common policies, the objectives and instruments made necessary by the new situation of an enlarged Union with new Member States. In the course of 2002, but even more so in 2003 and 2004 (and the same will apply to our successors in the years after that), we will have to bring about a genuine ‘intellectual revolution’. It is our discussions, our plans and our action that will shape the greater Europe. It is essential for the Commission to adjust to the new dimensions of Europe, but it is just as important for the other EU institutions and for the Member States of the Union to do so as well. We must explain this new situation to our citizens to help them overcome their anxieties and make them aware of the human, cultural and economic opportunities offered by enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">From an economic standpoint, enlargement is one of the few games in which all the players stand to win. It will bring an increase in growth not only for the new Member States but also for the Fifteen. Of course, the impact of enlargement within the Union will vary from one country to another and from one region to another. Thanks to the single market, however, the benefits will be visible everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not enough for this greater Europe just to expand geographically to the east and the south. It must continue on the path of gradual rapprochement with the Balkans and project an arc of stability from its own gates towards Russia and the Ukraine and towards the Mediterranean. In preparation for the meeting in Valencia in April, the Commission will table proposals for improving the functioning of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, particularly in the fields of education and culture. Also in the course of next year, it will propose measures for stimulating investment, improving cooperation in the field of immigration and strengthening the Union's role in the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is an accomplishment of historic significance. However, it must not lead to paralysis of the Union. This is the background against which the debate on European governance is taking place, a debate that the Commission helped to launch with its White Paper. It is crucial that the dialogue between our two institutions on the issues raised by the White Paper and the ensuing action should continue, and the work programme for 2002 lays down the details of this.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on Europe and on the future has, however, spread well beyond the confines of the White Paper and has taken on a more clearly Constitutional tone. Moreover, right from the beginning of its mandate, this Commission has fought for renewed vigour to be injected into the institutional debate in the Union. As early as September 1999, addressing you here in this same Chamber, I insisted that the Intergovernmental Conference to be held in 2000 should adopt a broader agenda, above and beyond the ‘Amsterdam leftovers’. At that time, I told you of my fears that the IGC would merely tinker with the machinery and not give us effective tools to take decisions. After the essential but undoubtedly minimal agreement reached in Nice, the Commission, along with Parliament, immediately lent its support to the idea of a Convention, something which has now been generally agreed. I warmly welcome this development because I am firmly convinced that this is the right path to take if we are to build the new, more democratic, more transparent Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, a wide-ranging debate on the future of the Union is already taking place in all the European countries, and that debate must be ongoing and must provide input for the work of the Convention. The time when we could go on putting off the necessary reforms until tomorrow, as if events would always unfold slowly enough to await our decisions, is over. A major contribution to this discussion has already been made by the Mendez de Vigo and Kaufmann report and by the plenary debate which Parliament held on the topic.</p>
<p class="contents">In preparation for the Laeken Council, the Commission presented a communication on 5 December. As we explained in that document, which is intended merely to provide a few pointers for the debate, the key to the problem lies in renewing and strengthening the Community method. Our aim should not be to interfere with the balances that have been built up over the last fifty years. Rather, what we should be doing is modernising our system and enabling the peoples of Europe to identify with it. What the Convention should, in my view, produce is a coherent text, underpinned by its own logic, not a mere shopping list; a text adopted by consensus, which therefore does not seek unanimity at any price and which, to avoid scaling down its essential ambitions, voices minority views where necessary; a simpler, more easily readable text which clearly sets out not only the principles guiding our action – and the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be at the heart of those principles – but also the goals to which we are aspiring; a text which makes the way in which the European public authorities work more transparent, that is which gives a clear description of both the institutions and the instruments necessary for achieving the objectives they are assigned; and lastly, a text that is capable of evolving and is therefore, to this end, a combination of a set of fundamental rules and some more technical provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Before the Convention begins its work, the Commission will state its position on many issues, such as the powers of the Union and of the Member States, the strengthening of Parliament's legislative role, the distinction between the Council's executive and legislative functions, and the Commission's executive tasks. The extension of majority voting, the procedures for revising the Treaties and the Union's own resources are other issues that also form part of the political debate and will have to be addressed in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Before leaving the subject of the forthcoming Convention, I would like to focus for a moment on an issue that is usually summed up by one word: the Constitution. For me, what is essential is not the name eventually given to the text that grows out of the work of the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference. My objective is that that text, by virtue of its content and thanks to the open, democratic nature of the process that generated it, should ultimately be regarded by everyone as having the force of a Constitution. I am confident that the work programme for 2002 will provide the foundation on which, over the next twelve months, our two institutions can build a relationship of close, constant, fruitful cooperation.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the presidency welcomes this debate on the Commission work for the 2002 programme. Last year, there was still a great deal of disapproval from Parliament with regard to the Council’s absence during this important debate. Mr Poettering, in response to your claim that European policy is being neglected by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, I can assure you that this is not the case and that we do not shy away from public debates, but you know this by now.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, this debate is not a matter of course for the presidency. First of all, we are giving our verdict on a document that is only a few days old and which the presidency has received for perusal only very recently. Secondly, participation in this debate is a difficult balancing act for the presidency, while needless to say, your Parliament can, and, I would even so far as to say, must, focus on the implementation of its supervisory role.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with you that the policy of the Council and the Commission must be as coherent as possible. This concern about coherence is also shared by the Council and the Commission and is, moreover, borne out in the facts. As you know, that is exactly why the Belgian Presidency has started to present status reports on the other Council divisions to the General Affairs Council. Our presidency has done this to enable the General Affairs Council to coordinate all activities of the various Council divisions, and thus to guarantee internal coherence and compliance with the Union’s general objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, each institution is, of course, autonomous in drafting its own work schedule and deciding upon its own emphases. Moreover, the institutions must respect each other’s autonomy. Mr President of the Commission and Commissioners, the purpose of my visit today is therefore not to assess the Commission and its work document critically nor to weigh it up against the Council’s past achievements and future priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We were very interested to read the work programme, since the Commission has focused on its core tasks and core objectives and therefore no longer gives a full overview of its activities, as the President pointed out, which – and I have been witness to this in the past – used to result in a long list of legislative and policy measures. In its current form, the work programme has unmistakably gained in clarity. We are delighted that the Commission is largely on target with the realisation of the strategic objectives for the 2000-2005 period. Indeed, with regard to the internal reform operations, such as in the field of enlargement negotiations and negotiations regarding the new multi-lateral trade round, the reconstruction of the western Balkans, as well as negotiations regarding climate change, the Commission has indeed taken its role of driving force very seriously over the year which is now about to end, and has acted each time Community action was crucial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, issues such as accession negotiations, the successful launch of the euro, sustainable development or the fight against terrorism and crime will continue to be of great interest to us. We will, of course, need to continue to coordinate, as best we can, the action of the various institutions in the European Union in order that specific objectives can be reached. I am sure you will understand, however, that, as the representative of a presidency that is coming to the end of its term, it is difficult for me to, in effect, put myself in the place of the forthcoming presidencies in presenting the Council’s work schedule for the year 2002. The presentation of the programme for the forthcoming Spanish Presidency to the European Parliament will no doubt allow this debate to take place and deepen. I would however like to make a few comments.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the fight against terrorism and crime, and advances in the security of European citizens after the tragic events of 11 September, it has to be said that, at a European level, every effort has been made to provide an adequate, rapid and coherent response to these issues. We fully share the objective of offering citizens a high level of protection within an area of freedom, security and justice, and I would like to underline the constructive way in which the Council and the European Parliament have worked together on this matter, with the full cooperation of the Commission. We have had proof of this this very morning, Madam President, with Parliament’s agreement to urgent procedure. Terrorism is a great challenge for both Europe and the rest of the world. We therefore need to continue our efforts to strengthen police and judicial cooperation. This common area of freedom, security and justice, which is yet to be achieved, remains one of our major concerns. It is essential that we maintain the momentum in asylum and immigration by implementing the Tampere conclusions. There is still a considerable amount of work to do and the Laeken European Council will provide a new impetus. The introduction of euro notes and coins, in addition to the generalised usage of the new representative and electronic money will constitute an unprecedented qualitative leap forward in the development of Economic and Monetary Union. After the abolition of borders, which created a large internal market, the euro will be, for economic operators and for European citizens themselves, the second tangible manifestation of European integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners. A sustainable development strategy for the European Union requires an integrated approach which takes account of economic, social and ecological aspects in a balanced manner. In this respect, the Council monitors this balance between the social, economic and environment-technical indicators. These indicators are fundamental for the summary report on the strategy on sustainable development which the Commission is to draft for the European Council of Barcelona. Indeed, progress that has been made since this strategy was laid down by the European Council of Gothenburg in June 2001, will be assessed for the first time on that occasion. In future, the strategy will be assessed annually at the spring meetings of the European Council. And this will be done in Barcelona for the first time.</p>
<p class="contents">Remarkable progress has been made in the accession negotiations, and it looks like the objectives will be met. It will be possible to fully meet the deadline that was laid down in Nice and clarified in Gothenburg. Consequently, it should be possible for the accession negotiations involving the countries which will be ready next year, to be completed. This will enable them to take part in the European elections of 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The pace of the Council’s activities is perfectly in keeping with that of the successive Council presidencies, and this will undoubtedly continue to be the case in future. The Commission and the Council ensure that the quantitative aspects of these accession processes do not overshadow the qualitative dimension. By this, I mean that it is important for the candidate countries to incorporate the <span class="italic">acquis</span> in their system of law. Additionally, it is equally important for them simultaneously to adapt and modernise their administrations, further develop their legal capacity and apply the <span class="italic">acquis</span> in practice. </p>
<p class="contents">The considerable attention which is being devoted today to the administrative and legal capacity of the candidate countries finds its origin in this concern.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the presidency is pleased to note that the Mediterranean area has been earmarked as a priority for 2002. This will give the Barcelona process a new impulse and strengthen the instruments involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Normally, if we praise someone and express our appreciation for anyone, it is for the President of this Parliament. We often have occasion to express our thanks and praise for her. However, today I would like to say a word of appreciation to the Council, and to you, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, for being here today for the first time, as our President has just said. Last time round I was critical because the Council was not represented. If the Council pursues a good policy, even if it concerns working methods, then that deserves our appreciation. You are a Belgian; you represent the Belgian Presidency. I would like to thank you very sincerely on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats not only for being here today, but also for the committed way you have worked during your presidency.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to address the President of the Commission. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have a very high regard for the President of the Commission, for his personal integrity and for his positive attitude. However, if we want to achieve joint successes, these successes have to be based on truthfulness and on sensible working methods and structures. Mr Prodi, you know of course that the political groups in the European Parliament prepare each part-session here in Strasbourg by means of their work in group meetings in Brussels. Many members of my group said last week in Brussels, when we were doing our preparatory work, that the 2002 work programme was on the agenda, but where was the document that we could have used to prepare for this debate in Strasbourg? Many members were in favour of striking this debate from the agenda. Mr Prodi, I have to tell you that this should not happen again, we must never again find ourselves without a working document for such an important debate. I would ask you to ensure in future – and this is not just your task as President but rather one for the Commission as a whole, and for your staff – that documents are made available in good time and that the European Parliament is treated seriously, so that we can work in a reasonable way, which is in both our interest and yours.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Reasonable working methods are essential if we are to succeed here. If we do not have reasonable working methods and structures, we do not have any chance of succeeding. We want to work towards joint success because we are firmly convinced that the Commission and this House, as committed advocates of the Community method, need to work towards the same goals. So if you have any colleagues who do not take Parliament so seriously, it is therefore in their own interest to consider whether working methods should not be restructured in their field. We are not just offering you and your fellow Commissioners a hand; we also need a sensible form of cooperation if we are to achieve joint successes. For that reason, relations between Parliament and the Commission need to be in good order. That is something that you want as well, but in that case the fine words that we certainly appreciate also need to be matched by specific practical action when it comes to cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">A programme like the one we have before us deserves to be supported by all the Members of the Commission, and indeed we have five Members of the Commission with us today, which is more than usual, but this programme covers all areas of work in 2002. You yourself said that you are effectively the European government, an idea with which we in our group have a great deal of sympathy. However, if you are effectively the European government, then the whole government should be here, with all your Members. I would very much welcome it if that were the case next time.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, when we are setting our agenda during the meeting of political group chairmen, we often hear that Commissioner A, B or C cannot be here in Strasbourg at such and such a time. I really must urge you, given that we are only talking about four days each month – Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday – to ensure that all Members of the Commission keep those days free. If Parliament asks for Commissioners to be here, then they should come, and the excuse that they have other commitments is not acceptable. Parliament should have priority over any other commitments the Commission may have.</p>
<p class="contents">There are of course exceptions – I say that because I see Commissioner Lamy is with us – when there are major world conferences on the international calendar, such as the Doha Conference, which Mr Lamy and Mr Fischler of course have to attend. We are not insisting on this point 100%, but basically speaking Parliament must have priority over other Commission activities.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may now turn to the substance of the programme, Mr President of the Commission, we largely support what you have said. We are in agreement, and for that reason we should cooperate sensibly and effectively. We now expect, like you, that next weekend in Laeken the Heads of State and Government will give the Convention an ambitious mandate so as to achieve a really positive reform of the EU institutions. We recommend that an early start should be made on this work, at the end of February or the beginning of March, so that the Convention can be concluded at the end of 2003 under the Italian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support what you have said about enlargement. Up to 10 new countries could be included in the first round. This is not the time to say which those countries will be. However, we do not agree with the French Minister for Foreign Affairs when he says that we should accept all the Central European countries, as when we make a decision on this in autumn 2002, we can only accept those countries which meet the conditions. Those countries that do not meet the conditions cannot yet expect to join the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not acceptable for countries like Hungary to have to wait because other countries are not yet ready. Those countries that do meet the conditions should not be held back because other countries are not yet ready, and we hope that the decisions made at that point will be the right ones. We also fully support your comments about the Mediterranean region. We need to work with great commitment under the Barcelona Process, which is becoming ever more urgent and involves an ever greater contribution to stability. You mentioned how important stability is for us if we want to make Europe truly competitive, because it is not enough for us simply to declare that the European Union is to become the most competitive area in the world. We also have to take the necessary structural measures, and that means in particular strengthening Europe as a location for investment. There should not just be tax incentives for major corporations, but also for medium-sized companies, so that they too can invest, and when investments are made that leads to the creation of jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall wind up now, Madam President. We have an ambitious programme, we support the Commission and we call on the Commission and the Council for us all to work together, as there should not be any competition between our various institutions, because we are all committed to the same Europe, and that is why the Commission, the Council and Parliament must each fulfil their own responsibilities. We are prepared to do so, and will support the other institutions when they do the same.</p>

I believe that this is a type of training with a future.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, Mr President of the Commission, we must resolve the disagreement between us with sincerity and frankness. At the beginning of the legislature, my group asked the Commission to present a political programme for the purposes of the vote on its investiture, and that programme, as we said at the time, had to lead to an adjustment of the annual programme, not only in legislative terms.</p>
<p class="contents">What happened the other day in the Conference of Presidents, however, and what has happened again today, requires clarification. We have not asked you not to present the legislative programme, nor after the deadline. What we have asked is that you present a political programme, and you have produced a working programme: this is all very well, and we take note of it, but we also want a legislative programme, because we are one of the parties to codecision. And proof that we were right lies in the fact that I was told, last night, by e-mail, that the legislative programme had arrived as an annex.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we are able to respect the deadlines and agreements we are party to and, on that basis, you can organise the work as you see fit: by means of ‘planning’, ‘programming’, ‘rolling on’, or whatever you want. I very much fear that the number of officials filling in forms is going to increase. But that is your problem. You must fulfil your commitments to Parliament. In this respect, Mr President, I must say that you must improve the department or service of your secretariat which deals with mail, because we have raised a parliamentary question on how you are going to deal with the issue of the flax fine, specifically in Spain, and four Group Chairmen, despite the fact that the Liberal Group and the PPE-DE Group have blocked this question, which should have been seen in this House, have written to you and we are awaiting a reply. It is important – and I am happy that the Vice-President of the Commission is here – that we do not allow issues to fester. I would therefore be grateful if you could be more diligent with regard to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">These problems relating to the programme are mere child’s play compared to the current situation. We are on the eve of the Laeken Summit and the fundamental issue is the defence of the Community method. And I say this because dark clouds are appearing on the horizon. Yesterday in this House, on behalf of my group – and I am pleased that the President-in-Office of the Council is here – we strongly supported the Belgian Presidency of the Council and the Council itself with regard to an issue which we feel is very important – I believe that President Verhofstadt is in Rome today – and that is that we manage to introduce, as fifteen countries, the anti-terrorist legislation which this Parliament, the Council and the Commission have supported. We believe that this is an important defence of the Community method. If it is not done by 15 countries, it will be done by 14. We would prefer it to be 15, but this is an issue on which we clearly support them.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also currently concerned about the fact, and I am referring to a point which Mr Poettering highlighted yesterday, that certain governments, of Austria and Italy, are opposed to democratic criteria appearing in the statute on political parties.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Laeken, Mr President of the Commission, the most interesting part of your speech was the final part, when you not only supported the Convention, but you gave it content, in complete agreement with the approach contained in the Leinen-Méndez de Vigo report. In relation to the Convention, I would ask you to defend what you have said here today in the European Council in Laeken, to make a coherent proposal and that that proposal, even if it has to be cooled down and digested, is not left on the shelf. I would like to know how that is going to be coordinated with the timetable for enlargement and the reform of the Treaties before 2004, and what your position is with regard to the membership of the praesidium of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, finally, do not leave the secretariat of the Convention to the Council; we must all participate in it, because a broader distribution always brings the best results. And, in this respect, Mr President, I would ask you to expand on the replies you have given in relation to the Convention. You call on Parliament and the Commission to work together – and I believe we can do great things in defence of the Community method – but it is important that you have the courage and the capacity to make use of your monopoly on initiative, which must not simply be a monopoly on operation, but which must be a means for achieving what you have proposed: texts of constitutional value and, above all, which reflect the democracy and transparency which we want in this enlarged Union.</p>

I regret that my remarks today will mostly be about process rather than content, because I think that we still have not found the correct process. I would, however, like to salute the work the Commission has done this year and to acknowledge the enormous progress in the preparation of the launch of the euro; the very substantial progress on enlargement which we very much welcome; the work which is being done in south-eastern Europe; the break-through on the World Trade Organisation and the very stimulating programme on sustainable development. All of those and the work on the common area of justice and security are to the credit of the Commission. I very much agree with the focus of next year's priorities which are sensible and acceptable, particularly in that we need to work closely together on promoting the Community method in building the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, questions in the legislative programme to which we need answers. Why last year was only 45% of the programme processed by this time of the year and 55% not? How is it that 117 or 118 new items not foreseen were added? I do not mind flexibility – that is good in politics – but this seems rather more chaotic than one's definition of flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully respect the Commission's right of initiative, but I would urge that the Commission should not simply start in February with a general statement of priorities and then, in November, bring forward a specific work programme. We need an intensive dialogue between times and some intermediate staging-posts at which to make evaluations.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe, Mr President of the Commission, like you, in good governance and this Parliament will commit itself to being a high quality player in terms of the input and impact on co-legislation, but that requires criteria. We need to discuss with each other – and this is not an attempt to interfere with the right of initiative of the Commission – is the law necessary? Is it proportionate? Does it respect subsidiarity? Is it transparent and accountable? What are the options for implementation? Can we do some kind of regulatory impact assessment before we go down the line?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission already has a wonderful process of consultation in place with social partners. Share this process with us as well, not because we want to interfere with your right to make the final call, but because we too are players and we cannot be left to one side or not get documents till the eve of a debate. Our President has communicated to you a scheme that we would commend. Our Conference of Presidents backs what she has said. Our Committee on Constitutional Affairs backs what she has said and if we can do that, next year we will discuss politics more and process less. We have got to get it right. We have to do this early to avoid a repetition of this unnecessary mutual incomprehension which helps none of us to bring good governance to the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, you told us that you wanted full and transparent cooperation between the Commission and Parliament. That is all very well. You told us: ‘To be strong, the European Parliament needs a strong Commission’. We agree. But you must understand that we cannot accept being treated as the Commission’s obedient stooge. We of course unreservedly acknowledge the fact that it is very important that the work programme is clearly comprehensible politically, which is the case here; this does not, however, exempt you from presenting a legislative programme. And yet, today we have to deal with a work programme that was sent to us at the last moment and a legislative programme of which we had no knowledge before last night.</p>
<p class="contents">It is difficult for us to work under such conditions. The European Parliament is already suffering from having no right of legislative initiative, even in areas where the Commission is failing to act – which is, in my opinion, an institutional anomaly that should be corrected in order to reduce the democratic deficit. However, Parliament does enjoy the power of active cooperation, which is recognised by the Commission. I would remind you that, from the start of this Parliamentary term, a framework agreement exists between ourselves and the Commission, an agreement that clearly defines the role of Parliament in the legislative process. In accordance with this agreement, the legislative programme for 2002 should have been presented to us in October, accompanied by an assessment of the previous programme; in this way we would have been able to make criticisms, remarks and proposals at a politically appropriate time and within reasonable timescales.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also underline the extent to which it would be appropriate, on a political level, for political debates on the budget and the legislative programme to mutually support and complement each other. October or November would be an appropriate time for this to take place. Today, we are two months late and there is no legislative programme, or rather, we have only just discovered one exists.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these conditions, I think that Parliament is <span class="italic">de facto</span> deprived of its powers of control and influence, which is not a good thing. I would also like to remind you of some concrete facts: on 30 November, just a few days ago, less than half of the programme for 2001 had been executed. In addition to this, half of the initiatives taken were not included in the legislative programme for 2001. This is astonishing at the very least. It must, of course, be admitted that the unforeseen events that took place, which completely turned the political agenda on its head, justified the tabling of proposals to take account of such upheavals, but a careful reading of the texts shows that, to a great extent, these new proposals have nothing to do with the present situation, or, in any case, could have been tabled at some other time, rather than within the context of the programme for 2001. In my opinion, this reveals, and I think that most Members in my group would agree, that there is quite a significant degree of disorder within the Commission and a lack of common vision of the guidelines that should direct the common work of our institutions. The explanations that you give us to justify this, which relate to the Commission’s internal reforms, will not satisfy us forever. I would point out that these explanations have been given since the start of this legislature. We cannot accept, Mr President, that the European Parliament be deprived of its powers of control, which are clearly recognised; this situation is not good for either Parliament or for the Commission itself. At a time when we are talking about good governance, of reconciliation with the European citizen, the most fundamental thing is that commitments made and Parliament’s prerogatives be respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today we are debating the Commission's work programme, and I wish to say that my group supports the general resolution by the various political groups concerning this programme. Why? Because there is an interinstitutional agreement between two institutions, and I do not think this House is being unreasonable in expecting the Commission to adhere to the undertakings it has given Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, in your White Paper on European Governance there is much talk about how Europe could be better governed. However, you are not performing one of the most elementary tasks, that is to say the presentation of a legislative programme. I heard this morning that an e-mail with an attachment arrived last night. The text that I am familiar with so far is a work programme which as far as I can see is simply full of platitudes. It includes announcements about comprehensive packages of measures, other measures are to be proposed, specific measures are being prepared, and so it goes on for 20 pages. But what the Council and Parliament need to know above all, and in good time, is what legislation will actually be presented, and, first and foremost, why. We need to know what the basis for this legislation is so that we can act in unison here.</p>
<p class="contents">I must not forget to point out that the national parliaments, which also have a certain role in this process, and a not inconsiderable one at that, have some problems with the whole process. This is a problem that has to be solved, Mr Prodi.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have a few more comments about your communication for the Laeken Summit. I consider that it contains some extremely interesting ideas that are worth supporting. It is true to say that limiting ourselves strictly to the four priorities identified in Nice would weaken the credibility of the Convention, in other words the list of issues to be addressed needs to be widened in order to meet the public's expectations and to ensure that the enlarged Union will have a viable future.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I also have to say that with this paper too, I kept asking myself why the Commission was showing so little courage and vision in the run-up to such an important summit. What will the public think if the Commission talks about defending a certain European ideal, as it does in the document, in such an unambitious way? What ideal are we talking about then? What is the process of deepening that we are all in favour of to be like, and why should it just relate to democracy, as the document suggests? I really find it rather mysterious why, with an eye to Laeken and particularly when we are envisaging convening a historic convention, we do not quite simply say, yes, our common goal is to create a truly democratic Europe. Furthermore, Mr Prodi, I expect, in view of all this, that in future the Commission will act far more energetically in its capacity as the motor of European integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It may be toppled by new scandals involving fraud, because the former cases of fraud have not been cleared up and because the reforms that might have prevented new cases have not been introduced. The Commission may also be toppled by Parliament through a vote of no confidence. I believe it is heading for the end of the road if it does not change course now. Parliament’s committee chairmen have asked for what are known as the screening reports on the negotiations with the applicant countries. Parliament’s group chairpersons have repeated the request. Still we have not received them. MEPs sit every day in committee meetings without the relevant and up-to-date papers from the secret legislative process. There is solemn talk of Parliament as co-legislator, but the legislative power has, in reality, been taken over by officials and ministers in the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We are humiliated the whole time. People who are humiliated can one day deliver a vote of no confidence to the Commission. After the ground rules had been agreed, we should have had the Commission’s legislative programme in October. We have now been given an essay containing general reflections and, yesterday evening, a summary containing little detail. However, we have still not been given a proper catalogue of laws. The Commission should present its annual programme, stating its proposed legal base for this, so that, in the case of each proposal, we can adopt a position on whether the Commission is respecting the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. That is not only a right we possess. It is a duty imposed by the Treaty on each individual institution. All the institutions must ensure that the EU does not adopt rules which the Member States can devise just as well or better. We are asking for an independent discussion of the annual programme as it relates to the proximity principle, and we agree with the other groups in criticising the way in which the Commission keeps its plans secret. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet it is a religion, ladies and gentlemen, which has lost its god, for the Community method that you are all upholding was based on the centrality of the Commission, and the Commission no longer has that pivotal status. The Commission is no longer at the centre of our European integration, it is no longer – as it was when there were six or nine States – the driving force of European integration. The 15-State Europe has already brought a number of institutional innovations: Mr CFSP is totally outside the Commission’s control. Well then, ladies and gentlemen, I would like my friend Mr Méndez de Vigo and a great many others to answer this crucial question: do you really think that countries like France and Germany, in particular, not to mention the United Kingdom, of course, will place their confidence in a 25-member Commission, working according to the principle of collegiality, and trust it to take fundamental decisions? That is impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission as it was conceived, to be the central, driving force of the Community method, is no longer, and unless we change the system of European integration radically, the Commission will be increasingly reduced to playing the role of Council secretariat. It is, therefore, a Commission that needs to make an effort to change. However, I feel, Chairman Poettering, that we are, so to speak, firing on the relief workers, for the problem is institutional, it is Laeken; we need to make radical changes to the institutional system to restore the Commission’s former power and legitimacy. Only with the American system – with a separate Executive, with the President of the Commission being directly elected, with a scrutinising Parliament safeguarding our Constitutional framework – can we have a properly functioning Europe, a strong Commission, a strong Parliament and a strong Assembly of Member States; otherwise, our Commission’s role will increasingly be reduced to that of Council secretariat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, as a matter of principle, we have the institutional agreement of 1993, which says that the programme should be presented by October, and then our agreement of 2000, under which we are to have a broad debate about the programme before it is implemented. Neither of these have been fulfilled in this particular case. Why is this totally insufficient? Firstly, the programme which is presented to us lacks focus. It is somewhat difficult to see priorities when you have seven of them and, within the priorities, lots of themes which are generating new ideas. If you have more than three priorities, as Bob Zoellick, the USTR, said, you lose yourself in detail and you can never focus on what is really important.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have a lack of detail. I understand that we now have a legislative programme sent by e-mail, but Parliament has not been associated with this and it seems, as other speakers have said, that we had a legislative programme which was not implemented this year. Mr Barón Crespo is right that we did not want it. We wanted a political programme and legislative programme and Parliament to be associated with that.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is a lack of coordination: not just coordination among ourselves but with the national parliaments. As Mrs Kaufmann said: how is it possible to establish a programme for the European Union if not all the actors who are concerned at political level are associated with it? This leads me to say that we were better off with President Santer. We were better off with the last Commission as regards the way in which the programme is presented. At least we had a programme in its outline and there was a real effort to try to get institutional priorities, and we had a legislative programme with details, which we could see in front of us.</p>
<p class="contents">My conclusion today is that the Commission is there to propose. It has the right of initiative but it is not the European government. It cannot come to us and say this is what the European Union's programme is going to be and expect us simply to accept everything that is in its documents. Do you not agree, Mr President, that it would be better for the success of the European Union if we were to go back to presentation of the proposals of the legislative programme in October? We would then be able to discuss, debate, consult on and conclude a programme which the Union could put forward for the year ahead. If you have all of us with you, you will be better off than if we have interinstitutional wars, which you seem to have started this morning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first dilemma we face is that as President of the Commission you have quite rightly, and we must be fair about this, presented a political programme. However, the political programme needs to be underpinned by the legislative programme required to implement the political objectives, and that is what is missing.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, your programme does not really address the problem that we have, in fact, implemented very little of the 2001 programme. You did at one point suggest that Parliament and the Council were to blame, but I believe that the Commission is really responsible for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this House has, particularly this year, either rejected or substantially amended various Commission proposals. How are you going to cope with the framework that this Parliament has set? Your Vice-President, Mrs Loyola de Palacio, could perhaps help you here, and particularly in the fields of the environment and of transport there are very few proposals and indications as to how “sustainability” is to be made a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that there is a whole raft of problems with implementation. In your paper you do indeed refer to implementation problems. But the Commission, too, has implementation problems. From the time when the Commission takes decisions and makes financial commitments to the time when monies are actually paid out, it is not uncommon for not just months but whole years to go by. That is why it is also important for the Commission to consider how it can improve its own implementation, and, of course, also how national governments can improve implementation of their legislative intentions or the legislative intentions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the dilemma over the Laeken communication, a dilemma that I have personally and probably share with most of us here. It is a good paper and its goals are good. The only problem, Mr President of the Commission, is this: why it is so ambivalent, so tentative, and so vague? There is one sentence in which the Commission considers that it is opportune to examine the possibility of providing the Union with a constitutional text. Why do you not come out and say quite plainly that you are in favour of such a text, whether you call it a constitution or a charter or whatever? This kind of language typifies the way in which the Commission fails to clearly express what it stands for. I believe that at this particular moment this is especially important, as we are to have a convention. Except that this convention will chiefly consist of Members of Parliament from the individual Member States. We are talking here about representatives of our national governments, whereas for the Community method, which is quite rightly a matter of concern, there are Members of the European Parliament and representatives of the Commission. If the Council – and I am addressing this comment to you, Madam President-in-Office – on top of all that decides to appoint a former prime minister, or as now seems likely, a former president, as president of the convention, rather than a former President of the Commission, then I fear that the convention will from the outset be stigmatised to some extent by the fact that the majority of its members will not be guided by the Community method, and that the majority will perhaps not be particularly interested in strengthening the Commission and the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, I believe that at such a stage and in the present situation, the Commission document that you adopted at the end of December should have used clearer language. You partly admitted that in your speech to us today. It is not a question of saying we could, we ought to or we should – it is question of the Commission saying that it believes we must strengthen the Community dimension, and of the Commission saying that it believes Parliament should be strengthened as the central legislative institution of the European Union. To that extent we are faced with a dilemma about saying that you are right. It would be unfair to reject what you have said today. But the dilemma we face is that in such a sensitive political situation we need a Commission and a Commission President who are willing to say in even stronger, clearer and more unambiguous terms what needs doing – namely that the European Union as a whole needs to be strengthened, and that the Community method will take Europe into the future.</p>

Allow me, however, to welcome the fact that a kind of evaluation from the year gone by is included and that there is more strategic thinking when it comes to the Commission’s intended way of working.</p>
<p class="contents">Now let us talk about the future, however. President Prodi outlined, of course, how it will be possible in future to deal with the issue of the annual programme. As Parliament’s rapporteur, I have had the opportunity to monitor this matter for quite a long time. I hope we can conclude it soon and begin work on the programme for 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">As the co-decision procedure has developed, Parliament and the Council, too, must also play a larger role in devising the annual programme. That does not mean that the Commission’s right of initiative is being questioned, but that all three institutions should be more in step in encouraging both openness and efficiency in our joint work. Moreover, it would then be easier for national parliaments and citizens to follow the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the timetable is concerned, it looks as if we can now perhaps agree. There is an introductory presentation of the general priorities, followed by thorough discussions between the Commission and the committees concerned with a view to establishing the details. It is important for the parliamentary committees to be involved at an early stage because it is the committees which will then deal with the proposal. We can then present the definitive proposal by no later than the beginning of November.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the content of the programme, last year’s criticism does not mean that we do not want any legislative proposals. On the contrary, our common framework agreement states that what we are concerned with here is the annual legislative programme. Parliament has demanded clear proposals in order of precedence, explanatory statements with timetables, budget references, legal bases and information about who is responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Follow-up and evaluation must also be improved. As we have seen, a very great many proposals are being re-introduced, at the same time as other proposals are disappearing. It should be possible to set up a joint database to monitor the decision-making process for each topic.</p>
<p class="contents">A process which is clear, open and predictable should benefit all the institutions and also the citizens we are here to serve. It is our joint responsibility to ensure that this happens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the objective, it states that we must, and I quote, ‘draw up credible guidelines in order that an enlarged Europe can achieve political, economic and social integration’. And yet, if the different peoples of Europe really do want common cooperation and work at a European level, none of them has, to my knowledge, ever asked for this extreme type of integration, that is to say political, economic and social unification, by means of a democratic consultation. The objective today is not to strengthen this ‘integration-unification’, headed by supranational institutions, which we do not want, but to better organise and make more effective the nations’ control over Brussels. Under these conditions, the Community method, useful on occasions, should not become the rule, for it is too supranational, too rigid, and removes the Union from the reality of its citizens. It should be provided with procedures which are more flexible, founded on respect for national democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the forthcoming Convention should mainly rely upon national parliaments, which should work within networks. And to start with, it is these national parliaments which should have the task of organising the debate with their citizens and to put forward proposals without having to pass through an artificial forum of associations, which are European in name but not at all representative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These challenges are very clear – how to revitalise our economies just a few weeks before the introduction of the single currency, how to take advantage of the challenges and opportunities offered by accession, with 13 countries seeking entry to the Union and, at the same time, how to reinvent Europe in a situation and at a moment when we are about to begin the work of a convention aimed at preparing a new Intergovernmental Conference, the objective of which must be to prevent the ‘Old Continent’ becoming an outdated continent.</p>
<p class="contents">This Commission’s working programme for 2002 is accompanied by a communication on the Community method. I believe that that is an absolutely fundamental issue and we would be making a grave error if were to devote ourselves entirely to incidental issues and allow what is really crucial at the moment to stagnate.</p>
<p class="contents">Next year there will be elections in several countries of the European Union and we need an institution which not only cares for the coming generations, but which takes account of their concerns and challenges. And that institution must be the European Commission, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the time to analyse the decimal points presented to us by financial analysts. This is a time for considering the broader picture and I believe, Mr President, that it would be a serious mistake for this Parliament to exaggerate the errors which may be made by the European Commission. I want to say this, Mr President, because it is in the interest of Parliament and the Community as a whole to have a strong Commission. It therefore seems to me that, before preaching about how to sort out the world’s problems, we should take a good look at our own institution and respect the work and decisions taken in the field of our parliamentary bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">I say this in relation to something Mr Barón mentioned – I regret that he is not present at the moment – and frankly I do not believe that we should take advantage of this debate to introduce extemporaneous issues which are not currently amongst our concerns or relevant to this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe, Mr President, that it would be a serious mistake for the Commission not to direct all its efforts towards restoring that alliance, that harmonious partnership between Parliament and the Commission, which has led to all the progress made within the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I hope that, by means of this working programme, the disagreements of the past may be transformed into the agreements of the present and I hope that that method will prevail in the work between the Commission and Parliament. Anything else would be to confuse what is incidental with what is fundamental. We should mobilise all our forces in order to consolidate, as I have said, this strategic alliance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corbett (PSE).</span></span>   – President Prodi stated that he was attached to interinstitutional cooperation and full transparency. I, of course, welcome such a statement: it is essential for this process to work. But you have to start by respecting the procedures that are agreed already, that are known and that are laid down in writing.</p>
<p class="contents">I have here the Framework Agreement between Parliament and the Commission agreed just two years ago. I also have Rule 57 of our Rules of Procedure which lays down how we deal with the annual legislative programme and reflects the agreements that have been entered into in the past with the Commission. That rule states that the Commission shall present its Annual Legislative Programme in October. Of course, we know that there can be delays, that has happened before. But it specifies that this Annual Legislative Programme must refer to all proposals of a legislative nature and every act included in the programme must indicate the legal basis and the timetable envisaged for its adoption. On these points, what we have had before us this week fails to respect our Rules of Procedure and existing agreements reached between the two institutions. The one positive innovation is that Rule 57(6) has for the first time been implemented with the statement made by the President-in-Office which I like others welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact we have a work programme, a work programme – not a legislative programme – outlining priorities. To outline priorities is fine and the priorities chosen are good ones – perhaps obvious ones, but nevertheless the right ones. But we need the detail, we need the detail that is required in our Rules of Procedure and in the Framework Agreement. We need it for our committees to be able to get to work and plan their work and appoint rapporteurs who can work with the Commission in the pre-legislative phase. It is in the Commission's interest as well as in our own interest. I understand that we are now receiving the detail by e-mail, but even that, as far as I can see, fails to mention the legal basis and the timetable of each proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">General debates are all very well on broad priorities, but we have that several times a year when the Commission presents its programme, when each Presidency presents its programme, and we tend to have that sort of debate surrounding each European Council meeting as well. What we are supposed to get there is the nitty-gritty detail as well.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi is right to say that the procedure needs improving, but we have a procedure to negotiate such improvements, the Malmström report in our committee for example. Mrs Malmström is already in dialogue with the Commission on that and, frankly, we should have waited for the outcome of that before changing procedure. The President of the Commission cannot unilaterally take existing agreements and tear them up. New procedures must be agreed by both institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A number of extremely clear messages have emerged which the Commission will take into account, for we have the same objectives and there is a harmonious alliance between Parliament and the Commission. There may have been times when our instruments were slightly out of tune, but we have worked extremely well together.</p>
<p class="contents">I have several things to say on this point. I assure you that the Commission has been concentrating explicitly on cooperation with Parliament, and I feel, moreover, that a Commission President has never been present at so many plenary sessions or attended all the committee meetings and meetings of committee chairmen to which he is invited. Each Commissioner stands before the relevant Parliamentary committee on average seven times a year to discuss political issues relating to his or her responsibilities, to his or her portfolio; 80% of subjects are dealt with in plenary by the committee responsible; a record-breaking number of confidential documents has been sent to Parliament; each year, to date, we answer over 3 000 questions from Members of Parliament and dealt with 200 petitions referred to us by the Ombudsman. We are therefore genuinely making an enormous effort to respect our commitment to maintaining a responsible relationship with Parliament. Of course, there are problems<span class="bold"> </span>and<span class="bold"> </span>areas that need improvement, and it is precisely in order to remedy these that we have reformed our way of working.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I hear people saying, and I know what they mean, that we need more than the political programme; establishing the political programme was a step forwards but it is not enough, for it must go hand in hand with the legislative programme. We are finding it difficult to achieve this, and when we realised that this is what is required, we immediately took steps to establish the legislative programme, albeit with a slight delay. However, we are aware that the driving force of our relationship with Parliament is the political programme, for it is on the political programme that we must work together. People are saying we must not start in February and conclude in November and then let the relationship fall by the wayside. I fully agree with this sentiment. What I would ask, however, is that we be informed of dates for meetings with the committee chairmen a long time in advance; indeed, I assure you that on the few occasions when we were unable to meet, it was because we already had absolutely unbreakable commitments. However, if we establish the schedule together, I am sure we will be able to achieve our aims.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on from the subject of cooperation, I would now like to focus very briefly on the issue of the role of the Commission and of the forthcoming Convention, starting with something which may not appear to be a key point but which I consider to be extremely important, namely that we need to work alongside the Council as regards the Convention’s secretariat. It will be an extremely important time. Of course, the Convention will not take any decisions itself, but it is such an innovative way of working and the fact that it is going to work transparently before our entire continent, before the entire people of Europe, is so significant that it will ultimately acquire huge importance.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a further point in this regard as well, the view has been put forward on a number of different occasions that the Commission should be stronger. I, too, am of this opinion, but I would like to look at what we have achieved, although our achievements are sometimes understated and difficult to understand, so to speak. In my opinion, it is the results that count. The Convention did not just appear out of nowhere, it was not presented to us on a plate; the Convention was a working relationship between Parliament and the Commission immediately after Nice, at a time when both institutions were in the deepest despair. It is precisely this work, carried out together, which enabled us to rise again towards the goal which we had lost all hope of achieving. We must acknowledge the substantial help we received from the Belgian Presidency, which really took the project to heart, but it was the Parliament-Commission cooperation which won for us the chance – and I would stress, this is a chance which has never before been available in European history – to reform the institutions by means of a broad, open debate with no time pressure, so that all the European citizens can listen to us and understand what we are talking about. When the European citizens realise that this debate is the debate on the efficient running of the institutions, on unanimous voting or the different vetoes, the debate on the need to proceed with all speed in the interests of serving Europe itself, well, then the significance of this debate will be understood and, indeed, become crystal clear. Our problem was that the decisions were being taken in fora and by bodies whose significance was not understood. Well then, this is the strength of the Commission and the strength of Parliament – patience, and also never losing sight of our primary objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Swoboda, whose comments were extremely constructive, I would point out that, in terms of the debate we conducted on the basic text, our proposal dates from January 2001 – that is when we made every effort to ensure that the text could, slowly but surely, become the focal point of all our work. 2001 has been a year in which we have redefined the boundaries of our work and outlined the strategy. Certainly, there is a great deal at stake, for our whole future, our entire future, hangs upon the Convention, but we have, at last, taken this debate to the appropriate forum where the citizens will be able to listen to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on a lighter note, with regard to institutional reform, I would like to inform Mr Barón Crespo and the other four group chairmen that I replied to their letters on 5 December and that my response bears the reference number 850511. I therefore feel we need to reform the postal services, although whether those responsible for collecting the mail or those responsible for delivering it, I am not sure. In any case, for my part, I duly replied to the letter, as is my custom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
