We wanted to draw attention to the characteristics, unacceptable in our view, of the draft submitted to us at that time. We stood by the principle that there should be new appropriations for new policies. Instead of the intended redeployments, detrimental to the traditional priorities, we called for the multi-annual revision of the financial perspective, especially for external actions, although a similar problem arises for expenditure on employment and environmental protection. We decided – and we make no bones about it – that we did not want the Council putting us in a position tomorrow where we have to choose between two priorities that are equally legitimate in our eyes: the Balkans and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now in precisely the situation we wanted to avoid. Under the terms of the compromise concluded between Parliament’s delegation and the Council, Euro-Mediterranean cooperation suffers a cut of EUR 200 million compared with the budget for 2000. A fine signal to send our close partners in the South. As for the Balkans, they have given rise to an arduous and very precarious financial set-up. This includes a transfer, to the 2001 budget, of 2000 budget appropriations for aid to Latin America, or appropriations for Morocco under the draft fisheries agreement and not used this year. In addition, and above all, the problem of financing for the Balkans will still be there in its entirety for the years ahead. Heading 3, internal actions, also warrants a comment, since the ‘employment initiative’, re-baptised the ‘Spirit of Enterprise programme’ has been amputated to the tune of EUR 87 million, the Trans-European Networks by EUR 23 million, and environmental protection by EUR 42 million.</p>
<p class="contents">In total, with about 1.09% of European gross domestic product, or even less, the 2001 budget will be one of the lowest of the last ten years, in relative terms, since it is well below the already very restrictive ceiling established under Agenda 2000 in Berlin in March 1999. That is why the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left unfortunately cannot support Mrs Haug’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank Commissioner Schreyer. However, this does not mean that we could have done more or better. I will focus on one aspect at a time. Firstly, the positive side: the approximately EUR 60 million of agricultural funds allocated for testing, which is a significant although, in my opinion, not conclusive step; the earmarking of around EUR 450 million for small and medium-sized businesses, for we have at last realised that the European economy is not based on multinationals but on small and medium-sized enterprises, which will give new impetus to development and employment; then the fact that the increase in expenditure is only 3.5%, and the increase in appropriations for the Balkans, which is of political importance. In this sense, our committee has made a fundamental achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to focus on two points which I feel require some attention and give cause for concern: firstly, the possibly excessive use of flexibility which, like all excessive things, is a negative factor, which means that we must not use it as a safety net; secondly, the fact that the creation of the new jobs is simply due to early retirements. This must not become a precedent in our institutions. Finally, I urge the committee to adopt increasingly a budgetary strategy aimed particularly at strengthening and protecting our currency, the euro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that the Chamber is pretty thin, but unfortunately the debate on the budget lasted longer than planned and we – I and the speakers who follow me – will not have the opportunity to raise the matter with the Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I, in my turn, would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, the Council and the Presidency on the work that has been accomplished, and the conclusion of this agreement which will allow us to vote for the budget for the year 2001. But I endorse all the comments made, especially by Mr Colom i Naval, on this extremely delicate issue of the financial perspectives. An agreement has just been concluded in Nice to make enlargement possible. Now, the previous enlargements gave rise to major financial allocations. The Member States were not afraid of public opinion at home then and the enlargement to Spain and Portugal was accompanied by a major mobilisation of resources. When I see that our budget is down by comparison with the year 2000, both in real terms and in terms of percent of GNP, and that we are so very far adrift from the objectives set in Edinburgh, I recognise that as the real problem. Refusing to harness ourselves to them means undermining the credibility of the construction and enlargement of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of these issues was, and still is today, the increase in the financial perspective for foreign policy. The Council is right to reject this revision because there is no point in putting a ceiling on the expenditure in Berlin for a period of six years if these ceilings are going to be called into question every year. These maximum levels force the Commission to set priorities within the confines of a budget, in the way that every government has to.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue to be given an airing once again this year was the flexibility instrument. An instrument of EUR 200 million that has now been earmarked, in agreement with the Council, for aid to the Balkans. As Mr Colom i Naval rightly commented, using the flexibility instrument in this way misses the whole point, i.e. the assuaging of unforeseen budgetary need. To be perfectly honest, I do wonder whether he would have said the same if this instrument had been used in the same spurious way for MEDA, as proposed by Parliament. It so happens that I voiced this criticism during the first reading of the budget, and I do not recall anybody applauding it. Needless to say, I am not against giving aid to the Balkans. The Union as an association of nation States, born of the need for peace in Europe, has a duty of honour to finance the process of peace and reconciliation in the Balkans. However, I feel that when it comes to mounting such an extensive operation, we must take stock of the need for aid before opening our wallet. The zeal shown by the Commission and Parliament to equip the Balkans with aid reserves, contrast sharply with the cuts in aid for the candidate States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we probably ought to reserve the flexibility instrument for the 2002 budget now for the candidate states. They might wish to join the EU earlier, completely out of the blue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also good that, as the main source of employment, small and medium-sized enterprises have been allocated additional funds. This will help to create new jobs and continue the fight against unemployment. We are also aware of the assumption behind the Commission's Letter of Amendment No. 2, i.e. that around 900 million can be saved in Category I. However, this assumption no longer holds true. First, the euro has now gone up in value, thereby reducing any potential savings, and secondly, we must now assume that insufficient funds have been earmarked in the budget for dealing with the BSE crisis. We shall therefore be forced to accept a supplementary budget which will again seriously reduce, if not eliminate any potential savings in this category. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The vote that is to follow this debate will mark the end of the long, complex process of approving the European Union budget for 2001. As a result of intense negotiations and successive compromises among the various institutions, the chances of its approval are reasonable. However, I should like to point out certain aspects that carry over to subsequent years. The budget represents, in payment appropriations, just 1.056% of the Community GDP. The financial perspective forecast 1.11% for 2001, which is not to mention the 1.27% that was being mentioned a few years ago. On the other hand, external cooperation programmes are still not multiannual, the difference between commitments and payments is still growing, some projects are still implemented very little or badly, there are unjustifiable and unsustainable payment delays, and Parliament has been confronted with <span class="italic">faits accomplis</span> with budgetary implications. Whereas there is no solution as yet for the first aspect mentioned, the GDP, and I am sure that Parliament will soon demonstrate its persistence with regard to the second, I must say that with regard to the third aspect that I have highlighted, I believe that the great novelty in the budget process in coming years is the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council for the Commission to draw up a report by 30 June 2001 to be submitted to the first two institutions regarding the progress achieved in a number of basic fields, such as the reduction in the amount outstanding, the simplification of the project round, improved programme implementation, a commitology review, the reform of the Commission, the definition and execution of implementation objectives, particularly in external cooperation, and the provision of more thorough information for Parliament in several fields. If the submission of such a report is not seen as just one more formality, the hopes that many of us have placed in this new step will be justified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I may just deviate from that trend slightly in relation to the Council – not necessarily the French Presidency – but the Council in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not kid ourselves, this is a good budget. It is not the budget that I or many of my colleagues would have wanted. However, we can be satisfied with it. In football terms it is like a l-1 draw. However, because of the flexibility instrument, we think we have won the penalty shoot-out.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's original proposal for a revision of the financial perspective to take EUR 300 million from category 1 for category 4 was a worthy idea: worthy of support and eminently sensible. Unfortunately, a majority of my colleagues did not agree with me and therefore we could not go along with it. Neither was there a qualified majority within this House to revert to Article 272. Therefore, we had to find a solution within the means that the interinstitutional agreement affords us so that we could get a decent budget. That is what we have done: we have avoided a budgetary crisis by going to Article 272; the financial perspective has been maintained, even though we have used the flexibility instrument. The result is the best that we can hope for without either a revision or Article 272.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Colom i Naval made his remarks this morning because it was clear to those of us who were present when the IIA was agreed that the flexibility instrument should not be used for the same purposes in consecutive years. I admire the answer Mrs Parly gave this morning but we have turned a blind eye to that. Kosovo and Serbia are in effect the same thing. We have ignored what we agreed. We have also said that the flexibility instrument would not be an annual reserve for category 4 but that is exactly what it has become. That is why it is not only Mr Colom i Naval who is frustrated at the way things have developed over this budgetary procedure in the last two years.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be said, and I put it on record, that the French presidency has been a good partner in trying to find solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">On classification, I have no problem with the two points that were raised: pensions are compulsory expenditure. What we are talking about is an early-retirement scheme which as yet has no legal base; no one knows whether what will be proposed is compulsory or non-compulsory and it is, after all, a p.m. that is on the line.</p>
<p class="contents">On the fisheries agreement, we have only changed the remarks for the A lines. In other words, the remarks which concern non-compulsory expenditure. In both cases we have not changed any figures. There should not be a clash on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Just because we have a budget and we have agreed a deal at conciliation, let us not imagine that all our problems have disappeared. The problems will remain until we sort out what we are going to do about external expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">There are times when I foolishly assumed this year that once the Commission had made its proposals for a revision we could reach an agreement with the Council. I was wrong. Then when I discovered that there would be no discussions on that revision regarding Article 25 of the IIA, I was, to say the least, somewhat disappointed. The Council's attitude in this game of football seems to be not to worry about the ball but to get on with the game. Let me just say to the Council that, as far as this game is concerned, we have not run out of balls and this side intends playing until we get the right result.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I thank all those who have been involved in this – not just the rapporteurs – but also the secretariat of the Commission, Parliament services and the political group staff. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also particularly like to thank Mr Wynn, who, I believe is seeing out his first full year as chairman of the Committee on Budgets during a budgetary procedure, and I think he has made an outstanding job of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am satisfied with this budget. I am particularly satisfied because we stayed within the financial perspective again. I believe Parliament must uphold its agreements, and they can only be broken in cases of extreme need. I have not identified any such cases this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner is still proud of this and says that the agricultural expenditure will increase by an enormous percentage this year as compared with previous years. That is indeed the case but then these are agreements that must be kept. They were concluded before she became Commissioner and I think it would be to her credit if she were to uphold the Berlin agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">What else has a bearing on the agricultural budget? We are all familiar with the content of the letter of amendment in October and if all goes well, if the dollar stays at 91 cents, then we could end up with a surplus of approximately EUR 1.3 billion in category 1A. Suppose that does not happen and Mr Duisenberg says it is not going to happen, how are we to finance the BSE crisis? That is what I want to know. Are we going to make cuts in other agricultural expenditure, are we going to defer it to other years, is it still possible to use the surplus for 2000 or can we devise an insurance system, which already features in an earlier parliamentary resolution? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not gain this importance out of nowhere, but from the Treaties, although sometimes the Council finds it hard to admit it.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, with the Bourlanges report, the flexibility instrument was mobilised for the first time, and an institutional declaration was also obtained recognising the possible financial insufficiency of category 4.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, the Haug report has taken advantage of this institutional declaration last year to discuss the need to revise the financial perspective. It has been demonstrated that it was not the right time for a revision, that there was enough margin to fulfil the commitments to the Balkans and to the MEDA programme without altering the forecasts of Berlin 1999, and it has been shown that the compulsion to have a revision is only in the intentions of those who voted against Agenda 2000 in its day.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the European Parliament cannot carry on forever reducing its external commitments. This year the flexibility instrument has been used again, but we should not continue down this road.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want there to be a proposal for revision for next year in the Colom Resolution, because we want to wait for the World Bank evaluation, but we share his criticism that this method of resolving the financial insufficiency in category 4 distorts the multiannual nature of the major external objectives of the Union and the very definition of the financial perspective.</p>

<p class="contents">The final outcome of the negotiations is positive, which shows that in order to achieve some objectives, what matters is not getting there alone and early, but getting there altogether and on time. We wanted a budget that would combine our efforts with those of the Member States to contribute to economic growth and increasing employment, and therefore the agreement that has been reached on the multiannual amount for the small businesses programme is a good thing. However, sustaining this and Parliament’s other political priorities needs to be compatible with budgetary stability in spending.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the Union is in its most favourable economic situation for 10 years, as is proved by the fact that the net balances have improved a great deal. But, precisely for this reason, I think that the agreement reached on payment appropriations is reasonable, because it combines efforts in the right direction for sustained growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s budgetary strategy marks a before and an after at this start of the millennium. Because the negotiations not only lead to the final amounts and their distribution, but also to the implementation of instruments which are going to enable us to measure to what extent the political will of this Parliament translates into facts. And I am going a little further, because it is not enough to have strict and transparent rules for implementing the budget, such as the cancellation of commitments if they have not been implemented after two years. This should go hand in hand with a commitment from the College of Commissioners to a fair and efficient distribution of human and material resources for the management of the various policies, that is, they must remember the political priority of Parliament and the management priority of the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can now say that this struggle has been successful. We shall be able to adopt a Budget within this framework, which is a great success. I believe, in actual fact, that both the Member States and the taxpayers are grateful that the charges are not still higher.</p>
<p class="contents">I also see it as a clear success that we are able to go into a new Budget year with a greater margin than in the past. When we make use of 1.06 per cent of the Member States’ GDP, this gives us a margin greater than ever before and greater than that predicted in Berlin less than two years ago. This gives us an opportunity to be an active partner where enlargement to include the countries in Central and Eastern Europe is concerned and when it comes to helping establish peace and prosperity in Serbia and the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">For all this to be possible, there will have to be extensive prioritising in the future, too. This will be necessary if we are successfully to honour our long-term commitments, something which is clearly possible if our objective is to work for an EU which is strong but, at the same time, circumscribed.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, there is a major threat in the present-day situation, namely BSE. It is nonetheless important to note that we must cope successfully with this too within the current Budget framework. This means that, if the solution to the problem requires still more money, this must be provided by means of other savings in Category 1 or through the Member States’ accepting a larger portion of the cost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Generally-speaking, the proportion of the budget earmarked in order to safeguard and maintain the environment is far too small. This is particularly annoying in that environmental policy is a horizontal policy because environmental policy – or at least successful environmental policy – must be applied as a cross-border policy. We all know that. Which is why safeguarding and regenerating the environment is a job which has to be done at European Community level. But this also means that we need to be given proper funding once and for all. We cannot just keep on issuing endless directives and regulations, often without sufficient background information, scientific basis and generally to unbelievably short deadlines.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make a comment: I am not the only one who constantly has the impression in these circumstances that my only purpose in sitting on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is to prevent the worst in the frenzy and rush of regulation which is thrust upon us.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not lose our sense of environmental direction by promoting small, local measures, however badly they may be needed, or by blindly shelling out money to institutions which appear to produce little in the way of results, which applies, in my view, to the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">What European environmental policy needs is a scientifically-based framework for action. That is something we do not have. And that is because we lack the foundations. We need to invest in scientific research and analysis. Only then shall we be able to work out realistic prospects, prospects for linking environmental and health policies to other policy areas, prospects for what promises to be a successful and realistic approach to problem-solving. That is the only right and the only sensible way of investing the money at our disposal on behalf of our fellow citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first relates to something which you reminded us of this morning, Mrs Schreyer. Compared with many national budgets, the increase in the Community is somewhat higher but, in relation to expenditure ratios, it is still very low and sets an excellent example for many national budgets. We must tell the public that, if the national foreign or other secretaries of state keep handing work over to be carried out at European level, such as the whole Balkans programme, then we must also bear in mind that this work requires money and that funds must be made available.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment relates to the common foreign and security policy. Tremendous progress was made here during the 1990s. During the conflict in Bosnia, Europe was still not in a position to speak with one voice: one country was purported to be on the side of the Serbs, another to be on the side of the Croats. We almost seemed to be back in the policy of alliances of the 19th century. Now, at the end of this century, at the end of the 1990s, Europe is speaking with one voice, Europe is the biggest civil reconstructor in the Balkans, bigger than the United States, and is doing a good job; through its budget and its policy it really did help to make peaceful revolution possible in Serbia. This needed to be said quite clearly about European policy at the end of this financial year and after this decade of confusion in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Foreign states are becoming more important to us and we hope that, with the new posts provided, the Commission will do the job which we expect it to do. We are being up front with our praise and you may be sure that we shall seek to exercise strict control in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much talk of post-Nice. Nice was yet again the scene of national haggling for individual states. We have overcome this to a considerable degree in foreign policy and I hope in the forthcoming budget debates that we shall take more decisions of substance and spend more time on the problems and less time haggling over national interests in this budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, the structure of the budget in 2001: one speaker said that the agricultural budget would not rise sufficiently. However, I must stress that the agricultural budget has a very high rate of growth, namely 5.7%. If we include the expected supplementary budget, it comes out at nearly 8%, while other areas, such as training policy, the whole of internal policy – including research –, foreign policy, administration and accession aid have together only risen by 1.1%. We really must stress, therefore, that Parliament too has exercised immense budgetary discipline in the areas in which it has the last word but has, I think, brought about an excellent result with clear priorities nonetheless.</p>
<p class="contents">On Mr Mulder's comment: you noted that, because the budget at second reading was below the margin in agricultural policy, the risk of a change in exchange rates needed to be included in the calculation, because it would be not unwelcome if the euro were to rise against the dollar. I would draw your attention here to the rules of the Interinstitutional Agreement, which state that a "currency risk" of up to EUR 200 million must be financed from the agricultural policy and that only then can recourse be taken to the currency reserve. However, my view is that we should in fact take care in the supplementary budget to keep this reserve at EUR 200 million so that we do not have to take other measures if there is the slightest change in the exchange rate.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mrs Sommer's comment that too little account is taken of environmental aspects in the European Union budget, allow me to point out that one third of the budget is spent on structural policy and that we have mainstreaming in structural policy; we have gender mainstreaming to ensure that structural policy measures provide equal opportunities for men and women. The money must be used in order to increase employment and – and this is the third mainstreaming – it must be used in order to improve the environmental situation. That gives us an enormous amount of money to play with.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also point out that the EUR 4.5 billion under agricultural policy for developing the countryside, which we discussed this morning, includes numerous measures to promote environmental protection. In addition, agricultural policy also includes something in this area which is not standard practice in environmental policy and which fundamentalists may occasionally take a dim view of: namely that compensation is paid for refraining from taking environmentally damaging action. Here are your measures which quite explicitly promote environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment again on the charming question put by Mr Colom i Naval this morning. He asked what was the difference between revising the financial perspective and using the flexibility instrument? You are, of course, quite right to keep reverting to this question. I see it like this: revising the financial perspective means that if we make an increase on one side, we must at the same time decide where savings can be made. This requirement does not apply to the flexibility reserve. In this respect, the finance ministers' reluctance to revise the financial perspective is even harder to understand. Oh well, we live and learn. I guess this example also illustrates the fact that sometimes principles count for more than budgetary intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is a good thing that we have succeeded in activating the flexibility instruments and giving Serbia the help it needs on this occasion, although I fully agree with you that our strategy must be such that we prevent the phenomenon from arising whereby a European flexibility instrument wanders from one region or country of Europe to another, depending on where it is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, I should like once again to stress that, in the Commission's view, the 2001 budget provides an excellent basis on which we can together forge a good Community policy for Europe and I should like to thank you for the excellent cooperation. And we shall have the opportunity of continuing this excellent cooperation on the supplementary budget in January. But first I should like to wish all those involved in the budget a Happy Christmas! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
