<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Iratxe García Pérez, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two legislative proposals comprise the so-called ‘quality package’, which was presented in December 2010: one on agricultural product quality schemes, which basically covers the rules on geographical indications and other voluntary schemes, and the other amending the articles in the single common market organisation (CMO) that refer to the marketing standards that agricultural products should fulfil to be sold within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to the latter, the Council has not been able to agree on a full negotiating mandate, meaning we have not even been able to debate the position adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development over a year ago, a position that Mr Dantin has now included in his report on the single CMO. I hope this wider context leads to negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the proposal for regulation before us today, the trialogue concluded with an agreement on 20 June 2012, an agreement we hope to see ratified in this part-session.</p>
<p class="contents">After the ‘milk package’, it is the second agricultural dossier to be adopted by means of the ordinary legislative procedure, and it was a good running-in process to undertake the important negotiations that await us with the reform of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea behind the geographical indications system is to protect designations that identify a product as originating from a particular area and to attribute to it the quality, reputation and other characteristics that differentiate and enhance it, due to either its origin or its mode of production.</p>
<p class="contents">It undoubtedly means a potential economic opportunity for farmers and food producers, which is very beneficial to the rural economy, although it is first and foremost a system for registering and protecting intellectual property rights, a system that has been in place since 1992 and is already one of the hallmarks of European agriculture. Since then, it has protected registered product names in the Union in a uniform and harmonised manner. Proof of its success can be seen in the fact that there has been a constant increase in registered products since the system was introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal was not as far reaching as expected given the overview contained in the Green Paper. It must be acknowledged, however, that the system has been simplified and harmonised, and coherent rules have been put in place as required. One of the objectives the Commission took very much into account in their proposals was the strengthening and simplification of quality systems.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to highlight other improvements, such as the strengthening of monitoring rules. Each Member State is a market, not only for its own ‘designation of origin’ or ‘protected geographical indication’ (PGI) products, but also for those from other Member States. They should all ensure the appropriate use and effective protection of all the indications.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of Union logos will be compulsory from now on. This is essential to rectify the lack of consumer knowledge of the geographical indication system.</p>
<p class="contents">The traditional specialty guaranteed (TSG) scheme is not undergoing such a radical change as was initially proposed. A transitional period for TSGs to exist without reserving a name has been established, a simplified system is introduced, and a 30-year period is established for the use of the term ‘traditional’.</p>
<p class="contents">A quality system is set up for mountain farming products, as requested by Parliament, the operation and details of which will be developed by the Commission, ensuring it has a uniform, community-based focus. I will take this opportunity, Commissioner, to pass on to you a question that I have been asked more than once since we reached the agreement: When do you estimate this quality system will be ready and in operation?</p>
<p class="contents">Undoubtedly, the role of producer groups is strengthened and acknowledged more than in the initial proposal, although not as much as the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would have liked. Those present here know that every effort was made so that the final agreement would give them an active role in the repositioning of production to the market, as was agreed with ‘designation of origin’ or PGI cheese producers in the milk package.</p>

As a member of the European Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I have always attached great importance to this subject, for I believe that the future of the European agricultural product industry, particularly on the international market, resides in its quality and diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the compromise reached during the trialogue of 20 June. I would like to point out that this trialogue took place in a truly constructive atmosphere, which I welcome, because we managed to reach a balanced and satisfactory outcome. The end result of this work is a compromise in the best meaning of the word: everyone has given a little or ceded on one point or another, including on important points, and everyone has also achieved genuine improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms García Pérez is of the view that the Commission’s proposals were not very ambitious. However, on other points, the Commission too expected Parliament to be more ambitious in relation to its own proposals. So finally I think that we have managed to reach a compromise which is satisfactory for all parties.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to thank Ms García Pérez for her constructive approach and her endeavour to understand the reasons behind the Commission’s proposal on points that I think are essential if we want to be able to say that there has been an improvement in the agricultural product quality policy. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteur as well as the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which contributed a great deal to this project, and also the Council, the Danish Presidency and the previous Presidencies for their hard work.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have a well-balanced, satisfactory text on the table. It is true to say that the future regulation on quality systems will allow us to reinforce and simplify European policy on quality. From now on, we shall have a single instrument for geographical indications, designations of origin, traditional specialities and optional quality mentions. It will bring significant improvements to the protection scheme for these quality instruments that will create greater visibility for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">This framework for a coherent, strengthened, quality policy will undoubtedly best serve all the different producers, products and consumers in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I can therefore conclude by confirming that the Commission supports this political agreement and I hope that Parliament will adopt it tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">To answer Ms García Pérez’ question concerning the specific mention for mountain areas, we shall finalise the proposal as soon as the impact assessment has been carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by saying a few words about comitology. During the trialogue on the draft regulation, the Commission agreed not to adopt the draft implementing act if the committee responsible for it did not provide an opinion, in which case Article 5(4), third subparagraph of Regulation No 182/2011 will apply. That goes against the Commission’s general rule, but in this particular case, agreement could not have been reached if it had made an objection on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in a spirit of compromise, the Commission was reluctant to oppose a qualified majority in favour of the Presidency’s text and wishes to make the following statement: the Commission stresses that it is against the spirit of Regulation No 182/2011 to invoke Article 5(4), second subparagraph, point b), systematically. Recourse to this provision must respond to a specific need to waive the general rule whereby the Commission can adopt a draft implementing act when no opinion is provided.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that this is an exception to the general rule provided for in Article 5(4), recourse to point b) of the second subparagraph cannot simply be considered to be a discretionary power of the legislator, but must be interpreted strictly and must therefore be justified.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to note that the two institutions have thought it appropriate to continue discussions on trading standards, in particular, and also on other points which had initially been envisaged in this draft regulation within the framework of the reform of the common agricultural policy currently being discussed, and the Commission will provide the support needed to ensure a successful outcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We now have around 1 000 such designations in Europe and each year these account for sales of around EUR 15 billion, representing 4.5% of our food market in Europe. These products are constantly gaining in importance. These figures show just how important these designations of origin have become.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, whom I would like to thank for her cooperation in recent months, has already indicated the benefits of the new regulation. We shall have less red tape, greater public protection for designations of origin and new designation options, such as the ‘mountain products’ designation the Commissioner has just mentioned. That is major progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much regret that we have not succeeded in apportioning greater importance to the support consortia. There is no doubt that these products are perceived by consumers as brands. Anyone who claims that consumers do not recognise names like Pata Negra or Parmigiano Reggiano as brands is misunderstanding the situation. Support consortia lack a central element in market leadership, however. They are unable to decide on the amount of product to be put on offer. Unfortunately it has not been possible to reach agreement in this area with the Council, which is notable by its absence today. I hope that we will manage to find such agreement during the debate on agricultural reform.</p>
<p class="contents">I also find it quite unhelpful that an amendment should now be tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which we are to vote on tomorrow and which moves in this direction. My group agrees with the substance of this amendment and would vote in favour if this was the only issue. We know, however, that this would prevent the adoption of the regulation at first reading, which is why we shall have to vote against it. Thus, this is not particularly helpful and achieves no progress. I hope that the Greens will support us when we raise this subject as part of agricultural reforms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As happened with the Milk Regulation, Parliament has again managed to introduce significant amendments to improve the Commission’s proposal. I would highlight, for example, the stricter rules to protect certified products against misuse and imitation (the so-called <span class="italic">ex officio</span> rule); the new system of optional quality terms, starting with the ‘product of mountain farming’ quality term; area marks; and greater simplification in the authorisation procedures for Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) and Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) products. I would also like to mention the amendment to the list in the annex, which at last makes it possible for chocolate to enjoy a protected geographical indication. Allow me to take this opportunity to greet the friends of Modica chocolate who are here in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">These are just a few of the many amendments that Parliament has successfully introduced to strengthen the prospect of leveraging quality in order to compete in the sector. This was made possible by the excellent work done by the rapporteur, Ms García Pérez, whom I thank, as well as the shadow rapporteurs and the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
<p class="contents">The only regrettable fact, as the rapporteur herself mentioned, is that Parliament has not managed to persuade the Council of the need to extend production planning, which we usefully introduced in the milk package, to all the other protected designations of origin, particularly in the ham sector. However, as has been pointed out by Mr Dorfmann, one of the shadow rapporteurs, we shall not fail to do so in the debate on the reform of the common agricultural policy, and on the single common market organisation document in particular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We set ourselves the goal of simplifying the quality systems, ensuring the reliability of quality and also establishing a way to get better prices for farmers. We did not succeed in controlling marketing standards or the regulation of supply. We now intend doing this in the common organisation of the markets. Overall, however, it must said that we have taken a first step towards a uniform quality policy. The long time spent in negotiations also shows how much we have struggled among ourselves to reach an agreement and that it is not always easy to make progress at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement has now also been confirmed by the Council. Speaking on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I have no choice other than to support the compromise before us and to ask you to support the amendments. We have failed to achieve a lot of what we wanted. The ALDE Group was not happy with the introduction of another new quality characteristic like the mountain products, however when one considers what has been achieved overall as a package, then we can support this.

<p class="contents">By improving the quality of agricultural output, not only will the supply side move agriculture away from the production of basic raw-material commodities, for which it receives basic raw-material prices, but there will also be an opportunity to add real value to the products.</p>
<p class="contents">The types of strategy that might come into play here include building and exploiting regional identities, building and exploiting brands and points of differentiation, and better marketing of products whether that be through cooperation, strategic alliances or moving closer to the marketplace.</p>
<p class="contents">These strategies do not just add considerably to producers’ incomes, they can also create and sustain a large number of jobs in the rural sector, they contribute strongly to growth in the rural economy, and they will significantly reduce dependence on subsidy support from the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have two criticisms of this report. First, it is too focused on the domestic or European market. We should not forget that European products possess some of the best-recognised and strongest identities in the world, but that export potential is not being fully exploited at the present time. I therefore suggest that we should be doing more to help stimulate this important trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we are keen to support and encourage regional and producer organisations. But such organisations should not be empowered to restrict or control output levels. In practice, that would amount to an unofficial quota system which, in the short term, would be anti-competitive and, in the long term, would mean missing opportunities for efficiency gains and wider market exploitation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The importance of their work is highlighted in this report, since the Member States are enabled to promote the establishment and operation of such groups. The positive outcomes obtained are due to the teamwork shown by Parliament’s delegation to the meetings with the other institutions. They include <span class="italic">ex officio</span> protection, whereby the Member States must protect products with quality marks, even where they are used as ingredients in processed products, without waiting for producers to make a complaint.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast to the measures introduced in Mr Nicholson’s report on contractual relations in the milk and milk products sector, production management for quality marks in other sectors has been left out of the report now being debated. It was simply not possible to reach agreement on production planning, a crucial issue for our producers. They wanted this instrument above all to make it possible to balance demand and supply. We will continue working alongside our fellow Members to achieve this outcome as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly I would like to thank the Italian associations that represent the cooperatives, which have worked with us and will continue to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Northern Ireland has, to date, three protected geographical indications: the early Comber potato, the Armagh Bramley apple and the Lough Neagh eel. While I welcome the official recognition of these products, there must be adequate safeguards in place to protect not only the standing of the products but also the scheme itself. This report goes some way to addressing that.</p>
<p class="contents">If quality schemes are to be meaningful and useful in the marketing of products, then it is imperative that those products retain their authenticity. This is especially true of products that require traditional production steps but must also be manageable in today’s global market. It is important too that the registration and monitoring of those using quality schemes must be fit for purpose but not restrictive. The success of a quality scheme will depend on its capacity to stay relevant to the consumer and to add value whilst maintaining exclusivity and regional brand identity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, while we continue to improve quality schemes in the EU, I think Parliament and the Commission should do more to protect EU citizens from poor-quality imports which do not meet the same high standards, and should put an end to the hypocrisy in this regard and the unfair competition for our farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is shame that the Council is not represented here tonight with us.</p>
<p class="contents">The new quality system for agricultural products is a simplification of the current system and a streamlining of current authorisation procedures, and that is good news. It is also a good achievement to have included the obligation to use the Union logo for designations of origin and protected geographical indications, given that it increases the exposure of European products.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is also worth noting that the provisions for protecting quality designations in bilateral agreements with third countries are strengthened, and that a legal basis for defending the European Union logo in those third countries is created, as I honestly think that the protection of European products in third countries should be a fundamental objective.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a shame that this package has been somewhat stripped back during the negotiations and, I will say it again, it is a shame that the Council is not here to hear it, because the original quality package proposed by the Commission has been rather forgotten and the marketing standards and management of supply through quality designations of origin have been cut from the agreement, leaving it, as I said, a little empty.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the Council’s blinkered attitude on these two issues is regrettable, as they refused to listen to Parliament’s reasonable positions.

Only thus can we reach a situation where all consumers will know it and take account of it in their decision-making. Frequent and extensive changes will not help us, and will only lead to confusion.

Quality must be worthwhile, however. For this reason, I expressly welcome the fact that the decision on the quality package will create measures that will highlight European quality and further secure protected designations of origin, geographical indications and traditional specialities. It is also very important that these products should be protected beyond Europe’s borders and that processes cannot be cheaply copied. Successful programmes are recognised by consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">We have very positive experience with brand registration in Austria. The designated products enjoy a good reputation. However, measures are required on a Europe-wide basis that will promote sales and increase brand recognition. At the same time, we also need measures to enable more of such brands to be registered. Agricultural producers need user-friendly support with registration.</p>
<p class="contents">I also expressly welcome the introduction of labelling for products from mountain areas. This is clearly the handiwork of the European Parliament and I would like to thank the negotiators for their dedication in this context. This new, counterfeit-proof label is a milestone for dairy producers. Milk production in mountain areas is hard work and is associated with the highest quality standards. Consumers associate products from mountain regions with an untouched landscape, cows freely grazing the meadows, feeding on hay in the winter, and small farms. It must be possible for the greater effort and higher production costs involved to command a better product price. We need to keep on working on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all understand the peculiarities of islands, their serious and permanent drawbacks, their physical and demographic problems, their distance from the mainland, their small size, their difficult terrain, their specific climate and their dependence on activities with limited potential.

<p class="contents">I think one of the things that we have not highlighted enough in terms of the common agriculture policy and farming is the fact that there has been a gradual improvement in quality in every respect during the lifetime of the CAP. The environment has improved, water quality has improved, biodiversity continues to improve and, of course, the quality of the food produced is constantly improving.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, without any doubt, a guarantee that food can be traced from farm to fork, but sometimes the primary producers have not benefitted from this, and these proposals should help to ensure that happens, particularly if we streamline the bureaucracy and ensure that the solutions are simple ones.

However, quality schemes cannot be a panacea for solving the multiple problems that are facing agriculture and the rural world today, especially in less developed regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the continued liberalisation policies and the deregulation of markets for agricultural products, it will be very difficult to ensure the continuity of many high-quality productions, with great relevance for the cohesion of the rural economic and social fabric.

The first amendment concerns the establishment of a new term, that of ‘mountain product’, to describe products containing raw materials from mountain areas. The second amendment refers to the possibility of establishing a new local farming and direct sales labelling scheme to assist producers in marketing their produce locally. The introduction of this label depends on a study to be carried out by the Commission, which I hope will be carried out soon.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the two new terms could bring important benefits for producers, enabling them to find market niches more easily and compete against large producers. They will also benefit consumers who want to buy food produced in their region, through the efforts of farmers located near the cities they live in.

I hope that Parliament will adopt the agreement that we have reached, through the discussion of certain elements in the context of the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). I think that it would be a pity to block the decision on this Quality Package and hold it up on the grounds of points which we can discuss and clarify at the time of the CAP reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Several of you pointed to the discussion on quality-related volume control, which did not lead to an agreement between the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I am open to pursuing this discussion with you and with the Council in the context of CAP reform, with a view to determining how the monitoring of volumes might have a positive impact on quality, and I am ready to take this aspect into account, if need be.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this legislative proposal, if it is adopted, will create a proper framework for encouraging producers to register their products and for ensuring that the quality of agricultural products in the European Union is more obvious in the marketplace. The advantage of this regulation, to reply to Mr Tabajdi, who unfortunately is no longer here, is that, once this regulation comes into force, all Member States will have to apply the same labelling and quality mentions. This will make it easier for European customers, throughout the Member States, to identify quality products from the same category.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you have spoken about the export potential for quality products. The Union is indeed one of the top exporters of agricultural products and foodstuffs in the world, but, unlike other global partners, such as the United States, which export mainly raw materials, we primarily export added value, with quality products. The regulation that we are about to adopt will make negotiations for the recognition of this system of geographical indication outside the European Union easier for us with our international partners and consequently easier to ensure the legal protection of these products on external markets.</p>
<p class="contents">That will allow us not only to promote quality more effectively outside the Union, but also to protect our quality products against counterfeits still to be found on the market. Admittedly these counterfeits are proof that European products are appreciated by consumers outside the Union. However, we now need the legal framework to be able to protect our producers from these counterfeits.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also plans to present a legislative proposal with a view to promoting agricultural products and foodstuffs on the European market and abroad. It intends to promote actively quality labels and ensure that the European consumer recognises them. We shall invest money to promote the logo that we have designed as part of this regulation, so that European consumers are better able to identify quality products on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as local products and products of island farming are concerned, you asked the Commission for reports. I can assure you that the Commission has already started to carry out evaluation work on the quality potential of local products and products from short production and distribution chains. The same work is being carried out for products of mountain farming. It will also be carried out for products of island farming. Finally, at the end of this year, the Commission will present a report, possibly accompanied by legislative proposals for registering these quality labels. I can assure you that this is indeed our intention and that we have already started to work on it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank you again for your support for this legislative proposal. I hope it will lead to a vote in favour tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The regional diversity of food, the traditional methods of production, and the emphasis on safety and good environmental conditions lead to the fact that the quality of European food is among the highest in the world. We must also demand this from third-country products entering the EU. Farmers and consumers alike need to be made aware of these special characteristics of their home-grown food. This quality-oriented approach could help reward the best-quality products on the domestic, as well as international markets. These labels and quality schemes provide recognition for the high-value characteristics of the products and also for the regional specificities of the products. The current quality schemes are: Protected designation of origin (PDO), Protected Geographical Indication (PGI), Traditional Specialty Guaranteed (TSG), Organic Farming and Outermost Regions, all with their respective logos. They bring greater added value for farmers and consumers. I therefore welcome the rapporteur’s initiative, which urges the Commission to make these schemes easier to understand and to extend them to ‘products of island farming’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European food producers provide consumers with very varied and mostly very high-quality food. They are creating protected European marks that represent their history and their quality. The current quality regimes include the protected designation of origin (PDO), protected geographical indication (PGI) and traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG), products of organic farming and the most remote regions. The food in these systems is marked out by its own logo, enabling rapid recognition by the consumer. The food quality and labelling system helps successful promotion on both the European and global market. It is essential to continue this effort and to continue improving the policy on food and product quality. The Commission’s new proposal sets out the aim of modifying EU legislation in the area of quality, and improving the functioning of national and private certification systems so that they are simpler, more transparent and comprehensible, and more adaptable to innovation and rapid progress. It is also important to reduce the burden they impose on producers and administrators. The report on the quality of agricultural products is a benefit for European legislation, the agricultural market, producers and consumers, and I therefore support its adoption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The introduction by the regulation of protection of designations of origin and geographical indications ensures appropriate product designations which maintain the unique and traditional character of the products.</p>
<p class="contents">The retention of characteristic quality features of EU agricultural products is important because it applies to product groups that build a competitive advantage for EU agriculture in the world and meet the demand for high quality food. We should therefore make every effort to ensure that regional products (such as the categories of products of mountain and island farming specified in the regulation) are duly registered, labelled and protected against unfair competition. We must ensure that when these products are placed on the market they build a reputation for European food in the world and contribute to maintaining employment in traditional methods of food production. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The registration and labelling of foodstuffs, statement of product composition, and so on, is only one <span class="italic">– </span>albeit significant <span class="italic">– </span>measure. I consider it important that consumers be properly informed so that, at a time of crisis, when people look to buy cheaper products, they do not buy low-quality agricultural products. It is similarly important that national inspection authorities conduct thorough checks of the consumer market so that we will never again useindustrial salt on our food, or eat chickens that have been around the world twice and frozen four times, and whose origin we cannot trace. Foodstuffs such as these harm human health, and even kill people. We see examples every year: last year in Germany, and now people are dying in the Czech Republic from methanol. I therefore believe that the adoption of the regulation of Parliament and of the Council on agricultural product quality schemes will contribute to ensuring a better quality system for foodstuffs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
