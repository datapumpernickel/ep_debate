It is a second reading and what we have tried to do is look at the Council"s common position compared to the Commission"s original proposal, and compared to its development following the amendments brought by Parliament, although not by me as rapporteur, as I took this on somewhat later. On the basis of all this we concluded, again in cooperation with the European Commission, that we had to formulate a number of amendments. At that time we did not of course yet know that this would be one of the first reports in the social field to come under the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1 May, just a few days ago, when the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force, health and safety has come under the codecision procedure. I believe that this marks a significant new departure. It means that the Commission"s role remains unchanged but becomes somewhat easier as it is no longer faced with the united front of the Member States saying that they want to go back to the common position agreed earlier. The Commission is then always faced with the problem of whether it should stand its ground and defend Parliament"s amendments to the bitter end or bring the matter to a close.</p>
<p class="contents">All this has now been made easier. If there is no agreement the matter simply comes back to the European Parliament and then we must all discuss it and vote on it. I think that the Council in particular, which when it comes to social policy has not proved exactly progressive in its relations with Parliament, still has to get used to this. I look forward to being able to discuss this with the Council in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have one question, which arose after we had completed the amendments. It concerns the position of LPG in the directive. I should like clarification from you on this point. Article 1 includes an exception, but there is a difference in interpretation between myself and your services on the one hand, and the English authorities on the other. The latter seem to give a different and somewhat broader interpretation. I should like to hear the last word from you on this point, so that the Minutes will be there to help the subsequent legislative process.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hughes </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Pronk for the work he has done, following Mr Mather, who dealt with it at first reading. On the second reading of this report he has been quite right to re‐present Parliament's amendments which were not accepted by the Council and also to include part of the Commission's text deleted by the Council. We in the Socialist Group will be supporting the amendments he has tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">There are certain concerns about some of the amendments. I have seen a number of briefings, for example, about Amendment No 7. Mr Skinner will speak about this in a moment. I have read and reread the text several times and have also had contact with the Commission services. I cannot see how Amendment No 7 can be interpreted as meaning that all the equipment has to be replaced; adapted, yes, but that is a totally different prospect. Such adaptation seems very important to me for workers' health and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">It is on that understanding of the meaning of the amendment that we will support Amendment No 7 as well as the others.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps it is just as well that this proposal will now be subject to codecision. Conciliation might give us an opportunity to reach some understanding on these matters with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing what will be my final speech in this Chamber for this mandate as chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs I would like to thank all of the Members of this House for their cooperation in moving forward the number of dossiers we have in this area of work in the last five years; and you too, Commissioner, for your valued cooperation. The progress that has been made will stand as a testament to your commitment to European employment and social policy.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Skinner </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I should like to add my heartfelt thanks to the rapporteur, whom we have seen on many an occasion take on the mantle of health and safety, to you, Commissioner, and your services for expediting much of the legislation which has been necessary in this field, and for your assistance both formally and informally in helping Parliament to understand what can and cannot be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed now, as Mr Hughes has just said, we move into the difficult area of codecision which can help us. In this particular directive we can seek further clarification from the Council. Mr Pronk and I have managed to find a compromise on Amendment No 2, which has led to a better text. I look forward to the Commission and the Council accepting that text. But Amendment No 7, where disagreement lies, certainly requires a large amount of clarification. Until we get that it is not one that I am going to be fond of supporting.</p>
<p class="contents">However, codecision is going to be about sensible discussion. I hope the Council will respond to what Parliament votes tomorrow. I too would like to say that I have enjoyed working in health and safety. I spent some time working on a lot of these reports. I must commend Mr Hughes, the chairman of the committee. The intensity of this discussion on health and safety has been led through that chair. I wish him the very best and hope that maybe, when we both come back in July, we will continue some of that particular discussion. Nonetheless I would like to hear from the Commission as to what we can do about Amendment No 7.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Flynn, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, let me first of all thank you, Mr Pronk. You have done a remarkably good job on what is regarded as a very technical matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is prepared to accept all of the proposed amendments. The Commission considers in fact the Council's common position as a step forward towards achieving better protection for the health and safety of workers potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres where fatal accidents occur every day. Nevertheless, you know that the Commission has maintained some reserves as regards the common position, for example on appropriate supervision and on the deletion of items in Annex 2 covering additional risks resulting from power failure and the need to provide for manual override where automatic processes deviate from intended operating conditions and the need to be able quickly to dissipate or isolate accumulated energy in the event of an emergency shutdown.</p>
<p class="contents">The text of the common position in these areas is considered by the Commission to be weaker than the amended proposal. The Commission therefore considers that the amendments proposed by the European Parliament are essential for the establishment of a strong, coherent prevention strategy against the risks arising from explosive atmospheres.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the amendments on the establishment of the vademecum and on the requirements for provision of information to undertakings, particularly SMEs. I share your view that a simple statement in the Council's minutes is not a sufficient guarantee of follow‐up.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the rapporteur's approach to bringing the proposed safety sign into line with the international CEN ISO standard is a good approach. As far as LPG is concerned, of course, the situation is that road traffic regulations cover the question of, say, tankers of LPG being delivered to a filling station. LPG in a plant is covered, but in a filling station the end user, a car, for instance, is not covered under Article 118a or 137. I would like to say as well that we have no difficulty with Amendment No 7 as it is our understanding as well that equipment is to be adapted, not replaced. That is an understanding I can give to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, Mr President, this is probably our last meeting together on some very important broad issues that deal with working people. I would like to finish by recording my personal pleasure and satisfaction with what we have achieved together on the development of employment policy and social policy agenda for the European Union. I would like to record my appreciation for the important contribution that you have made to achieving our shared objectives. When the history of the development of social policy and employment policy comes to be written subsequent to my leaving the Commission, the period 1993‐1999 will be recorded as quite a remarkable period for change, for advanced thinking and for Treaty change support. For those of you who will not be returning I want to congratulate you on the contribution you have made to social policy advances over these last few years. They are quite significant and they will make a real difference to European citizens. For those who will be back in July your responsibility to build on this base that we have started together will be quite immense. I believe it will be made easier because of the work and the cooperation that we have had these last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say to you, Stephen Hughes, as the chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, it has been my personal pleasure to work with you, not just as a good parliamentarian, but as a gentleman of credibility and integrity. You deserve your place in this House and I know that you will be back with your friends here to continue the good work. It has been a personal pleasure for me these years and I have gained enormously from the experience. I am full of expectation for the good things that will be achieved in the coming years for the citizens of Europe. It has been my pleasure to have been part of that advance.</p>
