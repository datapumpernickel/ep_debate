<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Vecchi </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Aldo, on behalf of the Socialist Group, on producing a brilliant report for the Committee on Development and Cooperation, a report he pressed for and felt very strongly about.</p>
<p class="contents">In today"s debate we are looking at an issue that is important for the development of territories which are very diverse in terms of legal status and levels of development, but which at least share a geographic location. Overseas countries and territories, ACP countries and ultraperipheral regions do in fact differ and the Union has rightly established a range of instruments for them.</p>
<p class="contents">To be frank, I am not entirely convinced by everything in Mr Aldo"s report. But I think we must support its basic political message, which is the need to deepen relations between the three different groups through intensive decentralised cooperation, with a view to achieving harmonious territorial development.</p>
<p class="contents">The report essentially deals with the outlook for the ultraperipheral regions and OCTs, and that is what the European Parliament is expressing its opinion on today. But I do think it is absolutely vital to involve the countries of the Caribbean and the Pacific fully, to listen to their ideas and their requests and make sure that any initiative is in their interests too. The full involvement of all interested parties in the consultation and decision‐making process is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also deals with issues relating to commercial regimes. Here it is essential to proceed with great caution, because even recently difficulties have arisen from abuses of the special rules relating to OCTs. The aim of encouraging the commercial integration of UPRs, OCTs and ACP countries is undoubtedly laudable, but its implementation must respect the special position of the ACP countries and take place in the context of the definition of new, broader rules linked to the new post‐Lomé Convention, the new GSP, the CAP reform and the WTO rules.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the interests of all European farmers must be taken into account in the context of the common organisations of various markets.</p>
<p class="contents">As a whole, however, this own‐initiative report sends an important and positive message. Closer external cooperation and more refined instruments will mean that even those territories of the Union which are geographically most marginal can find new roles and embark on new development paths, which will also benefit neighbouring developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">That is an important message, and it has our full backing. It is the reason our group will vote for the whole report as approved in committee, although we still think some specific points need further study.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lehideux </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span><span class="italic"> – (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, the report by our colleague Mr Aldo is a significant text. It is significant due to way in which it was prepared, because it affirms the natural desire of the regions, countries and territories concerned to establish regional partnerships. It is also significant because of the proposals that it puts forward.</p>
<p class="contents">During a fascinating meeting, the Committee on Development and Cooperation listened to representatives from the overseas regions and overseas countries and territories. That was a new experience, but it was a fundamental moment in Parliament"s understanding of the problems, needs and plans of Europeans from other corners of the globe. Such a dialogue was necessary and must be continued in as many contexts as possible. Indeed, the report makes proposals in this respect and we support them.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said a moment ago, this report affirms the natural desire of the ultraperipheral regions and the overseas countries and territories to establish regional partnerships. This is obviously extremely important for them, for their development and for their future. However, it is also, and perhaps above all, essential for the Union, because the Union will be involved in each of these partnerships, adding a particularly important dimension to its cooperation with the ACP countries. To some extent, this is recognition and affirmation of the Union"s global dimension, of its economic role, but also, and above all, of its political importance. We should not only accept these partnerships; rather, we should support them and help them to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve this, the rapporteur makes several proposals. In the time I have available, I would like to mention just one of these: the establishment of devolved units of the Commission in the ultraperipheral regions and the establishment of offices or contact points in the overseas countries and territories. This suggestion comes, notably, from local elected representatives in an ultraperipheral region, and I would thank the rapporteur sincerely for having included it in his text, thereby giving it weight and strength. However, this suggestion must not just be wishful thinking. If Parliament adopts it tomorrow, we will have to closely monitor its implementation. Little by little, it will become an essential element of the cooperation between the Union and the ACP countries and we will have to pay particular attention to this.</p>

It describes the pressures on island regions that are remote and isolated from the economic centre of the Union. It points out that there are three different kinds of subregions, which must be consulted, must be involved in the decision‐making; and here I believe the reference to new ACP negotiations is important.</p>
<p class="contents">The reference to trade, to the generalised system of preferences and to the need for a coherent policy is one of the key points of this report and a key to the future negotiations. We should support the concrete demands set out in relation to telecommunications, research and development, education and training and the prevention of natural disasters. I believe we all agree on the need for regional integration. However, the use of the term ‘Caribbean Europe" on page 11 of the report reflects both the problems that exist but also, in my view, a problem we have been carrying around with us since colonial days.</p>
<p class="contents">Would it not make sense to consider these three subregions together, to give them independence, to link them into a regional association through a new treaty and to help them in that endeavour, so that we can finally be through with this episode of old colonial history? That is a thought and an idea worth considering, because I find this demand, and the very term ‘Caribbean Europe", quite incomprehensible! I am in Europe, I am in this economic area, I am in this trade area, which we want to shape and control democratically. And the people of other regions want the same. Do we not want to support regional developments? Our resolve for the future should be to pursue this idea further!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hory </span> <span class="bold"> (ARE). – </span><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, on my own behalf, on behalf of Mrs Taubira, who has been detained due to threats of various demonstrations, and on behalf of my group, I would like to express our total support for the particularly relevant initiative by our colleague Blaise Aldo. He is finally proposing that we take a global and consistent view of the regional relations of the ACP countries, the ultraperipheral regions of the Union and the associated OCTs.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the OCTs – and particularly the one I know best, the territorial collectivity of Mayotte – I agree entirely with the analyses made by Mr Aldo and by Mr Castagnède, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy. They highlighted the lack of legal precision, the economic inconsistency and the social injustice of the situation created in the OCTs by the European Union. Mr Aldo tells us that they are the poor relations of the European Union. He is absolutely right. He could have highlighted the paradox that exists in that when it comes to the European Union"s internal solidarity, the OCTs are not rich enough to be with the rich, and when it comes to the Union"s external solidarity, they are not poor enough to be with the poor.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take a few examples from Mayotte of the inconsistency of our situation. Mayotte, for example, is not part of the European Union, but it votes in European elections. In order to develop, Mayotte needs stable and sound legal rules. Community law does not apply there, either directly, or automatically through a process of incorporation into national law. It is applied at the whim of the instructions for implementation which are a feature of the special legislative system. We are also told about economic development through local production, but Mayotte – which is already at a disadvantage due to its limited market, the fact that it is an island and the cost of labour – is penalised by the rule of non‐reciprocity of the preferential arrangements granted to the ACP countries in its region.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention one last example. Mayotte imports everything from the European Union, but the only sources of tax it has are those that involve penalising its own imports with customs duties. This is why I believe that the only solution for the OCTs – and I would ask my colleagues to make a clear distinction between the OCTs and the overseas departments – is to totally rewrite Article 227(3) of the Treaty. This would allow them to assert their full membership of Europe and, particularly through local decisions, to bring the wealth of their diversity and their particular characteristics to the European Union.</p>

It is important that the projects supported by the EU in these areas are coordinated, and that the EU takes more account of them in its own policies. There is an advantage in promoting decentralised and regional cooperation among the OCTs themselves and with the ACP States, because this can help promote their development. It is therefore important to enter into a dialogue and to develop an equal partnership which respects each of the partners' characteristics.</p>
<p class="contents">We neither can nor should sit in Strasbourg and dictate what this cooperation should be aimed at. In the first place, that is unworthy. Secondly, the countries themselves naturally have the best understanding of the local conditions. However, as the Committee of the Regions points out, we can encourage cooperation financially in areas such as research and development, technology transfer, education and culture, the improvement of sea and air connections, environmental protection and access to information technology. And we should also ensure in the negotiations on international trade that we maintain the trading privileges enjoyed by the OCTS and the ACP States. In that way, we shall also promote the thing on which all our discussion of development should be focused, namely the fight against poverty.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Antony </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must congratulate our colleague Blaise Aldo on the outstanding work he has done. It is a mark of his realism, his wisdom, and also what I would call a healthy empiricism, and these are all qualities that, in general, are rarely evident in this House. However, this is only a report and I believe that it shows the fruit of his work and his considerations. I also believe that it clearly demonstrates other political currents and forces, and I would like to share some of my reservations with you.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, we cannot accept the risk of a drift towards the progressive assimilation of our overseas departments and territories into the ACP countries. This is a considerable risk and it becomes evident when we read between the lines. For us, and I would like to clarify this for the French people that we represent, our overseas departments, our overseas territories – Réunion, Mayotte, the West Indies, New Caledonia, Polynesia and Guyana – are French territory just as much as our departments in Metropolitan France. We are aware of their particular characteristics and we constantly stress the need for national solidarity in order to face the challenges of their remoteness, their demography and their economic situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that I listened very closely to what was said by our colleague Mr Hory. He knows a great deal about the situation, and his remarks were entirely relevant and sensible. For example, unemployment is very high in Réunion and in the West Indies. Therefore, we should not devote our efforts to integrating unlimited numbers of immigrants. Indeed, the volume of such immigration is becoming unbearable and more and more tragic, and it also affects our department of Guyana. Nor should we try to overcome the effects of losing the connection with one"s roots, the failure to adapt and the refusal to assimilate, or the effects of the presence of communities that want to be increasingly dominant and overpowering. Instead, we should fully exercise solidarity with our overseas departments and territories.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to see a different Europe and a different system of cooperation with the ACP countries, although I cannot expand on this in the context of these proposals. However, we are not questioning the specific proposals that our colleague Mr Aldo rightly sets out in his report, such as those on fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to say that this is a good report. Nevertheless, we do have certain concerns, based on our sense of national interest and the interests of our overseas departments and territories. It is therefore with a certain amount of regret that we abstain on this report, pending further consideration.</p>

The ultraperipheral regions form part of the Community territory and have equal rights. The citizens of those regions, including myself and Mr Aldo, are therefore voters and can be elected representatives within the European Union. We live in regions that are situated far from the continental heart of Europe but we are members of the European Union in the same way as any Community citizen. The only difference is that we live further away.</p>
<p class="contents">There is clearly a certain ambiguity as regards the British, French, Dutch and Danish overseas countries and territories, as some of these regions still seem to be evolving. Nonetheless, they too are still territories of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The ACP countries are independent and are sovereign states. No‐one is trying to regulate their status or to assimilate them. On the other hand, the Canary Islands – where I am from – clearly form part of the European Union and will continue to do so as they have been a part of Spain since the fifteenth century.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the Aldo report is to use the European Union"s potential in these far‐off regions to help to promote one of the EU"s aims, namely development aid. The ultraperipheral regions – and perhaps to a greater extent the overseas countries and territories – have a relatively low standard of living compared with the Community average, although it is still much higher than that of the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals in the Aldo report are aimed at establishing a relationship, and this is of particular importance for the region where Mr Aldo himself lives, the Caribbean. The geographical distribution there rather affects the situation and the status of each of the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that these are positive proposals, as Mr Vecchi said. They probably need to be examined in more depth, but the fact that the Commission is using these regions as platforms for development aid operations is a positive step. This is a way of promoting a certain degree of integration between those regions and their less developed neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">This report by Mr Aldo is an own‐initiative report and is clearly not binding. The Commission could therefore use some of the points and proposals made by Mr Aldo as a basis for specific proposals that would allow both the ultraperipheral regions and the overseas countries and territories to play a serious role in its work to support development aid in the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I believe that we should welcome this excellent report by Mr Aldo. For me, it represents at least the beginning of one aspect of the Community"s action in the area of development aid.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fernández Martín </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span><span class="italic"> – (ES)</span> Mr President, the debate on the report by Blaise Aldo has the merit of being politically expedient.</p>
<p class="contents">The ACP countries have often shown their support for an increase in regional cooperation in the fields of politics, economics, trade and culture. This was particularly evident last spring during the meeting of the ACP‐EU Joint Assembly in Mauritius.</p>
<p class="contents">The European overseas territories are increasingly calling for greater consideration so that they can participate in a developing world with a globalised economy.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember one basic fact: the overseas territories are not territories of the Union, but their inhabitants are Community citizens and we must never forget about them. The Union"s ultraperipheral regions enjoy a specific status, which has been incorporated into the Treaty of Amsterdam as primary Union law. If they are capable of making the most of their geographical situation, they will be able to play a role in the future development of the Union"s relations with ACP countries, for example, within the framework of Interreg.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many examples of interregional cooperation, including Réunion in the southern Indian Ocean, the French overseas departments in the Caribbean and the cooperation between the Canary Islands and certain countries in western Africa. These cases demonstrate the possibilities offered by cooperation; we cannot ignore them. Three weeks ago, the general secretariat of the ACP Chamber of Commerce met in the Canary Islands with a view to establishing its headquarters there. This is just one of the many examples of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">For these and other reasons, we are going to vote in favour of the Aldo report. The Commission is aware of all the points we have made. I would therefore like to end by asking the Commission for its opinion – given the absence of a legal basis – on how we could bring all these elements together so that three different entities might be able to cooperate and help each other.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Carlotti </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the Committee on Development and Cooperation welcomed this own‐initiative report on relations between the overseas countries and territories, the ACP countries and the ultraperipheral regions of the European Union. Blaise Aldo, the rapporteur, has completed a significant report, and I congratulate him on his bold conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Aldo has shown us that we had a duty towards these regions. They are strong in their originality and in their diverse cultures, identities and statuses. They are true representatives of the European Union in the world, as they are also outposts in the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic and the Pacific, and they embody the European model in their values of democracy and freedom. Moreover, our cultural and historical links with them mean that we must support and cooperate closely with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite our trade agreements and our specific programmes, we had never succeeded in holding a global discussion on the future of these regions and on their relations with the ACP countries. At a time when the Union is engaging in a threefold process of renewing and renegotiating the Lomé Conventions, it was fitting to review its association with the OCTs and to implement a form of adapted integration with the ultraperipheral regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the discussion led by Blaise Aldo comes just in time, as it is becoming essential for the European Union to promote harmonious economic and social development in these regions and to help them to integrate into the international and commercial system and face global competition.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, I would just like to highlight three points from the Aldo report. The first is its political dimension, with the establishment of a forum for dialogue between the European Union and the OCTs. The second is its economic dimension, with the establishment of a European Fund for developing economic and social projects. And the last point is the establishment of representative offices of the European Union and contact points to promote training and information projects for individuals or whole populations.</p>
<p class="contents">I naturally support the rapporteur"s proposal to maintain the current trade arrangements, in other words, free access for products from the OCTs, under conditions that would not harm the interests of the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I believe that the Commission should pay a great deal of attention to the Aldo report, so that this document might result in specific proposals.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Günther </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, when I look at the globe and consider the regions we are discussing, it almost makes me feel dizzy to think about the problems around the world that we are tackling from here in Europe. First and foremost we have special obligations towards the ACP states. The rapporteur, whom I congratulate on his work, pointed out in his explanatory statement that developments in these regions, in the OCTs, are not particularly positive, in spite of favourable conditions. I do not know whether we are taking the right approach to changing this situation. On the one hand he proposes a range of administrative measures, on the other a range of financial measures. I would like to see more emphasis put on the regional approach to which some previous speakers have repeatedly referred. For I believe that is where the best chances lie for development, that we must exclude the long‐distance approach from the outset and focus more on cooperation within these regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I am a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation I still have a few problems with some of the paragraphs and sections of the report. First there is the question of enhanced Union citizenship which it discusses; but that is after all tied to very definite conditions. Then there is the question of a special fund under the Community budget. Here I fear that we would to some extent be restricting ourselves, tying ourselves down and losing flexibility. Thirdly, there is the idea of setting up offices or contact points in all these countries, which I also see as an added administrative burden without any obvious benefits.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van Putten </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I too would like to stress the importance of the Blaise Aldo report, for which I thank him. He is right to call for attention to be paid to these regions which have just been described, and he looks, among other things, at the issues of trade and equal treatment with the ACP countries. As regards the funds, I also have questions like those raised earlier by other speakers such as Mrs Günther. But I am not yet convinced that this is the best solution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also striking that it is largely the French who are conducting this debate and, unfortunately, I find that I am the only Dutch person to speak on the subject, despite the fact that the Netherlands Antilles are also concerned. It is very noticeable too that there are no Englishmen present, yet they also have overseas regions. There are two kinds of overseas regions. There are the Overseas Departments and there are Overseas Territories. The Overseas Departments are exclusively French. We say in the Netherlands that the Overseas Territories are a sort of poor relation in that they are treated rather differently, and it is on this that there is now a major conflict again.</p>
<p class="contents">This sometimes results in bizarre situations. The Netherlands Antilles, for example, have Sint Maarten, while the French have Saint Martin. That is simply the other side of the island. On our side there is the airport, while the French side is European territory. It is amazing that no graduate student in the Netherlands or France has written a thesis on what this means for Europe"s border controls and the like.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I believe that we must also look at the treatment of the Overseas Territories in relation to the Overseas Departments. If these Overseas Departments have such a special status, what does that mean for the Overseas Territories? I should like to know whether in the future as a follow‐up to the Aldo report – which I repeat is very important – the Commission will also turn its attention to this matter.</p>

<p class="contents">The possibility of a new tripartite regional set‐up – with closer economic, social and political links between overseas countries and territories, the ACP countries and the ultraperipheral regions of the European Union – could not have come at a better moment. Mr Aldo"s report opens up new avenues towards a new type of development aid, a new model that differs considerably from traditional aid, as provided for until now in the Lomé Convention, the old EDF or in bilateral agreements between rich countries and developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">At present there is a dangerous decline in world solidarity. In 1997 state aid and private credits in the OECD countries earmarked for cooperation fell by 41 billion dollars, to 324 billion, the lowest level for a decade. We need to reverse that trend and these regional and sub‐regional partnerships could prove to be an investment with a visible return for all interested parties. The institutionalisation of the OCTs and the ultraperipheral regions of the EU as special partners under the Lomé Convention, particularly by including them in the new Joint Assembly, deserves a warm welcome from us. By the same token, we also support, overall, the very diverse range of proposals and ideas contained in the draft legislative resolution in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">With special reference to the ultraperipheral regions of Madeira, the Azores, the Canary Islands, Réunion, Guadeloupe, Martinique and French Guiana, we should stress that they are not only furthermost frontier of the Union but also genuine strategic centres for strengthening trade relations with various regions around the world, as well as local beacons of democracy and freedom in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. The European Union should set up delegations in those regions with decentralised powers to coordinate support actions as part of the regional cooperation debated here today.</p>

<p class="contents">There are certainly parts of the world where ACP states, overseas countries and territories of Member States of the Union, and ultraperipheral regions which are an integral part of the European Union coexist in one region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Third Lomé Convention, covering 1984‐89, first introduced the idea of strengthening cooperation between these three groups with differing status. Now, in parallel with the negotiations for the Fifth Lomé Convention, which opened on 30 September 1998 between the European Union and the ACP group, and the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty, the future of the ultraperipheral regions and overseas countries and territories will begin to be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">Undoubtedly we need to take a keen interest in these territories and distinguish them carefully. One point the rapporteur highlights, and which I particularly want to stress, is the fundamental importance of disaster prevention. This has also been stressed by the group on climate change for the small island states, which I chair in the Joint ACP‐EU Assembly, because these territories are particularly vulnerable and need our assistance, especially as the activities vital both to their economies and to social welfare principally develop along the coastal strip.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Aldo has looked at these problems in great detail and I think he should be strongly supported, especially as a report along these lines is to be approved at the next Joint Assembly.</p>

I am very honoured to replace him in the debate on this matter, as the Commission welcomes the work that has been done by your Committee on Development and Cooperation, thanks, in particular, to its dynamic rapporteur, Mr Aldo. It also welcomes the work carried out by the committees that were consulted for an opinion and their draftsmen, Mr Castagnède and Mr Souchet.</p>
<p class="contents">This work resulted in an own‐initiative report that is very detailed due to the wide range of subjects it covers, including financial, trade, humanitarian and geopolitical issues. It is also complex due to the various types of status to which it refers: the ultraperipheral regions of the Union, the four overseas departments, the Canaries, the Azores and Madeira, the 20 countries and territories associated with the European Community, and the ACP states, with which the Union is currently negotiating a future partnership agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add that this is a bold own‐initiative report, and I think that that is the best compliment that can be given to Members. It often goes very far in asserting certain concepts that have yet to be realised. Examples of these are the decision to do away with the unanimous procedure governing the association of the OCTs, Article 136 of the Treaty, or the establishment of free trade areas in the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean, involving ACP countries, overseas territories and overseas departments. Other examples include the establishment of a special fund for the development of the OCTs, to be included in the budget, and the plan to give a voice to the OCTs through some sort of involvement in the ACP‐EU Joint Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">Elaborating your ideas, coming up with revolutionary concepts and drawing up daring proposals are the most important contributions your institution can make to help the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, for its part, has also entered into extensive discussions on the 20 OCTs. The results of this will be submitted to Parliament, through its Committee on Development and Cooperation at its meeting in April. The Commission plans to consult local leaders on the results of its discussions. The ideas taken up in your own‐initiative report will be very useful to the local representatives involved during these consultations. Finally, they will also be of great use to the Commission as it will have to draw up proposals following these various consultations.</p>
