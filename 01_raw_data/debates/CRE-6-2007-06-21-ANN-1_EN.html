<p>At the meeting of ICATT in November 2006 a recovery plan was adopted for the red tuna. However, the transposition of this plan into Community law is still dependent on its approval by the Council, in a context of pressure being applied by certain Member States.</p>
<p>Both biologists and fishermen, and in particular the Cofradía (fishermen's organisation) of Formentera (Balearic Islands), have been issuing warnings for years concerning the perilous consequences which the disappearance of this species would have for the delicate balance of flora and fauna in the Mediterranean, including a proliferation - as observed already - of jellyfish, the tuna's main competitor in the consumption of zooplankton. They have accordingly urged the EU to adopt a prolonged moratorium on fishing so as to allow the species to recover.</p>
<p>Can the Council confirm whether consideration is being given to temporary moratoriums on industrial fishing, and, if so, for how long a period? Are measures envisaged to raise the minimum catchable size? Will a monitoring system be introduced for tuna caught for fattening purposes?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The November 2006 ICATT meeting adopted a Recovery Plan for the red tuna; the Plan's transposition into Community law is still waiting for approval by the Council, due to the pressure brought to bear by certain Member States.</p>
<p>In the last few days, the President of the Cofradia de Formentera (Spain) had denounced the fact that since 2000, large tuna boats have been using light aircraft, equipped with the very latest technology, to spot tuna shoals. These tuna boats are, furthermore, damaging the sea bed and the local fishing industry's nets by caging their live catches, intended for fattening, these cages are then dragged, at depths of up to 35 metres, to their destination, in the process destroying the fishing lines and nets of the local small-scale fishermen.</p>
<p>When does the Council intend to adopt the red tuna Recovery Plan? Can it confirm whether the Plan covers the banning of tuna-shoal detection by means of light aircraft?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As regards temporary moratoriums on industrial fishing, Article 80e provides for the following fishing bans:</p>
<p>from 1 June to 31 December 2007 for large-scale pelagic longline vessels over 24 m in length in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean, with the exception of the area delimited by west of 10°W and north of 42°N,</p>
<p>from 1 July to 31 December 2007 for purse seine vessels in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean,</p>
<p>from 15 November 2007 to 15 May 2008 for bait boats in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean,</p>
<p>from 15 November 2007 to 15 May 2008 for pelagic trawlers in the East Atlantic.</p>
<p>the use of aeroplanes and helicopters to search for bluefin tuna is prohibited in the Convention Area, as laid down in Article 80f.</p>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the June 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>I should like to mention at the outset that the Council does not comment on press articles as a matter of principle.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I wish to assure the honourable Member that the EU continues to take a clear position on the respect for and advocacy of the basic principles of democracy referred to in his question. As a country negotiating its accession with the EU, Turkey must meet the political criteria laid down at the Copenhagen European Council, namely stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities.</p>
<p>As is stated in the negotiating framework adopted by the Council in October 2005, the European Union expects Turkey to sustain its process of reform and to work towards further improvement in terms of respect for the principles of liberty, democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms. The EU also expects Turkey to consolidate and broaden its legislation and implementation measures specifically in relation to provisions relating, inter alia, to freedom of expression and religion and to minority rights. Recently, in its conclusions of 11 December 2006, the Council noted that further significant efforts were required on Turkey’s part to strengthen freedom of expression and religion. All of these issues are raised regularly in the course of political dialogue between the EU and Turkey.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding Yassin Al-Qadi, I should like to remind the honourable Member that, in accordance with the October 2001 decision of the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee, the Commission, in its Regulation (EC) No 2062/2001, an implementing regulation, placed Mr Qadi on the list of persons, groups and entities covered by the freezing of funds and economic resources.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0410"></a>

<p>The European Union has long maintained economic relations with the countries of North Africa under the Europe-Mediterranean partnership agreements and the European Neighbourhood Policy.</p>
<p>Through the Barcelona Process, the EU has demonstrated its consistent commitment to socioeconomic development and the consolidation of prosperity throughout the Mediterranean region, and in the countries of North Africa in particular. Under the MEDA Regulation, the countries of North Africa received a total of € 5.2 billion over the period 2000-2006, the main aim being to create in those countries an economic climate conducive to faster growth. Under the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), which has superseded MEDA as from 2007, the EU has increased funding for its neighbouring countries by a third. Out of a total of roughly € 5 bn for the period 2007-2010, € 3.4 bn has been earmarked for the Union's southern neighbouring countries. The primary purpose of the ENPI is to implement the action plans drawn up as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The efforts in this area include measures to open up markets, modernise undertakings and develop the private sector, to foster trade and industrial cooperation, to create jobs and to improve economic infrastructure. In addition to the ENPI funding, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has made loans totalling € 10.7 bn available to the North African Mediterranean countries for the period 2007-2013.</p>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the June 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member is aware, the EU is firmly resolved to take on a leading role in the fight against climate change. It has also promised to help developing countries meet their commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.</p>
<p>The honourable Member will also be aware of the firm commitments to reduce emissions that the EU made recently, at the March 2007 European Council. It is vital that, as well as industrialised countries making absolute emission reductions, the economically more advanced developing countries, too, contribute adequately to reducing their emissions levels according to their responsibilities and capabilities, including by means of new and flexible types of obligation and increased cooperation on technology.</p>
<p>In addition, it was agreed recently, at the G8 meeting in Heiligendamm, that our approach to climate protection must be such as to support growth in developing, industrialised and newly industrialised countries alike, whilst avoiding detrimental economic effects. It was also decided to draw up long-term strategies with countries whose economic activities produce high emission levels (including Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa). China, too, declared its commitment to making a fair contribution to the fight against climate change.</p>
<p>Even though China’s climate-protection plan does not currently contain any absolute reduction targets, it nevertheless represents a welcome and clear indication of movement towards the development of the international climate-policy regime under the umbrella of the UNFCCC. China regards increased climate protection as a national challenge and is prepared to continue along the path of sustainable development. In 2007, China’s Premier Wen Jiabao has repeatedly announced measures to cool the overheated economy (approximately 11% growth in the first quarter, approximately 18% in April/May) and to control rising environmental pollution and energy consumption, but has admitted to difficulties in practical implementation.</p>
<p>By way of conclusion, I should like to assure the honourable Member that the EU is making a serious effort to cooperate with China in climate matters, whilst taking commercial issues into account. Firstly, the EU–China Partnership on Climate Change, which was established in 2005, covers the elimination of obstacles to the development, use and transfer of technology. Secondly, the EU–ASEM meetings in 2007 have presented the opportunity to put the spotlight on climate change. There is no doubt about the need to raise the issue of climate change in other contexts, including that of commercial relations.

<p>(DE) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor its Members, was not given orally at Question Time to the Council at the European Parliament's June 2007 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council's 2005 agreement to increase official development aid went beyond merely confirming the UN objective of spending 0.7% of GNI on official development aid, since the Council agreed to achieve this goal by a set time, namely 2015. The real and substantial increases in the budgets of the EU Member States mean that the prospects for ODA are encouraging, even though major challenges remain.</p>
<p>The Council recently gave a clear statement of its position on this matter (conclusions of the Council of 15 May 2007).</p>
<p>In 2002 the EU pledged to spend 0.39% of gross national income (GNI) on development aid in 2006; in 2005 it agreed to raise this percentage to 0.56% by 2010 and to 0.7% by 2015.</p>
<p>In 2006 the EU reached a total of 0.42% of GNI, thereby exceeding the target of 0.39%. This represents a record sum of EUR 48 billion.</p>
<p>Within this overall amount, some Member States have gone beyond their respective targets, whilst others have failed to reach them for various reasons. However, the efforts made by the European Union as a whole must be considered highly satisfactory.</p>
<p>The Council is aware that some of the measures that have produced this satisfactory overall figure are one-off measures, and consequently additional efforts will be necessary to reach future targets.</p>
<p>The honourable Member is doubtless aware that the quality of aid is just as important as the quantity. In this connection the Council also adopted key conclusions on making development cooperation more effective by means of joint programming and increased division of labour among donors. In keeping with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, this should help ensure that development aid has a greater impact as regards fighting poverty, achieving the Millennium Development Goals and reducing the administrative burden in recipient countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0427"></a>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the June 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Under Title V: ‘Provisions on a common foreign and security policy’, Article 18(5), of the EU Treaty, the Council may indeed appoint a special representative with a mandate in relation to particular policy issues.</p>
<p>On the subject of energy policy, I am sure the honourable Member is aware that the European Council declared back in March 2006 that the Energy Policy for Europe (EPE) was to help increase security of supply via the development of a common approach to external energy policy. The measures mentioned in connection with realising the EPE included the development of a common voice in support of energy-policy objectives when addressing third countries.</p>
<p>The general principles of this approach were then further specified by the Commission and the Secretary-General/High Representative in their joint paper entitled ‘An external policy to serve Europe’s energy interests’, which the June 2006 European Council welcomed, asking the Presidency, the Commission and the High Representative to further the work on implementing this external energy policy. The Presidency, the Commission and the High Representative have spoken with this ‘common voice’ many times already in energy-policy dialogue with third countries or groups of third countries.</p>
<p>Most recently, the Spring European Council of March 2007 laid down the aspects essential for the further development of the EU’s common voice.</p>
<p>The Council has not decided to appoint a Special Representative for energy policy, but the EU’s external energy policy is being dealt with at the highest level, and is being represented appropriately to third countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0437"></a>

We call upon all parties concerned to take this opportunity to exercise restraint and refrain from any action that could endanger the talks.</p>
<p>The next time the European Union and Morocco are due to meet is on 23 July at the meeting of the Association Council. This, too, will present an opportunity to discuss these issues further.

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the June 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Presidency is well aware that the project mentioned by the honourable Member has given rise to concerns on the part of several EU Member States, third countries and environmental organisations as to possible adverse environmental effects. It is also true that international agreements, particularly the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context (‘Espoo Convention’), Community law and domestic law lay down rules and obligations relating to environmental impact assessments (EIA).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Council has no legal basis whatsoever for taking specific measures to ensure that an EIA is carried out; it is incumbent on the Commission to ensure that Community law is properly applied, and to take such measures as it deems appropriate in the event of infringements.</p>
<p>As regards the initial results of an EIA, all the Presidency can do is note the publicly available information, which states that all the countries concerned have been officially informed about the project and that there are plans to draw up an EIA report by autumn 2007, which is then to be presented to the competent authorities for approval.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member should also be aware, Decision 1364/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks makes several references to a gas pipeline between Russia and Germany via the Baltic Sea or ‘via the offshore route’.<a href="#defann_17_1" name="refann_17_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>In Annex I to this Decision, the Council and Parliament have designated a ‘North European gas pipeline’ a ‘project of European interest’ – a term denoting the projects given ‘the highest priority’ (see recital 8 and Article 8).</p>
<p>I should like to refer the honourable Member specifically to Article 13 of this Decision, which reads as follows: ‘This Decision shall be without prejudice to the results of the environmental impact assessment of projects, plans or programmes which define the future framework for such projects. The results of the environmental impact assessments, where such an assessment is requested in accordance with relevant Community legislation, shall be taken into consideration before a decision on the carrying out of the projects is actually taken in accordance with the relevant Community legislation.’</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

It is indicative that the seven consecutive increases since December 2005, when the base rate was 2%, have resulted in soaring profits for the banks, multiple increases in monthly mortgage repayments and in conjunction with falling wages and pensions have, in general, dealt a severe blow to the standard of living of working-class families.</p>

<p>(EN) Climate change is happening and its financial consequences, both in terms of mitigating emissions of greenhouse gases and adapting to the unavoidable consequences of climate change need to be considered. For 2007-2013 the EU budget is fixed and it is too early to anticipate the financial perspective after 2013. However, climate change risk prevention, mitigation and adaptation measures can already be financed through the current Community structural fund programmes. Further action will be needed to promote the inclusion of such measures in the current programmes. Climate proofing of projects financed by these Funds must be ensured to guarantee the sustainability of these projects.</p>
<p>For the 2007-2013 period the LIFE+ programme has climate change as one of its principal objectives. LIFE+ will fund innovative or demonstration projects promoting adaptation across borders, i.e. demonstrating cost-efficient adaptation technologies, innovative approaches.</p>
<p>The European Union Solidarity Fund is not an instrument specifically designed to respond to climate change. However in cases of major natural disasters of a European dimension, whether provoked by climate change or other natural causes, it may grant financial assistance. It is financed outside the EU budget on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>Moreover, Council has adopted in March a civil protection financial instrument which aims at supporting and complementing the efforts of Member States for the protection of people, the environment and property in the event of natural and man-made disasters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to support the Community's ambitious climate change objectives and as part of a wider reform of rules on national state aid, the Commission has recently presented new draft Community guidelines on environmental state aid. The updated guidelines will apply a more economics-based approach to ensure that Member States can support measures in favour of the environment whilst causing the least possible distortion of competition.</p>
<p>The concern about climate change will influence EU relations with third countries. In developing countries, adaptation to the consequences of climate change will be important because of the increased vulnerability and limited capacity of poor communities. Several policies and funding mechanisms exist and need to be further developed to face the adaptation challenge globally.</p>
<p>The Community's research programmes have invested in targeted climate change research over several years to build a solid knowledge base in support of policy making. Spending on adaptation research will increase further.</p>
<p>The Commission will adopt before the summer a Green Paper on adapting to the impacts of climate change which will elaborate in greater detail on the cost and policy responses proposed for adaptation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0402"></a>

It is therefore for the Member State to determine, before giving the development consent for a project, if it is likely to have significant effects on the environment. If this is the case, an environmental impact assessment has to be carried out.</p>
<p>The site "Ses Salines d'Eivissa i Formentera" has been designated as a site of Community importance under Directive 92/43/EEC<a href="#defann_23_4" name="refann_23_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> (the Habitats Directive) and as a special protection area under Directive 79/409/EEC<a href="#defann_23_5" name="refann_23_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> (the Birds Directive). For projects likely to have a negative impact on such sites an assessment must be carried out in accordance with Articles 6.3 and 6.4 of the Habitats Directive. On the basis of this assessment the relevant authorities have to decide if the project can go ahead, and if so, under what conditions.</p>
<p>According to the available information, the project and the environmental impact assessment were the subject of a public information procedure in May 2006. Moreover, in April 2007, the competent authority of the Balearics issued a favourable opinion on the project under certain conditions. The Commission also understands that the project is planned in an area outside the Natura 2000 site, that it will not significantly affect any Natura 2000 site, and that the impacts the project would have on the priority natural habitat "Posidonia oceanica" will not be significant.</p>

Indeed, installations with a capacity below 20 Megawatts (MW) do not fall under the scope of the EU Emissions Trading Directive<a href="#defann_24_1" name="refann_24_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This also means that they do not have emission allowances, or indeed have any other obligations related to emissions trading.</p>
<p>A basic design principle of the EU emissions trading scheme (ETS) is that it only includes direct emitters of greenhouse gases. This means that only the producers but not the end-users of electricity participate in emissions trading. Therefore, the allowances that are surrendered by electricity producers to compensate for greenhouse gases emitted in the course of generating electricity that will be consumed by – inter alia – small and medium enterprises cannot be regarded as allowances "belonging" to such small and medium enterprises.</p>
<p>Power generators might pass on any potential increases in the cost of power generation to power consumers. This could extend to costs associated with emissions allowances. High costs of energy encourage end-users such as small and medium-sized enterprises to further save on their power consumption. However the Commission will consider possible measures to address any windfall profits, notably through the review of the EU ETS and by increasing the competitive pressure in the EU energy markets.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that all sectors of the economy should contribute to the necessary greenhouse gas emission reductions in order to restrict climate change to 2°C above pre-industrial level. The currently ongoing review of the EU Emissions Trading Directive will provide an opportunity to evaluate how and to what extent small and medium-sized companies should participate in emission trading and ensure that they do so in a cost-efficient manner.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The EU has taken extensive action in the area of waste over the past thirty years. Indeed, it was one of the very first environmental issues tackled at the European level. The EU now has 14 pieces of waste legislation in place, ranging from general legislation such as the Waste Framework Directive<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, to specific legislation dealing with waste management techniques or particular waste flows.</p>
<p>With legislation such as the Landfill Directive<a href="#defann_25_2" name="refann_25_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Waste Incineration Directive<a href="#defann_25_3" name="refann_25_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, or the IPPC Directive<a href="#defann_25_4" name="refann_25_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, high, uniform and detailed standards are put in place to ensure that the environment and human health is protected from waste installations, no matter where they may be in the EU. Similarly, legal measures such as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)<a href="#defann_25_5" name="refann_25_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> or End of Life Vehicles<a href="#defann_25_6" name="refann_25_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> Directives ensure that a common approach is taken by the Member States to difficult waste streams, protecting the environment and preventing obstacles to the Internal Market.</p>
<p>There are, however, still varying approaches to waste management in the Member States. Some of these are normal and inevitable, the result of varying geographical and cultural circumstances. In other cases, as set out in the Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste<a href="#defann_25_7" name="refann_25_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> of December 2005, the Commission is working towards greater co-ordination and additional minimum standards for waste.

The result, on the one hand, is that business has made huge profits, and has managed and dictated policy in these sectors and, on the other hand, that workers are unable to enjoy areas which are actually public property and are compelled to pay exorbitant charges in order to swim or for any other services.</p>

<p>It is important to underline that this Recommendation talks about "adequate" access. This does not imply that each beach or the whole coastline must be open to the general public. Whether in a particular case the coastline is, or is not, accessible to the public – and on what conditions – is strictly a matter of subsidiarity.</p>
<p>The Recommendation on Integrated Coastal Zone Management is a non-binding legal instrument. It aims at sustainable development of coastal areas, in particular through better coordination and involvement of stakeholders. Member States are invited to set up Strategies for Integrated Coastal Zone Management, based on general principles. In line with the principles of subsidiarity, the Recommendation does not impose particular issues or address specific sites.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0363"></a>

The spa industry is an asset in that it is widely used by patients in Europe, but it lacks a European legal framework which would guarantee quality standards and enable it to be exploited as a natural resource. In fact, there are no European provisions governing the quality of spa waters, unlike bathing water, groundwater, drinking water, and so on. The same is true of other resources in this sector, such as mud, etc.</p>
<p>Does the Commission intend to recognise therapeutic spa treatments in the context of cross-border healthcare provision?

<p>A specific surveillance network for healthcare-associated infections (HELICS) is funded by the Public Health Programme.</p>
<p>Surveillance data estimate that every year, 3 million patients in the EU acquire a healthcare-associated infection, corresponding to 10% of hospitalised patients. Approximately 50,000 deaths are estimated to occur every year as a consequence of such infections.</p>
<p>EU surveillance networks rely on data from national surveillance systems which are heterogeneous in nature and which, in numerous cases, are not readily available.</p>
<p>As the EU is progressively covering surveillance of communicable diseases via the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC), the quality and comparability of data is critical.</p>
<p>In their 2007 annual epidemiological report, the ECDC identified healthcare-associated infections as one of the major communicable disease threats in the EU.</p>
<p>The Commission held a public consultation from December 2005 to January 2006 on a document called "Strategies for improving patient safety by prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections".</p>
<p>This document is meant to form the basis for a Council Recommendation on the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections to be adopted in 2008 as part of a wider package on patient safety and quality of healthcare services.</p>
<p>The principal recommendations will cover the establishment or strengthening of:</p>
<p>- control and preventive measures to support containment of infections;</p>
<p>- infection prevention and control programmes in healthcare institutions;</p>
<p>- surveillance systems according to commonly agreed standards:</p>
<p>- education, training, research and information exchange.</p>
<p>The ultimate aim of any future proposal for a Council Recommendation is to increase patient safety and to bring down the significant burden of healthcare-associated infections on EU societies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0395"></a>

<p>(EN) A Commission inspection was recently carried out in Brazil in March 2007 in order to assess whether animal and public health standards related to export of beef were in compliance with Community rules. The inspection took place in March 2007 and the final report will be published on the Directorate General Health and Consumer Protection (DG SANCO) website<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, in accordance with the normal procedures.</p>
<p>Following this inspection the Commission assessment is that import of beef from Brazil into the Community does not present a health risk to our consumers and livestock and does not warrant any immediate changes to the extensive import requirements currently in place. A ban would therefore not be proportionate to the situation at hand.</p>
<p>According to normal procedures following a Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) mission, once the draft report is drawn up, the Brazilian authorities have the possibility to comment on it and if appropriate provide evidence that the identified shortcomings are being tackled. The Commission then reserves the right to reassess the situation and consider further action.</p>
<p>In this regard, the Commission remains in close contact with the Brazilian authorities to ensure that the shortcomings identified as regards implementation of Community import conditions for beef are properly addressed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>My question begins with a self-criticism: sadly, the European Parliament is not setting a good example and is unable to impose a ban on smoking in its public spaces. Some EU states, however – Ireland, Italy, France, the UK, Belgium and Lithuania – are successfully implementing the ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces (admittedly with some exceptions). Although the regulation of smoking falls within the sphere of responsibility of the Member States, in my view the Commission could achieve a great deal in the area of smoking prevention by drafting proposals on how the good example of these EU Member States could be followed.</p>
<p>What measures is the Commission taking to prevent smoking? Does it have any plans to draw general conclusions from the positive and negative experiences of all Member States with their bans on smoking in public places, and to make recommendations accordingly?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission thanks the Honourable Member for the question on tobacco control, in particular smoke-free policies. The Commission welcomes all Member States that have already strengthened their smoke free laws, and hopes that others will follow their example towards a smoke free Europe.</p>
<p>In January 2007 the Commission adopted a Green Paper which launched a public consultation on the best way forward to promote smoke-free environments in Europe.</p>
<p>This consultation closed on 1 June 2007. More than 250 responses have been received and the Commission is currently analysing them with a view to publishing a summary of responses during the summer. A preliminary assessment of the submissions showed that further EU action is needed. This will need to take into account the differing situation in Member States. The Commission will be guided by the experience from those that already have successful smoking bans.</p>
<p>In this regard, the recent discussions in the Environment Parliamentary committee and in the Health Council in May were very helpful.</p>
<p>Once the Parliament has delivered its opinion in September, the Commission will complete the analysis and will propose EU level measures in a follow-up communication in 2008.</p>
<p>Of the wide range of tobacco control measures in the EU, the Commission would like to underline one.</p>
<p>The new pictorial warnings on tobacco packages are intended to help smokers visualise the nature of tobacco related diseases, including the risks of passive smoking. Sadly, the pictorial warnings which have been supported by the Parliament, are only used in a handful of countries. The Commission asks Honourable Members to support the promotion of their introduction in more EU countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0401"></a>

<p>(EN) The Eurobarometer survey showed that the willingness to donate varies from 29% to 81% in the EU. Several reasons have been identified to explain these differences:</p>
<p>Societies have different attitudes towards organ donation, based on cultural and social factors.</p>
<p>The level of public understanding of organ donation and related ethical issues as well as variations in legal procedures for donor consent influence willingness to donate.</p>
<p>On the top of willingness to donate come differences in the actual transplantation systems. Each Member State has its methods of organising and carrying out transplantations, based on the type of health system, available resources and the attention given to increasing the number of transplants;</p>
<p>The Commission adopted on 30 May a Communication on Organ Donation and Transplantation, which aims to:</p>
<p>Improve the quality and safety of organs for transplantation;</p>
<p>Increase the availability of organs for transplant; and</p>
<p>Make transplantation systems more efficient and accessible.</p>
<p>These actions will particularly benefit those Member States with lower level donation rates.</p>
<p>The Commission seeks to achieve these goals through:</p>
<p>An Action Plan to enhance cooperation and the exchange of best practice between Member States. Discussions with experts on concrete possibilities will start in July; adoption of a proposal by the Commission is foreseen in late 2008 or 2009.</p>
<p>A proposal for a legislative instrument, to be proposed in late 2008, on safety and quality of organs.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no clear-cut data on organ trafficking, although the problem is estimated to be much smaller in Europe than in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>The Commission will closely monitor any developments in organ trafficking both inside the EU and worldwide. The legislative instrument will help to combat trafficking by setting common standards for the authorisation of establishments and programmes of organ donation and procurement in Europe.</p>
<p>The Eurobarometer shows that eight out of ten Europeans approve of organ donor cards, but only 12% carry one. This is due to multiple factors; probably one of the main reasons is that this option is not clearly presented to citizens.</p>
<p>The Commission also believes a European donor card could help to increase public awareness and close this gap. It is also needed in view of the increasingly mobile European citizens.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0433"></a>

<p>(EN) Since the emergence of avian influenza, pandemic preparedness has been a priority for the Commission and the Member States.</p>
<p>Across the EU, all have been working hard on preparations. Now it is time to take stock.</p>
<p>In 2005, the Commission asked the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to survey pandemic influenza preparedness in the EU.</p>
<p>What did ECDC’s interim report – published in January 2007 – find?</p>
<p>First, all countries have been working hard. Europe is far better prepared than it was in 2005. Never before have Member States and the Commission worked in such a concerted way, preparing for an impending - but not current - health threat.</p>
<p>But the ECDC also found that getting countries adequately prepared is not a quick job. It is a continuous process.</p>
<p>There are national plans and contracts in place for H5N1 and pandemic vaccines. Simulation exercises have been done and all countries have antiviral stockpiles.</p>
<p>In the ECDC’s view, endorsed by national experts, this work has to continue. A number of gaps have been identified – with five particular areas needing work:</p>
<p>- Moving from health sector planning to national plans encompassing all sectors,</p>
<p>- Addressing ‘interoperability’ so that we all do broadly the same things in the event of a pandemic,</p>
<p>- Operational research,</p>
<p>- Making national plans operational at local levels,</p>
<p>- Responding better to seasonal influenza.</p>
<p>The need to get other Ministries involved is self-evident, as a pandemic will affect many aspects of society.</p>
<p>Concerning interoperability, it is time to start working on what should be done collectively in the early moments of a pandemic on issues such as restriction of international travel. The value of restriction of movement measures on the outer EU-borders would in the early progression of the pandemic only yield a limited delay of import of new cases, but even then, its value and possible modes of implementation must be further considered.</p>
<p>It is to be doubted that all countries will agree on policies. Probably "one size will not fit all" given our diversity of circumstance.</p>
<p>It is important, however, to discuss this together and to pool scientific thinking as will be done again at the 4<span class="sup">th</span> Joint EC/ECDC/WHO Workshop on Pandemic Preparedness which the Commission is organising in Luxembourg in September 2007.</p>
<p>So that is where we stand on pandemic influenza preparedness.</p>

<p>(EN) In the field of state aid, the role of the Commission is not to interfere with Member States’ responsibilities with regard to the use of public resources, but to prevent possible distortions of competition and trade resulting from the granting of public subsidies. The Commission recognizes the importance of media pluralism for the cultural, democratic and public debate in Member States. The Commission has approved numerous aid schemes through which Member States grant financial support to the publishing sector.</p>
<p>Each case must be seen in its own right and whether or not an aid scheme can be declared compatible with the common market depends on the details of each aid scheme: the specific objective of the aid, the duration of the scheme, the type of expenses that are financed, and the intensity of the aid in relation to costs, among others. Aid granted to small and medium size companies may be more likely to be compatible with the internal market than aid to larger ones, insofar as smaller companies have more difficulty in raising capital and credit, for example. However, it is certainly not the case that subsidies are incompatible as a matter of principle purely because intended beneficiary companies are active internationally.</p>
<p>The Swedish press aid regulation came under review by the Commission because the Swedish Government notified amendments to the regulation, for which they sought prior approval under the state aid rules. Furthermore, the Commission also received a complaint concerning the press aid regulation, alleging distorting effects both on the newspaper market and with regard to advertisement sales. In these circumstances, the Commission is under an obligation to investigate. Once the investigation is complete, the Commission's final decision will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0376"></a>

<p>The Commission bases its recommendation on basic eligibility for Union membership exclusively on this provision.</p>
<p>For those countries which have been granted a membership perspective, the Conclusions of the 1993 Copenhagen European Council membership spell out the political, economic, and acquis related criteria for accession.</p>

The December 2006 Council conclusions confirmed that this strategy provides a basis for our renewed consensus on enlargement.</p>
<p>Obtaining candidate status constitutes one step on the path towards EU membership. In its 2005 strategy paper, the Commission outlined a membership roadmap for the Western Balkans, including the meaning of - and requirements for – obtaining candidate status:</p>
<p>"Following a membership application, and on the basis of the Commission’s Opinion, the EU may decide to grant an applicant country candidate status.</p>
<p>This status is a political recognition of a closer relationship with a country on its way towards membership. In practice, it implies that EU assistance can be used in all areas relevant to the ability of the country eventually to assume the obligations of membership, such as preparation for the implementation of the structural funds. However, it does not mean any automatic increase in the overall sum of assistance allocated to the country.</p>
<p>Candidate status implies that the country concerned opens a new stage in its relationship with the EU, and it will benefit from more intense political dialogue and economic cooperation with the Commission and Member States."</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0377"></a>

<p>(EN) Council Directive 2000/78/EC establishes a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation. It prohibits discrimination in employment and training on the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation as regards employment and occupation. The Directive applies to all the Member States.</p>
<p>Article 2(5) of Directive 2000/78/EC provides that it is without prejudice to measures laid down by national law which are necessary in a democratic society for public security and for the protection of health.</p>
<p>Article 6 of the Directive allows for the justification of differences of treatment on the grounds of age in certain circumstances, as long as this is objectively justified by a legitimate aim, and the means of achieving that aim are proportionate and necessary. In addition, article 4(1) of the Directive allows differences of treatment based on age (as well as the other protected characteristics) where this is necessary for a genuine and determining occupational requirement.</p>
<p>The Commission is not aware of the details relating to the particular situation of the question. However, the Commission is of the opinion that the setting of a compulsory retirement age for pilots arising from the differences of treatment based on age could be justifiable under the above-mentioned provisions in order to ensure the air safety and protection of the public.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0383"></a>

<p>(FR) The idea of a fixed link between Spain and Morocco was first voiced a number of years ago. Several alternative technologies have been suggested, including a bridge and a tunnel. It is this last option that appears to have been taken up by the Spanish and Moroccan authorities for more in-depth technical and economic studies. According to Spain’s strategic plan<a href="#defann_44_1" name="refann_44_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the fixed link is an important, but longer-term, project.</p>
<p>The Commission recently adopted the ‘Guidelines on transport in Europe and its neighbouring countries’ Communication<a href="#defann_44_2" name="refann_44_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. In this Communication, the Commission has endorsed five major transnational routes, including the link between Spain and Morocco. Following Morocco’s proposal, the fixed link has been included in the list of long-term projects to be carried out after the year 2020. As the Communication points out, this list is purely indicative. Any project that appears in the list must be subject to in-depth economic, social and environmental studies before a financing decision may be taken.</p>
<p>According to the information available to the Commission, the fixed link requires a large number of very complex technical (geological, marine, etc.) studies and innovative solutions before the construction can begin. 2008 would therefore seem too early a date for the construction work to begin.</p>
<p>The Commission has not helped to fund the project. No funding is envisaged for this project within the context of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund, for the period 2007-2013. In the future, the ERDF could possibly help to fund the Spanish part of such a project, if the Member State so requests and in so far as the provisions laid down for the use of the fund are fulfilled.</p>
<p>A funding request from the Spanish and Moroccan authorities would in principle be eligible under the cross-border cooperation programme within the framework of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument. However, given the limited resources of the Community budget for this purpose, any support would be limited, rather, to technical assistance measures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>At the end of April, two pateras (small boats) from Algeria reached the coast of the Balearic Islands, putting ashore in the south of Majorca. Since September 2006, four such vessels have illegally reached the Balearic Islands. The Spanish Government has failed to take effective measures as a matter of urgency to stop the arrival of fresh pateras, and prevent the Balearic Islands being used as a new route for illegal immigrants into Europe; this means that there is a risk that we will shortly be seeing scenes in the Balearic Islands no less tragic than those witnessed in recent years in regions like the Canaries. The Balearic Government believes that we should not wait until further boats reach the Islands before the Spanish Government takes special measures, including stepping up cooperation with Algeria in order to control the departure of illegal immigrants. There should be an increase in air and sea surveillance of the Balearic coasts and the Mediterranean in general. The present Spanish Government irresponsibly decided on a mass regularisation of immigrants two years ago, provoking a 'pull factor' which could now also have consequences for the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p>Does the Commission know whether the Spanish Government has asked the European Frontex Agency to collaborate on Mediterranean surveillance, so as to prevent the establishment of a new route for illegal immigration from Africa into Europe? Is the Commission going to take measures to prevent the consolidation of this new route to the Balearic Islands?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) According to the experiences, gathered by the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX) and by the Member States, illegal migratory routes and the intensity of using those routes are constantly changing. FRONTEX, in accordance with its mandate, carries out regular as well as ad hoc risk and threat assessments in order to prepare and coordinate operational responses to those changes. As far as the Balearic Islands are concerned there were a few incidents in 2006 and 2007 when illegal immigrants landed there, but the assessments made by FRONTEX do not confirm this as developing into a major new route yet.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Annual Programme of Work 2007 of FRONTEX, several joint operations are planned and will be carried out in the course of 2007, under the co-ordination of FRONTEX along the external borders of the European Union. Joint operations may be held in the area of the Balearic Islands during the year if the development of the situation so requires and subject to further planning and availability of necessary funds.</p>
<p>It should be stressed, that the responsibility for control and surveillance of the external borders lies with the Member States. FRONTEX role is to facilitate the application of Community measures relating to the management of the EU's external borders by ensuring the coordination of Member States' actions in the implementation of those measures. In addition, FRONTEX does not have its own assets, therefore it would not be able to plan and carry out any operations, aiming at effective border control and fighting illegal immigration, without the active contribution and participation of the Member States.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in accordance with Article 14 of the Regulation establishing FRONTEX<a href="#defann_45_1" name="refann_45_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> it may cooperate with the competent authorities of third countries in the framework of working arrangements to be concluded with these authorities. The Annual Programme of Work 2007 of FRONTEX foresees the conclusion of such a working arrangement with the competent authorities of Algeria and the first contacts have been already initiated by the Agency to that effect.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In accordance with Directive (EC) 2002/59, any vessel carrying hazardous or polluting substances, irrespective of its flag, must notify its identity and its cargo as a condition for entering an EU port. On this basis, the competent authorities must ban the entry of vessels in breach of Regulation (EC) 417/2002.</p>
<p>In the event of a falsified or erroneous declaration being made by the captain or operator of the vessel, Directive 2002/59 permits the Member States to impose appropriate sanctions, such as fines.</p>
<p>If, in spite of the ban, the competent authorities discover a vessel in breach of Regulation (EC) 417/2002 in the port, they must take the necessary measures such as the obligation to transfer the vessel’s cargo to a conforming tanker before the vessel departs.</p>
<p>The Commission does not know, thus far, of any cases in which Regulation (EC) 417/2002 has been violated by vessels flying the flag of a third country.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is closely monitoring the evolution of the influxes of Iraqi asylum seekers in the EU as well as the developments in Iraq itself and its neighbouring countries. To this end, the Commission is in constant contact with several International Organisations, including the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>).</p>
<p>There are two clear and distinct dimensions to the crisis which need to be addressed: an internal dimension, relating to the consequences of the crisis in the EU, and an external dimension, concerning the consequences within Iraq and neighbouring countries. The Commission's efforts aim at tackling both dimensions, in close consultation and cooperation with the Member States. The Commission intends to keep the Parliament informed of all relevant measures to be adopted.</p>
<p>With regard to the internal dimension, it has emerged that, despite the existence of a harmonised legal framework at EU level on the criteria for granting international protection, national policies vis-à-vis Iraqi asylum seekers vary considerably, creating an incentive for secondary movements within the EU.</p>
<p>It appears that the main reason for the divergences noted is that the grounds for protection invoked are very often mixed, so that different weight can be given to each ground in different cases. Member States also assess differently the individual nature, the seriousness and intensity of the alleged threat of persecution or serious harm, which may justify granting a protection status.</p>
<p>There appears to be a significant increase in the overall number of positive decisions granting protection status in the EU. Moreover, most Member States have policies to grant some form of complementary protection on humanitarian or compassionate grounds to Iraq asylum seekers, in particular from Central and Southern Iraq.</p>
<p>On the issue of returns, it seems that the situation in Northern Iraq is considered more stable than in the Central and Southern part of the country. However, currently most States do not forcibly return to Iraq, whereas the numbers of voluntary returns seem to have decreased in proportion to the current influx of asylum seekers.</p>
<p>In general, all relevant discussions demonstrated the complexities involved in the assessment of the protection claims presented by Iraqi asylum seekers and the need for a more thorough analysis of national status determination practices – and of the divergences noted – in light of the relevant EU provisions, with a view to bringing more consistency in decision-making and in granting of protection to this caseload across the EU.</p>
<p>To this end, the Commission intends to organise and facilitate further exchanges of detailed information on the current situation in Iraq and on national policies as a basis for a more exact analysis of the decisions made in Member States.</p>
<p>Moreover, to assist the Member States confronted with increasingly high numbers of Iraqi asylum seekers and whose reception and asylum systems are put at strain, part of the new budget line "Preparatory Action: Migration management – Solidarity in action" will be made available to finance national measures taken to adress these particular pressures. In particular, it will finance actions aiming at the improvement of the quality and capacity of reception at the points of arrival or at the pooling of resources with a view to provide operational assistance to those Member States particularly affected.</p>
<p>As far as the external dimension of the crisis is concerned, the Commission's efforts focus on providing support to Iraq’s neighbouring countries, which are becoming overburdened with the influx of refugees.</p>
<p>The Commission has already mobilised an initial funding package of € 6.2 million for meeting the humanitarian needs of refugees who have fled to countries such as Syria, Jordan, Turkey, Egypt and Lebanon, focusing on the most vulnerable groups. The aid will consist of basic healthcare and education as well as targeted distributions of food and essential household items. Another initial funding package of € 4 million is being drawn up for people suffering inside Iraq, based on a careful assessment of priority needs and aid delivery modalities in a highly volatile security environment. Another € 1 million has been allocated to UNHCR to finance protection related actions in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, notably to provide emergency assistance to the most vulnerable amongst the Iraqi refugees.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission believes that there would be added value in a coordinated response at the EU level to the appeal by UNHCR regarding the resettlement of Iraqi refugees living in the main three first countries of asylum (Syria, Jordan and Turkey). The Commission has therefore invited Member States to consider providing resettlement opportunities for Iraqi refugees in these countries as a concrete demonstration of burden-sharing vis-à-vis the hosting countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) There are six Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) already operational: the North Sea RAC (operational as of November 2004), the Pelagic RAC (operational as of August 2005), the North Western Waters RAC (operational as of September 2005), the Baltic Sea RAC (operational as of March 2006), the Long Distance RAC (operational as of March 2007 although its inaugural meeting took place on 29 May 2007) and the South Western Waters RAC (operational as of April 2007). The Mediterranean RAC has just finalised its preparatory work in early June and the Commission hopes that it can become operational before the end of 2007.</p>
<p>So far, the experience with the RACs has been very positive. The Commission has received around 60 recommendations from the 4 RACs that have been operational over the last three years, including several constructive contributions. The Commission believes that RACs have certainly helped to improve communication between the Commission and the stakeholders.</p>
<p>As a result of RACs positive experiences, the Commission has already proposed an amendment to the Council Decision establishing RACs (2004/585/EC) to grant them with permanent EU funding by defining them as bodies pursuing an aim of general European interest. This was adopted by the Council on 11<span class="sup">th</span> June 2007.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently undertaking a review of RACs functioning as foreseen by the Council Decision on RACs. This review aims at improving the working arrangements set out for the RACs and will address all aspects related to the operation of the RACs, except financing issues. The Commission's report will be published later this year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0415"></a>

<p>(EN) Organised crime is being seriously tackled by the European Union as a whole and at all different levels in order to strengthen the European Union as an area of Justice, Freedom and Security based on the EU Hague Multiannual Programme (2004) and the Action Plan implementing the Hague Programme prepared by the Commission in 2005. Subsequent to the Hague programme, the Commission issued its Communication on developing a strategic concept on tackling organised crime of June 2005 which sets up strategic priorities and objectives complemented by concrete actions aiming to achieve them. In order to effectively implementing the comprehensive and cross-cutting measures to fight against organised crime in the EU, the Commission is focusing on the following priorities:</p>
<p>Improve knowledge of organised crime by setting up a reliable crime statistics system: The Commission proposed an EU Action Plan for the development of EU statistics on crime and criminal justice over the period 2006 – 2010 in its Communication on developing a comprehensive and coherent EU strategy to measure crime and criminal justice of 8 August 2006. This action plan outlines the stepwise approach, in coordination with EU Member States and other concerned entities, towards the objective of accessible high quality quantitative information to be used for prioritising action to fight crime, benchmarking performance and evaluating implemented measures. The Commission organised the first expert group meeting on the policy needs of data on crime and criminal justice on 2/3 April 2007. Concerning the EU intelligence-led law enforcement mechanism and the setting up of a “European Criminal Intelligence Model”, a key element is the European organised crime threat assessment by Europol. Europol has presented its second Organised Crime Threat Assessment (OCTA) in April 2007.</p>
<p>Trafficking in human beings: The Commission is committed to fully implement the EU Action Plan against trafficking in human beings; this requires close cooperation between EU institutions, EU Member States and civil society organisations. The Action Plan should be regarded as a long-term programme that shall guide continuous EU action in the near future and in any case far beyond summer 2007. It will be revised and updated regularly. The Commission is preparing recommendations with the participation of governments, contact points, NGOs and international organisations to ensure early identification and assistance to trafficking victims, with a special focus on children. In addition, the Commission proposed an EU Anti-Trafficking Day which aims at increasing the visibility of the problems connected with trafficking and which shall be launched on 18 October 2007. One of the main aims of the Conference in Brussels on this day will be to encourage the development of a victim-centred anti-trafficking policy at national and European level. Besides, the Commission's Expert Group on trafficking in human beings will present its work on tools to measure policy progress in the field of combating trafficking in human beings. The Commission is highly committed to raise awareness and reinforce policy means in order to provide quality services for those in need of assistance. A report on the implementation of the EU Action Plan, including proposals for further action will be issued by the end of 2007. The Commission puts the protection of children from sexual exploitation at the highest level, especially on the Internet. This issue is addressed inter alia by the Commission's Communication "Towards a general policy on the fight against cyber crime" which was adopted on 22 May 2007. Specific actions to improve coordination and cooperation between law enforcement authorities and between law enforcement and private sector operators will play an important role in the fight against cyber crime, and complement other actions taken at national, European and international level.</p>
<p>Reducing the proceeds of criminal activities: Regarding financial organised crime, it is a matter of urgency to enhance investigation capabilities among law enforcement forces. The key to fighting criminal activities is to set up appropriate legal instruments aiding rapid identification and tracing of illicit financial transfers and other transactions. In this area, a number of Framework Decisions addresses the freezing and confiscation of assets of crime. The Third money laundering Directive adopted on 26th October 2005 strengthens the existing European Community anti-money laundering legislation by e.g. widening the definition of predicate offences to cover all forms of serious crime and adding new categories of persons subject to reporting obligations. Moreover, the Commission adopted a Communication on the Fight against Terrorist Financing including a Commission Recommendation for EU Member States and a Framework for a Code of Conduct for Non-Profit Organisations to enhance Transparency and Accountability in the non-profit sector to Prevent Terrorist financing and other types of criminal abuse on 29 November 2005.</p>
<p>Improve law enforcement cooperation: The Hague programme stressed the potential of existing EU bodies to be exploited to greater effect especially of Europol. In line with June 2006 Council conclusions, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council decision in December 2006, which establishes Europol as an EU Agency, financed by the EU Budget and whose staff would be covered by the EU Staff Regulations and Protocol on Privileges and Immunities. Europol's competences will be widened to combating terrorism, organised and other serious crimes.</p>
<p>Strengthened international cooperation: The EU is a major partner on the international scene in the fight against organised crime. Close cooperation has been established through agreements and other instruments with many partner countries, regional and international organisations such as the Council of Europe, OSCE, OECD, G8 and the United Nations. The Commission is implementing the organised crime aspects of the EU Strategy for the external dimension of Justice and Home Affairs (December 2005) in particular through the promotion of multidisciplinary regional law enforcement cooperation in combating organised crime in Western Balkans and EU neighbourhood countries.</p>
<p>Securing finances to underpin Justice, Freedom and Security policies: The Commission, endorsed by the Parliament, has allocated almost € 5 billion to policies in the area of freedom, security and justice in its financial programme for 2007-2013. Combating organised crime is particularly addressed by the new programme on Security and Safeguarding Liberties which includes specific programmes on the Prevention of and Fight Against Crime (ca. € 600 million) and on the Prevention, Preparedness and Consequence Management of Terrorism and other Security related risks (ca. € 140 million). Securing finances to underpin policies in combating organised crime and other areas is an importand step forward.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0417"></a>

<p>On 31 May 2007 it was announced that in the next few months 2200 jobs will be lost at the Opel works in Antwerp. This restructuring is a direct consequence of the impact of globalisation on the European car industry. It was precisely with the aim of cushioning such disastrous social effects of economic dislocation caused by globalisation in Europe that Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006<a href="#defann_54_1" name="refann_54_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund EGF) was adopted in 2006.

<p>(EN) The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund may provide assistance for workers made redundant as a result of changes in world trade patterns, following the receipt of a formal request for such assistance by a Member State. In the case of Opel in Antwerp, no request has yet been made by Belgium.</p>
<p>If a request is made by Belgium for assistance for the workers made redundant by Opel in Antwerp, or its suppliers or downstream producers, the Commission will assess the application according to the criteria set out in Regulation (EC) N° 1927/2006. If the Commission concludes that the application meets the conditions for assistance, it will make a proposal to the Budgetary Authority to make available the necessary financial resources.</p>
<p>The two applications for assistance, to which the Honourable Member refers, concern suppliers to major car manufacturers in France. One case concerns 1,345 redundancies amongst various suppliers to Peugeot SA, and the other case concerns 1,057 redundancies amongst various suppliers to Renault SA. In both cases, the redundancies are spread over several French regions.The French authorities have proposed to use the EGF in a focussed way in order to assist a proportion of the workers affected, where their employer has gone into bankruptcy and can no longer provide the normal assistance provided for under French law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In September 2007 the Court of Justice annulled the 2004 Council regulation reforming the cotton sector. The basis of this decision was not the fact that the reform did not respect the Accession Protocol n°4, or the objectives of the reform (i.e. the change of the support system) - but that the principle of proportionality had been violated because the Commission had failed to carry out an impact study that included labour costs in its calculation of production costs, and the potential effects of the reform on the local ginning industry.</p>
<p>To avoid legal uncertainty for operators the Court of Justice specified that annulled regime would continue to apply for the time necessary to establish a more soundly based regulation. The Commission is currently preparing a new proposal which will be accompanied by an assessment of the economic, social and environmental impacts of different reform scenarios. Protocol n°4 has been one of the main legislative elements of the past reform and as such it will remain for the reform in preparation.</p>
<p>In order to enrich the information available the Commission is organising a series of meetings with interested parties (Cotton Advisory Committee and Natural Fibres Management Committee). Specific consultation meetings are also being organised on particular aspects of the reform. Two external studies concerning socio-economic and environmental questions are being realised. Moreover, a bilateral meeting has taken place with representatives of the regional government of Andalucía.</p>
<p>An Internet consultation has been launched and remains open till 22 June 2007 to give a wider public the opportunity to express their views. However, this will constitute only one of the sources of information used by the Commission when preparing a new proposal.</p>
<p>Public Internet consultations were also used when reforming other sectors: Common Market Organisation's in fruits and vegetables, bananas and veal.</p>
<p>The Commission will report on the consultation process, once it is completed.</p>

<p>(EN) The conduct described by the Honourable Member could indeed constitute discrimination on ground of the nationality or the residence of recipients of services. According to the settled case-law of the Court of Justice, rights of recipients of services are part of the freedom to provide services enshrined in Article 49 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>However, the alleged discrimination consists in this case in behaviours adopted by private operators and to date the Court of Justice has applied Article 49 of the EC Treaty to private parties only in relation to measures regulating collectively the provision of services (e.g. measures adopted by sporting associations or professional bodies)<a href="#defann_58_1" name="refann_58_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This seems not to be the case of the behaviours of the Dutch operators in question. Yet, Article 49 of the EC Treaty being of direct effect in the national legal orders, citizens affected by the described practice are of course fully entitled to rely on this provision before national judges and authorities, which, as the case may be, will decide taking also account of the case-law of the Court of justice cited above.</p>
<p>As far as the Commission is more directly concerned, it regrets to inform the Honourable Member that it cannot directly intervene in cases such as this one since it does not have competence to take action against private undertakings on the basis of the powers of monitoring the application of EC law conferred on it by Article 226 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Commission also wants to inform that in the future it will be possible to tackle discriminatory behaviours adopted against recipients of services on the basis of the recently adopted Directive 2006/123/EC of 12 December 2006 on Services in the Internal Market<a href="#defann_58_2" name="refann_58_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. In particular, according to Article 20 (2) of this Directive, Member States will have to ensure that the general conditions of access to a service, which are made available to the public at large by private service providers, do not contain discriminatory provisions relating to the nationality or place of residence of the recipient. At the same time, as it is explicitly clarified in the same provision, service providers will be entitled to demonstrate that differentiations in treatment are motivated by objective criteria and are thus justified. The Commission is currently working along with Member States in order to make sure that the Services Directive, including the above mentioned provision, be properly implemented into national legal orders by the deadline of end of 2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has set the objective of cutting back on the pointless red tape imposed on business by EU legislation. However, at Member State level the size of bureaucracies far exceeds that required under Community law. For instance, a major administrative burden is placed on companies by the complex system of notifications, authorisations and licenses required for the commencement and cessation of a business activity, many of which have to be renewed annually and are accompanied by complicated issuance procedures.</p>
<p>By what means does the Commission believe it should be possible to stimulate the involvement of all Member States in the process of cutting back on red tape (other than that required under EU law)? Does it consider that a European Year of Reducing Bureaucracy could contribute to accelerating that process?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In order to secure real progress on this issue, the Commission proposed in the Action Programme that the 2007 Spring European Council should set as its target a 25% reduction of the administrative burdens by 2012. This target, along with the Action Programme, was endorsed by the Spring Council in March this year. The European Council also invited Member States to set their own national targets of comparable ambition within their spheres of competence by 2008.</p>
<p>The Commission will monitor this and actively engage Member States and stakeholders in the measurement and reduction of administrative burdens.</p>
<p>Reducing administrative burdens and creating better regulation is a process – not a one-off event. In its Action Programme the reduction target date is 2012 and the work is programmed for this period, so in fact the Commission suggests that not just one year, but all the next 5 years should be dedicated to reducing administrative burdens.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>A proposal for a directive which is intended to create a single residence and work permit - in order to reduce administrative red-tape - and define the minimum rights which should be granted to any third-country national legally employed in a Member State of the European Union, including artists;</p>
<p>A proposal for a Directive on the admission of highly skilled workers. This Directive may – in certain cases - directly apply to third country artists and grant them facilitated access to the EU labour market, as well as other favourable residence conditions.</p>
<p>In respect of what is now called the "Blue Card" scheme, it will only be applicable to the third-country nationals who qualify to be admitted under the terms of the highly skilled third-country workers proposal. Its details are however still to be defined.</p>
<p>As to the possibility of moving to other Member States to work, in the Commission's opinion this might constitute one of the main elements of attractiveness of the scheme. It should however be subject to certain conditions.</p>
<p>In respect of the coordination of social security schemes (including statutory pensions) for persons who move legally to other Member States, Council Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72 have been already extended by Council Regulation 859/2003 to third-country nationals who are legally resident in the territory of an EU Member State and are in a situation which is not confined in all respects within a single Member State. Apart from equal treatment with nationals of the Member State of residence in respect of tax benefits, no further measures are currently foreseen in the field of taxation.</p>
<p>The policy plan, however, does not envisage proposing measures focusing exclusively on the conditions of entry, residence and mobility of third-country artists. The policy plan, in fact, also proposes other non-legislative measures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Parliament further considered that in certain cases the existing common organisation of the market (COM) in fisheries and aquaculture products 'has not succeeded in making a sufficient contribution to improving first-sale prices and the distribution of added value across the value chain in the industry'. The Commission has, furthermore, recognised that in recent years market prices have failed to keep pace with the trends in production costs. In its communication of 9 March 2006 on the economic situation in the fishing industry, the Commission stresses the need for a revision of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000<a href="#defann_62_1" name="refann_62_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> establishing the COM in fisheries products.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is well aware of the concerns which the Honourable Member expresses concerning the income situation in the fisheries sector. In this context, it is important to recall that any policy approach to address problems in this area has to take account of the fact that the evolution of first-sale prices and the distribution of added value may be affected by a variety of factors which require in-depth scrutiny.</p>
<p>In its current form, the common organisation of the markets (CMO) provides a number of instruments aimed at increasing the financial returns of producers. The ongoing evaluation of the CMO is intended to look at the effectiveness and efficiency of the existing mechanisms as well as to explore possible new tools in order to improve the marketing of fishery products. The evaluation is essential in order to obtain a full and accurate picture of the elements that are fully functional as well as of those which require improvement. It has to be emphasised that the evaluation of financial instruments of the CMO is an obligation upon the Commission under the terms of the Financial Regulation.</p>
<p>The CMO evaluation consists of a series of studies which are being carried out during a period of two years. These studies cover the various financial and non-financial instruments of the CMO as well as topics related to the economy of the sector, supply of the industry, consumption, consumer expectations, and linkage to conservation policy. At this stage of the evaluation process it is therefore premature to consider the shape of a future CMO including the possible addition of new intervention mechanisms. Legislative proposals for a reform and revision of the CMO can only be envisaged when the evaluation is completed in 2008. An acceleration of the evaluation process would adversely affect the Commission’s ability to properly assess the need for either maintaining or changing the market organisation and thus to come up with proper operational proposals in this particularly important field of the Common Fisheries Policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) International environmental standards, and EU legal requirements and practice, require a comprehensive environmental impact assessment study prior to the construction of a gas pipeline such as the North Europe gas pipeline. The relevant EU legislation states that it is for the developer to carry out the studies to collect and prepare the relevant environmental information required; and for the Member States concerned to make sure that the respective standards and legal requirements are respected. As far as EU legislation is concerned, this includes in particular the application of the relevant provisions of Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment<a href="#defann_64_1" name="refann_64_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and of Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora<a href="#defann_64_2" name="refann_64_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) directive has been amended by Directive 97/11/EC in order to bring the EIA Directive into line with the requirements of the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context (Espoo Convention).</p>
<p>According to the information provided for to the Commission by the promoter of the North Europe gas pipeline project (now called "Nord Stream") it appears that a full EIA is being undertaken by "Nord Stream" in the frame of the Espoo Convention to which all nine Baltic States are parties, with a view to fulfilling the requirements of the permitting procedure and getting the necessary authorisations. This procedure is already under way and expected to end in 2008, when the final environmental report (expected in autumn 2007) will have been validated.</p>
<p>According to the same information, an official project notification on the basis of the Espoo Convention has been submitted on 14 November 2006 to all involved countries around the Baltic Sea, in order to commence the permitting process. Pursuant to such information, it also appears that over 20 open public hearings and 100 authorities' meetings have been held, with 129 statements received. Based on the recommendations received, additional studies are to be launched. The Members of the EIA Group were also informed in their 10th meeting held in Geneva from 21-23 May 2007, about the results of such consultation.</p>
<p>The Commission is closely following these developments in view of its political sensibility and of the fact that the North Stream gas pipeline is a priority project declared of European Interest by the Council and the Parliament.<a href="#defann_64_3" name="refann_64_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
