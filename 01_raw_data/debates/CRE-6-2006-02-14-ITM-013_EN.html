<p class="contents">I should like to draw your attention, ladies and gentlemen, to the new procedure, under Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure, which was already in operation during January’s part-session. I should therefore like to ask for the cooperation of the Council and the Members of this House in order to ensure that the maximum number of questions can be discussed and answered.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the new arrangements, there are now two parts to Question Time. Answers in part one will be given by Mr Winkler, the Austrian representative on the General Affairs Council, and in part two by the relevant minister, depending on the subject matter under discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">The following questions have been addressed to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Part One:</span></p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 1 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (<a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0006_EN.html">H-0006/06</a>)</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Accession negotiations with Serbia-Montenegro</span></p>
<p class="contents">The European Council meeting in Thessaloniki (20 June 2003) decided that all the countries of the Western Balkans should have the prospect of European integration. However, Serbia-Montenegro remained excluded from European proceedings and it was only on 10 October 2005 that Mr Olli Rehn, the Commissioner responsible for enlargement, launched negotiations with a view to a Stability and Association Agreement between the European Union and Serbia-Montenegro.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission say to what this delay is attributable? Will absolutely the same criteria apply to Serbia-Montenegro as to Croatia? Does the Council consider that Serbia's stance in negotiations on the final status of Kosovo will influence the negotiations on the Stability and Association Agreement? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council has always upheld that principle and it goes without saying that it also applies to Serbia-Montenegro.</p>
<p class="contents">May I remind you that at the November 2000 summit in Zagreb the Heads of State or Government of the EU Member States and the countries of the Western Balkans expressed their commitment to the stabilisation and association process. It was made clear that accession to the European Union can only take place if the terms of the Treaty on European Union are observed, the Copenhagen criteria satisfied and progress is made on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. It goes without saying that all countries must satisfy these conditions equally, without any discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a commitment to regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations, which are very much essential parts of the stabilisation and association process.</p>
<p class="contents">That commitment was reaffirmed in the Thessaloniki summit statement in 2003, which also noted these countries’ European perspective. I would at this point again like to point out that one of the Austrian Presidency’s priorities is to reaffirm that European perspective by focussing on the Balkans during the six months of the Austrian Presidency; the countries of the Western Balkans must have the opportunity of joining the European Union if the conditions for that are satisfied.</p>
<p class="contents">Now so far as Serbia-Montenegro is concerned, that country has enjoyed trade concessions and financial and technical assistance since the year 2000 as part of the stabilisation and association process. Since 2001, the European Union has also provided Serbia-Montenegro with political advice through the consultative task force, which was later replaced by the strengthened permanent dialogue in preparation for negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">If progress is to be made in the various stages of the negotiation process, Serbia-Montenegro will have to continue to cooperate very closely and consistently with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. That applies just as much for Serbia-Montenegro as it did for Croatia and as it also applies for all the other countries at issue here.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission is also monitoring Serbia-Montenegro’s cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal during the negotiations for the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. Should the Commission conclude that cooperation is not unreserved, it can, together with the Council, decide to suspend those negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already pointed out, Serbia-Montenegro and all the other countries of the region must of course satisfy the Copenhagen criteria. These include political stability, respect for human rights and the ability to meet the particular requirements of the stabilisation and association process.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member also raised the matter of Kosovo. I would like to point out that the European Council made clear what the European Union expects of the parties with regard to Kosovo in June 2005. It called on both Belgrade and Prishtina not to obstruct the introduction of the necessary standards in Kosovo. As you know, negotiations on the status of Kosovo are ongoing. Both sides will have to demonstrate their good will in this process, however, if a solution is to be reached that is acceptable to both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council said on that occasion that any solution must be fully consistent with European values and standards and contribute to realising the European perspective for Kosovo and the region. It went on to say that the final status of Kosovo must result in greater security and stability in the region and that any unilateral solution or one imposed by force would therefore be unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Both these processes must continue. Ultimately they will have to merge. It is of course also clear, whatever status is decided for Kosovo, that Kosovo too must have a European perspective, whatever form it may take.

(DE)</span> Mr President, Austria’s criticism of the European Court of Justice’s judgment on access to higher education, which you mentioned, was in fact concerned essentially with the actual problems that have arisen as a result of the judgment and the – in our view – overly strict application of the ban on discrimination in the area of education policy. In that connection, the comment was also made – and that, too, is something that really ought to have been taken into account – that it would have been fully consistent with the tradition of supreme courts to have set transitional periods and not to have stipulated retroactive effect. These are all points constituting material comment on this judgment.</p>
<p class="contents">This judgment has in fact interfered with Austrian citizens’ access to many areas of higher education, especially areas that are important for Austria’s supply of, in this particular case, doctors. This disruption in what is after all a very important national affair is something that needs to be remedied. A solution must be found to ensure that enough doctors are trained every year in Austria – or in Belgium – to meet the country’s needs; that is surely a legitimate request.</p>
<p class="contents">Ideas have been put forward to overcome and remove this problem. One of them, which must ultimately be decided by the European Parliament because it will have to be in the form of a law, is to set a quota for the study of medicine – dentistry and human medicine – that will be based not on nationality but on possession of the Austrian school-leaving certificate that guarantees access to higher education. This will ensure that the number of medical students, of doctors, that Austria needs for its health service nationally is safeguarded.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe this solution is compatible with European law and also with the judgment of the European Court of Justice, which after all itself found that the only failing was that this disruption was not numerically documented. One year on, this documentation is now available. I believe that this solution, which is very similar to that between Belgium and France, will also stand up to scrutiny in the light of European law. I believe we are on the right way to a good solution here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has a very important contribution to make and is certainly also one of the things on which we need to concentrate if we want to achieve the objectives that the Lisbon Strategy has set for itself.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as approving the new integrated guidelines for growth and employment, which comprise the broad guidelines for economic policies and the employment guidelines, we believe it is also important to give some thought to the mutual compatibility of the Lisbon Strategy and the Bologna Process in the ongoing debate about the future of the European Union and its institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bologna Process, which will involve the establishment of a European area of higher education by 2010, is of great importance for our young people in particular. The reason for this is probably that the rules governing access to higher education are caught between the rights of the EU’s citizens in the internal market on the one hand and the strict observance of Member State responsibility for course contents and the shaping of the education system, which is anchored in the EC Treaty, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">This tension exists in other areas of the Lisbon Strategy as well, where national competences confront European objectives and solutions have to be found that do justice to both principles. It is particularly great in education. That is why it is important that we find common solutions in this area in particular, because we shall not be able to achieve the Lisbon Strategy’s objectives without improving access to education. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the Joint Statement with the European Union during the EU-Russia Summit in Rome on 6 November 2003, Russia took the responsibility of quickly concluding border agreements, which at that time were still unfinished, with Estonia and Latvia, thus precluding any questioning of its State borders with the enlarging Union. Nevertheless, in 2005 the Russian Government announced that it ‘does not intend to endorse’ two already finalised border treaties with Estonia, just signed by both sides and ratified by the Estonian Parliament. Thus Moscow unprecedentedly withdrew the signature of the Russian Government and recently urged Estonia to go back and reopen over 10 years of negotiations. The position of both the Council and the Commission remains unclear, even if Russia’s provocation is jeopardising the credibility of the entire Union in the eyes of the new Member States. One more possible task of it is to get a new frozen conflict, this time with the EU on a common border. Is it acceptable for the EU leadership to remain on the sidelines in the role of an indifferent observer?

I was Austria’s Permanent Representative to the Council of Europe when Russia and also the Baltic States were admitted. Of course I am aware of how this situation came about historically. We must be clear that it is the result of a historical development. The important thing is that, as Members of the European Union, the Baltic States should satisfy the relevant provisions, norms and rules of international law, of the Council of Europe and the OSCE in particular. Because the standards which, thank God, we have in the Europe of the Council of Europe, but especially also in the Europe of the European Union, are actually higher than in international law in general. We can be proud of that. The Council also feels obliged to comply with these stricter rules and standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(DE)</span> Mr President, I can answer Mr De Rossa’s question about public voting in the Council as follows. As the Federal Chancellor said in his speech about the Austrian Presidency last month, transparency is something the Austrian Presidency wants. So far as possible and insofar as the rules allow, we want to achieve the greatest possible transparency between the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">While we must be clear about the fact that this does have its limits, the Presidency will gladly do what it can in the five months that still remain to us, and we are also talking to the Finnish Presidency about it.</p>
<p class="contents">The position at present is as follows. If the Council is acting as legislator, the outcome of the vote, the Council Members’ explanations of vote and the statements entered in the Council minutes are published. Information on how the delegations have voted is published and is accessible on the Council’s website.</p>
<p class="contents">The site also provides information about the legislative acts finally adopted by the Council in a given month and the monthly list of the Council’s legislative acts. That list also shows any votes against or abstentions, explanations of vote and the voting rules.</p>
<p class="contents">We are endeavouring to make further improvements. The Council Secretariat is currently taking steps to also post on the Council’s website the outcomes of Council votes on legislative proposals accepted under the codecision procedure, where the public will be able to view them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would also like to point out that when a legislative act has finally been adopted the General Secretariat makes available to the public, without restriction, all documents already produced in connection with that act to which no exceptional rules apply.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Presidency want to try to ensure that the restrictions that exist and are laid down are applied as little as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will act in relation to the services directive in the same way as in all codecision procedures – there are very clear rules – which means that at the beginning and end of the procedure there is an open debate. Whether there is any readiness on the part of Member States to go beyond what is in the rules is something that I cannot answer at this stage, but we will certainly abide by the rules, as far as the services directive is concerned. The rules already open up certain segments of the procedure to the public, and that would apply to the services directive as it would to any other. The results of the vote, the explanations of vote, the statements entered in the minutes, are all made public.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the honourable Member that we are not as far on as we would like to be. The process was set in motion by the December agreement.

(DE)</span> Mr President, in answer to both these questions I can say that security of energy supplies, together with competitiveness and sustainability – they are, after all, the three relevant pillars – has for years been one of the main concerns of European energy policy. This is also true of the new energy policy for Europe that is now being developed. The gas dispute in particular, the price dispute of the last few weeks and months, has made clear that consideration must also be given to the concerns of our neighbours and international partners.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union maintains close ties both with energy producers like Russia and OPEC and with important users like China and India. In this connection, I would also like to remind you of international arrangements like the Energy Charter Treaty and the South East Europe Energy Community. Diversification of energy sources, the promotion of domestic energy sources, renewables in particular, and energy efficiency are important aspects of the security of energy supply. The great importance of investment in both infrastructure and exploration should also be stressed. Transeuropean energy networks are also part of both these aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">A host of instruments have therefore been adopted in the European Union in different fields. On security of supply, particular mention should be made of EC Council Directive 2004/67 of 26 April 2004 concerning measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply, on diversification of energy sources the directive from 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources, which aims to see 22% of the Community’s electricity generated from renewable sources by 2010, and the 2003 directive on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also mention the December 2005 proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council on energy end-use efficiency and energy services, which is expected to be adopted in the next few months.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither should we forget the Sixth Research and Development Framework Programme and in particular the ‘Intelligent Energy for Europe’ Programme, which seeks, among other things, to promote new and renewable energy sources at local and regional level and in developing countries. The Council is also showing the importance it attaches to renewable energy sources in the non-legislative domain. In their contribution to the Spring European Council in March 2005, the energy ministers support giving priority to a strategy for renewable energy sources beyond the year 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Energy policy and the security of energy supplies in particular will also appear on the agenda – no doubt prominently – for the Council’s next meeting in the spring. Two further areas on which the Presidency will be focusing are the Biomass Action Plan and the proposed Energy Efficiency Action Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">In its contribution to the international action plan of the June 2004 International Conference for Renewable Energies in Bonn, the Council noted that EU energy policy should aim to increase the use of renewable energy sources significantly and that increased use of renewable energy, improved energy efficiency and sustainable energy use will also contribute to security of supply as complementary areas of policy.</p>
<p class="contents">At its meeting on 29 November 2004, the Council adopted conclusions on renewable energies which highlighted the importance of making renewable energies more competitive by reducing production costs, among other things. All these instruments and measures are a solid basis for the short, medium and long-term security of energy supplies in the European Union, which have also proved their worth in actions of solidarity in connection with the consequences of the disastrous weather events of last year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am sure that renewable energy sources – biomass in particular, of course, but not only biomass – will have greater market opportunities in the months and years ahead, because the price of oil is not going to fall to 10 or 20 dollars a barrel again; that will be a good thing, because it will be an opportunity to increase Europe’s independence. We should not deceive ourselves, however: it may make it possible to reduce the rate of increase in dependence on fossil fuels, but only the rate of increase, not the rate of dependence. At the same time, that will mean additional sources of income for many rural areas and for many people, farmers in particular, not only from producing food, but also from producing energy plants. In the long term, biomass and renewable resources could in fact be the source not only of carbon but also, indirectly, of hydrocarbons, which could then be used to run private cars. I believe the way forward for power stations and the like may lie in a different direction in the long term, but that fossil fuels in particular, which are used almost exclusively in transport today, can gradually be replaced by renewables and hydrocarbons from that source.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat, the chances for that are better, it is easier to make renewable resources, renewable energy sources, a marketable proposition if the market price of a barrel of crude oil is around 60 dollars or a kilowatt of electricity costs two and a half times as much today as even two years ago. One megawatt-hour costs 50 euros today; I can still remember when it was 20 euros. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(DE)</span> Mr President, honourable Member, what Europe needs is a coherent energy policy, an energy policy that is geared more to our common interests. We must learn the lessons, on the one hand those from the realm of climate protection, on the other those from the marked rise in the prices of fossil fuels – due not only but mainly to a shortage of refinery capacity, plus hurricanes, plus geopolitical difficulties – and also the lessons from 1 and 2 January this year when, for whatever reasons, the quantity of Russian natural gas flowing to Europe through Ukrainian pipelines was greatly reduced. Those are three reasons why we should rethink our position.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again: we must expect Europe’s dependence on imports, especially of fossil fuels, to increase over the next few years, probably decades. However, that should and must not stop us looking increasingly to renewable energy sources of our own and in the end also tightening the screw of energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">That is where I agree with the Commission when it says it is already hard enough to get the Member States to commit to 1% a year; we shall see whether a 2% a year commitment is possible in future. There are still things we can all do in energy efficiency and we can improve things there; the new Member States normally have greater potential in this area. Their efficiency in terms of gross domestic product per unit of energy consumed is much lower than in the countries of the EU 15, where they began to break the link between energy consumption, gross domestic product and growth back in the 1970s as a result of the 1973 and 1974 oil shocks.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a coherent energy policy that does not overlook any of the possibilities already mentioned: renewable energy sources, increased energy efficiency, but at the same time also diversification in fossil fuels, that is in gas, and of course also diversification in pipelines. The basic problem was not the shortage of gas, the basic problem on 1 and 2 January was that there is only one pipeline through Ukraine supplying a lot of European countries and that 80% of all the gas coming from Russia to Europe flows through that pipeline.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly sensible for contracts to be concluded between the companies in Germany and Russia. It is certainly very important that the European Parliament and the European Commission should also support the Nabucco gas pipeline project that could bring some 12 billion cubic metres of gas a year to Central Europe from the Caspian Sea via Turkey from 2011 and around 30 billion cubic metres of gas a year from 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">In the matter of gas, however, we should not forget liquefied natural gas, either; apart from a few southern Member States, Europe has not set much store by it up until now. We need that as well if we are to reduce our dependence.</p>
<p class="contents">I also very much welcome the announcements made by Russia and its finance minister at a recent G8 summit in Moscow that they are going to reconsider or abolish Gazprom’s export monopoly. Unfortunately, they did not say when that would happen, but there was the announcement at least. Cooperation with Gazprom has stood the test of time, it is true, but this means that we will also be able to speak, negotiate and work with other Russian partners some time in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, the route Europe has taken so far in liberalising and deregulating the energy sector has been important and correct. It, too, has helped to stabilise prices in particular, but in the next few years we shall have to walk a tightrope between greater security of supply – and ultimately also giving investors the security of recovering their investments through long-term contracts – and nevertheless creating more of a European internal market in energy, also integrating South East Europe, Ukraine too, and perhaps even Russia. If we cannot do that through the Energy Charter, then perhaps it will be possible through the Energy Community, and that is a concrete proposal that the Commission will probably be presenting in the next few weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take all these approaches. Energy policy is top priority, and the last few months have shown us just how important it is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That might now sound rather audacious coming from an American, but it was the former US President who said it, and he did sign the Kyoto Protocol. As we know, though, Congress then did not ratify it.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with you and with many others that climate protection is a top priority. It is a necessity, because the global climate is under threat. However, we in Europe need to bear in mind that we are currently responsible for around 14% of global CO2 emissions, and by 2050 the figure will be about 10%. In other words, currently around 86% and in future 90% of CO2 emissions come from elsewhere. It makes a big difference whether we in the European Union are going it pretty much alone or whether we at least have our partners in the USA – who are of course our competitors as well – on board. That is not foreseeable at the moment, though.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question, of course, is how we should deal with countries such as China and India, which have no obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. I expect that these countries will say – and this is quite understandable: 'you Europeans generate around 10 tonnes of CO2 per capita, the Americans around 20 tonnes, and we produce between one and two tonnes. First let us bring our industrial and other development up to your level, then we will contribute to climate protection'. Getting China, India and other developing and emerging economies on board as soon as possible and convincing them of our arguments is a very sensitive issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Europe should go a step further, but at the same time we need to bear our competitiveness in mind and protect the climate as cost-effectively as possible. Joint implementation is very valuable in that connection.</p>
<p class="contents">If we can invest in European countries, for example in the new Member States, and thus reduce CO2 emissions for less investment than would be possible in, for example, the EU-15 Member States, then we should go down that route, and this is laid down in the Kyoto Protocol. That in turn means that climate protection is of the utmost significance. At the same time, however, we are also aware that energy prices have an effect on competitiveness and thus on employment.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going in the right direction, and in the next few months we will find out how the second post-Kyoto phase will be implemented in the EU Member States and what the national allocation plans will look like. Trading in CO2 certificates has made a good start, and the prices are considerably higher than we expected – at one point there was talk of EUR 10 per tonne, and the most recent listing, as far as I know, was EUR 28, which is almost three times as much. If we are now going to tell European industry that it will be allocated less than in the past, then we will have to find some good arguments.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interests of employment in good old Europe, I would quite clearly advocate that we tread very, very carefully and softly when it comes to our energy-intensive economy and industry. With respect to the future of Kyoto, I am very much in favour of making progress and of an offensive approach, but this approach must not put any jobs at risk of being relocated from Europe to countries that still pay no attention at all to climate protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The OECD and the European Commission both estimate that this vulnerability, this sensitivity has reduced by about half, precisely because our management and production are now much more energy-efficient. However, that does not of course mean that, even today, we can easily cope with an increase in the oil price from USD 30 to USD 60 just like that; and there are voices – which I hope will never be proved right – predicting three-figure prices in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to gas, it must be said, to be fair to our Russian friends, that their intention was to get Ukraine to pay the world market price, although the world market price is a relative term, so it would be better to say the standard price in Europe, of about USD 220 per thousand cubic metres. This was ultimately agreed in the night from 3 to 4 January in the negotiations between Gazprom and Ukraine. The compromise provides – and the contracts have now been drawn up and signed – that a mixture will be produced of Russian gas at about USD 220 and much cheaper gas from Central Asia, and Ukraine will pay about USD 95 for that mixture.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to world market prices and European gas prices, you should be aware that the US buys its gas at a much higher price than we do in Europe. We obviously do not yet have a standard world market price – the differences for gas are considerably greater than they are for oil. That, in turn, is an argument in favour of a more long-term approach to energy policy and in favour of increased partnership. This dialogue between the European Union and Russia on one side, and OPEC on the other, must be continued and strengthened. A greater degree of transparency is desirable in this connection, to build trust in both groups of partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also very much recommend that we pay greater attention not only to working with the energy producers, but also to establishing dialogue with consumers. It is important for us in Europe to reach agreements with Japan, the US, and similarly with other consumers, to achieve a goal for which the oil-producing countries are also aiming: stable long-term prices. It is quite incorrect to believe that it is in the primary interest of the OPEC countries to reach a price of USD 100 as soon as possible. They are well aware, firstly, that it would not last long and that market mechanisms could then reduce the price to a relatively low level. They are also well aware that the functioning of our economy, and continual growth, are ultimately important for their oil and gas sales, too.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore a common interest in creating stable, reliable energy markets and guaranteeing secure supplies and stable prices. We will be able to make good progress in this over the coming months. The Green Paper that the Commission is currently discussing is not yet officially referred to as such, but in practice it is one. It will in future be a guiding principle for us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Supplementary occupational pensions are an important subject, including in connection with our concept of 'flexicurity' – flexibility through security. The Council has already started examining the proposal submitted by the Commission at the end of October 2005 for a directive on improving the portability of supplementary pension rights. By the end of February, the preparatory body responsible for examining the matter, in other words the Council Working Party on Social Questions, will have discussed the proposal in six meetings. The Austrian Presidency has included the proposal in its draft agendas for the Council's meeting. In view of the fact that the matter is very technically complex, however, we still need to examine how far this work will have got by the time the Council meets in June. I will not hide the fact that, quite apart from the general complexity, there are still some key questions that need to be answered, but in principle I believe that it will make, and must make, a very important contribution to improving the mobility of employees in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to expand on what you have said by saying that the point is that, when it comes to occupational pensions, we obviously also have to deal with the differences in competences and in tax systems. The differences in competences in the Member States have led to major barriers to mobility.

Anybody who wants employees to have mobility across European borders must make it possible for them to take their supplementary pension rights with them without too much difficulty. On the other hand, it is quite clear to see that, when it comes to social security, each country has its own traditions and therefore that any attempt at harmonisation would be doomed to failure. We do not want that; where social security is concerned, one size certainly does not fit all.</p>
<p class="contents">This is therefore certainly an issue in areas where it is sensible and appropriate to establish minimum standards. In the field of pension rights, we should not forget that most European countries use a contributory system as the basis for state support. At the same time, we know that it would be appropriate to supplement this contribution-based system in part by one based on capital, including in the state sector. In addition, as part of this opportunity – we must of course also take account of the incomes of European employees and savers – we should of course also encourage private and occupational pension provision.</p>
<p class="contents">I am working on the assumption that the Member States will, and should, retain their decision-making authority and competence over the relatively long term, but that we should also establish – in particular through this directive – ways to make it easier for European employees with pension funds to transfer their pension rights throughout Europe, which the introduction of minimum standards would of course make considerably easier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many of the available statistics show that mobility is twice as high in the USA as in Europe. Of course, we cannot remove Europe's linguistic barriers overnight – and perhaps we do not want to do so – nor can we institute the federal principles applied in the USA just like that.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in general it gives our young people an opportunity to increase their mobility and opens up to them a European market in interesting jobs and career opportunities. With these qualifications, as we certainly do not want to adopt the American situation here overnight, more mobility for employees and young people is a goal of ours.</p>
<p class="contents">Improving workers' mobility involves taking measures, step by step. With regard to this specific directive, I can tell you that the Commission has declared 2006 to be the European Year of Workers' Mobility, that there will be a job portal, EURES, an improved version of which is going to be presented at a meeting in the next few days, namely on 20/21 February in Brussels, where the starting pistol will officially be fired. I myself will have the honour of taking part, and Commission President Mr Barroso, Commissioner Špidla and the President of the European Parliament have also agreed to be there.</p>
<p class="contents">This meeting will include discussion of the topic of 'mobility, a tool for more and better jobs', and this discussion will continue in workshops. We do not just want the directive on the portability of supplementary pension rights – what we want is a general mainstream. It is also important that a best practice process should be initiated between the authorities, trade unions and the private sector, and we also want to broaden the knowledge base. This therefore forms an important part of the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Year of Workers' Mobility is just starting; the final conference will take place in November under the Finnish Presidency. However, I think it is a good thing that there are already plans to follow up on this first European Year of Mobility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
