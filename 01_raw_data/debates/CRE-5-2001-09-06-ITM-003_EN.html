<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Camisón Asensio (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">– (ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by saying that serving as rapporteur for this report is a matter of great personal satisfaction for me. This is because I am one of those firmly convinced of the value of the European Parliament’s Committee on Petitions for society at large.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason is that the system enabling citizens to present petitions is the most direct channel available to Europeans when it comes to denouncing the loopholes still remaining in Community legislation. It is also invaluable for highlighting cases where commitments resulting from directives and regulations already adopted are flagrantly disregarded either because the latter are not being implemented or because they have simply not been transposed.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the European Ombudsman has a key role to play in this great task. It has also been a matter of great personal satisfaction for me to note the high degree of consensus between members of the Committee during debates and votes.</p>
<p class="contents">The figures speak for themselves. All sixteen conclusions in the report were adopted by unanimity. The same was true of the five amendments tabled following minor adjustments in the interests of compromise. Accordingly, I should like to thank the entire Committee and its secretariat.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are already familiar with the content of the report, ladies and gentlemen, I shall only refer to what I consider to be its most innovative features. For instance, the European citizens’ right to petition, which as I see it is a fundamental right, is extended to include natural or legal residents, together with those who have registered in a Member State. There is also the recommendation that in future debates this fundamental right should be ascribed the importance due to it, and that it should be included in the possible convention on the building of Europe. Further, it is clearly necessary to grant the Committee on Petitions the status it deserves, given its social importance resulting from direct contact between individuals and the institution.</p>
<p class="contents">This must come about, because something has to be done to break down the barriers between the people and the remote European institutions highlighted by all the surveys undertaken. One way forward might well be to encourage more own initiative reports, particularly concerning issues on which the citizens appear to be particularly anxious to be more closely involved with the institutions. It also seems reasonable to try and devise ways to carry through legislative initiatives stemming from civil society itself. They are usually indicative of serious shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">All this serves to highlight once again the legitimacy of this Committee’s right to have access to all relevant interinstitutional documentation. Indeed, this is essential if the Committee is to undertake its important task effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection it is only fair to mention the ongoing help received from both the Commission and the Ombudsman. Their support is invaluable and much appreciated. Unfortunately, the same is not true of the Council. It remains conspicuous by its absence.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, at this stage the citizens need to become far more aware of the petitions system. This could be achieved through programmes aimed at informing and educating or more specifically, through information technology. User-friendly guidebooks are needed. This is an outstanding task. Apathy on the part of certain public authorities at all levels, community, national, regional or local has been detected all too often when it comes to finding fair solutions to the problems arising.</p>
<p class="contents">Some reaction to this negative situation is called for. At the very least, we should appeal to the President of the House to ensure that, if appropriate, publicity could be given to this reluctance to tackle problems and flagrant injustices which continue to afflict certain sectors of ordinary European society.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to draw attention to the considerable importance attached to maximising personal contact between petitioners and the European Parliament through the Committee on Petitions, so as to ensure that the Committee’s work bears good fruit. I should also like to express our appreciation of the splendid service provided by the European Parliament’s Directorate-General for Research and by STOA. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks to him our colleagues can be aware of the expectations of the citizens of the Union and therefore of the task of the Committee on Petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">The situations in which petitioners find themselves are often Kafkaesque. That is what comes out of reading some of the cases mentioned by Mr Camisón: whether they are problems of recognition of qualifications, discrimination, payment, or withdrawal of vehicle registration, the complexity is such and the obstacles so clear that citizens feel completely powerless.</p>
<p class="contents">The combined work of our Committee and the European Commission means that, by dealing with the problems, what is felt to be injustice can be corrected. The Committee on Petitions can go further, however. It can involve citizens in drawing up Community rules.</p>
<p class="contents">On 13 June, I had the honour of putting a report on silicone implants to the vote in Parliament. This report is an example of the use, which is unfortunately all too rare, of paragraphs 1 and 4 of Article 175 of the Rules of Procedure, which says in particular that the committee responsible may decide to draw up reports on the petitions that it has declared to be admissible and, if necessary, to put motions for resolutions to the vote in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This was the case for the report for which I was responsible. It was following two petitions collecting more than 1000 signatures that this report was undertaken. But it was only the second time since the Committee on Petitions was created that a resolution adopted by Parliament resulted from direct complaints from citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As advocated by Paragraph 18 of Mr Camisón’s report, in this case our Committee called on STOA to make a scientific analysis of the problems encountered by petitioners. Increased use of Article 175, an idea that is defended by the rapporteur, should enable our Committee to make a direct link between citizens’ problems and all the Members of the European Parliament. In my view, this is a political recognition of truly listening to citizens and it is one of the paths for the future for the Committee on Petitions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The work of the Committee on Petitions has often led to a successful conclusion for the citizen concerned and has in some cases resulted in changes to national law and practice in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The areas that present the greatest difficulties to individuals and groups of citizens continue to be social protection, healthcare, taxation and recognition of academic qualifications, particularly for citizens who work in states other than their own Member States, such as in border regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Environmental complaints are also made on major developments where it is felt that their impact on the environment and the livelihoods of people in the areas affected is being ignored by the developers and in some cases by the authorities concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been many successes. For instance, an Irish petitioner with a UK higher institute teaching qualification was refused the right to apply for a post in a state school. The Commission took up this case on behalf of the petitioner and the Committee on Petitions and eventually won the case, having met strong resistance from the German authorities. That is the kind of success that can be achieved by the Committee on Petitions and we need more resources if the Committee on Petitions is to do its work effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am aware that it is not one of the most influential committees in the House, and that not everyone appreciates it fully. Nonetheless, the work of this Committee does represent one of the few channels allowing us to establish direct contact with the citizens and bring the institutions closer to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I entirely agree with Mr Camisón Asensio’s report. I believe it reflects the concerns of those of us who are most closely involved with the Committee’s work. We shall therefore vote in favour of it. I should however like to highlight some of the everyday practical problems we encounter…</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruption by Mr Marinos)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I do apologise, Mr Marinos. I was saying that we work well in the Committee on Petitions and that our work is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">I was hoping to highlight some of the everyday problems we encounter. Firstly, we enjoy a good relationship with the European Commission. The European Commission and the Ombudsman work closely with the Committee on Petitions. The opposite is true as far as the Council is concerned. We do not cooperate with it at all, yet the Council could have something to say on a good many petitions and we very much regret it is always absent. That is our first problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem I would like to mention concerns swift and decisive action on petitions. I am very involved in the Committee on Petitions’ work on environmental issues. That is quite logical, as I also sit on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. It is often the case with environmental problems that if it takes a long time for a response to be received, the decisions taken in a particular country prompting the petition have had an irreversible impact on the natural environment by then. The petitioners lose patience. That therefore is another problem. Responses need to be swifter and more efficient. I am well aware that Member States are conscious of the fact that delaying responses can facilitate their political decisions. That is sometimes the case. It is not entirely the Commission’s fault. The Member States take a long time to respond.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said earlier, the Committee on Petitions is very important to me. It is however lacking in human, legal – and here I am addressing our own institution of course – and technical resources, and it does need them.</p>
<p class="contents">One of Mr Camisón Asensio’s proposals seems to me to be entirely appropriate. It would mean that in cases of lengthy delay in responding to the citizens, the President of Parliament would be requested to publicise the delay and its negative consequences for the petitioners. After all, the latter have enough to do familiarising themselves with Community legislation and assembling the documentation.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I do believe that work needs to be done to educate and inform citizens of their right to petition, because this is one of their rights. I recall that in the previous legislature it was even proposed to do away with the Committee on Petitions and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. For myself, I wish both Committees a great future in this House as they do at least bring the citizens closer to our work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I merely wish to highlight the inexcusable fact that the Committee on Petitions is still being rudely ignored by the Council of Ministers, none of whom – not so much as a representative – has ever wanted to work with us.</p>
<p class="contents">Why would they? European citizens generally take recourse to the Committee on Petitions precisely in order to complain about infringements or omissions by ministers and their services, when they are wronged or when their protest or complaint is ignored. That is precisely why the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman have become the refuge of those who believe that they have been wronged or who, as civic-minded citizens, are trying to do something about infringements, injustice or the destruction of the environment. That is why the European Parliament needs to pay greater attention to the Committee on Petitions and to give it more scope for efficient intervention. It is true that the Committee works closely with us but it often comes up against the indifference and filibustering of national services. As a result, cases drag on interminably, to the disappointment of the European citizens seeking our support.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Camisón Asensio report quite rightly says that short, mandatory deadlines need to be introduced for dealing with petitions more quickly. At the same time, we need a procedure for publicising complaints and the inertia or filibustering of the authorities against which the complaint has been made in the petitioner's country. This will give citizens the only weapon which the guilty authorities fear: publicity which exposes them to the voters.</p>
<p class="contents">A proposal which, if adopted, would I think be hugely important: we need, subject to certain requirements, to introduce an injunctions procedure so that an immediate stop can be put to any incipient infringements of Community law which threaten to wreak irreparable damage on the natural environment or our cultural heritage. Because the time-consuming procedure up to final judgment by the European Court is bereft of any material value if the damage has already been done and cannot be reversed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also would like to thank the European Ombudsman who carries on the fight in defence of the citizens from his observation post. We are working together, of course, and we too are working for the citizens of Europe, because they have a champion in this Parliament, the most authoritative institution in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the European Commission’s particular sensitivity, as demonstrated by the preparation behind the officers’ explanations of their reports in the Committee on Petitions, we have made great progress. However, more and more European citizens are presenting petitions on personal, social and environmental problems. It is our duty give them increasingly relevant, detailed, and satisfying responses.</p>
<p class="contents">Their petitions illuminate the path the Union still has to travel to ensure peace of mind for our citizens. Of course we do not want dull and amorphous standardisation in the European Union, rather we think above all that cultural differences should be harmonised by turning those differences into the true wealth of the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have entered a season of reform, defence and strengthening of the institution of petitions and we believe that season of reform will give us the power to defend the citizens and, at the same time, make the European institutions better known to our ever-growing population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate Mr Camisón Asensio on his report. In it he emphasises how petitions allow the citizens to make their legitimate aspirations known and also draw attention to the inherent weaknesses of Community legislation. The Commission is interested in your work on both these counts, ladies and gentlemen. As an outside observer, allow me to reiterate what I said earlier to Mrs González. I believe that the Committee on Petitions in this House does serve to bring the citizens closer to the institutions in general. The same is true of similar committees in other Parliaments I am acquainted with, for instance in my own country’s parliament, with which I am most familiar. They play a key part precisely in bringing the citizens closer to the institutions in general. They are also invaluable to the work of Members themselves, making them aware of issues a significant number of citizens feel are sensitive and worthy of concern.</p>
<p class="contents">This last year, not only have the Commission’s services cooperated with this Committee, but we Commissioners have also made it our business to cooperate actively with you, ladies and gentlemen. I would therefore like to thank Mr Gemelli for his remark. It is certainly the case that Mr Kinnock, Mr Liikanen, Mrs Wallström and Mr Bolkestein have contributed to your work. They have come in person to discuss and explain issues. They have tried to adduce reasons, possibilities or solutions to concerns expressed by the Committee on Petitions further to requests or complaints by citizens. This proves how much we in the Commission value your work, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection I should like to reiterate what I said earlier. The Commission will respond in as open and constructive a manner as possible to your desire for strengthened cooperation. I appreciate that the time it sometimes takes for us to respond to a query is a problem. Nonetheless, I am sure the House is aware that on most if not all occasions when problems were experienced they arose because the Commission was dependent on a Member State for information.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to deal with different administrations. The only way we can obtain certain types of information from Member States is by exerting political pressure. There are no other means at our disposal. The Commission brings pressure to bear in the same way as you do, ladies and gentlemen. We publicise the fact that the Member State in question has failed to respond to a query or is hindering a response by the Commission. I can only promise that the Commission will continue to urge Member States to act on queries as quickly as possible, supplying the information requested. We will then be able to respond appropriately to the concerns raised by you. In that sense we shall endeavour to continue cooperating fully with the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
