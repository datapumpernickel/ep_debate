<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="italic">(SV) </span>Mr President, the background to this report and the Commission communication with which it deals is a number of extremely serious accidents which have happened in the mining industry in recent years. In 1998, a dam collapsed at a mine in Spain, with very serious ecological consequences, and a similar accident occurred in Romania in 2000. Both these accidents had international environmental consequences. In recent years, we have also seen similar, but less extensive, accidents involving collapsing mine dams, e.g. in Northern Sweden and in Wales.</p>
<p class="contents">This has led to the EU reviewing its legislation with regard to this type of mining operation. At the same time, we have large amounts of mining waste stored in various places releasing heavy metals and other toxic substances into the environment. The content of this waste and the extent of the problem are also not entirely clear. As such, mining waste is one of our major environmental problems. The safety of mining operations is also a major environmental problem.</p>
<p class="contents">In its proposal, the Commission presents its thoughts on possible ways of improving EU legislation in this area. In the main, we have decided, in our report, that things are moving in the right direction. However, we have a number of comments on what we believe the more concrete content should be and on what we would like the Commission to propose. We emphasise that, in the event of an accident, the responsibility should lie exclusively with the company, including responsibility for the environmental consequences, and that the mining industry should be included in the future Directive on environmental liability. We would like more research in this area. At the moment, there is a major lack of research into the management of mining waste. We would, therefore, like the techniques currently found in various countries to be developed. We would also like the EU to review its own financing of various projects in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the main proposals, in my report we propose that the study now underway should also take in the candidate countries. The study means going through old mining waste and identifying cases of serious environmental problems. We know that the situation may be more serious in many candidate countries than it is in the present Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We also emphasise that we would like a common method to be used so that it will be possible to compare results from different sources. We believe that, in the cases where it is established that there is a major problem, these must also be followed up with actual action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important element of the Commission’s proposal is the proposal for a new framework directive on mining waste. I, as rapporteur, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, believe that this is the right approach. A special directive is needed, as neither the Directive on Waste nor the Directive on the landfill of waste is especially applicable to the management of mining waste. We also stress that this directive must deal with both old mining waste and existing production.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive should also contain a provision obliging the Member States to have legislation on the restoration of those locations which have been used for mining operations. Such legislation already exists in a number of Member States but not all, particularly if the candidate countries are included. We would like specific provisions on dam safety which directly address these accidents. In addition, we would like a direct ban on the method used in Baia Mare in Romania, where cyanide was used in open dams for metal extraction. This is an extremely dangerous method which risks seriously damaging the surrounding environment if the dam bursts, as was the case in Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">A third element of the proposals is that the Seveso II Directive should be reviewed. It is a question of broadening the scope of the directive in order to include requirements for contingency plans and information for mining operations. In this area, there is the one amendment to the report, which comes from the Conservative PPE-DE Group. The amendment proposes that the obligation set out in the Seveso II Directive should be restricted and only cover mining operations concerned with ore processing, i.e. metal extraction. I believe it is too early to set such limitations before the Commission’s proposal has even been tabled. It would be unwise to do this at this point. Instead, options should be kept open for all types of mining operation to be covered by this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">There was widespread agreement when we discussed this matter in committee. I would like to thank my fellow Members for their comments and for the support I have received. We have also enjoyed excellent cooperation with the Commission and now look forward quite soon to receiving the first proposals that have been promised, especially the revision of the Seveso II Directive. We hope that the Commission will also listen to us regarding the focus of the forthcoming proposals. Thank you for such excellent cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He had a really very tricky subject to deal with. My group, at any rate, will be very glad to vote in favour of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">As we shall, of course, be voting in favour of your report, Mr Sjöstedt, allow me to give voice to certain misgivings expressed to me by persons affected. Persons affected are of the opinion that a lot of things are being said here that are not materially justified. Because of the two tailing ponds disasters with which we are familiar, the mining industry as a whole and the existing rules are being seen in a light that bears no relation to reality.</p>
<p class="contents">People have mentioned to me recital A, which says that mining accidents have highlighted the inadequacy of rules and monitoring requirements governing the mining industry in present and future EU states. Couched in such general terms, that is not correct. What is correct is that the strictness of the regulations varies within the EU and naturally also in the candidate countries. But the problem lies not so much in the laws as in how those laws are enforced in certain countries, Romania for example.</p>
<p class="contents">On recital D: poor management of mining operations and disposal of mining waste is a global problem. This, too – according to the people concerned, who feel offended by it – is not exactly true, because most firms in the SME category do not operate on a global scale. Many large firms that are active worldwide are, on the contrary, pioneers when it comes to strict safety and environmental standards. Viewed globally, in gold mining, for example, there are more problems with small, under-funded operations that are not in a position even to be properly aware of environmental concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">But there are also things that are expressly welcomed, for example the final sentence of point 8: ‘Furthermore [Parliament] believes that the landfill of waste Directive does not constitute an appropriate framework for regulating mining waste and therefore urges the Commission to put forward a proposal for a specific Directive on mining waste.’ That can only be fully and entirely welcomed and underlined. I believe the European mining industry is very much aware of its responsibilities and is therefore calling for a specific directive for mining waste. There must, then, be adequate rules for waste, and environmental and technical standards must be laid down. I believe we are all aware that the specific nature of mining is such that the Landfill Directive cannot be applied and would not bring about any improvement in the ecological and economic situation of mining companies.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken the liberty, Mr Sjöstedt, of tabling an amendment to paragraph 9. This is concerned with extending the Seveso II Directive to also cover risks arising from storage and processing activities in metal ore mining. I hope you will be able to agree to this amendment and I congratulate you once again on your report.</p>

The incidents which precipitated the study and the subsequent reports in Spain and in Hungary have made us aware of the problems posed by mines and mine-workings, both old and new.</p>
<p class="contents">The potential problems – particularly the problems of water pollution – are cross-boundary problems and therefore worthy of European-wide legislation. After consideration of existing legislation, be it on IPPC, landfill or Seveso, and in each case I have acted as the rapporteur at different stages of development of that legislation, it is clear that none of them can provide a comfortable solution to the range of problems presented by mining operations. So I would concur with the rapporteur that a new piece of legislation – some kind of new initiative – is required to regulate the mining industry in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">I would raise two points with the rapporteur. Firstly, old sites do not necessarily need to be cleaned up. Many old sites are literally centuries old and have developed in such a way that they are now sites of scientific interest and contain particular flora and fauna. I would urge that we should consider preserving sites and using sites in that way rather than simply clearing them off the face of the earth at great expense.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would say that classifying mining waste as waste is very difficult when you consider that large amounts of it are simply crushed rock and quite similar to products that you would get from any quarry in the Union. Therefore I would say that we have to look more particularly at processed waste from mines which often contains high levels of toxic chemicals. That does require regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say that the amendment from the EPP Group is not particularly helpful, since it tries to reduce the scope of this directive to the mining of metal ores. From my own experience, the first tailings dams I ever saw were in Derbyshire in the north of England, and they were the result of the mining of fluorospa, not a metal as any chemistry teacher will tell you. But they present exactly the same problems as tailings dams resulting from mining operations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would recommend a positive vote tomorrow and, I hope, rapid action by the Commission to implement the recommendations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We think it is excellent. The mining sector’s track-record leaves a lot to be desired, not just in Europe, but in eastern Europe and worldwide. One of the very important things in this report is the need for a future directive on mining waste. It should cover both operational and abandoned sites and disposal and contain provisions for mining waste action programmes as well as provisions to facilitate more sustainable extraction: site cleaning, waste reduction, and dry-tailing disposal in the case of metal mining waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Mining companies need to establish decommissioning plans for new and existing mines and tailing ponds. I just have to look at it in my own country where mining companies have come in and basically taken what they want. They then leave the mess behind to be cleaned up. As Mr Bowe said, there may be "historical" mining sites of interest, but we are really talking about tailing ponds which contain many dangerous substances. Local communities have to live with that and, in some areas, even farming has been affected because the mining companies leave their mess behind, affecting not just the water supplies but also the land in general.</p>
<p class="contents">We really have to take into account all sectors in the community. The mining industry has got away with it for far too long. We really need an extremely tight clampdown on how mining industries operate and a future directive on mining waste is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to finish by saying that the report itself is excellent and I hope that it gets full support. I would also like to confirm that our group would be reluctant to support the amendment proposed by the PPE Group for the reasons just mentioned by other speakers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this evening I am standing in for Margot Wallström on this topic because Mrs Wallström had to leave today for the international climate talks in Japan and Australia. I think the Committee will be fully in agreement with Mrs Wallström representing the European side at this High Level Group because climate protection policy is one of our most pressing concerns. I should like, on behalf of the Commission, to thank the European Parliament and especially you, Mr Sjöstedt, but also the committees involved, for your constructive cooperation and outstanding report.</p>
<p class="contents">The background to the Commission’s communication was the serious environmental damage caused by cyanide following the dam breaches in Spain in 1998 and in Baia Mare, Romania, in January 2000. The communication mentions the three key actions planned by the Commission after the most recent mining accidents: first, amendment of the Seveso II Directive, then the presentation of the proposal for a new directive on the treatment of mining waste and, thirdly, the creation of a reference document on best available technologies<span class="italic"> </span>following the procedure laid down in the IPPC Directive, with a description of the best available technologies for reducing everyday pollution and preventing or reducing mining accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">The Baia Mare Task Force’s final report reaffirmed the need for these measures. It was Mrs Wallström who set up this Task Force to obtain more information about the Baia Mare accident and, on that basis, to devise measures to reduce or prevent such hazards in the future. In their report they welcome this communication and support the Commission’s general approach of creating a transparent and coherent framework for greater safety in mining by making appropriate amendments to environmental law and the instruments. This refers not only to the three key actions just mentioned but also to legislation that is not specific to mining, such as the proposed directive on environmental liability.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress at this point that the three key actions mentioned now have different time frames. The proposal for a directive amending the Seveso II Directive has already completed a public consultation and, according to the Commission’s work programme for 2001, is likely to be adopted in the course of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive will not only cover mining but also, following the tragic accident in Enschede in the Netherlands in May last year, the safe storage of fireworks. In the light of the amendment that is now before us and of what Mrs Flemming has said, I should like to add that both the mining accidents mentioned in the Commission communication occurred during activities connected with the extraction of metallic ores. The Commission therefore understands the reasons for wanting to confine the scope of the directive to this field.</p>
<p class="contents">But I would ask you to consider that a gradual extension of the scope of the directive – when and only when accidents have happened – is not consistent with the precautionary principle. Aristotle himself said the improbable will probably happen. Even tomorrow, there could be an accident in an industrial plant not covered by the Seveso II Directive, in which case we would make corrections retrospectively and wait for the next area, so to speak. I would therefore be pleased if Parliament would support the Commission in its efforts to be proactive rather than reactive in its proposed legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">A comment on the time frame for the second key action. Work on the proposal for a new directive on the treatment of mining waste is progressing well. The study of mining hot spots will soon be completed and consultation with the interest groups concerned has already begun. The proposal will probably be adopted by the Commission in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Work on the document on best available technologies began with an opening session at the European IPPC Bureau at the end of June. From past experience, however, producing such a detailed document describing the best available technologies takes two years on average. Finally, the report calls on the Commission to intensify dialogue with the European mining industry. This dialogue is already taking place. It will play a central role in implementing Community strategy for safety in mining.</p>
<p class="contents">Your support shows the Commission that we are on the right road. The report motivates us to continue to work hard for a swift implementation of our strategy for the prevention of mining accidents in the European Union and also in the candidate countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
