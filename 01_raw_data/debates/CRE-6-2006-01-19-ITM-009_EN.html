Parliament is the institutional embodiment of freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Political representation was found to be the very embodiment of democracy; legislation as an act of the will of the electorate, in a spirit of mutual consent and sovereign expression. Democratic political systems heralded parliamentary institutions, because of the openness and transparency of their debates and because the people could monitor the Members at election time. Representatives do have a ‘special status’ which is conferred on them because they are seen as a ‘cross-section of the population’. Their freedom is a right and a duty, their responsibility is politics, and, as Popper once said, their judgment day comes on election day.</p>

This is not, however, a cross-border issue. On the contrary, each Member State must decide for itself how it wishes to design its small enterprises policy. Institutional competition, in which the Member States are able independently to find sound solutions without being locked into rigid EU regulations is incredibly important to the development of small enterprises. Precisely for that reason, we believe that the EU is not the solution when it comes to bringing about an environment friendly to small enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">The report states that there are obstacles to the development of small enterprises, for example in terms of obtaining credit and dealing with complicated tax systems and with administrative procedures for gaining access to Structural and Development Funds. The Member States must do more to make things simpler for small enterprises, and concerns are expressed about there being big differences in respect of education in entrepreneurship and the cultivation of the spirit of enterprise in schools. It also states that the Charter should have the force of law and be binding because the Member States’ involvement would then be greater.</p>

<p class="contents">This is all the more remarkable when you consider that they are often collapsing under fiscal, social and regulatory burdens that are as much as they can bear; that they have to face unrestricted global competition without the weapons of the big companies to defend themselves; that they find it more difficult to access capital, which is so vital to investment; and that a change of ownership often threatens their very existence.</p>

European legislation is staggeringly complex, and the standards imposed are expensive to implement. The policy of opening up the market to unbridled and unfair global competition only adds to the problem.</p>

Sugar beet is an important product for many of our farmers, being one that can be cultivated in places where the conditions are too adverse for other agricultural produce, and so well-considered reform is vital if the survival of farms – the small and medium-sized ones in particular – is to be ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">Reform is needed, but the Commission’s ideas about it again far overshoot the goal, and so we are today calling for even smaller cuts in the price of sugar and beet, more support for the cultivation of sustainable raw materials as a substitute for the cultivation of beet and higher compensation payments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, too, has seen the need for adjustments and has, in its decision, referred to many of our demands. The Council decision in itself amounts to a triumph for this House and for Europe’s sugar-beet farmers, but the cuts still go too far.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of these events, I think it sends completely the wrong signal that the Council should, at the Commission’s insistence, formulate a statement of intent even before Parliament has voted. I believe that the amendments we have proposed today represent an even better way. What we have here is a good reform; I want a better one. It is for that that I stand, and for that that I, today, have voted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Socialist Group in the European Parliament's two amendments also move in the right direction, by providing for the complete elimination of European export subsidies (by 2013 at the latest) and compensation for the restructuring of the sugar sector in the ACP countries, based on an estimated requirement of EUR 200 million a year.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, I would have liked the EU to go further, by providing the funds for this restructuring immediately, instead of the miserly EUR 40 million that has been promised (we proposed twice that amount in the Committee on Development).</p>

This figure is considerably lower than that proposed by both the Commission and Council.

We can expect an exponential increase as China, India and many other rapidly developing economies increase their sugar consumption from the present 10 kg per capita per annum to the European average of 35 kg per capital per annum. We must retain production and processing capacity to face these future challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">Having lost the vote on the common organisation of the market, I logically supported the other two reports – on direct support schemes and the temporary restructuring of the sugar industry – in order to secure the best possible deal for Irish, EU and ACP growers. Overall, Parliament’s position is an improvement on the proposals from the Commission and the Council, but it does not go far enough. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the contrary, it is well known that, when approached by a lion, an ostrich will sacrifice itself to protect its young, by moving away from the nest and allowing the beast to eat it. The ostrich, therefore, is there to sacrifice itself for future generations: it is a symbol of courage and devotion!

It is a good report, the main gist of which is that Europe needs to move on, and that is important, because those, too, who voted ‘no’ in the referenda were not happy with the present state of Europe. The report argues that popular support is essential, and that a variety of options are available, and that too is important since the referenda are a matter of fact, with the ‘no’ votes in the referenda in France and the Netherlands and the ‘yes’ votes in those in Spain and Luxembourg.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very glad to see that the present text incorporates Amendment 18, which explicitly states that the objections of citizens in countries like France and the Netherlands must be met halfway. That is clear as daylight; it is what makes this such a good report, the gist of which is that we must move on, that we must be bold enough to get out of this impasse, but that we must do so by way of the various options open to us; the period of reflection in which we now find ourselves, taking the public into consideration, including in the countries where things have gone wrong. That strikes me as a healthy approach, and that is why we, in the CDA delegation, are enthusiastically supporting this course of action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is ironic that one reason cited in the report for why a European constitution is necessary is that, following the accessions of Bulgaria and Romania, no further enlargement will be possible under the terms of the current Treaty of Nice.</p>

Let the people decide</p>
<p class="contents">The treaties can be amended only by unanimity. The proposed Constitution has been rejected by 55 % of the voters in France and 62 % in the Netherlands. Their verdict must be respected. Therefore the proposed Constitution IS dead according to the rules adopted unanimously among the Member States of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The next meeting in the European Council must accordingly declare the draft text dead; reflect on the No votes; re-read the questions from the Laeken declaration and go back to first principles.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> is to decide whether treaties require popular approval. We believe that treaties have to be adopted by referendum in all member States where it is legally possible. The referendums should if possible be held on the same date.</p>
<p class="contents">Supporters and opponents of the constitution should be asked to produce a joint text for debate about our possible futures. It can include joint amendments on transparency and democratic procedures where the working group may agree. It will certainly include different proposals for catalogues of competences where members will disagree.</p>
<p class="contents">After a year of debate, two alternatives should be placed before the national electorates: On the one hand a renewed constitution; on the other a Co-operation Agreement among European democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">The new directly elected Convention must work in public in working groups and plenary meetings for a year. Each chapter of the existing treaties will have to have a special working group to allow drastic simplification of the existing complicated texts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the plenary of the Convention may adopt two different proposals, a draft Constitution and a draft Cooperation agreement and then ask the voters what they prefer.</p>
<p class="contents">When we have the peoples' verdict the Member States can then meet in a formal intergovernmental conference and take the necessary decisions to be adopted formally according to the demands in the national constitutions. If one or two Member States reject the drafts, a unanimous solution will have to be found in respect of the agreed playing rules for treaty changes.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the minority in the European Parliaments Constitutional committee and the SOS Democracy inter group in the European Parliament, hope and believe that the peoples of most states will see no need for a constitution beyond their own national constitutions. We expect supporters of the constitution to show the same respect for democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Our alternative may be based on seven broad proposals</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">1) Cooperation agreement instead of constitution</span></p>
<p class="contents">The constitution is dead. Instead of a complicated constitution and the Nice Treaty with priority over national constitutions, we want a cooperation agreement with no more than 50 articles. Countries that don't wish to join the cooperation agreement can choose a free trade agreement instead.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council should establish a working group with equal numbers of supporters and opponents of the Constitution in order to present a proposal of rules which is flexible enough to let them unite instead of divide Europe, as we have seen the Constitution do.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">2) Openness and transparency</span></p>
<p class="contents">Openness and full access to documents will be the main rule. Any exceptions shall be approved with 75 % support. The Ombudsman, the Court of Auditors and the EU-Parliament shall be able to control all expenditures.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">3) Direct elections</span></p>
<p class="contents">Decision makers shall be directly accountable through the ballot box to those who must abide by their decisions in each country.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">4) 75 % majority in the Council with the right to veto</span></p>
<p class="contents">Laws should be adopted with unanimity or by a 75 % majority among member states and simple majority in the EU-Parliament. There should be the opportunity for veto, when a national Parliament votes against a proposal for EU-law and requests the prime minister to bring up the case at the next summit.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">5) Bottom-up subsidiarity</span></p>
<p class="contents">The subsidiarity principle should be controlled by the national parliaments. The existing 100,000 pages of legislation must be revised critically, and the main part must be eliminated or sent back to the member states.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">6) Greater flexibility and minimum conditions</span></p>
<p class="contents">Laws should be approved as a common set of minimum standards which gives the member states more flexibility and possibility to have a higher level of protection of security, health, environment, working conditions, social conditions and consumer protection. We should prefer mutual recognition to total harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">7) Enhanced cooperation instead of compulsory union</span></p>
<p class="contents">Foreign and security policy, the euro cooperation and legal cooperation should not be an obligatory part of the cooperation but can be transferred to an enhanced cooperation if desired by the individual countries. Defence should be completely separated from the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was what the co-rapporteurs from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, whose ceaseless efforts I welcome, wanted, and I co-signed their amendments advocating a 'constitutional core'.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament rejected this pragmatic and worthwhile policy, and restated their commitment to the current text of the Constitution. This is the idea that it is still possible to make the French and Dutch vote again on the same text. This denial of the popular vote is futile, whatever the positions of the various parties: that is why I am pleased that the French socialists, with a few exceptions, abstained.

It is lamentable that Parliament has, on this point, disregarded the warning given by its rapporteurs, Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, and it is for that reason that I have abstained from taking part in the final vote on the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The period of reflection must be used to prepare agreement on a procedure that is as democratic as possible for a new reform of the Treaties.

Other passages (paragraphs 1, 5, 7, and 31) also fail to do justice to the unambiguous no vote in the Netherlands. It is for that reason that I find it impossible to vote in favour of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that the Netherlands has to make clear precisely what it wants – whether it wants to renegotiate the Constitution, continue on the basis of the Treaty of Nice or begin the whole process anew.

Whether we are talking about the Constitution, the services directive or Reach – to name but a few – the challenge before us is to simplify the language we use and the way we communicate, in order not to leave the field to the so-called populists. Scarcely any other institution possesses so many structures and so many means for supporting communication, yet scarcely any other institution uses a language the complexity of which leaves it wide open to deliberate or involuntary misinterpretations. All too often, the two things that fall by the wayside in any debate about Europe are common reference to what has been achieved and an explanation of the new in that context. There are in essence two great schools of thought where the future of Europe is concerned. One of the things that the Constitution did was to show how those who want more Europe and those who want less combine to bring Europe to a standstill – not in the way they think, but in the way they vote. If these contradictions are made clearer and more readily comprehensible for the citizen’s benefit, a new and real European debate will be the result. The Duff report goes in the right direction; all that is needed is action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most of the electorate are all in favour of Council meetings being open to the public, of a subsidiarity test for national parliaments, or the tentative moves towards a citizens’ initiative in Article 47. These things could have been brought in long ago, even without a constitution. Far more contentious were the economic and military policy choices that this text was to set in stone, such as free unhindered competition being one of the EU’s main objectives, the constantly-extended liberalisation of services, or the constant upgrading of the Member States’ weapons systems. The practice of tied sales, which involves good points being taken hostage by bad ones, is one that the two rapporteurs want to adopt, in the belief that approval is only a matter of time. They even want to put a stop to the admission of new Member States until such time as the constitution has been approved.</p>
<p class="contents">My party, the Socialist Party, is the largest of the parties that, in the Netherlands, waged a successful campaign against this draft Constitutional Treaty. After it was rejected by the voters, we tabled proposals in the Dutch Parliament for openness, a subsidiarity test and citizens’ initiative, similar to what Mr Brok recommended to this House on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the very same alternative that I had put forward in Amendment 6, the rejection of which represents a missed opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">1. If we are to have any hope of a social and civil Europe, the Constitutional Treaty for the EU must once and for all be consigned to the archives.</p>
<p class="contents">2. The EU Constitution is intended to significantly accelerate the militarisation of the EU and (in III-311) lays down a whole range of militaristic projects.</p>
<p class="contents">3. The EU Constitution is intended to prepare the EU to be able to wage war on a global scale. It opens up scope for worldwide military interventions (I-41,1 and III-309).</p>
<p class="contents">4. The Constitutional Treaty for the EU includes an explicit obligation to rearm (I-41,3). If it were to be ratified, there would be an even greater tendency to spend more money on armaments.</p>
<p class="contents">5. With the Constitutional Treaty for the EU, the EU’s foreign policy would be bound only by the principles of the UN Charter rather than by the Charter as a whole (I-3,4). This would make it possible for the EU to interpret them in such a way as to be able to wage war even without a UN mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">6. The Constitutional Treaty for the EU serves as a programmatic blueprint, making it possible to push the militarisation of the EU forward without reference to the treaties as they currently stand. Among the examples of this are the extension of the EU Armaments Agency (III-311) and the establishment of the Battle Groups (III-312).</p>
<p class="contents">7. The Constitutional Treaty for the EU is intended to put neo-liberalism on a constitutional footing (III-177), something of which the anti-social Bolkestein directive is but an initial foretaste. The proposal by the German Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel, that a repeat vote be engineered in France and the Netherlands by adding to the EU Constitution a declaration on the ‘social dimension’ of Europe which would not be legally binding is nothing short of scandalous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The more countries living in peace, stability and prosperity we have in our neighbourhood, the safer we will be ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason I still asked for the floor is that in my opinion, the importance of the good neighbourhood policy far exceeds the interpretation currently given to it by the European Union. In our current thinking, forced enlargement plays a much more serious part than the neighbourhood policy. Certain countries can never become members of the European Union, others are given vague promises, and others yet are regarded by some as privileged. I believe that it would be wiser to develop some sort of special partner status, and deepen the neighbourhood policy. Rather than accepting some countries and punitively ignoring others, we should be thinking in terms of a good neighbourhood policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">1. The intention is that the EU’s neighbourhood policy should be a means towards creating a geopolitical sphere of influence for the European Union and its Member States, its efforts being aimed at the creation of ‘privileged partnerships’ for the neighbouring countries, including those of the South Caucasus.</p>
<p class="contents">2. The report is quite frank about the geostrategic direction of the neighbourhood policy being towards securing the supply of raw materials for the EU. ‘Energy policy’ is to be an important theme in the EU’s neighbourhood policy, as the EU ‘is surrounded by the world’s most important reserves of oil and natural gas (Russia, the Caspian basin, the Middle East and North Africa)’. It repeatedly emphasises the geostrategic significance of such transit countries as Georgia and Armenia.</p>
<p class="contents">4. The plan is that the EU’s influence should be underpinned by bringing about regime change in Belarus and elsewhere. All that is needed is to consider the different treatment meted out to Belarus and Uzbekistan, the latter of which tolerates the presence of EU Member States’ military bases, such as the German one in Termez, for it to become clear that the primary concern here is with the extension of the EU’s sphere of influence.</p>
<p class="contents">5. In terms of military policy, too, the neighbouring countries are being locked in to the EU, the idea being that they should be able to take part in military interventions and participate in the military structures of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Women have the right to be integrated into the normal working processes as the equals of men in every respect, with, moreover, the right to equal pay for equal work, although it is common knowledge that there is still a need for more progress in this area. On that, then, we are in agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, however, want to point out that, in every European Union Member State, a remarkably large number of women freely choose to work at home among their own family, and that even more women would be willing to take that option if it were financially feasible. Part-time work and good childcare facilities are partial solutions, but the introduction of full parental pay for those who work at home or have small children would be a very good step to take. In addition to that, it has to be said that there needs to be a solution to the issue of pensions rights and to the social security arrangements of parents working at home for all or part of the time, whose contribution to society is of incalculable value. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
