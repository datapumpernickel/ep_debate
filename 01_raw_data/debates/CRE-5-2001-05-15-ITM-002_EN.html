<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">von Wogau (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>.<span class="italic"> </span>– <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first of January 2002 will mark the start of a momentous chapter in the history of European integration, when twelve sovereign states exchange their national currencies for a common European currency. From that moment on, the people of those twelve Member States will use the same notes and the same coins.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems appropriate to find a term to describe this new stage in the integration of national economies, a stage which is characterised by a common market and a common currency and which is surely unique in the economic history of the world. We propose the use of the term ‘European home market’ as a synonym for Euroland or the euro zone. This European home market already has a common monetary policy. Since European economic and monetary union came into being on 1 January 1999, this policy has been in the hands of the European Central Bank. Today, however, we are faced with the challenge of formulating appropriate common economic policies for the European home market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs agreed by a clear majority that these economic policies should be based on the principle of a socially committed market economy. The main instrument for the coordination of economic policies at European level is the procedure laid down in the Treaty for establishing the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. The European Parliament has hitherto played a subordinate role in this procedure. I therefore believe it is absolutely essential to provide for a greater degree of participation by the European Parliament in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Another flaw in the procedure is its lack of flexibility. Recommendations are made on the basis of predicted economic trends. If, however, current economic data diverge from the forecast values, these recommendations lose some of their validity. The Member States must therefore be given some leeway to respond quickly to unexpected changes in economic indicators. The Guidelines are not legally binding, but it is certainly accurate to speak of the political binding force of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there is no disputing that defects must be corrected in everyone’s interest, a certain margin of discretion should exist here too. I believe there is a need, for example, when assessing a Member State’s economic policies, to consider the extent to which particular trends in that country will affect the euro zone as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic growth in the European Union has slowed down since last year. The Commission has now revised its predicted growth rate of 3% and has lowered its expectations to 2.8%. Other observers expect even lower growth rates. On the basis of these forecasts, we consider a figure of between 2 and 2.5% for this year to be entirely realistic. In view of the general slowdown in the world economy, I believe it is crucial that the European Union should look to its own strengths. How profoundly the bleak global economic climate will affect us is largely in our own hands. Particularly in view of developments in the United States and Japan, responsibility for the world economy falls on the European Union, and we must shoulder that responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the present state of play in the European Union? As far as inflation is concerned, current forecasts indicate that prices are set to rise by more than 2% in two consecutive years, thereby exceeding the bounds of price stability as defined by the European Central Bank itself. External factors, however, such as the increase in oil prices, are playing an important part in this development.</p>
<p class="contents">In this difficult environment, the European Central Bank is doing an excellent job. But it must continue to do everything in its power to avoid squandering the reserves of trust that have been vested in it. That is why we welcome its steady-handed policy, which we encourage it to keep pursuing. At this point, however, I must cast doubt on the consistency of last week’s interest-rate cut with this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">In the domain of budgetary policy, most Member States have managed in the course of the past year to achieve the balanced budget prescribed in the Stability and Growth Pact. This, however, has been done with the aid of the proceeds from the sale of licences for the operation of universal mobile telecommunications systems (UMTS) as well as low interest rates and the increased tax revenue generated by accelerated economic growth. Some of the Member States, however, have not capitalised sufficiently on these favourable economic conditions to reduce their public deficits and their national debt.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the changes in the ageing pattern of the European population and the strain these are likely to put on the pension system, it is crucial that sufficient financial room for manoeuvre be created. Full use must be made, for example, of the potential for spending cuts in every area. This should not undermine the role of public investment, but such investment must be made judiciously in pursuit of defined strategic aims and must not be made at the expense of priority private investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking to our own strengths also involves continuing the structural reforms of the Member States’ capital products and labour markets. The Stockholm summit failed to reach agreement on a firm timetable for the liberalisation of the European gas and electricity markets. I very much regret that. Nevertheless, we should make every effort to secure the liberalisation of the remaining state monopolies. This is essential if we are to achieve our avowed aim of making the European Union the most competitive and dynamic economic area in the world by the year 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is imperative to push ahead with the completion of the internal market. I need cite only two major examples in this context: firstly, agreement must be reached at long last on the Community patent; secondly, Community rules on public procurement should be applied to defence procurement too, wherever their application is warranted.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Particularly at a time when the European Union is taking steps to establish a common defence policy, the ring-fencing of national defence markets is inefficient, anachronistic and quite simply too expensive.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of the euro on 1 January will affect the entire population of the European home market. If we want it to benefit the people of Europe, we need an economic policy that accords with the principles of social justice and market economics.</p>

On the whole, however, I do not believe that his report is as balanced as he presented it here. First of all, on behalf of my committee I must criticise the lack of opportunity we were given to cooperate on this report, to engage in proper parliamentary discussion and to draft an opinion. Public acceptance of the euro and of European economic policy, Mr von Wogau, will not simply depend on the coining of a new term such as ‘home market’ or the like. It will take a bit more than that to convince people. This point is emphasised in the opinion which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted by a large majority. Let me cite some examples of the interaction and evidence of reliability that are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we need stability, but, as you well know, we also need more extensive investments in education and science. We call for an increase in the activity rate, especially with regard to women, yet we do not provide sufficient childcare facilities throughout the Union. We have naturally looked long and hard at demographic trends in all 15 Member States and now in the applicant countries too, yet our health services and our care services for the elderly still leave much to be desired. Growth alone, as our committee noted very clearly, cannot guarantee the quality of jobs. All of these improvements are necessary to ensure that our economic and monetary policies win the approval of the general public and of the working people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to see that some Member States – and I believe this is underestimated by the Commission and its Economic Policy Committee – are working to improve and intensify the participation of employees in economic life, as demonstrated by the legislative bills that have been introduced in France and Germany, for example. It is also interesting that a number of Member States have already responded to the proposals that Parliament and the Commission have been making for some time – they are not being tabled for the first time today – such as the long-overdue opportunity for older employees to upgrade their qualifications rather than being more or less squeezed out of the labour market with the aid of statutory provisions as in past years.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, let me point out that our committee was scathingly critical of the Council’s dilatory implementation of the Lisbon strategy. The economic policy of the Union must clearly be consistent with the principles of its employment policy and the social agenda. I wish to thank my fellow committee members for the flexible and constructive manner in which they dealt with the drafting of an opinion in such unusual circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His consistent support of the doctrine of the social market economy as the most suitable common socio-economic model for the Community only deserves our thanks and our endorsement of the ideas he has put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The social market economy, however, does not mean adhering to outdated structures or building resistance to change on the pretext of preserving social services and jobs. Neither is this plea made in Mr von Wogau’s report. On the contrary, Community structures have to be continually questioned and modernised if we want to realise the solemn promise made at Lisbon of a Europe as the most competitive, knowledge-based area in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The signs are bad, however, and in some respects getting worse. I do not accept that staff should not be told about structural changes and job losses as early on as possible, but if there is any intention of evolving a directive from the Marks &amp; Spencer case, one that would essentially slow down the conversion of companies, I am against it. I am astonished at Germany’s official negative attitude – one I have only read about in the newspapers, it is true – towards the directive on mergers and takeovers, and at its aim to provide companies with artificial tools that will prevent the merger of companies which are aspiring to greater efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mr von Wogau, I am tired of speaking about the much too slow deregulation and opening up to competition of the energy sector, transport sector and the Post Office in many different Member States. Nor, apparently, will the position regarding air transport become clear for years to come, and internal bolts have been drawn to prevent the advance of genuine, pan-European public procurement, which will tend to have a hampering effect on the real efficiency that results from genuine competition. The UMTS auctions were an unfortunately good example of how governments are also managing to shoot Europe and themselves in the foot in the building of an <span class="italic">e</span>Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, well-balanced public finances, control of inflation and the monitoring of employment indicators are certainly important, even essential, but it is just as essential to clean the skeletons out of many of the national cupboards and put an end to the continued furtive glances from electorates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission recommendation for 2001 was drafted when the rest of the world was going through a particularly difficult patch. We have seen a recurrence of monetary crisis in the developed countries, such as Argentina and Turkey. We have seen the technological bubble in the new economy burst in the United States. This has not been without a knock-on effect in Europe, in that numerous companies in the United States have cut back or shut up shop in Europe in an effort to reduce overheads. Generally speaking, the problems in the global economy have seriously reduced the prospects for the European economy, to 2.8% for 2001 and 2.9% for 2002, according to the Commission’s latest figures.</p>
<p class="contents">The main questions for the European economy, for the European institutions and for the Member States remain the same, despite the change in the international environment. The questions are whether economic policy innovations and methodology are sufficiently well designed to protect the economy of Europe from external disruption and give the European economy the chance to embark on the high road to sustained and stable economic development in the medium and long term.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no doubt that permanently high rates of growth are vital; they are the <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> if we are to reduce what are still unacceptably high rates of unemployment and boost European competitiveness. The unemployment situation is not unrelated to the question of competitiveness; they are connected because an economy without full employment cannot be called a competitive economy because it is wasting a large part of its potential.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we achieve a higher rate of growth? The report tells us that we can only rely on monetary stability, a prudent budget and logical wage demands which take account of price stability. Most of the committee believes that mobilising the market will only increase investments in what are exclusively market tools.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the report calls on the Member States to speed up the structural reforms of capital market, product and labour markets and expresses its regret that there is no timetable for liberalising the energy and gas markets in Europe. I should like to add here that, if and when this liberalisation comes about, the Member States must heed the lessons learned from the upheavals in the United States. Privatising major sectors is no easy task.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also calls for greater efforts to complete the internal market. Of course greater effort is needed to complete the internal market, especially the internal market in financial services, because we certainly need a much more dynamic stock exchange in Europe. However, none of this alone will trigger a high rate of growth in the European economy. Structural reforms are needed; we must not neglect public investment, which has been neglected in the past, and we must do this by stimulating public investment, because we are lagging way behind.</p>
<p class="contents">My job was to present Parliament with the report on the economic guidelines for 2001. I have warned that, although the crisis in the American economy could endanger us, we are now taking this crisis seriously and, if we are to avoid succumbing to upheavals in the international economy, it would be illogical to neglect any weapon; most importantly, it would be illogical to neglect the weapon of public investment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The forecasts, which were rosier some months ago, have had to be revised downwards. There is enormous resistance to setting the inflation rate at the target of 2% and there is clear concern about the current economic situation.</p>
<p class="contents">This obviously leads to the question of what is the correct way to try to overcome this situation and ensure solid and sustained growth.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, Mr von Wogau’s report contains many elements which should be taken into account, but I would like to highlight some of them which we have already stressed. There are some which we have in fact mentioned in various debates.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the need for Member States to remain rigorous and resolute with regard to the commitments established in the respective stability programmes: we are worried that there may be flexibility – in the field of deficit and public debt – with regard to those issues intended to ensure that objectives are achieved and complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like to mention the need for better and greater coordination of economic policies – you know that we are not satisfied with the current level of coordination, and this Parliament has stressed this on many occasions – and we would like to stress the issue of structural reforms and the need for flexibility in certain markets which affect the productive structure of the European Union, such as the labour market, and, obviously, the process of liberalisation in certain sectors also considered to be key sectors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This basically equates to cuts in public and social spending. Mr von Wogau’s report takes the same approach. There is a self-satisfied air about this that I find quite disconcerting, given the worsening economic situation, and a refusal to consider the conditions needed to promote sustainable development. The declared ambition is to follow a programme of stability. The European Central Bank’s primary goal is to ensure price stability. The European Central Bank still refuses to lower interest rates, because it is obsessed with the threat of inflation, which is still on the horizon, and the President of the Bundesbank recently reminded us that the European Central Bank is not responsible for either growth or employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The report reiterates the European Union’s goal to be more competitive and more dynamic, which is a worthy objective, but the proposals on the resources needed to implement this remain within the realms of dogma. These include adjusting pension systems to take account of budgetary restrictions, fully exploiting the potential for spending cuts in all areas, although the euphemism given to the public is ‘creating an appropriate environment to foster investment in terms of the labour market’, without forgetting, of course – and this is the perpetual icing on the cake – liberalisation in the outstanding sectors. There is no mention of our obligations towards Community level services of general interest. Basically, we are continuing to use the same old strategies, namely the anti-inflationist credo, the number one priority. We all know the consequences of this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The report shows no hesitation in stressing the progress made in reducing levels of unemployment in some Member States, and highlights the need to continue reform of the labour market. It would be worthwhile assessing the nature of these newly created jobs, which are most often insecure. How can you possibly strive for improvements in unemployment whilst totally disregarding the strategy of the large and generally profitable European companies, which keep a close eye on financial criteria and make many of their employees redundant on the pretext of maintaining competitiveness? Although this stretches the credibility of the European social model, we are coming up against obvious reluctance to take the necessary measures to protect employees.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no mention of the social policy that is essential to consolidating growth. No mention of businesses’ social responsibilities. Once again, this sort of economic policy does not tally with the desire to achieve sustainable development, which would require a dynamic of public investment and organising a market with strong industrial ambitions. The necessary capital does exist. There is an urgent need to control the reality of the financial market and that is why my group, in the process of discussing this report, is revisiting the European Union’s economic policies and proposes to introduce a tax on speculative buying in order to control them, to reduce their volatility and most importantly to raise resources to invest in society and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">This report, and the situation of the European Union in general, show once again that it would be beneficial to make the EU’s political, economic and social decisions part of a genuine democratic process, which could be established in each country, after wide-ranging consultation with civil society in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A step which is costing money while the benefits are yet to become apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the euro coin, the new step has two sides. On the one hand, economies which are ahead in the economic trend are in need of an increase in interest so as to dampen down inflation. This is now impossible. On the other hand, countries which are lagging behind need a boost with a lower rate in interest. That too proves to be impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">Whichever way you look at it, it marks the loss of one of the instruments required for a healthy economy. Greater coordination is not the answer. Something else is needed to balance the loss of national monetary instruments: structural reforms – familiar to us all, yet a rarity – such as a more flexible labour market and the further breakdown of state monopolies. These could restore the value of the euro, more so than an unexpected change in interest rates. The most recent fall in interest rates of the European Central Bank came a day before it was known that, at 5.3%, Dutch inflation had reached its highest level in almost 20 years. That illustrates the seriousness of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Those reforms should make Europe more innovation-friendly. However, many subsidies and other incentive schemes only distort the market and are often harmful to the environment. If we are to launch these reforms with a vengeance, I fear the worst for Europe’s competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns the environment. Despite the favourable economic climate, little has been done about the strategy for sustainability. Economic growth, a fall in employment and environmental integration must be better coordinated. Since the economy has grown more rapidly than expected, more ambition in this field should be a matter of course. Let us therefore declare this a cornerstone in our policy. The European Parliament will be given its opportunity at the end of May, and the European Council in Gothenburg in June.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, a new step in integration can only live up to its name if the integration of the environment and economy actually gets off the ground. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let us quickly look at its form. In Article 5, you mention, and I quote, ‘the political priority to improve the quality and sustainability of public finances’. Would public finances thus be unsustainable, because they are short-lived? In Article 10 of your resolution, you stress, and I quote, ‘the importance…of public investment, which must, however, be targeted and based on strategic objectives,’ – that is true – but ‘which must not drive out private investment, which has priority’. What sort of contradictory statement is this? One that is designed to please everyone and achieve nothing!</p>
<p class="contents">As for the report’s content, you demonstrate a commitment to the social market economy, a subject close to the heart of the CDU party. This is not the view France takes. Judging from the relatively poor performance of the German economy over the last 40 years, why should we adopt this approach? Why should France, for example, abandon the industrial policy which has transformed it into the leading European country in its strategic sectors? This has all been achieved without using any monetary tricks, as used by the deutschmark, which was overvalued by 15% when the euro was introduced, or when East Germany was estimated to be worth USD 350 billion, whereas at reunification, it was only worth USD 100 billion at the very most. This has all been achieved without drowning ourselves in everything European, which is what eventually happened to the aerospace company that was taken over by Aérospatiale-Matra – one of the world’s former leading companies in aeronautics and space engineering – despite the fact that Matra is half the size, and these two companies were then both swallowed up by EADS. This is certainly great news for France,<span class="bold"> </span>which having once had a majority stake, is now a minority partner once again!</p>
<p class="contents">Should we thank the frenzied Mr Chirac for this outcome, or Mr Jospin, the pacifist, or Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, who did at least try to clear up the mess made by the other two? What use, therefore, is this report, which does not criticise any of the euro zone countries directly and which does not even mention the de facto devaluation of the European currency, the collapse of which continues to be a cause for concern? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I firmly believe that trying to reconcile social justice with the market is a concern shared by all the countries of Europe. All countries should, however, be free to follow the path that is most suited to their character, enhanced by mutual coordination, but the instrument of Brussels should not be used to impose a single formula upon them.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that there is a huge misunderstanding surrounding the concept of the home market. There is a risk of this expression implying that the European economies are managed by a single political authority. This is not the case today, however, and as for the future, the Treaty of Maastricht makes no such stipulation either. According to the Maastricht model, the single currency, which is managed by the European Central Bank, coexists with many national political authorities. If some countries see matters in a different light, it would be better if they stated this clearly to the public in their own countries before the end of the year and to arrange the necessary referendum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, Karl von Wogau’s report is not a school report card on the progress of the Member States’ economic policies. This report by Karl von Wogau is a report on the economic guidelines for the future and an analysis of the <span class="italic">status quo</span>. I am therefore very grateful that Karl von Wogau chose the term ‘home market’ in connection with the introduction of euro notes and coins, because the single currency is the greatest integration project of the present-day European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of euro notes and coins will be a clearly visible reminder of our European home, a reminder that will be given to all the people of the euro zone whenever they handle the single currency. It is also positive that this concept of a home market will also remind the public so tangibly of the political integration project that underlies the introduction of the euro, since this could provide an extremely powerful impetus for the political pursuit of economic progress, employment and European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point is that I fail to understand how, in this day and age, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs can still try to present capital and growth as the enemies of employment, which came across to some extent in Mrs Weiler’s speech. This is why it was necessary once again to put the concept of a socially committed market economy at the heart of this report. I should like to extend the concept into that of a socially and environmentally committed market economy. What do we mean by that? We mean that we are opposed to the treatment of growth and employment as two completely separate issues. That is why we have pledged ourselves to the Stability Pact and to growth and employment. A socially committed market economy encourages social responsibility, ecological sustainability and an education policy rooted in the principle of lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish with an appeal to the Council. The Broad Economic Policy Guidelines require us all to work together. Since the report says that the EU market in financial services must become an integrated, efficient market, and since we are forever stressing the important role played by pensions and by accelerated procedures, I have to say to the Council that the Ecofin Council, at its last meeting, certainly paid further lip service to the principles that are involved here but, when it came to company pensions and the Lamfalussy report, betrayed those selfsame principles. The Broad Economic Policy Guidelines can be implemented with the active support of the Council. Now is the time for it to act.</p>

I believe that when discussing the coordination of economic policies, the debate that we are holding today and the vote that we will take on this report are still our main cornerstones, on which any comments should be based. From this point of view, I cannot resist the pleasure of repeating a warning. These broad economic guidelines are still our primary analytical and working tools for arranging the coordination of economic policies. We can only regret the fact that once these broad guidelines have been adopted, they will no longer be part of the national debate. I urge all our colleagues in the Member States to take these broad guidelines into account when they draw up national budgetary and fiscal guidelines, because otherwise there will be no genuine coordination of economic policies. We shall soon have the opportunity to come back to this subject, when we discuss the communication by the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">I have three comments to make on the main thrust of the proposal submitted to us today by our fellow Member, Karl von Wogau. The first comment is to express my pleasure at what the report says on enhancing this tool and on the prospect of a convergence of the fiscal and budgetary policies of the Member States, particularly and primarily of those belonging to the euro zone. I have taken note of the consideration given here to the importance of economic stature, which should be taken into consideration when considering sanctions against a Member State. I imagine that this will take us back to the debate that we had last year on the situation in Ireland. I believe that the decision taken on Ireland is not exceptional. This decision was expected, it was legitimate and it was fortunate. Even so, if we have to consider the importance of economic stature in various situations, we will then have to look at how Mr Berlusconi will implement his economic policy and whether this is compatible with the broad guidelines that we are finalising today.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to make one comment, if I may, on the reform of the labour markets. If this involves carrying out structural reforms, by amending the Directive establishing a European Works Council, on the information and consultation of workers, we can only support this. Lastly, with regard to liberalisation, I think that experience both within and beyond Europe suggests that we should be extremely careful in maintaining access to public services, in parallel with these changes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The workers, the working majority of the population, do not base their judgments on your words, but on the difficulties in their own lives and they understand all too well that what you are calling the ‘the social market economy’ is making 15 million men and women redundant in the European Union, which is actually one of the richest regions of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Your social market economy, in other words, means wide-spread job insecurity and an increase in the number of workers who, even here in France, are paid FRF 4 000 or 5 000 per month and much less in other European countries, whereas shareholders, who do nothing, take their share of the dividends from the massive profits made by these companies.</p>
<p class="contents">So the market economy that you are glorifying in your report is a stupid, unjust and inhuman economy, which works by concentrating wealth amongst a small minority and by making the majority’s living conditions worse.</p>
<p class="contents">You are daring to assert that competition provides considerable protection against the abuse of power. However, it is by bringing about competitiveness and competition that the boards of directors of large companies such as Danone, Michelin, GEC-Alsthom, Péchiney, Marks &amp; Spencer and many others can perpetrate this particularly horrendous abuse of power that involves laying off some of their workers, completely closing down factories, which sometimes means that an entire town will become deserted, just so that their shareholders are guaranteed some extra dividends.</p>
<p class="contents">You claim that you want to overcome, and I quote, ‘the democratic deficit in European economic policy’, but the first step you must take in order to overcome this deficit would be to deprive large employers of their divine right to get rid of all the people who work to improve their existence and you would do this by banning employers from making collective redundancies and forcing them to deduct from profits and from dividends, stored up by shareholders, whatever is necessary to safeguard all the jobs that are at risk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Della Vedova (TDI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would like to start by replying to the previous speaker, for I too am dissatisfied with the term ‘social market economy’. There is no need for the word ‘social’. In my view, the market economy, with its rules, is not only the climate in which the fundamental economic right of people – the freedom of contract and trade – is guaranteed, it is also the economic environment which is most conducive to the generation of wealth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to Mr von Wogau's report, I would like to make a few specific points: I have a positive comment to make on point 12, for example, which takes quite an encouraging view of the work of the European Central Bank. I would like to expand on this. Without going into a detailed analysis of the choices made regarding interest rates or monetary policy, I feel that this is one occasion when it must be stressed that the attempt by the governments and also by many political groupings present in this Parliament to force the European Central Bank and President Duisenberg to work towards goals, which are not the most suitable for supporting economic growth, must be opposed. There are such wide gaps between the various European economies in terms of productivity and efficiency that, in my opinion, this is the area that we need to concentrate on if we want to secure a competitive future for the economies of the leading countries, for we will certainly not achieve this by taking the deceptive shortcut of lowering interest rates.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point on which I would like to focus relates to point 8, which concerns the need to adapt pension systems to changes in demographic conditions. I believe that, in this matter, the European Parliament must call strongly, first and foremost upon the Member States but also upon the Commission, in so far as it is able, to adopt a more responsible approach. Their responsibility is to achieve, through radical reforms and as soon as possible, a pension system that is financially sustainable and fair towards future generations. Currently, in a large number of countries – such as Italy, for example – the pension contributions of workers, particularly young workers, are being used irresponsibly to finance the pensions of people who are 54 or 55 years old, who may well be doing two jobs, an illegal job or an undeclared job. In my opinion, this must be a priority for Europe, a priority of economic efficiency but, first and foremost, a priority of fairness towards all generations. There are countries, such as Italy, in which obligatory pension contributions exceed 30% of income, although the people paying these contributions will receive much lower pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to another issue, the labour market, we must be firmer in our demands on the European countries. It has been said in this Chamber that there is a risk of causing job insecurity, but I believe that precisely the flexibility and substantial use of flexibility tools in the labour market, together with a re-evaluation of the rules governing permanent employment, re-establish a balance between atypical employment, precarious employment and permanent employment. This is necessary because it is the only way to achieve an increasingly balanced labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to make a point on a subject which is just as problematic – I would not go as far as to say critical but certainly problematic – the prospect of political economic policy coordination mechanisms aimed at bringing about convergence of fiscal and budgetary policies. In my opinion, we need to focus on the fact that convergence of fiscal and budgetary policies has to be one of the European Union's objectives. I feel that having different contrasting models, different solutions to observe, doing, so to speak, a little benchmarking – and the case of Ireland is, in my opinion, a negative precedent – is a positive, not a negative thing for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Lip service is paid time and again to the principle of supporting small and medium-sized businesses, but the fact is that we give them far too little support, even though they are the engine of our economy and the guarantors of European jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">If we really want to help them, we must do all we can to ensure that changes are made to the economic conditions in which they operate. This means that our administrative systems and regulations must be modernised and simplified. Deep cuts must be made in non-wage labour costs, which are vastly excessive. These measures must be consolidated by means of an extension of the Maastricht criteria on budget deficits and debt levels to include a cap on administrative expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">No Member State’s administrative expenditure may on any account exceed 8% of its GDP. If this savings potential were realised, the absolutely crucial process of tax reform could be financed, and the engine of our economy, the small and medium-sized businesses, could be primed up to remain in perpetual motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Chancellor Brown, no doubt with the general election of 7 June in mind, decided to promise considerable increases in public spending, particularly on health and education, threatening, without tax rises, to breach the stability and growth pact agreements and to raise the proportions spent by the public sector beyond the desirable current 38% level of GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Berlusconi's new government and promised economic package may also be problematic for the Commission, but it is particularly rich for the British Chancellor to reject this criticism from the Commission as interfering in sovereign British fiscal affairs, while at the same time making active plans for a referendum to join the euro, subject to his arbitrary five economic tests, which make no mention of the constitutional issues behind EMU, which are dear to British Conservatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Once the UK is in the euro zone, we will have even less fiscal autonomy, and I do not know what politically – as opposed to legally – binding guidelines really mean in practice, as we are forced to harmonise our taxes upwards to avoid so-called unfair tax competition and avoid distortion in Mr von Wogau's proposed European home market. That is a name that I, as a UK Member, object to, as it suggests that the three states remaining outside the euro, of which my country is one, are not at home in Europe's single market; so I would strongly suggest that euroland or euro zone is much the preferred label and I wish the zone every success for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I personally have a problem with the term ‘social market economy’, as we in Britain associate it with social democracy, the description in the report rightly encapsulates the vision of a dynamic, deregulated, competitive, free-market economy that is sensitive to the needs of the environment and the labour markets, which I clearly welcome. However, I am not so sure whether the comments regarding the European Central Bank's first two years are exactly correct. It has not been a great success, and they are still muddling through and remain somewhat opaque in their decision-making process. This was clearly demonstrated by the quarter percent interest rate reduction last week which came across as panicky and a knee-jerk reaction to the downturn in the American economy and seemed to fly in the face of their own monetary and inflation targets as well as many speeches by Mr Duisenberg.</p>
<p class="contents">On another matter, I too call on the EU to implement rapidly the suggested liberalisation of the energy, post, airport and railway sectors. I personally also support the single sky initiative. Mr von Wogau was right: Europe will not become a fortress and overall, in spite of all the problems in the world, its prospects look relatively rosy in these uncertain times. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sadly, the broad economic policy guidelines still contain too little in the way of qualitative and quantitative targets that could inspire us to think beyond the narrow confines of tax cuts and spending cuts. I believe that a new debate on the quality of public finances in all Member States, which the Commission has gratifyingly initiated, can enable us to move more freely along the road to a form of investment-led growth that will create employment.</p>
<p class="contents">That is essential too. In my opinion, the broad economic policy guidelines must focus more sharply than hitherto on investment-led growth and on motivating people to enhance their employability. At the moment we are confronted by a certain degree of pessimism in the European Union. I do not believe that a sustained slide towards recession is threatening, but every possible step must be taken to ensure that the recent developments in the United States do not become such a risk to the European economy that the European Union is powerless to contain it.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise that the broad economic policy guidelines, the aims of our economic policy, do not apply to the euro zone alone but to the entire single European market, the home market of the European Union, and that is how it should stay, because what we do not want to let ourselves be split in two but rather to go on growing closer together.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Europe, however, must not slide into another recession for want of initiative, into a slump that destroys what we have achieved, namely the lowest level of unemployment for ten years. Let me therefore re-emphasise that, compared with other regions of the world, we invest too little in research and development and in education and training, and even in the realm of infrastructural investments, which this House has so often commended and demanded, we are still lagging behind. Besides monetary stability and sound budgetary policies, it is also imperative that we find innovative ways of achieving social stability and a stable employment situation. This is what the Lisbon process requires of us.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that we have not seen even more new ideas emerging during the Swedish Presidency of the Council. But I also bitterly regret that we do not have more transparency and democracy. The participation of the European Parliament in the macroeconomic dialogue, in the formulation and adoption of the broad economic policy guidelines and in the preparation of other processes connected with Lisbon and Stockholm is indispensable. If need be, we must use the next intergovernmental conference in 2004 to lend weight to our demands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doyle (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, in discussing the broad economic policy guidelines I am particularly mindful of my own country's run-in with the Commission in recent months, a situation handled badly in my opinion by both the Commission and our own Minister for Finance. As we face a referendum on Nice on 7 June next, popular opinion in Ireland is one of amazement at the response to the economic miracle that has been performed. It has allowed one of the poorest, underdeveloped and most peripheral regions of the EU to catch up and surpass many of the strong economies and, to quote, 'realise our economic and social potential and ensure the welfare of our people' as our Taoiseach said at the time we were voting on whether to join the then EEC or not in 1972. It is not what the Commission did but how it did it that I question: decisions behind closed doors, badly communicated and with no parliamentary input. Please let us learn from that. I know and appreciate why Commissioner Solbes was concerned about what was considered an inflationary budget and at 5.6% this remains a serious concern. But the bald choice was between maintaining our social partnership and some semblance of wage stability through tax cuts at a time of exchequer plenty; and wage stability is the most important part of the Irish stability programme. In a word, in a country that is in a catch-up position, the classic economic model, a one-size-fits-all economic model, is a bad fit.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic forecasting is not an exact science. Nor is it within sole EU control. We are part of a global economy. It is subject also to the forces of nature, to animal and plant diseases. Witness the havoc BSE and foot and mouth disease have caused, even in Ireland where we have had only one case of foot and mouth disease. The successful efforts to ring-fence the disease are forecasted to take over 2% of our growth this year.</p>
<p class="contents">In the matter of economic forecasting I am increasingly concerned about the behaviour of the ECB which appears to be reduced to reading the tea-leaves in the bottom of the cup. Is the ECB part of the problem or the solution? I fully support the recent reduction in interest rates to support growth, but questions have to be raised about the way the ECB decides policy and communicates it to the financial markets. In the context of statements from senior officials in recent weeks, the ECB has left itself open to accusations that it bowed to pressure from the US, or worse panicked, in the face of contradictory economic models.</p>
<p class="contents">The way the recent reduction, only the second since the ECB was established in 1998, was handled, has seriously damaged its credibility. Not for the first time I find myself questioning the competence of senior officials of the ECB, even when I agree with what they are doing. Too much megaphone diplomacy, too little consideration or understanding of the impact on the markets of what they say. Too much post hoc justification of the fact and about-turns in policy. We expect and demand better. Perhaps the recommendation procedure should be directed towards them, Commissioner, or are they subject to any checks and balances? Perhaps we need after all to revisit the debate on vaccination for foot <span class="underline">in</span> mouth policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since 1993, when the broad economic guidelines were initiated, the Commission has always appreciated Parliament’s constant interest in this debate. Parliament has always been fundamental to maintaining the coherence of the Commission’s recommendations, preventing them from being watered down subsequently in the debate in Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I am especially grateful for your contribution to the broad guidelines this year. The resolution is very clear, it is practical, it addresses specific aspects and I feel that there is great harmony between the contents of Parliament’s recommendation and the Commission’s proposal, although, as I will point out later, there are also some differences on certain specific points.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr von Wogau has highlighted, this year’s broad guidelines are the last before the introduction of notes and coins. It is also true, however, as Mrs Randzio-Plath was saying, that the broad economic guidelines do not only involve the euro zone: they involve the whole of the European Union and therefore, although certain factors will result from this change, greater attention is given to the countries which have a special involvement with the euro and clearly the eurogroup’s importance here is fundamental. Nevertheless, the guidelines still apply to the Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">In the presentation of the Commission’s recommendations on the broad guidelines for 2001, I explained what the general approach for the broad economic guidelines for this year were going to be to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Nevertheless, since some of these issues have been raised again in today’s debate, I would like to comment on them once again.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in my opinion the new broad economic guidelines differ from previous ones in one fundamental way, which is that they respond to what we defined at the Lisbon Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we could hold a debate on whether or not certain aspects defined at the Lisbon Summit should be more balanced. For example, Mrs Weiler referred to the social aspects, raising the question of whether or not they are sufficiently addressed. I believe that we are dealing with the social aspects insofar as they must be included within the broad economic policy guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, of course, other European Union documents which deal with social aspects in greater detail, but I do not believe that the broad economic policy guidelines should play the role, for example, of the broad guidelines for employment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the case that this year the new model established at the Lisbon Summit and the debate in the European Council on two questions which are fundamental to the drawing up of the broad economic guidelines have reduced the time available for the creation of this document, and this has also affected the European Parliament. Both Mr von Wogau and the spokesman for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs complained about the lack of time for a more in-depth debate on the various issues. This is true and we will try to overcome these timetabling difficulties as far as possible, but it will be difficult, given the commitments we have taken on, since all of them restrict the time available for the subsequent debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now deal with the fundamental issues. First, however, I would like to make a quick comment about the coordination of economic policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mrs Berès have both referred to this, and so have certain other speakers, especially Mrs Doyle. We believe that the coordination of economic policies must fundamentally be carried out by means of the broad economic policy guidelines and the key document for coordination. It is true that this document must take account of the Stability Pact, but in no way can this be considered to be the only factor that can ensure that the coordination of economic policy moves ahead correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the importance of the document we are discussing today.</p>
<p class="contents">We must include every factor in the broad guidelines. It is true that the broad economic policy guidelines and coordination will be discussed – coordination will be discussed subsequently in greater depth – and that will give us further opportunities for future corrections. Nevertheless, I would like to stress a point which has led to certain comments from Mrs Berès and Mrs Doyle on the specific problem of Ireland. Firstly, to talk of sanctions in the Irish case – although I realise that the media finds this kind of language attractive – does not correspond to the reality of the situation. The Council, not the Commission, has adopted a decision on a specific recommendation because of incoherence between the accepted budgetary policy and the budgetary policy implemented by a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The von Wogau report refers to the consideration of the greater or lesser degree of control which a country that is part of the Monetary Union enjoys over the measures it adopts. I believe that an option such as this poses clear risks. Of course, if only the large countries are obliged to comply with the broad economic policy guidelines, then, in the end, our model would become highly contradictory. The very nature of the European model is that all countries, large and small, have the same rights and obligations, and I believe that we have to remain coherent on this general principle.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the major challenges, our commitment and approach in this case have been clear. We refer to three types of option: firstly, in the short term, to maintain economic expansion; in the medium term, to increase the potential for growth, and, in the long term, to deal with ageing. I will comment briefly on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to economic expansion, our forecasts are possibly more optimistic than those of others. We are well aware of the reality of the situation in Europe and we believe that the solidity of developments in internal demand enables us to be relatively optimistic. This does not mean that we are not concerned to see the uncertainties arising in other economies and certain recent figures – which you have referred to – relating to the United States economy. These figures must clearly be borne in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, our starting point was a V-shaped recovery of the United States economy<span class="bold"> </span>and we hope that that situation will be reached.</p>
<p class="contents">The overriding issue is whether the European economic situation, affected by the external situation, can justify a change in the economic policies we have been applying until now. The Commission believes that it cannot.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the ongoing high growth that we will be seeing in Europe means that we can continue to opt for the fundamental idea of moving ahead with the consolidation of public deficits and the reduction of public debt. I do not agree either with those people who suggest that these factors will not have positive effects in terms of employment: we only have to look at changes in employment in the European Union over recent years to see that this policy has achieved good results, as has a wage policy coherent with growth and inflation over these years. I believe that we have made considerable progress in reducing unemployment in the last two years and we must continue in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to our medium-term objective, increasing growth potential, there is no doubt that what we all want, at the end of the day, is to achieve the best results for economic growth in terms of employment and in terms of growth. We also believe, of course, that in this respect it is essential to improve the working capacity and level of activity of our populations, but, to this end, it is imperative that we make progress on structural reforms, both of the markets and of the labour system.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not, of course, forgotten something that some of you have mentioned, which is the transition to a knowledge economy and the fundamental need to invest in research and development, both in new technologies and in the public sector. The Commission’s position has always been very clear on this point. We believe that investment in the public sector is adequate and coherent, but it must be compatible with our general budgetary obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to refer specifically to the need to pay greater attention to sustainable development and specifically, to the environment. This year’s broad guidelines contain a specific reference to this point and there is no doubt that next year, after the Gothenburg Summit, we will include additional elements in relation to it.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the final part of the broad economic guidelines, referring to long-term commitments, the Commission still believes that the problem of the ageing population is a key issue which ultimately affects the circumstances of the various Member States in terms of debt and is, therefore, something that we must consider.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that the problem cannot be resolved simply by reducing public debt and this is a positive step. We believe that we have to do more, both in relation to pension systems and in relation to increasing the level of activity in the various countries. In our opinion, of course, this is not a problem for year-by-year broad guidelines, but rather a medium- and long-term problem. We must also make a specific reference to this issue, however, in the various annual presentations.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the points that I wanted to mention today. I would like to thank Parliament and Mr von Wogau for your contribution and I hope that the final result of the broad economic guidelines will be what we all want: greater growth in Europe, greater sustained growth, and furthermore a form of growth that is achieved by means of a plan for the coordination of economic policies, which, of course, respects the capacity for national responsibility of each of us, in accordance with the Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
