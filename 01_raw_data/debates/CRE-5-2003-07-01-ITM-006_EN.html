<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I am delighted to be able to announce to you that, earlier today, the Commission adopted a communication on the G10 Medicines initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">For those of you who are not familiar with G10, I would like to briefly explain the background to this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years there has been growing evidence that the European-based pharmaceutical industry was losing competitiveness compared with its American-based counterparts. This is not only serious for our economy but of vital importance to public health and, especially, European patients. Millions of Europeans use medicines everyday.</p>
<p class="contents">Achieving real and long-lasting benefits to patients is a key objective of pharmaceutical policy. We must support Member States to make authorised medicines, especially the newer and more innovative ones, available and affordable to all those who need them as quickly as possible. However, some of the statistics concerning the industry make difficult reading; those pertaining to research and development, for example: critical to our industry, to our science base and to our patients.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1990 Europe was the world leader in pharmaceutical research and development and innovation. Now the US has overtaken Europe in the discovery of new chemical or biological entities. This has not happened by chance. Since 1990, research and development expenditure in the US has grown at a dramatic rate. Between 1990 and 2000, research and development expenditure grew at twice the rate in the US compared with Europe. By 1997 America had overtaken Europe in terms of total research and development expenditure. G10 medicines were born out of this background.</p>
<p class="contents">In recognition of the critical role the industry plays in both the industrial and health sectors, Commissioner Byrne and I established the High Level Group on Innovation and the Provision of Medicines – G10 Medicines. It is a small Group of high-level representatives from Member States, industry, mutual health funds and patients.</p>
<p class="contents">The group was given the challenging remit of reaching consensus on ways of improving the competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry in the context of achieving social and public health objectives. To many people’s surprise, the group was able to report back in May last year, with 14 wide-ranging recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">In the communication adopted today we set out how we plan to take these recommendations forward. There are five broad themes we pursue in the communication which we intend to take forward in parallel.</p>
<p class="contents">Benefits to patients are at the heart of G10. We will look at ways of improving patient information on medicines, strengthening the role of patients in public health decision-making and so forth. I am sure that in that area my colleague Mr Byrne will say more.</p>
<p class="contents">Developing a competitive European-based industry takes us back to the origins of G10. We examine ways of improving access to innovative medicines and the need to speed up national negotiations on reimbursement and pricing, greater price competition for medicines that are not part of the state sector and measures to develop competitive generic and non-prescription markets.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to strengthening the EU Science Base: if we fail to support innovation we will pay a heavy economic, social and public health price. We look at ways we can develop incentives for research, including the use of virtual institutes for health to stimulate and organise health and biotechnology research and development. We also link in to the many initiatives under the Commission’s existing Sixth Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As for medicines in an enlarged Union, with the forthcoming enlargement the Union is facing one of its greatest challenges and opportunities. We look at ways of meeting the challenge through providing a level playing field for intellectual property protection and providing support for the new Member States to implement the new legislative framework.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Member States learning from each other, benchmarking will provide a practical mechanism for monitoring the implementation of the recommendations, as well as providing a forum for Member States to share best practice.</p>
<p class="contents">So, what is the driving force for implementing the proposals in the communication? The main driving force will be the pharmaceutical review supported by the Life Sciences and Biotechnology Action Plan and the Public Health Programme. You will be well aware of these, and the Pharmaceutical Review will obviously have its second reading in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the unique aspect of G10 is the vehicle it provided to look at areas of national competence that have an impact on competitiveness and public health. There is only so much we can achieve at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">In the communication we set out areas where we believe that a European reflection could benefit Member States as well as helping to achieve our G10 goals. In particular, we propose an examination of national pricing and reimbursement systems. Although this is clearly within the competence of Member States we believe that the injection of more market measures, while ensuring national safeguards to control expenditure on pharmaceuticals, could bring benefits to patients and the industry in terms of quicker access to the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, I believe the communication, together with the other initiatives I have mentioned, provides a framework for turning around the competitiveness of our pharmaceutical industry while reinforcing European public health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This rebalancing of policy-making between legitimate industrial innovation and health needs is an important step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">You have previously heard me say here that our health is our wealth. The development of rising public health standards, the extension of disease-free life-years and the increase in life expectancy are shaping features of modern economic development, and pharmaceutical innovation has played a significant role in all of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, from a patient point of view, innovation has yielded dramatic improvements in the dignity and quality of life of patients in recent decades. Now patients are taking a more active role in seeking out information and products.</p>
<p class="contents">But at a point where health expenditure is rising, the population is ageing and patients' expectations are increasing, we need to have a strategic vision of how to move forward in this complex field.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of interlinked issues here. For patients, there is a desire to have more effective, more humane products, brought to market more quickly. There is a desire to have better information on the comparative advantages of products and early warning of adverse reactions. For patients, the availability of clear and authoritative information from the leaflet inside the package, to online at the level of a European health portal, is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">For those who finance the health system, there is a need for sustainable budgeting, affordable medicines, manageable demand and responsible behaviour from patients, prescribers and producers alike.</p>
<p class="contents">From a public health point of view there is a need to ensure that medicines maintain high quality and safety standards and that adverse reactions are quickly identified and tackled. There is a need to work towards more rational prescribing and consumption patterns, to ensure that we can tackle anti-microbial resistance.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition there is a need to ensure that research develops products which tackle health requirements as distinct from lifestyle issues. For example, more must be done to develop products that tackle rare diseases and childhood illnesses. And, in an ageing society, medicines will play an important role in ensuring active and healthy ageing – with all its attendant economic and human benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">For the industries involved, there are a range of specific issues which are being presented to you today. But we need to be aware that an increasingly global industry is less likely to prioritise investment in research for the treatments which Europeans will need in 10-20 years' time if they are dealing with a fragmented and unpredictable market. In other words, whilst there will be no shortage of sure-fire lifestyle wonder drugs like Viagra, how can we be sure that the medicines needed to tackle arthritis, Alzheimer's and obesity, to name but a few, will be developed?</p>
<p class="contents">It is only by moving towards a more predictable market environment across Europe that we will be in a position to convince industry to take the needs of Europeans seriously in the years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">The High Level Committee on Health has stated that the public health goal of pharmaceuticals policy is 'to make readily accessible, efficacious, high quality and safe medicines, including their most recent innovative ones, to all those who need them, regardless of income or social status'.</p>
<p class="contents">Each of these issues has been addressed in this communication. We have effectively highlighted patients' needs for better information and their need for a stronger voice to influence policy. Efforts in both these areas will support their growing role as important decision-makers for health care. The establishment of an EU-funded European Patients' Platform in February this year is an important step.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also targeted the medicines themselves, to build up systems that ensure their safety, quality and efficacy. Here the G10 put the need for stronger systems of pharmacovigilance and relative effectiveness firmly on the agenda. In this way we aim to improve the rational use of medicines. This is a public health goal that underpins our vision for the pharmaceuticals sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Relative effectiveness is a very important issue for the European Union. In June 2000 the Council underlined the importance of added therapeutic value both in terms of health protection and from an industrial policy perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Effective medicines must get quickly to the people who need them. This means identifying which medicines are genuinely effective, not just in the controlled environment of a clinical trial, but in general use amongst the wider population. This is the critical issue at stake here.</p>
<p class="contents">Relative effectiveness is one key tool towards rational use. But, clearly, we have to consider the role of other actors too. How can we improve rational use of pharmaceuticals at the level of the health care prescriber and the consumer?</p>
<p class="contents">A parallel question might be: how can we know if we have improved the rational use of pharmaceuticals? This brings me to the issue of benchmarking. The recommendation to develop indicators for public health has set us a big challenge. For example, to investigate indicators that could monitor what is happening at the health-care prescriber level. Ultimately, the intention is to have a set of indicators that can shed light on what is happening in the pharmaceuticals sector of Member States in terms of the extent to which public health needs are being met and in this way to inform policy development at national and European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the discussion on enlargement is particularly timely. The accession treaties have been signed. Although enlargement is one specific recommendation of the G10, clearly our responses to each recommendation need to adequately reflect the changing environment within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The G10 is a first important step to developing a strategic vision of the future health needs of Europeans which is affordable, effective, transparent, inclusive and safe. Properly pursued it will be good for the health of all concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have just one question for the Commissioners. Do you not think that there is a certain contradiction inherent in the recommendations? If you are in favour of more incentives for research in order to get better medicines to the patients more quickly, and if all the G10 countries have said so too, then why does it appear from the policy agreement on the pharmaceuticals package as if the provision being made for data protection, as regards the creation of a return on innovations, is insufficiently long-term, so that research is not being driven forward? Do you not also think that the safest and best way of providing patients quickly with better medicines would, in principle, be a fast and simple central procedure, and that it would be better if the Commission and the Member States were to hand out more money for research projects and at last get round to submitting the new legislation on children’s medicines to Parliament? That would enable us to do something more quickly about getting people better medicines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As I said, it is now important to get the review through.

These practices are all the more scandalous because the pharmaceuticals industry is one of the most profitable of all. The sole concern of this industry is the financial well-being of its shareholders.</p>
<p class="contents">Before bringing out a new medicine, the major companies first undertake marketing studies, which determine whether research in the field is continued or stopped. This means that companies are only interested in illnesses that generate money. Too bad if a growing number of men and women find it harder and harder to look after themselves; too bad if in Africa and elsewhere, children are still dying in this day and age of easily curable diseases such as measles, and too bad for those people suffering from malaria or other diseases that affect the populations of poor countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The only decision that could satisfy both the employees of these companies and patients – in rich countries and in the developing world – would be for this industry no longer to be a private industry in which only the interests of a minority count, and for it to be placed under the control of the people, for the benefit of everyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s answers to these questions, let us remember, were not what the European Parliament had hoped to hear.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, I have the impression today that the Council has reintroduced a number of items, such as the five-year renewal, marketing authorisations, the centralised procedure and stopping direct advertising to patients.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this leads me to ask you whether your communication will accept a good number of the amendments to pharmaceutical legislation that Parliament has adopted by a large majority, particularly in the fields of direct advertising, consumer participation in the EMEA, centralised procedure and modifying marketing authorisation dossiers, as real proof of your concern to protect consumers and patients? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We now we propose that it be applied for all active substances and Parliament supported this.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the Council has reached a political agreement which goes in the same direction, but in a rather narrower fashion. It will limit the application of the centralised procedure to four illnesses, but within the legislation, in the Council's opinion, there should be a particular Article which would allow for the enlargement of the scope of the centralised procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding information for patients in that area, discussions continue but it seems to be that the majority in the Council and the majority in Parliament are not so far from each other. This is not the same as the Commission's position, but I respect the outcome of the legislative procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has never proposed direct-to-consumer advertising. It only supports the provision of controlled information for patients, patient groups and so on. Anyone who today has access to the Internet sees a massive amount of direct spam advertising on medicines, which is growing every day. It would be better for consumers if they knew which websites were trustworthy, where there is scrutiny by the authorities or whether they could trust the quality of the information. On that issue, it seems that Parliament and Council are on the same wavelength in being very prudent on the issue of information for patients. We will of course return to this in second reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as efficiency factors are concerned, our position is that authorisation should be science-based but of course, once the authorities of the Member States decide which medicines they reimburse by public funds, they can reinforce that by different studies of their efficiency and that is supported also by G10. In that area G10 is proposing, and the Commission is supporting that proposal, that more exchanges of information on best practice and these kinds of efficiency studies could be undertaken in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the second question, of course it is very much in the hands of Member States. There is very different legislation in Member States, whereby patients are being directed to use different solutions, either only the product which traditionally has been under patent or at the same time generics, when generics are inside the market. On the European level perhaps the emphasis is not there; it should be more on the national level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You were both right in saying that the patient must be placed at the centre of the debate, but the question is, of course, who that patient is.

<p class="contents">Secondly, the question is that if that is not enough to provide an incentive for research work, the question of public research funding can be raised. I am sorry that Mr Busquin, the Commissioner for Research, is not here. I am sure he would be in a position to provide a more detailed reply to that.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there are the issues of the needs of developing countries, which are based on the low level of income and lower purchasing power of the citizens. In that area, there has been some progress in recent years. The issue is still being discussed in the WTO context on the one hand. On the other, there have been schemes which have allowed developing countries to purchase certain medicines at a lower price than in Europe.

Do you also have information about whether States have agreed to this programme and consequently whether public funds are being harnessed?

That is why Commissioner Liikanen’s observation left me troubled, more troubled than I already was. So I would ask him this: might the legislative framework under development in Europe and the inflexible system of research regulations in the field of biotechnology, for example, not constitute a major obstacle to European industry’s acquiring or recovering competitiveness? I know that this is not what many of my fellow Members wish to hear, who, for philosophical or ideological reasons, are imposing a virtual veto on biotech development, but I felt obliged to put this question to you, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Public research is very important but it is very clear that, even in the EU, objectives of devoting 3% of GDP to research by 2010 is based on the concept that 1% of GDP would come from public sources, 2% of GDP would come from the private sector. Whatever happens in public spending, we never will have enough resources to achieve 3%. For that reason, the regulatory framework has to be judged so that intellectual property rights are protected in such a way that private money will go to the sector. Whether you like it or not, that is very simple, clear economic logic.</p>
<p class="contents">On biotechnology, I am sure you are at least partly right. In the Commission we have accepted the biotechnology action plan, which we follow in a strict way. In general in the field of so-called 'red biotechnology', which is connected to pharmaceutical industries, perhaps the situation is slightly better. When you go to the other branches of biotechnological research we have a lot of work to do. Today my colleagues Mr Byrne and Mrs Wallström talked about the GMO area. There are also other issues in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to lead in the field of pharmaceutical research we cannot separate different chapters of biotechnological research. We need intellectual property rights, we need sufficient financing. We also need public opinion that supports novelties and innovation in the market. At the end of the day that is always critical. No research can have financing unless there is a market. There is no market unless consumers have confidence in the products that come out of research and manufacturing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
