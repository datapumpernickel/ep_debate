<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock, Neil,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, since this is a joint debate, the bad news is that I shall have to speak at some length, but the good news is I will be as quick as I possibly can whilst not avoiding responding to the detailed issues that have been raised by honourable Members in their activities, which I know reflect the hard and intensive work they have been doing.</p>
<p class="contents">As this House knows, the three European institutions worked together to secure a new Financial Regulation in 2002 that will come into effect on 1 January 2003. The regulation provides <span class="bold"></span> inter alia <span class="bold"></span> a clear framework for subsidies through which we support a large number of European organisations in the dialogue with European citizens, and it also stipulates that each financial decision should have a legal basis to ensure its justification.</p>
<p class="contents">That requirement is particularly relevant for those subsidies which have been financed from lines whose position in the budgetary structure <span class="bold"></span> the so-called A-part of the budget <span class="bold"></span> meant that they could be assimilated into administrative expenditure and consequently be incurred without a clear legal basis. The modification of the budgetary structure introduced in the new Financial Regulation has brought to an end this assimilation of administrative expenditure, meaning that a legal basis for the subsidies in question is now required.</p>
<p class="contents">It is this new obligation which led the Commission in May 2003 to present seven proposals for new legal bases. These were accompanied by a communication from Mrs Schreyer, which underlined the common context and presented identical solutions for common problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes this report by Mr Sacrédeus and appreciates the priority which the drafters and Parliament have given to dealing with the Commission’s proposal. With Parliament’s opinion it should now be possible to have the decision in force in 2004 and following a call for proposals, to go ahead with the selection of beneficiaries for operating grants for next year. The goal agreed between Parliament and Council during the conciliation of 16 July was the entry into force, by 2004, of the legal bases for grants which did not have that coverage.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal base presented today, together with the six other proposals covering grants, is important because it is a direct consequence of the innovations concerning grants in the new Financial Regulation and is firmly anchored in the basic principles of transparency and equal treatment for potential beneficiaries. Most of the amendments proposed in Parliament's resolution are acceptable to the Commission and in keeping with the spirit of the Commission’s proposal. However, the Commission thinks it appropriate to limit the amount of the grant to 70% of the eligible costs and not 80%. Similarly, the Commission is of the view that a digressivity rate of 10% per year is preferable to 2.5%. Our view is that both of these requirements are safeguards which will go some way to ensuring sustainability and encouraging beneficiaries to be active in seeking alternative and complementary revenue streams.</p>
<p class="contents">One point which should be mentioned is the need to ensure coherence between the proposed Council decision and the budget. In the Preliminary Draft Budget the Commission proposed one budget line to regroup amounts which, in the 2003 budget, are distributed over four lines in Chapter A 30.</p>
<p class="contents">The future legal base for this single line, as required by the new Financial Regulation, is the proposed decision which is before the House today. This decision provides for the selection of beneficiaries following a call for proposals in accordance with the principles of transparency and equal treatment. At first reading, Parliament replaced the single line with five lines. The title of each line is the name of an Institute. There is a clear incompatibility between the future legal base and the division of the budget line in this manner. The Commission hopes that the adopted budget will correspond to the PDB proposal, so permitting us to execute the proposal and appropriations in full compliance with European Law as defined by the new Financial Regulation adopted by this House and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the report by Mrs Rühle on the proposal for an action programme to promote civic participation. I am grateful to Mrs Rühle for having acknowledged the urgency of this matter and for having ensured speedy adoption by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. This has been immensely helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal before the House seeks to ensure harmonious transition from the old system to the new arrangements and continuity in the activities being supported. We have endeavoured to produce a text which, to a large extent, extends the 2003 implementation procedures while incorporating the requirements of the new Financial Regulation in terms of sound financial management of public funds.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a legal basis should therefore be considered a technical adjustment. There is, nevertheless, a great and understandable temptation to grasp the opportunity to add innovations and suggest improvements. Parliament, as ever, is immensely helpful with this creativity. This may, however, be risky <span class="bold"></span> particularly if such additions compromise the subsequent adoption of the proposal by the Council. The Commission's proposal has therefore been formulated in what we consider to be a measured way, with the essential objective of continuing what has already been accomplished and by providing a legal structure which is consistent with the new Financial Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would consequently invite honourable Members not to distance themselves too much from the Commission's proposals and to do their utmost to ensure that this legal basis is adopted as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in the case of the legal basis for active civic participation, the margin for manoeuvre is even more limited because unanimity is required in Council.</p>
<p class="contents">All avenues for compromise must be explored if we are to succeed in completing this procedure as speedily as possible. In fact, as from 1 January 2004, in the absence of this legal basis, it would quite simply not be possible for us to provide financial support to all the organisations which participate actively in the promotion of European citizenship. We would greatly regret that, and doubtless Parliament would too.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now outline the position of the Commission on the amendments contained in Mrs Rühle's report. The Commission can accept in full Amendments 1, 4, 7, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 13 and 31, which provide useful clarifications to the text. While recalling the need to apply the new Financial Regulation, the Commission sees no objection to Amendment 45 on the simplification of administrative procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that the Commission will impose an obligation on those who have received a European subsidy to provide adequate publicity. While entirely agreeing with Parliament on this point, as outlined in Amendment 48, we feel that it would be more appropriate to list this obligation in the conventions to be signed with the beneficiaries. The same holds true for Amendment 49 on the dissemination and availability of results. The Commission agrees with Amendment 47, which underlines the need for regular exchanges of views with the beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can partly accept Amendment 25. Since the amendment does not alter the substance of the Commission proposal, we can accept the proposal to specify that the budgetary appropriations scheduled after 2006 are subject to an agreement of the budgetary authority on the financial perspective beyond 2006. However, the Commission is willing to accept the same duration for all seven proposals in the package until 2006 if that helps to find a compromise for all the proposals with a view to having them adopted in time for implementing the budget in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">As this proposal has to be seen in conjunction with the other proposals in the package, the amendments on 'earmarking' and the possibility of an executive agency also have to be settled in the broader context.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept, in the same amendment, a reference to the total amount allocated to the programme since this is not consistent with the legislative procedures provided for in the consultation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can also partially accept Amendment 28. We have no objections to sending reports on implementation of the programme, but we cannot accept transferring the content of the Annex to Article 8a, which would not be in line with the usual format of legal texts. The same applies to Amendments 20, 21, 22, 29 and 30, which the Commission rejects.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission understands the view of Parliament on the matter of focusing on potential enlargement of the scope and objectives of this proposal. However, it is our intention to guarantee the continuity of the activities already supported by the Commission in the past, so we have to refuse Amendments 14, 40, 41, 42 and 43, with a view to reaching a unanimous position on our proposal in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 6 and 33, concerning the European Movement, are rejected as well as Amendments 32, 34, 35, 36 and 37, which add new organisations to the list of beneficiaries. With a view to ensuring the continuity of funding currently allocated, the Commission does not consider it appropriate to open a discussion on the list of organisations contained in Part 1.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the Financial Regulation, we intend to launch a call for proposals which will be open to all organisations active in this area. However, to facilitate the transition from the system of 'earmarking' to the system of calls for proposals, and taking into account the time left before the programme enters into force, we consider it more appropriate to apply the model of earmarking for 2004, and to publish an open call for proposals as from 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">This would be a reasonable compromise since it would be technically impossible, under the procedures laid down in the Financial Regulation, to launch a call for proposals after the adoption of this legal base which would still allow for financing as from the beginning of 2004. As a consequence, the Commission can, in principal, accept the application of a system of 'earmarking'. We consider, however, that this approach should be restricted to 2004 and the operating rules should be laid down in the Annex rather than in the text of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, for technical reasons, the Commission cannot accept that part of Amendment 23 relating to Group 1.</p>
<p class="contents">The part of the amendment relating to Group 2 and aiming at the incorporation of organisations having a different perspective of the policies of the Union is considered quite superfluous, and therefore cannot be accepted. The last part of the amendment is not in line with the usual format of legal texts and is also rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">On the possible involvement of an executive agency for the management of part of the programme, particularly in relation to management of the large number of projects in the town-twinning part of the programme, the Commission emphasises that such an approach conforms to Article 55 of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the Commission envisages the setting-up of such an executive agency in the area of education and culture. Subject to the conclusions of a cost-benefit study currently under preparation by an external consultant, the Commission could propose that such an agency should be partly involved in the management of this programme. Before reaching a final decision, the Commission will submit this proposal to the Executive Agency Committee of the Council. The Commission is therefore not in a position at this juncture to accept Amendment 46.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission rejects Amendments 2, 8, 10, 17, 19, 24 and 50, which are considered superfluous because the issues are already sufficiently detailed in the existing text or covered by other texts. The reference to full employment in Amendment 3 is rejected because it is deemed to be over-ambitious. Amendment 5 which refers to the draft Constitution is premature since it may still be modified.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider that the proposal to carry out regular evaluations of the organisations listed in part 1 referred to in Amendment 38 would be far too cumbersome to enact since these organisations are listed as recipients for the whole duration of the programme. A modification of the list would therefore require a new Council decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 39 is unacceptable because it goes against the very essence of the action programme which aims to foster European networks. Amendment 40 concerning the media is also rejected because it may jeopardise applications from grass-roots organisations</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission rejects Amendment 44 which represents unacceptable interference with the Commission's implementation powers. The information of national parliaments, as suggested in Amendment 27, is not appropriate and the Commission considers that any evaluation of the programme should be based on a two-year reference period and therefore rejects Amendment 26.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 51, which was tabled after the adoption of Mrs Rühle’s report in committee, is unacceptable to the Commission since it cannot guarantee the implementation of programmes before the legal basis is adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, on this particular response, of the 51 amendments tabled by Parliament, the Commission accepts 14 in full, partially accepts 2 and rejects 35.</p>
<p class="contents">I invite the House to do everything possible to ensure that the support provided by the European Union to the creation of a European citizenship is not derailed. If the system is to be put back on track at the beginning of 2004, an agreement at this stage in the procedure will be decisive as I know honourable Members fully understand.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful for the attention of the House. I have one short set of further points to make before I conclude. This relates to the decision of Parliament and Council establishing a Community programme to promote organisations active at EU level in the field of equality between women and men.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities for their work and achievements on this dossier, which have been considerable in all respects.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that progress has already been made in Council and in Parliament on this basic act which is designed to provide a legal base for continuing funding support for organisations active at EU level in promoting gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome most of the 20 amendments in Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou's report adopted on 3 November 2003 by the Committee on Women's Rights, because they add precision and clarity to this basic act. However, the Commission is not in favour of some amendments relating to aspects of the duration of the programme and its evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposed a duration of two years <span class="bold"></span> 2004 and 2005 <span class="bold"></span> because it will include this topic in the overall reflections on the future of the equality strategy after 2005. The Commission cannot, therefore, agree with the extension of the duration of the programme until 2008 as proposed in Amendment 8. As a consequence, the Commission does not accept Amendments 6 and 7 on degressivity, Amendment 9 on increase in the financial framework, or Amendment 10 on budgetary authority agreement post-2006.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the evaluation of the programme by the Commission is concerned, the Financial Regulation provides the solid framework that is necessary. Amendment 11, which suggests that this evaluation should be based on an external report, is therefore unnecessary and seems disproportionate to the small amounts involved in this programme and its duration.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment 19 because it considers it better to keep the themes general rather than specific.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 20 because it would impinge on the Commission's role in executing the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of this basic act in a short timeframe is very important in order not to disrupt the Community's financial support for those organisations, and notably the European Women's Lobby.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, the Commission can accept Amendments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 and it rejects Amendments 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19 and 20 for the reasons I have given.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to the House for the patience extended to me in making a rather long contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is why dialogue between civilisations and cultures must be strengthened. Following the entry into force of the new Financial Regulation, a basic act or new legal basis is required for actions covered by subsidies from former chapter A-30 of the budget and by subsidies provided under certain B lines. In this context, the Commission has therefore presented a total of seven proposals establishing new action programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">A dialogue between cultures and civilisations is, now more than ever, of crucial importance when it comes to guaranteeing peace and stability in the world. That is the special contribution and addition that I, in my capacity as rapporteur, wanted to make to the report on establishing a Community action programme for bodies promoting reciprocal understanding of relations between the European Union and certain non-industrialised regions in the world, a report adopted unanimously by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on 4 November 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The centre, institute or network specialising in the analysis of relations between the European Union and certain regions helps promote dialogue between cultures and civilisations. It is a dialogue that is fundamental and absolutely crucial on this earth and in this world that it is our common responsibility to manage and care for. Dialogue between cultures and civilisations must promote the generally applicable and universal value of human freedoms and rights and the defence of human dignity. The view of human beings upon which the European Union is ultimately based means that every person is of equal, unique and inviolable value. This common basis of values we possess and this shared view of human beings must also operate as a guarantee of respect for different cultures and civilisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The general objective of this programme shall be to support the activities of these bodies. According to the Commission’s proposal, the activities should consist of those in keeping with the annual work programme of a centre, institute or network. The activities supported must contribute to increasing understanding and dialogue between the European Union, the regions covered by the ALA, MEDA, TACIS and CARDS Regulations and the candidate countries. Here too, we in the European Parliament wish to add words to the effect that the activities must also – and I emphasise this – contribute to reinforcing social, cultural and human partnership and meeting places.</p>
<p class="contents">We also wish to extend the duration of the programme to 31 December 2008. Publication of the Commission’s evaluation report is accordingly to be moved forward to 31 December 2007, and the appropriations after the year 2006 are subject to an agreement of the budgetary authority on the financial perspective beyond 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve the objective of strengthening reciprocal knowledge and understanding, the bodies entitled to subsidies must be deeply acquainted with the cultural, historical, socio-economic and religious characteristics of the regions concerned. That is something I wanted to emphasise in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">These activities should contribute both to political cooperation and to developing genuine partnership between people. The EU is now already providing financial and technical aid to other parts of the world. In the Council of Ministers, the governments of the Member States said that they attach great importance to these activities and expressed their desire to increase reciprocal knowledge on the part of the EU and partners receiving assistance, as well as to find a legal basis within the EU for doing this.</p>
<p class="contents">The dialogue and the aid must be supported by bodies and organisations specialising in relations between the EU and the regions concerned. Examples of the activities of such bodies are studies and analyses of EU policy, together with seminars, round-table discussions and publications. Now already, there is a spectrum of bodies and associations engaging in regional cooperation and dialogue. It is therefore becoming more and more important to ensure that these activities are coordinated so as to prevent duplication of effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Life and the world do not end at the external borders of the Member States or the European Union. That is why dialogue between civilisations and cultures must be strengthened. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rühle (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the good cooperation over the recent weeks; I would particularly like to thank the secretariat of our Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs for their support, without which my report could not have been processed on time. As the Commissioner has already mentioned, we are working to a very tight timetable, as the continued funding of many European institutions, and the support for non-governmental organisations, associations, trade unions and educational institutions in the next financial year cannot be secured without passing a legal act.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the introduction of activity-based budgeting in accordance with the new Financial Regulation, these institutions need a legal basis. Although these institutions’ payments were previously covered by the A 30 line, these can, in future, no longer be made from the administrative part of the Commission’s budget. A legal basis is needed to ensure that the payments can be made. Such is the purely technical background to my report, and I do of course fully agree with the Commission that adaptation is an important primary concern. I am obliged to the Commissioner for his wide-ranging appreciation of my report, but I nevertheless want to contradict him on one point. We take the view that technical adaptation would not go far enough. The European Union has great challenges ahead of it, the first being the enlargement on 1 May 2004, and the poor turnout in the accession countries’ referendums has reinforced my view that more initiatives are needed if we are to press on with European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The second challenge is the debate on the new constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which also presents us with new challenges, and, last but not least, there is the harmonisation of the European legal area, in relation to which I will just mention the debate about the European Arrest Warrant. My aim has therefore been to help reduce the democratic deficit and develop a coherent picture of the concept of European citizenship and civic participation, and this has also been the overall motif of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">So I particularly regret the fact that the Commission has not mentioned, and will not endorse, my Amendment 35, since I believe it to be very necessary that we should start to cooperate better with the Council of Europe’s Venice Commission, which brings structure to constitutional case law. There is an urgent need for the database to be expanded in order to give us better access to case law in European constitutional law. I also think it very important to support the ‘Agora’ website, thereby developing a virtual forum in which legislators at national and European level can consult each other. The same is true of the network for the training and further education of judges and public prosecutors. If we are to talk in terms of a European arrest warrant, then judges and public prosecutors urgently need more knowledge of European lawmaking. Right across Europe, we need better interaction between judges and public prosecutors.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Commission’s report is the ambitious essay that I would expect it to be, I also note deficiencies in the way it is set out. These led us to pay close attention to the simplification of procedures, to the reduction of red tape, and to customer-friendly access to European support grants. One proposal, therefore, envisages access as a two-stage procedure, which would mean that the purely formal aspects would be scrutinised first, followed at the second stage by examination of the content. That would simplify the examination overall and make for speedier decisions for the non-governmental organisations in question.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want more transparency in the way Europe provides support. If a non-governmental organisation is in receipt of grants from Europe, it should also make that clear. Public access to the results of the work must also be ensured. For my final point, I would now like to turn to the question of earmarking, which has been a cause of great controversy in this House. In the first draft of my report I argued in favour of doing away with earmarking, but was obliged to take note of the fact that Parliament took a different view. I have come to share the view of many Members that we have to have a serious dialogue with the Commission, and that this will happen after 2004. Although I welcome the offer to continue earmarking after 2004, how, then – to take one example – is the call for proposals in relation to the Info-Points and in other areas to be implemented in 2005?</p>
<p class="contents">We can see a lot of question marks hanging over this, and I would like to have a dialogue with the Commission about it. This has led me to refrain from withdrawing the amendment, which I would prefer us to vote on today. I also think there has to be some fundamental rethinking of the issue of the executive agency and its objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thus, for us, the objective of the present programme must be the facility for the European Women's Lobby to continue its work and, at the same time, the facility for other women's organisations to function and develop integrated activities within the general framework of equality between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are calling in our amendments for funding to be directed not at special actions which cannot guarantee the permanence or standard of the programmes or the viability of organisations, but at funding operations, as is the case with the European Women's Lobby. Besides, we should not forget that special, specific actions, as proposed in the Commission draft, can be funded under other programmes or within the framework of Community policies with the annual priorities – equal pay, reconciling work and family life, participation in decision-making, changing stereotypes – every year there is this facility for women's organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the period of application of the programme is concerned, I share your opinion, Commissioner, that it should apply until 2006, precisely because we cannot forecast requirements as of now, especially once the new countries join. Besides, it is a pilot programme and we need to see how it progresses. We can continue to extend it after the evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the application of the gradual 2.5% reduction after three years in application of the programme, I really cannot understand the logic of the rapporteurs who proposed this amendment. The European Commission expressly exempts all women's organisations in this programme from any such gradual reduction on the basis of the provisions of the Financial Regulation. Why should we apply it, especially to women's organisations other than the European Women's Lobby? Especially at a time when the European Women's Lobby has other priorities within the framework of funding. It is discriminatory treatment of the organisations which does not even stand up on the basis of the Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">We also consider the proposal adopted by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities to differentiate the percentage of funding for women's organisations to be discriminatory treatment. We cannot ask for 90% cofinancing for one organisation, such as the Lobby, which has preferential treatment, as I have said, such as funding for operations without submitting invitations for expressions of interest, and to ask for 80% from other organisations which do not have permanent funding and are selected following invitations for expressions of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards our amendments to do with transferring the European Women's Lobby from the articles to the Annex, this is for technical reasons at the Council's suggestion, precisely because we believe that we need to try to achieve a uniform format for all Community programmes which fund action by non-governmental organisations. And the precise aim of our amendments is to bring us closer to a final agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We are trying, Commissioner, with our amendments, to keep to Community standards, precisely in order to speed up the immediate application of the programme, a programme which, however, does not limit the action of women's organisations to specific areas or specific groups or direct it to specific philosophies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, society is developing. Standards are changing, women's aspirations are constantly becoming richer and broader. It is up to us to show that we are able to administer this variety and give our society and, more importantly, the job of women, the opportunity to express its pluralism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are all aimed at providing a legal basis for the various subsidies in the former lines known as A-30, and on Monday 24 November we will hold a conciliation meeting with the Council, in which we will try to reach a consensus which allows us to approve all of these proposals before the end of this year, so that they may be executed in 2004. In fact, the most serious problem we are facing now is ensuring that the appropriations intended for these subsidies can be executed during next year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore address the European Commission, which, in its communication to the Council and European Parliament, when commenting on the proposals, spoke of transitional measures in the event that the basic instruments are not approved before the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears that the transitional measure in question consists of extending the time limit for approval until the end of January 2004, which in truth does not solve the problem, because both Commissioner Schreyer and Commissioner Reding have said very explicitly that, if the legal bases have not been approved before the end of January, the appropriations will not be able to be executed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to remind the Commission of its own words and I quote: ‘In the event that this objective is not achieved, the Commission will propose, in due time, exceptional transitional measures which will allow subsidies to be allocated in 2004 while awaiting the adoption of the basic instruments’.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that extending the time limit until the end of January 2004 is not a transitional measure, since it does not allow execution if these basic instruments have not been approved. Parliament has made an effort to work very quickly in order to make it in time, but we do not know what is going to happen in the conciliation procedure and, if it fails, the commission is obliged to stand by its word and seek a solution – and I would repeat its own words – in order to ‘allocate subsidies in 2004 while awaiting the adoption of the basic instruments’.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the conciliation of 24 November, the fundamental issues to be negotiated are going to be, firstly, the financial contribution for each programme, their duration and the application of degressivity – which has already been mentioned – but, above all, it is the issue of the application of the pre-allocation in what we call ear-marking which will undoubtedly be the main stumbling block, Commissioner. I will therefore expand further on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">The pre-allocation relates to the proposal on culture and citizenship, and Parliament wishes to maintain its right to this prerogative, and this is something it is going to defend before the Council. I would like to say once again that I have never been in favour of pre-allocation, but, like Mrs Rühle, I must recognise that, recently and above all thanks to the Commission's attitude, I am beginning to change my opinion, because, when I see the Commission's unwillingness to find a solution for the executability of the subsidies in 2004, when I see the Commission's attitude to the executability of pilot projects and preparatory actions adopted by Parliament at first reading, I begin to ask myself many questions, Commissioner, and if the Commission simply places obstacles in the way of all of this Parliament's initiatives in the budget, it has no choice but to fight harder to defend its prerogatives. And the Commission should not tell me that its proposals already provide for pre-allocation; the Commission is completely convinced and knows that, in any event, we were going to have the stumbling block with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kinnock, I am very sorry that the Commission is taking no notice of my appeals, but I have been surprised and irritated to see that the Commission published in the Official Journal of the European Union of 18 November, that is to say, the day before yesterday, the invitation for proposals for 2004 for organisations which promote mutual understanding in relations between the European Union and certain non-industrialised regions of the world, in other words the Sacrédeus report, which we are going to vote on today from 12 noon.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to be very serious that the Commission has allowed this invitation to be published before Parliament has approved its position and, naturally, before the Council has adopted its decision. In other words, there is currently no legal basis for this invitation. It may be the case that by doing so the Commission wanted to speed up the procedures in order to facilitate the execution for 2004 but I sincerely believe that it has exceeded its powers.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, with all the problems we still have to resolve on Monday 24, I hope, Mr President, that Parliament and the Council can negotiate all of this successfully. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Article 49(2) of the new financial regulation, approved last year, lays down that, except in relation to institutional prerogatives, pilot projects, preparatory actions and operational appropriations for each institution, all other operational expenses will require a basic instrument for their execution. As has already been pointed out, this means proposing legal bases for these subsidies which are currently in part A, as in the case of the report we are dealing with.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody here will be surprised if I say that the work of preparing this report has been particularly delicate, since the economic interests of many bodies working to promote active European citizenship are at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal includes ten budget lines which I am not going to repeat and whose objective is to stimulate the bodies defined in the different budgetary lines so that they may contribute to the promotion of active and participatory citizenship. This is the common objective of these subsidies, that is, to enhance the role of these organisations and to promote actions which in turn strengthen the European message.</p>
<p class="contents">The most controversial aspect is undoubtedly the earmarking which some Member States are opposed to, as has been pointed out. But we represent the interests of the citizens and this report, together with another establishing a Community action programme for the promotion of bodies active at European level in the fields of culture, youth, education and training, are of key importance in terms of the European Union's credibility, and by means of them it is possible to communicate the fundamental message of our work, which is to build Europe with the participation of the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore call on the Council and the Commission, within the framework of the new legislation, to act in favour of this interest, removing procedural obstacles which are overly complicated.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let us not forget that, as Salvador de Madariaga said, Europe will exist when it exists in the conscience of all its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate Mrs Rühle on her work, and we broadly support her proposals. I thank her for the willingness she demonstrated in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, to accept the amendments that I tabled, together with Messrs Hernández Mollar and Marcelino Oreja. I agree with the rapporteur when she insists that the fact that the programme’s main ambition centres on reducing the democratic deficit must be clarified and emphasised. Some reports that this Parliament has adopted clearly underline the need to strengthen and enhance the idea of European citizenship which, to judge by the levels of participation in the elections to this Parliament, needs to be promoted as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the need to give greater visibility to the obligation for transparency. Organisations that receive funds must clearly state that they have done so and also quote the amounts, both in the publications that they promote and on the websites that they own or contribute to. We must also call for the results of these programmes to be disseminated: the use of European taxpayers’ money must be counterbalanced by an evaluation of the practical benefits of the actions receiving funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I also add my voice to that of the rapporteur and that of the previous speaker Mr Ojeda Sanz, when they call for bureaucratic procedures to be simplified. These must be reduced to the absolute minimum. Commissioner, the Commission must ensure that payments are made on time. Unjustifiable delays in transferring grants often compromise the effectiveness of the actions, damage the European Union’s image and create difficulties for the organisations which, in good faith, work together with us on disseminating this ideal.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme is about strengthening the bonds of European citizenship, boosting civic and democratic participation and raising awareness of the European ideal and the workings of its institutions. There is no doubting the need to promote active citizenship, both by supporting organisations working in this field and by promoting actions with this aim. This is, therefore, an attempt to bring the citizens of the European Union closer, involving them in a direct or indirect dialogue with the Union and its institutions.</p>

My group warmly welcomed this report, which would have put an end to the shameful lack of transparency with which grants had been awarded to various bodies in the world over many years. Meanwhile, however, in the context of the budgetary procedure for 2004, Parliament has once again pronounced itself in favour of earmarking funds for various bodies that are dear to some of the Members of this House. Personally, I deplore that pronouncement.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation now compels us to accept amendments tabled by Mr Salafranca, which are entirely out of tune with the spirit of the original report by my honourable colleague Mr Sacrédeus. Nevertheless, we rely on the Council, in its wisdom, to take the right decision in order to ensure that the future budgets of the European Union are transparent. We need to guarantee fair competition among the regional bodies and to identify those that can best contribute to the propagation of knowledge about the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The general attitude has, therefore, also been that it was not the budget and its contents that were up for discussion. Rather, it was a matter of needing to put the legal basis in order.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the legal basis must be put in order. In the case of two of the reports, this happens with the help of Article 308, and this, in a way, shows the importance of Article 308. We are obliged to have such an article in case matters were suddenly to arise that, for example, needed to be put right. On the other hand, the same article must not of course be abused, as there has perhaps been a tendency for it to have been.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, however, the reports are much more than just a question of formally getting the legal basis right. In reality, it is a question of something that is extremely political: firstly, a power struggle between the EU institutions and, secondly, our relations with people in the European democracy within and outside Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite a lot has already been said about the first matter. I wish, in any case, to make a general remark, however, namely that it is striking that the women’s programme is the shortest one. Excuse me, but I do not think that the Commission has produced a particularly good explanation, for everything that has been said about the candidate countries can justifiably be said about all three programmes. I therefore take the view that, as the work continues, some thought might be given to why on earth women, as usual, have to be in the most vulnerable position. That, I have to say, is the attitude as I perceive it.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the second matter, I should like to say that I come from a country that has been a member of the EU since 1972. We have tested public opinion on the EU from time to time and have had quite a lot of referendums, and we know that, if we do not arrange for people to be more actively involved in the EU, both in terms of internal democracy and also in relation to other countries, then the project will not succeed in the long term. It will be something beyond people's ken, and we may be in danger of their ending up feeling poorly disposed towards the project. It is therefore incredibly important that we set to work on involving people in this work.</p>
<p class="contents">I am slightly annoyed that women, specifically, have been given the shortest programme. I would say again that experience from my own country shows that it is women who are most sceptical towards the project. There may be a variety of explanations for this, but that is not something I can go into now, because I do not have the time. Precisely for that reason, however, it is incredibly important that the women’s organisations too have a stable situation in which to work so that they do not have to spend all their time just finding the money for their work.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall just comment on the individual reports. The first of these is concerned, as the rapporteur also emphasised in the report itself, with an incredibly important subject, that of the EU’s relations with other countries, and we can see on a day-to-day basis that it is becoming more and more important to increase this understanding of the fact that there exist cultures other than the specifically mainstreamed culture that is most widespread in Europe. In that context, I simply ask myself whether this programme would enable the candidate countries in actual fact to join on the basis of those criteria. I should like to ask the Commissioner responsible to look into this, because we know that the candidate countries basically use their development aid to benefit neighbouring countries rather than countries farther away. There is not therefore perhaps so much basic material to work on in the candidate countries when it comes to relations with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The second report concerns the issue of citizenship, to which I have already referred. I just want to emphasise, however, that this must be developed all the time so that we ensure that not only the NGOs but also people in general are given the opportunity to participate in this work. In that way, we can increase understanding of the good things the EU has to offer. In that context, it is incredibly important that there not only be traditional organisations involved, but also organisations that take very broad cultural initiatives. I believe that this is one of the ways in which to make things happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the issue of the programme for women. I engaged in some constructive cooperation with the rapporteur prior to the publication of this report, but there is considerable disagreement in the committee. There are therefore also a number of us who are in actual fact voting in favour of extending the programme and in favour of various other amendments that I had heard the Commission had rejected but for which we nonetheless hope a majority can be created. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore wish to pay tribute to the work of those lobbies.</p>
<p class="contents">Given my desire to avoid entering into an argument on this point, however, I shall begin by stressing the following point: regardless of the usefulness of the European Women’s Lobby, if some Members – and I agree with the previous speaker here – are calling for the extension of the programme for women, it is because they know from their dialogue with the relevant associations that the main problem lies in the way they work. For any association to work properly, it has to know where it is going, and it must be able to organise itself. This is why I strongly emphasise how important it is that we do not finance a particular event organised by an association or group of associations; on the contrary, we should use our funds to ensure that these associations operate in favourable conditions. Let me add that opening up to the new Member States and to third countries is also of fundamental importance in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">When I look back on my experience of the past four years as a member of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, I realise that we have widened the scope of our concerns quite considerably. This is another key dimension. We have moved into new areas of activity not only through the reports we have compiled on our own initiative but also because, as the Charter of Fundamental Rights states, the issue of women’s rights is relevant to every domain of activity. I have therefore seen us deal with reports on women’s health, on women and sport, on the information society and on violence against women. All of these reports demonstrate the need for us to take an interest in the development of the funding of associations, because each of these new areas on which we are now focusing is also undergoing development.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why <span class="bold">–</span> and this is my final point, which is addressed primarily to the Commissioner, I am still absolutely astonished that the European Commission did not endorse Mrs Diamantopoulou’s proposal for a directive implementing Article 13 of the EC Treaty, as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam. Three years ago, the Racism Directive was adopted on the basis of Article 13. The directive on discrimination against women has just been undermined at the very time when we are in the process of broadening our horizons. I do not understand how the Commission can be so reticent, particularly with regard to the media, a sector in which we certainly need the associations and their support in order to combat all forms of discrimination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Community initiatives designed to promote European citizenship do exist, but of course they are still inadequate. The decision to establish a five-year programme of subsidies to promote active European citizenship is a good thing. Promoting the idea of European citizenship so that the people assume responsibility for Europe and equip themselves with the means of exercising that responsibility is certainly the aim of this proposal, which should strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the Union and enhance its transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">To that end, however, we must also simplify procedures with a view to ensuring that the largest possible number of associations can benefit from this new instrument. Moreover, it is observable that a hierarchical structure is developing among these organisations, a structure for which, I regret to say, there is not always any justification. Objective criteria should be defined by the European Commission for funding the operation and activities of the various NGOs, particularly those that are directly involved on the ground in practising the solidarity to which we are pledged. Let us not forget that it is thanks to them that social cohesion is maintained in the socially deprived areas of Europe where exclusion and discrimination are rife. How can we convince young people that Europe is a reality, how can we give them confidence in Europe, if Europe takes no practical action to combat discrimination?</p>
<p class="contents">People in the field have been heard to say that the Commission maintains special relationships with particular associations. If this assertion were true, such a situation would be unacceptable. On the other hand, while the social dimension is accentuated, for which we thank our rapporteur, we cannot choose to disregard the political dimension, which is indispensable if the present democratic deficit is to be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">So what citizenship are we discussing? The report specifies that citizenship of the European Union complements and broadens national citizenship through the recognition of common rights. It derives from the need felt by the members of this Community to share their common democratic values in the process of constructing the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">How long can we go on talking about a European construction process that excludes those 15 to 18 million residents of Europe who are nationals of third countries? By virtue of their active participation in European integration, they are no less European citizens than anyone else, and their associations and NGOs are also actively engaged in the effort to promote Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We undoubtedly want a Europe of the people, a truly democratic Europe where solidarity prevails. To that end, we must renew and enhance this European citizenship. Now that we have free movement of capital, goods and persons, it goes without saying that the people of Europe must be able to assume their responsibilities and enjoy their rights in whatever European country they have chosen to live. Europe cannot accept a tiered system of citizenship in which some of its inhabitants are more equal than others. Everyone who shares this one European territory must be able to enjoy equal rights in his or her country of normal residence.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the European citizenship we create must no longer be based on nationality but on residence. Too often in Europe, nationality and citizenship are indissolubly linked. In this respect, we can benefit from the interesting experience of the acceding countries, which distinguish between the concepts of citizenship and nationality. We want our old Europe to draw inspiration from this injection of fresh impetus in order to create a new definition of European citizenship, based on residence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In situations such as these, we see how the existence of European citizenship can complement national citizenship. There are, however, areas in which it is harder to discern this achievement. The structures created by the Community with the intention of promoting this European citizenship receive Community funding and might even have carried out work but do not reach the majority of the citizens. The lack of knowledge about the work undertaken in the various institutions is profound but, due to a lack of transparency, to bureaucracy and to the visible gulf between Europe's citizens and the institutions that supposedly represent them and the organisations set up to serve them, there is no real knowledge of what goes on.</p>
<p class="contents">Only recently we were surprised at the results of surveys that demonstrate the complete ignorance of the European citizens about the work of the Convention, despite the considerable resources that have been invested in informing them. I myself, two years ago, was rapporteur on the euro, an extremely important Community service, essential to mobility and to promoting cross-border employment, and I became aware of the widespread lack of knowledge among the public about the euro. Two years on, even though this was one of the areas strategically identified in the resolution we adopted, highlighting the need for a major awareness-raising campaign, the situation remains more or less the same, due to the shortcomings of the Commission and to the lack of interest of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, therefore, crucial that measures are adopted. On the one hand, greater transparency must be demanded of organisations receiving Community grants. I agree with Mrs Rühle on the need for the investments that the European Union makes in informing its citizens and promoting citizenship to be made public, in particular on the websites of the organisations that benefit from this funding. This is one way of dispelling the idea that Europe is only for eurocrats and is far removed from the citizens, letting them know that this Europe works for all of us directly on a day-to-day basis and also offering citizens real participation at the social and political levels.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community institutions are not entirely blameless and can improve their performance by simplifying procedures for submitting applications for Community funds earmarked for civic promotion, by promoting easy access to documents through user-friendly systems, by strengthening the intermediate structures between institutions and citizens, by really listening and genuinely opening up. This is furthermore the right time to encourage citizens’ participation in the construction of the European Union. The Intergovernmental Conference is preparing the new Treaty with constitutional aspirations that will have enormous repercussions for the future of European citizens. I therefore issue a universal challenge: promote real European citizenship now and make it compulsory for all Member State governments to hold referendums on this new Treaty, as many have already decided to do. Consultation on the subject of the future Treaty must take place in all the Member States. In this way, we will all be able to contribute to the genuine exercise of active European citizenship. There is no point in telling our fellow citizens that we are European citizens too, but continually telling them to ‘shush’. It is not right, having proclaimed European citizenship for ourselves in Maastricht, that we then ensure that nothing at all is said about it by imposing a strict vow of silence on the people. We cannot accept the idea that European citizenship is all well and good as long as the citizens do not commit the sin of asking permission to speak. Let us, then, give a commitment to active European citizenship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, subsidies have been paid for many years to associations with an allegedly ‘European mission’ without any legal basis. They are often concealed among the appropriations made under Part A of the budget, in other words they are merged, with the aid of creative accounting, into the administrative expenditure of the Commission. Every year we protest against the selective granting of these subsidies to organisations promoting a federal Europe – the Jean Monnet Association, the International European Movement, diverse federalist think-tanks, etc. Every year we have refused to vote for them. Every year an overwhelming majority of this House has approved their renewal. Now, following observations made by the Court of Auditors – and oh, how justified they were – the new Financial Regulation that entered into force in 2002 requires the specification of a legal basis – which, of course, does not exist. Hence the proposal presented by the Commission today, which is designed to provide this basis for some of these outgoings, packaged together into what is called the ‘Community action programme to promote active European citizenship’. This approach speaks volumes about Community customs and practices, and indeed the comments it evokes could fill several books. I shall confine myself to six of these comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, even if a legal basis were provided now, what would be done about the subsidies that have been paid in the past without any legal basis? Secondly, it is a complete mockery to launch an action programme defining objectives on the basis of which grant applications will be assessed when everyone knows full well from the outset which associations will ultimately be selected. Thirdly, the subsidised associations have a European mission, at least as defined by the Commission. The others are, by definition, anti-European. When will the Council intervene in this business, either to stop all these subsidies or to distribute them equitably among associations with different visions of the future of Europe? Fourthly, the European institutions are meanwhile trying to establish a system for the funding of the self-styled European political parties from the public purse. As these subsidies pile up, do you not think that taxpayers will eventually have had their fill of this recklessness? Fifthly, the list of eligible associations contained in the report reveals a motley assortment of organisations, many of which have nothing to do with European citizenship, such as the European Council on Refugees and Exiles. In addition, since it is all so simple, the European Parliament could not resist adding to this list through its amendments. I also wonder, by the way, about the Association of the Councils of State and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions of the European Union. How can it be that an association of leading judges who are supposed to be part of an entirely independent judiciary can receive money to promote active European citizenship? My sixth and final point is that the only legal basis which anyone was able to find for this programme was Article 308 of the Treaty Establishing the European Union, the selfsame wretched article that we have often tried to have repealed, because it provides the Community with scope to stretch the limits of its powers. The report presented today will not change our minds on that point. It is true, however, that the said article requires the Council to act unanimously, and so I ask the following question: will there be a single government that is honest enough to oppose this concocted programme in the Council, a programme whose underlying principles are tinged with totalitarianism, because a sense of European citizenship, ladies and gentlemen, should be spontaneous, born of affection for Europe, for the European Union and its achievements. It is not manufactured with the aid of subsidies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having spent ten years at the head of such an organisation, namely the European Centre of the International Council of Women, which has affiliated organisations in the European Union, in the new Member States, in Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, the EFTA countries and in other countries too, I am better placed to assess the real value of this programme, which is intended to help the numerous women’s organisations that are active at the European level in the domain of sexual equality. These organisations will be eligible to benefit from subsidisation from an appropriation that, according to the proposal, will amount to EUR 2.222 million. Our Committee on Budgets, for its part, has proposed an allocation of EUR 5.5 million covering the period from 2004 to 2008. This is not a huge amount, but women’s organisations, be they national or European, are used to living and operating on small budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">The main reason why I welcome this initiative is that it puts an end to the monopoly on operating subsidies that has been enjoyed by the European Women’s Lobby ever since its creation. Having been one of the women activists who dreamed up and created that lobby in my capacity as president of CECIF, the organisation I referred to a moment ago, and since I am still president of a national organisation affiliated to the EWL, I must surely be immune to any accusations of seeking to undermine the EWL, whose work I greatly appreciate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has clearly understood that, in this as in all other domains, monopolies are unhealthy. Unfortunately, however, it did not take that principle to its logical conclusion, because the draft presented to us still reserves privileges for the EWL in the new framework. I do not wish to question the payment of an operating grant to the EWL, which is an established subsidy, but other organisations that are active at the European level in the struggle against all forms of discrimination, particularly discrimination on grounds of sex, should be able to benefit from financial support in the framework of the aforementioned appropriation in the form of operating subsidies designed to guarantee the continuity of their activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur had judiciously amended the Commission’s proposal for a decision. Unfortunately, within the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, the dogmatism of the Left triumphed once again over equality of treatment and opportunity for all the relevant women’s organisations. This is regrettable. Since the draft programme was totally distorted, Mrs Kratsa and other members of my group voted against it. If our efforts to restore the balance between the EWL and the other women’s organisations should fail, I shall vote against the report again, while still helping to prepare the ground for the second reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We know that citizenship of the Union should serve to involve more and more of the people of the Member States in the common project for European integration. Sadly, it is an undeniable fact that there are still many obstacles to overcome before European citizenship can become a reality. This is why the Rühle report, in its technical aspects, is actually an eminently political report, because it provides a channel through which we can support those bodies that are working to promote active European citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely essential that the public is better informed about what the European Union is doing to harmonise national policies and what it will be doing in the context of enlargement. Efforts are also needed to improve the promotion of current initiatives. This applies, for example, to the European Info-Points, whose networked operations meet with general satisfaction. Let me declare most solemnly here that the European Parliament has tried to deal with the financial threats facing the Info-Points and that a solution must be found quickly. I believe that this is now being done, but nothing is absolutely certain yet.</p>
<p class="contents">The concept of European citizenship must therefore be applied in all its dimensions: political, administrative, judicial, social and economic. We must therefore continue to work towards the removal of those obstacles – and they do still exist – which are preventing the people of our countries from exercising their rights as European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In the year 2000, as has already been mentioned, the Charter of Fundamental Rights finally put the citizen at the heart of the process of European integration process. Public involvement in the creation of the draft European constitution is another step in this direction. It was high time, for how is it possible to engage in politics at the European level, and indeed nationally and locally too, without making people the focus of all deliberations, of all welfare measures and of all social planning? The public must become active players rather than mere passive spectators, as is still too often the case.</p>
<p class="contents">It will obviously be even more difficult to communicate with the citizens of Europe when the population of the Union rises to almost 500 million from the present figure of 370 million, but that is precisely what we must do, using all the facilities that will enable us to conduct and enhance that dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by recalling that one of the points highlighted by the report is this very lack of information, resulting in the stunted development of a sense of European citizenship. This is reflected, and regrettably so, in the turnout for European elections, which averages less than 50% <span class="bold"></span> a shocking state of affairs. As the red-letter days of June 2004 draw near, it is therefore more essential than ever to strengthen the information and communication policy of the European Union by every available means. The challenge is truly formidable: it is a matter of building a genuinely political Europe, a genuine people’s Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall start with the Kratsa-Tsagaropoulous report.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Dybkjær says, it is of course symptomatic that the gender equality programme is the least comprehensive, but that is something to which we are fairly accustomed, Mr Kinnock.</p>
<p class="contents">Equality between men and women begins in the home. The liberal challenge regarding gender equality consists in ensuring that women are given more power over their own lives. Even I as a liberal can say that it is a question of identifying structures that present obstacles to women being given the same opportunities as men. I am convinced that you, Mr Kinnock, are especially knowledgeable about this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Equality between women and men has of course been one of the EU’s basic principles since the Treaty of Rome. That principle was reinforced in the Treaty of Amsterdam and has gradually gained in prominence. It is therefore clear that we especially welcome this action programme and the legal basis that give the women’s organisations financial opportunities to do better work.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it important to say too that the activities engaged in by the European Women’s Lobby, which was founded by Mrs Lulling, is at present represented in fifteen Member States and has more than 3 000 members, should be prioritised and supported by us in this House today. Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou has talked in this Chamber about other organisations not included within the European Women’s Lobby, but they too are included in the action programme. I agree with Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou about the importance of diversity and of having organisations at all levels, but I would also give an assurance that the action programme is aimed at supporting both the European Women’s Lobby and other organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to Mr Kinnock that it is important for the EU also to guarantee that the organisations working on gender equality are treated equally and are given financial aid for longer than the two years you propose. A two-year aid programme does not provide financial security for any organisation. Another reason for supporting the action programme, which extends to 2008, is that we must be able to guarantee that organisations in our new Member States are also given an opportunity to seek aid within this programme. I think it important to add, and to emphasise, that it should provide more long-term security.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sacrédeus, who unfortunately appears to have left the Chamber, has done a good job concerning the programme covered by his report. The programme should help us and exists so that people in the various countries, regions and parts of the world that cooperate might have a better knowledge of each other. As a liberal, I fully and entirely support this work.</p>
<p class="contents">I nonetheless want to present three wishes based upon experience, of which I think we should take account. The aid must be easy to administer and apply for; it must be unbureaucratic; and it must be obtainable quickly. We know that many are reluctant to seek aid from the EU and within the financial framework we have, because there is a lot of red tape and it can be too late when the money is finally paid out. It must not be the case that, through these financial programmes partly aimed at making us more European, the European Union is associated with red tape, bureaucracy and tardiness, which are precisely what people do associate it with. That must not happen, and I hope, Mr Kinnock, that, in your continued work, you will ensure that we are given more aid and that there is increased access to these action programmes and to the money, so that they are of use. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, I should like to highlight the importance of a Community action programme to promote organisations active at European level in the field of equality between men and women, in activities as important as integrating the gender perspective into education, sport, health, social protection, cooperation with women’s associations in third countries, without detracting from the important work of the European Women’s Lobby. I would also emphasise the need for more actions to combat violence because this is an obstacle to equality and to the recognition of women’s dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I regret that the funds for these actions are still so limited, which reveals an ongoing lack of respect for the work undertaken to promote equality of rights and women’s opportunities in a huge range of fields. I would like a guarantee to be given now that the programme will be extended to 2008, because we must commit to continuing this extremely important work of promoting equality of rights and opportunities between men and women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must always remember that the aim of the programme in question is to support women’s organisations whose primary task is to promote, monitor and publicise Community actions designed for women, with the aim of achieving gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments tabled in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities changed the nature of the report and, what is worse, diverted it from the overall objective. Consequently, the members of that committee from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, including the rapporteur, voted against them. I must, therefore, congratulate Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou on the coherence and persistence of the work she has carried out and which can be seen in the amendments tabled for the vote in this plenary session.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, what is at stake are crucial issues; firstly, the reference to the European Women’s Lobby in the text that is annexed and not in the legislative part; secondly, the intention to award grants for organisations’ operational needs and not for specific actions; thirdly, co-financing and degressivity rates must be identical both for the European Women’s Lobby and for other organisations operating at European level. We would certainly not deny the fundamental role of the European Women’s Lobby, but the work of other organisations that share these aims and which undertake their own activities that do not receive financial support also needs to be recognised. Consequently, in order to ensure equal opportunities for all of these organisations, their names must be given only in the annex. Furthermore, this programme must award operational grants to organisations active at European level in the field of equality between women and men. The programme is not intended to subsidise specific actions that could receive funding under other programmes. This point must be crystal clear!</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in contrast to the Commission proposals, standard criteria must be adopted for the various organisations as regards co-financing and degressivity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to use this speech to defend the fundamental role of women’s organisations in the promotion of the European Union’s equal opportunities policy. Without them, without women’s organisations, it would have been very difficult to implement and extend the progress made in the promotion of women’s rights. It would also have been very difficult to diagnose the real situation of women in the different countries of the European Union. The progress made by the women’s movement stems from the solid work of their organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Women’s organisations also have the capacity to propose solutions which are very close to the ground and therefore very effective. Consequently, I believe that establishing a Community programme to support and promote these organisations is fundamental. There are many women’s organisations, each with its own specific nature and importance, all of which have done extremely respectable and useful work. But the problem is that not all organisations are equal and egalitarianism, in this case, could lead to clear injustice.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Women’s Lobby is a great organisation made up of many others. That is to say, the European Women’s Lobby is a great umbrella organisation containing thousands of women’s organisations, hundreds and thousands of women who work on a daily basis in favour of women’s rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot compare an umbrella organisation with organisations that work individually. Therefore, from the outset, the Commission is proposing different treatment for the European Women’s Lobby and for all the other organisations. And naturally my group supports that approach. Why? Because those of us who come from the women’s movement know that to fragment the movement, to disintegrate it, to break it into tiny pieces, is ineffective, that the most effective way is to work together, because united we are stronger. Dividing resources is of no use whatsoever, except to weaken the women’s movement. And therefore, defending and supporting each and every women’s organisation which works for equality, we must not treat those which are not equal equally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">How can anyone fail to endorse the principles set out in Amendment 13: the participation of women in decision-making, the suppression of all forms of violence against women, of sexual stereotyping and of discrimination against women in the workplace and the integration of the aim of sexual equality into the domains of education, sport, health and social welfare? At the same time, though, how can anyone fail to notice that the European institutions themselves are setting a bad example? Why do they not intervene to put an end, in every country of the Union, to the form of violence against women that consists in denying them the choice between having and not having a child? How can the European institutions wield any influence in the effort to combat discrimination against women at work if they refuse to enact coercive legislation against employers in this domain, as in others? How can equality between men and women, in deeds rather than words, be guaranteed unless sufficient numbers of crèches, childcare facilities and nursery schools are built, an aim which the austerity policies favoured by the European institutions and national governments are making more and more difficult to achieve?</p>
<p class="contents">So while voting for this report on the basis that some aid for women’s organisations is better than none, I must observe that the European institutions are evading their own responsibilities as far as the promotion of equality is concerned, because they are more concerned with competition, profit and capital than with the lives of human beings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As mentioned earlier, many organisations are eligible for this funding. We cannot allow a Europe where some are more equal than others. We must vote in favour of equal treatment between men and women but also between the European Women's Lobby <span class="bold"></span> EWL <span class="bold"></span> and other women's associations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not equal treatment when one organisation can receive funding without needing to make a proposal to the Commission, and yet other organisations must compete against many other worthwhile proposals. It is not equal treatment when there is such a huge difference in the proportion of funding received by one organisation as compared to that granted to other women's organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that a great deal of the EWL budget goes to coordination and research, but EWL does not offer financial aid to the associations that make it up. These organisations in fact pay for membership of EWL and they do not have permanent financial aid available to them. This discriminates against the very worthwhile organisations that need support at European level to make their voice heard and it undermines the appreciation of the high quality of their work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that when I was newly elected in 1999, I had no idea what or who EWL was. I was contacted by women's organisations in Germany and Spain and I was asked to make a plea on their behalf for equal funding. They did not receive funding from the European Union and they could not receive it unless they were part of EWL, which claimed to be the only voice for women throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to undermine the work of EWL <span class="bold"></span> it has a legitimate purpose and has a right to receive funding <span class="bold"></span> but I simply propose that the funding should also be available to other women's organisations, who feel that EWL does not speak for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Many parties make up this House and sometimes people feel that their voice can be heard perhaps better with one side of the House than with another. That is the situation we are in. Specific organisations should not be mentioned in this proposal. They should be mentioned in the Annex, and there should not be funding for specific actions that can be funded in other programmes. This is in line with the Council position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European women’s lobby has initiated important campaigns, such as the campaign for increased involvement by women in the European elections, has prompted a debate on the constitution, and is monitoring enlargement with a particular eye on equal opportunities issues.</p>
<p class="contents">What the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats now wants is for this line to be dismantled. We want to ensure quality. We want to speak for women with one voice rather than join in a chorus of many. In contrast to the rapporteur, my group wants, from the very outset, to make this a priority and ensure action in the European interest in the equal opportunities field. We will therefore reject most of the rapporteur’s amendments in favour of those put forward by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">We Social Democrats contend that Mrs Dührkop Dührkop has also presented a well-thought out proposal for funding, fully in line with the Budget Regulation, which secures provision of funding up to and including 2008, to the tune of EUR 5.5 million. That gives women’s organisations the security they need to plan ahead, and spares us another laborious legislative process once the two years are up. The cofinancing arrangement, with 20% for women’s organisations, with the exception of the European Women’s Lobby, which gets 10%, excluding degressivity, is a solution with which all parties can live.</p>
<p class="contents">When enlargement happens, we want the organisations from Central and Eastern Europe also to be included, and we want priorities set. It is therefore proposed in Amendment 13 – in which there is a translation mistake that I will bring to the services’ attention – that work and family life be made more compatible. We want to encourage women to play their part in the decision-making process; we want this programme, and the organisations, to support the fight against all forms of violence. We also want to support the fight against gender-specific stereotyping and discrimination of all kinds, especially in the workplace and in relation to pay, and we also welcome the encouragement given to women’s cooperation in third countries, for example in Amendment 14.</p>
<p class="contents">At the very last minute, the Italian presidency of the Council has attempted to bring influence to bear on us to get us to go along with the rapporteur’s proposals. Both my group and I are hoping for a majority in this House, we are not willing to encourage the fragmentation of women’s voices. We want unity rather than polyphony. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you for this kindness and this gift, which I particularly appreciate because I am to speak about women.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an issue which fascinates me, Mr President; it fascinates me because I firmly believe that women’s battle to be accorded at least the same importance as men and to be considered equal to them is right and sacrosanct, and every endeavour must be made to achieve this objective. This is why I would like to thank Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her commitment in tabling a report on this Commission document.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to ask a question: is the money destined for this purpose sufficient? According to an Italian proverb, silence means consent. You are silent, Mr President, but I think that you agree with me that it is not sufficient. I have calculated that, every year, with this programme for women five thousandths of a euro is spent every day – not EUR 5 but five thousandths of a euro <span class="bold"></span> for each woman: that is a very small amount. Look around you: what progress have women made in political life, in employment, in social life? In political life, Mr President, how many women vice-chairpersons and chairpersons are there in the European Parliament? How many women have been President of the European Commission? None, Mr Kinnock, either in the past or at present; let us hope that things will change in the future. In politics, elected women are in an incredibly small minority.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, I hope that the contributions provided for by the programmes for women will be distributed in a democratic way, not in the way that was so clearly criticised by Mrs Kratsa- Tsagaropoulou and other speakers before me. I genuinely hope that they help women to become aware of their potential and capacity to have a full role at the different political levels, irrespective of the political picture: it makes no difference whether the right or the left is in power. Women must have political power too, in addition to reigning over our homes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to say this about every report that has to do with action programmes, but, as the Commission has been very, very tardy in putting the reports before Parliament, the organisations concerned – including the cultural and educational programmes and of course the women’s programmes – now face the danger that they will get their money in 2004 only after a substantial delay or that the programmes cannot be run at all if – as you have previously stressed – this is not wrapped up by December. That is, of course, highly disadvantageous, and I think this an extremely inopportune time for you to launch a major action of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the transitional stage that you propose in the documents, I would like to ask you what you propose doing if there is no conclusion by December. We need a transitional stage in the event of the legal basis not being complete in due time. Rejecting thirty-five amendments, you appeal to Parliament’s sense of responsibility, telling us that we should make allowances so that the programmes can yet be implemented. When it rejects thirty-five out of over fifty amendments, the Commission cannot be said to possess much in the way either of a sense of responsibility or a conciliatory approach. That means that there still have to be some negotiations here.</p>
<p class="contents">Referring specifically to the women’s programme, I would like to add my voice to what has been said by my fellow lady MEPs. The European Women's Lobby is an organisation that concentrates on equal opportunities policy and engages in it with determination, being able to show strength by bringing together many organisations. I do not understand why it is sought to erode this strength by putting it on an equal footing with many other organisations. I therefore endorse the special status of the Women's Lobby and stress that it should be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, finally, like to address the subject of enlargement and take this opportunity to urge that special account be taken of the financial conditions for it, for an additional ten Member States also means that we have to do much more work on women’s issues, and one look at the number of women on the lists will make clear what we mean by that. It is here that we have to work harder, and for that we need more funding. The same financial conditions cannot apply to 25 Member States as did to 15. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The amendments proposed in the report will make it easier both to support projects that are important for the European Union and to monitor them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal only loosely defines who will be affected, and quite a number of possible target countries are not at all non-industrialised. In my opinion it is important that this project should apply specifically to those countries and their internal regions which can otherwise be more difficult to reach and with which the European Union can be considered to have an obvious need to develop mutual understanding and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">What I think is a particular problem is that cooperation agreements made with non-industrialised countries can easily focus just on promoting economic development. In this situation we should remember that improving social conditions has unquestionable value in international cooperation and a clear, albeit indirect, effect too in the way it promotes economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason I am of the opinion that it is important in the report to stress the importance of dialogue between the Commission and Parliament before issuing a call for proposals. Only in this way can Parliament ensure that it has control over how resources are allocated and can also support humane development aims. The decisions made by the Commission regarding priority themes take a strong stance on European Union values, and it is very important that Parliament, which in the eyes of the people represents the Union, can influence these decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new Financial Regulation requires specific legal bases, but, as many speakers have pointed out – and I am particularly obliged to the rapporteurs for doing so – this new legal basis does in fact entail far-reaching practical consequences for the individual areas in question.</p>
<p class="contents">I am speaking primarily about the report on active civic participation. We talk constantly about giving citizens more information about the European process and getting them more involved in it, but I want now to make it abundantly clear that there is a great danger of us, for the sake of the new legal basis and the Financial Regulation, throwing the baby out with the bathwater, and that we will, next year, be complaining that we have more problems with public information in the year of the European elections than we ever did before. I therefore appeal in urgent terms, particularly to the Commission and to the Council, that greater account be taken of how Parliament votes on these issues, especially as regards the conciliation procedure this coming Monday.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you just two examples. The first is the Info-Points, to which Mrs Rühle was right to make reference, and I also strongly endorse the amendment she has moved. It utterly passes my understanding how the Commission is unwilling to support this amendment. You are all aware that, in our home countries, the Info-Points serve as points of contact for information on Europe and the European institutions. Can you imagine the Info-Points in your region being able to do their job if they were restricted by a call for proposals?</p>
<p class="contents">This financial insecurity and inadequate institutional backup means that the Info-Points will, in future, be unable to perform their function. That is what the Commission is proposing to us in this report, and so I want to forcefully draw your attention to this danger. The same is true of town twinning, from which all of you, in your regions, receive support in your work. Here too, the bureaucratic process associated with this new legal basis can very much threaten the continuation of the work they do.</p>
<p class="contents">And so, let me conclude by reiterating my appeal to the Commission and the Council. I urge them to take Parliament’s vote on board and arrive at fair compromises that will guarantee rather than imperil public information in the future! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, I would like to clarify the Commission's position on a number of points relating to the three reports and, thirdly, to respond to a number of points that have been raised.</p>
<p class="contents">On the report by Mr Sacrédeus, I sympathise very strongly with the emphasis he put on dialogue between cultures and civilisations as a contribution to peace and understanding. I am reminded of Abba Eban's response when asked why he was continually seeking to open conversation with enemies. He explained that it was because his friends already agreed with him. That is a valid maxim for the conduct of international affairs. I am sure Mr Sacrédeus agrees. Indeed, it is not a bad definition of the relationship that is sometimes desirable between Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to add, in response to Mr Sacrédeus, that I understand that four additional amendments have been tabled which were not supported or proposed by the rapporteur. If adopted, those amendments, numbers 16, 17, 18 and 19, would radically alter the Commission's proposal and the effect would be to open the possibility of awarding grants without a call for proposals, thereby undermining the principles of transparency and equal treatment, not to mention the principles of order in Parliament, which is always desirable - though I understand it is difficult when people are coming in.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically in response to Mrs Dührkop Dührkop's comments about the publication of the call for tenders yesterday in the Official Journal, I have to inform her that the Commission had to do this to comply with the deadlines established by the financial regulation, which requires applications for operating grants to be submitted by 31 December. I know she has a forceful point relating to the legal standing of this action. If she does not have time to participate in the present debate, I hope she will be able to take the matter up with the relevant Commission authorities to get a clear explanation.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the report by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, I must add that, in order to be consistent, the Commission must also reject the later amendments: 21, 23, 25, 27, 31 and 32.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the Rühle report, I am afraid that a gremlin crept into the list we received and I have to say that the Commission also rejects Amendment 18. More importantly, I should reply to Mrs Rühle that the reason for the Commission's rejection of Amendments 35, 36 and 37 is that they would jeopardise the speedy adoption of the proposal because of the requirement for unanimity in the Council. I know she agrees with the Commission that delay is to be avoided wherever possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, there would inevitably be a long discussion on the potential beneficiaries to be included in the list. Given that the proposal is of an essentially technical nature, the Commission must guarantee the continuity of funding for existing activities, which clearly lack a legal basis. Any widening of the scope of this proposal is likely to jeopardise that objective, which I know is shared by Mrs Rühle.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission understands, however, the rationale behind the amendment and could take account of Amendment 35 when developing a proposal for the possible extension of this programme. I know that Mrs Rühle will take the opportunity that that affords.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mrs Prets, who, together with many other speakers in the debate, made a very valuable contribution, I would say that it has been agreed with the Council that we could add a clause in the legal basis to allow retroactivity in financing operational grants for beneficiaries from January 2004 onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of earmarking, mentioned by a number of Members this morning, was discussed at last week's trialogue. The Council proposed that the beneficiaries should be named in a list annexed to each programme for 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">From 2005 the call for public proposals open to all organisations will be launched. The Commission has decided to align itself with that proposal as a realistic compromise. It must be seen in the context of the overall effort to find solutions for all seven proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has compromised on the duration of programmes, where we proposed to limit them, until the end of 2006. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
