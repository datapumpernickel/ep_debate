<p>The Portuguese Presidency has set its first priority as 'solidarity between equals' and is highlighting the importance of developing the culture and tourism industry. Popular tourist regions in the EU are being blighted by phenomena, such as violence, alcoholism, and incidents, such as those involving British tourists at Laganas on the island of Zakynthos, which blacken the image of European tourists, undermine living conditions of the local population and bring the tourist destinations in question into disrepute.</p>
<p>Given the Presidency's orientation towards a sustainable, high-quality tourism based on solidarity, will the Presidency say whether it intends to promote cooperation between Member States in order to address such situations and exchange best practices? Does it believe that new measures must be taken aimed at boosting European tourism, while at the same time safeguarding the quality of life of the local population and the good name of tourist destinations? Does it intend to examine whether it is worth promoting codes of conduct which are binding for tourist undertakings active in Europe?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2007 September I part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Presidency confirms that, in its statement entitled ‘A stronger Union for a better world’, the top priority is ‘solidarity between equals’, which in this context means values such as respect for human dignity and citizens’ rights, freedom, democracy, equality and the rule of law.</p>
<p>With regard to tourism, it should be remembered that the EU’s responsibilities in this area, as laid down in the Treaty, are minimal. The current legislation is basically aimed at protecting the consumer (for example, passengers’ rights).</p>
<p>Further to the Council’s Conclusions on tourism of 18 April 2005 and according to the timetable for the 18 months from 1 January 2007 – prepared in conjunction with the previous German Presidency and the subsequent Slovenian Presidency – the Portuguese Presidency will very closely monitor developments in the Commission’s initiatives on the European tourism agenda, all the more so as it regards tourism as a sector with great potential for growth and the sustained creation of employment.</p>
<p>Moreover, in order to highlight the need to integrate tourism within our common agenda, we will host the 6th European Tourism Forum on 26 and 27 October 2007.</p>
<p>The Presidency hopes that the aspects mentioned in the honourable Member’s question may also be tackled during future discussions and is counting on appropriate measures being taken by the competent bodies to prevent the harmful effects on tourism described in the honourable Member’s question.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0583"></a>

The fact that these undertakings prohibited representatives of the third largest parliamentary party in Greece from entering shows that a 'State within a State' exists in workplaces where employers terrorise and act arbitrarily towards workers, deeming themselves above the law, so that they even forbid parliamentary controls of their undertakings.</p>

<p>Repeated calls have been made on the EU to regulate the activity of players' agents. This is often linked to reports of bad practices in the activities of some agents which have allegedly resulted in instances of corruption, money laundering and exploitation of under age players. However, it is a complex issue, since agents are subject to differing regulations in different Member States. Some Member States have introduced specific legislation on players' agents while in others the applicable law is the general law regarding employment agencies, but with references to players' agents. Moreover, some international federations have introduced their own regulations.</p>

<p>For the realisation of the abovementioned impact assessment, which conditions any potential EU measure in this field, the Commission considers that an external study is necessary.

However, the Commission is respectful of the autonomy of sports organisations and considers that the decisions about such competitions or competitions on the United States of America model of college championships belong to the relevant sports and education institutions.</p>
<p>The White Paper on Sport recalls that sport and physical activity can be supported through the Lifelong Learning programme. Promoting participation in educational opportunities through sport is thus a priority topic for school partnerships supported by the Comenius programme and for thematic networks and mobility in the field of higher education supported by the Erasmus programme.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as part of its Action Plan "Pierre de Coubertin" accompanying the White Paper on Sport, the Commission will introduce the award of a European label to schools actively involved in supporting and promoting physical activities in a school environment.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission draws the Honourable Member's attention to the new event created by the International Olympic Committee, namely the organisation of the 1st Summer Youth Olympic Games in 2010. The Commission welcomes the IOC's intention for the Youth Olympic Games to not only focus on competition, but to also give a major role to education and information of young athletes regarding important aspects related to sport, such as health.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0579"></a>

<p>The ceiling of the grant awarded to youth organisations is currently fixed at € 35 000 due to the constant increase in the number of applications submitted in recent years and with a view to providing support to an optimal number of beneficiaries.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently exploring the possibility of increasing the ceiling for grants in the framework of the Call for proposals for the year 2008.</p>
<p>This measure would need to be accompanied by an increase in the resources assigned to the action of the Programme supporting youth NGOs, while taking into account the need to ensure a balance in the funding available among the different actions of the Programme.</p>
<p>With regard to the selection procedure, each application undergoes an evaluation based on a careful analysis of the eligibility criteria, selection criteria and award criteria, in strict conformity with the stipulations of the Call for proposals. The selection procedure involves the participation of external experts and several representatives of the Commission and the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency.</p>
<p>Concerning the award of grants to organisations established in regions, it should be noted that - in the framework of the Youth in Action Programme - only those organisations exercising their activities at European level and having a structure and activities covering at least eight countries participating in the Programme can receive grants for their operating costs.</p>

<p>A few days ago, the Commission decided to initiate proceedings against Greece before the European Court of Justice in an attempt to standardise the retirement age for men and women working in the public sector which is currently 65 and 60 years respectively.</p>
<p>Does the Commission not agree that the retirement arrangements for public sector workers form part of social security? Does it not agree that the difference in the retirement age of men and women constitutes positive discrimination in favour of women, justified by their disadvantaged and unequal position in economic and social life, particularly in employment? Does the Commission believe that the harmonisation of the public sector retirement age for men and women should be achieved by increasing the retirement age of women to 65 years or rather by reducing the retirement age for men to 60?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Honourable Member puts several questions regarding proceedings against Greece before the European Court of Justice. The infringement procedure in question concerns the Greek Code for Military and Civil Pensions, especially the rules defining retirement age which are more favourable for women than for men. The rules vary depending on the circumstances but are in any event more favourable for women. For instance, widows, divorced or single women with unmarried children are allowed to go on pension after 15 or 17 years of service. The same rule does not apply to men.</p>
<p>As regards the question as to whether the Greek Military and Civil Pension scheme forms part of statutory social security, it should be noted that in a series of judgments, the European Court of Justice confirmed that, as a general rule, a pension paid by an employer to a former employee by reason of the employment relationship between them constitutes pay within the meaning of Article 141 of the EC Treaty. It does therefore not form part of statutory social security pensions. More in particular, the Court has also noted that pensions paid by the State to former civil servants who have worked in the public sector constitute pay within the meaning of Article 141 of the EC Treaty (C-7/93 Beune; C-366/99 Griesmar; C-351/00 Niemi; C-4/02, Schönheit). It has held in Case Griesmar that civil servants must be regarded as constituting a "particular category of workers". As a consequence, the Court has considered that the French pension scheme for civil servants therefore does not form part of statutory social security schemes but have to be considered as “pay” within the meaning of Article 141 of the EC Treaty. This approach has been confirmed also in regard to the German and the Finnish civil servants' pension schemes.</p>
<p>Pension schemes falling within the scope of Article 141 of the EC Treaty must respect the principle of equal treatment. This means that different conditions governing access to 'pay' (including pension) for men and women performing the same or comparable work infringe the principle of equal pay. Therefore, different retirement ages are to be considered as discrimination on grounds of sex. Provisions on different retirement ages are thus contrary to Article 141 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>The Commission takes the view that the Greek Code for Military and Civil Pensions provides for pensions which have to be considered as pay in the sense of Article 141 of the EC Treaty. They are paid to a “particular category of workers” by reason of the employment relationship.</p>
<p>Therefore these pensions do not form part of social security schemes.</p>
<p>As regards the second question on whether the differences in retirement age could be considered as “positive action” in favour of women, the Commission considers that different retirement ages cannot be considered as positive action. “Positive Action” within the meaning of Article 141 (4) of the EC Treaty are measures "providing for specific advantages in order to make it easier for the under-represented sex to pursue a vocational activity or to prevent or compensate for disadvantages in professional careers."</p>
<p>With regard to this particular aspect, in Case C-366/99 Griesmar (at point 65) the Court held that "(…) the measure … does not appear to be of a nature such as to offset the disadvantages to which the careers of female civil servants are exposed by helping those women in their professional life. On the contrary, that measure is limited to granting female civil servants who are mothers a service credit at the date of their retirement, without providing a remedy for the problems which they may encounter in the course of their professional career."</p>
<p>The same argument applies here: granting women in special circumstances an earlier retirement does not help them to pursue their professional careers but only helps them to receive more favourable conditions for an early retirement. Therefore, it cannot be considered as a measure in the context of “positive action”.</p>
<p>Finally, in response to the last question on how should the harmonisation of retirement age be achieved, in the Smith-judgment (C-408/92, point 22) the Court held that Community law precludes national equalizing measures which raise "the retirement age for women to that for men in relation to periods of service completed between 17 May 1990, the date of that judgment (i.e. case Barber, C-262/88) and the date on which those measures come into force. On the other hand, as regards periods of service completed after the latter date, Article 119 (now Article 141 of the EC Treaty) does not prevent an employer from taking that step. As regards periods of service prior to 17 May 1990, Community law imposed no obligation which would justify retroactive reduction of the advantages which women enjoyed."</p>
<p>Therefore, Community law does not allow for retrospectively raising the retirement age for women in relation to periods of service completed between 17 May 1990 and the date of entry into force of the measures by which equality is achieved in the scheme in question. However, as regards periods in the future, the Member State is free to decide how to achieve equalisation of retirement age or of other eligibility conditions to take up pensions, the objective being to achieve equal gender treatment in all respects.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0588"></a>

<p>(FR) The relevant Community provisions on fire fighting are set out in Framework Directive 89/391/EEC<a href="#defann_9_1" name="refann_9_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, and more specifically in Directive 89/654/EEC<a href="#defann_9_2" name="refann_9_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the workplace.</p>
<p>These Directives do not lay down any requirement for fire sprinklers to be installed in all workplaces. Nevertheless, given that they are based on a preventive approach the Directives seek to protect the health and safety of workers from fire by requiring workplaces to be equipped with ‘appropriate fire-fighting equipment’ in accordance with the specific characteristics of each workplace. In addition, employers must ‘be in possession of an assessment of the risks’ covered by the Framework Directive and ‘take the necessary measures’ for fire fighting.</p>
<p>The Commission emphasises that fire sprinklers are not the most appropriate means of fighting fires in every case. In fact, their use is not recommended for fighting certain types of fire, for example electrical fires, fires involving gas or flammable liquids and certain fires of chemical origin. As a consequence, the Commission does not intend to conduct research into the installation of fire sprinklers in all places of work.</p>
<p>Moreover, rules on the installation of fire sprinklers are also laid down in the provisions of Directive 95/16/EC<a href="#defann_9_3" name="refann_9_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> concerning health and safety problems when lifts are installed. In this respect, Article 2(3) of the Directive stipulates that ‘Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that shafts intended for lifts do not contain any piping or wiring or fittings other than that necessary for the operation and safety of the lift’.</p>
<p>In addition, the automatic triggering of a sprinkler system that is not correctly installed could compromise the safe use of lifts equipped with such a system and pose an additional risk to people trapped in a lift as a result of a fire if wiring or other electrical components are installed in the lift shaft.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Illegally staying third country nationals can be subject to exploitation, sometimes serious, at the workplace. The proposal does not affect third country nationals’ fundamental rights as workers.

<p>In its Communication "A new framework strategy for multilingualism"<a href="#defann_12_1" name="refann_12_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the Commission reaffirms its commitment to multilingualism, underlining that respect for linguistic diversity is in fact a core value of the European Union.</p>
<p>The Commission's new multilingualism policy encourages the full expression of all languages, which have the same rights and an equal value. It aims to create a climate in which the teaching and learning of a wide range of languages are encouraged.</p>
<p>This global approach is reflected in the new generation of Community funding programmes 2007-2013 under the Lifelong Learning framework managed by the Commission's Directorate-General for Education and Culture, in which all languages are eligible for funding. Thus, applications involving regional and minority languages are considered on an equal footing with all other languages.</p>
<p>Moreover, in 2007 the call for proposals for the key activity relating to languages in the Lifelong Learning Programme gave priority to projects and networks promoting linguistic diversity, thereby providing scope for regional and minority languages. The results of this call for proposals will be known in September. The Commission expects to co-fund a number of multilateral projects and networks in this field.</p>
<p>In 2008 the Commission will continue to give priority to projects and networks to promote lesser- used European languages, including regional and minority languages.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 12 June 2007, the Council adopted a regulation on the reform of the fruit and vegetable sector and decided to grant additional payments of EUR 230 a hectare to strawberry and raspberry producers in the new Member States. Unfortunately, these arrangements do not apply to producers of other soft fruits (such as cherries and currants) or, most importantly, to apple growers, which is of particular significance to Poland, as it accounts for almost one-third of the Union's apple production.</p>
<p>The situation of fruit farmers in Poland has been made more difficult still by the frost in May, which resulted in 70 to 80% losses to this year's harvest.</p>

<p>The decision to grant transitional flat rate support to surfaces under cultivation of strawberries and raspberries intended for processing reflects the fact that after recent enlargements the EU became a major producer of soft fruits on a global scale. These products were chosen because in recent years they were the most exposed to competition from third countries.</p>
<p>The Commission hopes that the Member States covered by the scheme decide, at least for the national part of the support, to condition access to it upon membership in producer organisations or producer groups in order to provide the incentive to organise. Fragmentation of production and marketing in the soft fruit sector was identified by the Commission as one of the structural deficiencies in its report from mid 2006. Now the producing countries have an instrument to redress the situation within a five year period.</p>
<p>As far as apples are concerned, the EU was already a major apple producer before recent enlargements. This is why no new support scheme is foreseen, even on a transitional basis.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to recall that a major objective of the fruit and vegetable reform was a more market oriented sector.

The rights and obligations resulting for the new Member States from those agreements shall not be affected during the period in which the provisions of those agreements are provisionally maintained.</p>
<p>Article 6(9) further states that as soon as possible, and in any event before the expiry of those fishery agreements, appropriate decisions for the continuation of fisheries activities resulting from those agreements shall be adopted in each case by the Council acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, including the possibility of extending certain agreements for periods not exceeding one year.</p>
<p>The Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Estonian Republic on cooperation in the field of conservation of fish stocks in the Chudskoye, Teploye and Pskov Lakes entered into force on 3 June 1994 (hereafter referred to as the "Agreement"). According to Article 8 of this Agreement, it shall remain in force for five years and shall automatically be extended for further five-year periods unless one party communicates in writing, at least three months prior to the end of the corresponding period, its desire to terminate the Agreement. In light of this Article and the information currently available to the Commission, the Agreement appears to remain in force until 2009.</p>
<p>According to Article 2(1) of the bilateral Agreement, the Parties shall establish an intergovernmental committee on fisheries in the Chudskoye, Teploye and Pskov Lakes. In accordance with Article 2(2), meetings of the Committee shall take place at least twice a year. Pursuant to Article 3, the tasks of the Committee shall include drawing up recommendations with regard to establishing a total allowable catch for each species of fish and allocating it between the Parties, as well as regulating fishing equipment and methods, minimum permitted sizes for fish caught and the percentage of young fish to be taken.</p>
<p>Article 3(1)(e) of the EC Treaty in conjunction with Article 32 and Annex I defines the scope of the Common Fisheries Policy. By virtue of these Articles, the Common Fisheries Policy covers the so-called "Chapter 3 products", i.e. fresh, frozen, smoked, filleted etc. fish, and "Chapter 16 products", i.e. processed fishery products, irrespective of whether they stem from marine capture fisheries, from freshwater fisheries, from inland fisheries or from fish farming. Therefore, although the above-mentioned "Agreement" between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Estonian Republic concerns inland fisheries, it does not alter the fact that, as from the date of accession, fisheries agreements concluded by the new Member States with third countries shall be managed by the Community.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, the Commission has not so far been involved in the meetings of the intergovernmental committee set up in accordance with the above mentioned "Agreement".</p>
<p>Between 10 – 12 July 2006, the European Community and the Russian Federation negotiated and concluded an Agreement on co-operation in fisheries and the conservation of the living marine resources in the Baltic Sea. The entry into force of this Agreement is currently pending the adoption by the Council of the Regulation on the conclusion of the Agreement and the subsequent signature of the Agreement by the Parties. This Agreement does not cover inland fisheries. However, the Commission will consider taking advantage of the contacts foreseen within the new bilateral Agreement for the Baltic Sea to raise the matter concerning the above-mentioned "Agreement" with its Russian fishery counterparts in order to explore the possible modalities of re-launching the consultations foreseen in this "Agreement" and progressively addressing the most important problems.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0544"></a>

<p>The prefabricated blocks of flats built in the V4 countries and in Bulgaria and Romania are now over 40 years old and they are in urgent need of refurbishment. The buildings are in such a poor state of repair primarily on account of system failures, defective statics, inadequate thermal insulation and high energy consumption. However, the granting of financial support from the Structural Funds for comprehensive refurbishment of the buildings is barred under the Commission's de minimis rule, pursuant to which State support to one and the same recipient may not exceed EUR 200 000 in any three-year period. In the case of prefabricated blocks of flats which are managed by just a handful of individuals (the housing collective), that is a very small amount. The average cost of refurbishment is EUR 17 058 per flat. Together with the Commission, ministers from the above-mentioned countries have appointed a group of experts to assess whether or not the terms and conditions governing the use of EU aid for the refurbishment of prefabricated blocks of flats are incorporated into current legislation.</p>

<p>The granting of financial support from the Structural Funds for comprehensive refurbishment of buildings is not limited to the Commission's de minimis regulation<a href="#defann_17_1" name="refann_17_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which allows the granting by Member States of a maximum of € 200,000 per beneficiary over any three year period.</p>
<p>In fact, the assistance for urban renewal under Community programmes, such as JESSICA (Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas), may exceed that amount. These programmes, which support the financing and implementation of urban development and renewal and social housing, play an important role in the new Cohesion policy for the period 2007-2013.</p>
<p>The de minimis rule is a regulation that sets a threshold figure below which support granted by a Member State does not have a substantial effect on competition and trade between Member States and therefore does not constitute State Aid in the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty. In this context, it is important to recall that when financing from the Structural Funds constitutes State Aid in the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty, it could then still be exempted from the notification obligation if it fulfils the criteria set out in the block exemption regulations (Small and Medium Enterprises, training, employment and regional aid).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, on account of its characteristics, State Aid to social housing is exempted from prior notification to the Commission, whatever the amount of support, provided certain conditions are met. The Commission's Decision of 28 November 2005<a href="#defann_17_2" name="refann_17_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> block exempted from the notification obligation State Aid to social housing, to the extent that it is a Service of General Economic Interest and fulfils the conditions set out in the Decision. This exemption would apply ceteris paribus to measures in favour of urban renewal in the context of social housing.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is important to stress that social housing measures which do not fulfil the above-mentioned conditions should be notified to the Commission and may still be declared compatible. Indeed, the Commission may and has authorised numerous State Aid measures concerning regeneration, including housing regeneration in areas experiencing or threatened by physical deterioration and social exclusion under the above Treaty provisions<a href="#defann_17_3" name="refann_17_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. The Commission will continue to take a positive view concerning housing regeneration measures comparable to those already approved, i.e. those measures addressing the needs of the most vulnerable citizens that cause relatively low distortion of competition and effect on intra-EU trade.</p>
<p>The Commission notes that it has responded in similar terms to the six Member States referred to by the Honourable Member.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The positive vote from the Parliament in July 2007 on the programme of Community Action in Health offers a solid legal basis for actions that we need to take at European level.</p>
<p>To achieve the Community goal of a more cohesive Europe, we need to reduce the major inequalities across the EU in terms of life expectancy, health status, and access to high-quality health services.</p>
<p>There are major differences across the EU not only in quality of life, but also in productivity and labour participation.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member rightly notes, the Programme focuses on addressing health inequalities, and provides for action to improve solidarity between health systems.</p>
<p>However, parallel to this, the Programme also aims to contribute to providing citizens with better access to information as a means to increasing their ability to exercise their rights and make decisions which cater for their best interests.</p>
<p>Such initiatives will need to take full account of consultation with a broad range of stakeholders, and in particular, will be shaped in partnership with organisations which represent patients’ interests.</p>
<p>The Programme provides the legal basis for offering financial support to non-governmental organisations or specialised networks, which take forward the agenda of the Programme.</p>
<p>The priorities and allocation of financial resources for the implementation of the Programme will be set each year on the basis of the annual work plan.</p>
<p>The issue of patient rights raised by the Honourable Member is important. The Commission would like to recall the discussions that it had with the Parliament on issues related to patient rights in the EU in March and in June this year.

<p>The Commission considers that European tourism industry has a strong growth and jobs potential. As outlined by the Commission in March 2006 in its Communication on a “A renewed EU Tourism Policy: Towards a stronger partnership for European Tourism”, the Commission aims to improve the competitiveness of the European tourism industry and create more and better jobs through the sustainable growth of tourism in Europe and globally, while acknowledging that the competence for tourism is essentially with Member States.</p>
<p>The most appropriate instruments for the attainment of this aim have been identified in the abovementioned Communication and imply co-ordination within the Commission and national authorities, co-operation between the different stakeholders, and the establishment of specific supporting actions in the following areas:</p>
<p>Mainstreaming measures affecting tourism</p>
<p>Policy-coordination</p>
<p>Most Community actions aiming to support the competitiveness of European tourism are carried out through the Enterprise policy instruments, nevertheless many other European policies impact tourism directly or indirectly. In order to reach policy-coordination:</p>
<p>each year, the initiatives that may affect tourism, included in the Commission Work Programme, are identified in order to make sure that their impact on the sector’s competitiveness will be taken into account at an early stage;</p>
<p>the members of the Advisory Committee on Tourism are kept informed on the tourism-related initiatives included in its Work Programme so that public administrations can also keep the various stakeholders, at national, regional and local level, regularly informed of the Commission initiatives;</p>
<p>the Commission consults with and informs the tourism stakeholders on issues and initiatives affecting tourism.</p>
<p>Improved use of available European financial instruments</p>
<p>Tourism has benefited greatly from the financial support offered by the various European financial instruments. In the period 2007-2013, the Structural Funds and other EU Programmes, will financially support and give Member States the possibility to support the development of tourism businesses, services and infrastructure (European Regional Development Fund, Cohesion Fund, European Social Fund, Integrated Lifelong Learning Programme, European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, European Fisheries Fund, Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, 7th EC Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration activities, to name the most important ones).</p>
<p>Promoting tourism sustainability</p>
<p>A European Agenda 21 for tourism</p>
<p>The Commission launched the preparation of a European Agenda 21 for tourism and set up in 2004 the Tourism Sustainability Group (TSG) in order to encourage stakeholder synergies and to provide input into the Agenda 21 process for the sustainability of European tourism.</p>
<p>The TSG has finalised its work in a report published in February 2007, the Commission has organised a public consultation exercise in April-June and building on the report will present in 2007 a communication for a European Agenda 21 for tourism.</p>
<p>Enhancing the understanding and the visibility of tourism</p>
<p>Improving the understanding and visibility of tourism: a common goal</p>
<p>Each year, since 2002, an Annual European Tourism Forum is hosted by a different Member State. It is organised in close collaboration with the Commission, the Member States and the European tourism industry. This year the European Tourism Forum will be held in Algarve on 25<span class="sup">th</span> – 26<span class="sup">th</span> October.</p>
<p>Also a number of Council Presidencies have been organising Tourism Ministerial meetings, specific Conferences and events or co-organising the European Tourism Forum with the host countries. The Commission will continue to actively support such initiatives and to encourage future Presidencies to do likewise.</p>
<p>Supporting the promotion of European destinations</p>
<p>To contribute to the marketing of Europe as a set of attractive tourist destinations the Commission financed the creation of the European Tourist Destinations Portal and entrusted the European Travel Commission with its management. It is also managing a “European destinations of excellence award” in close collaboration with Member States.</p>
<p>Finally, it analysed the impact of sport and cultural events on tourism oriented small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in order to address recommendations to future event hosts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0554"></a>

<p>The Commission has been supporting since 1998 the efforts of successive Bolivian Governments in reducing coca's cultivation and its illegal transformation into cocaine. Community aid has thus funded "alternative / comprehensive development" programmes in Bolivia aiming mainly at:</p>
<p>promoting sustainable socio-economic development;</p>
<p>easing availability as well as access to basic services for the population of both coca cultivation and labour out-migration regions;</p>
<p>strenghtening local institutions (municipalities).</p>
<p>These activities go beyond the substitution of coca's cultivation with other crops (pineapple, palm-hearts, green pepper, passion fruit, bananas, etc.) and try to favour a locally driven development process.</p>
<p>Continued EU presence in this crucial area of cooperation is foreseen under the 2007-2013 Bolivia's Country Strategy Paper (CSP), presented to the Parliament's Committee on Development in March 2007 and adopted by the Commission in July 2007.</p>
<p>One of the three priority sectors of the CSP is: "Supporting Bolivia's fight against illicit drug production and trafficking – comprehensive development and rationalisation of coca production through social control mechanisms".</p>
<p>The 2007 Bolivia's Annual Action Programme is focusing on this specific sector with two actions:</p>
<p>Support to the National Comprehensive Development Plan (€ 26 million)</p>
<p>Support to the Social Control of Coca Production (€ 10 million)</p>

This culture-friendly approach requires serious reflection on how online licensing is best organised across the EU. Licensing models that are good for culture and repertoire should not be abandoned merely because they imply certain changes to traditional forms of rights management.</p>
<p>The Commission now intends to assess the development of the EU's online licensing practices in the music sector in the light of the Commission Recommendation of 18 October 2005. On 17 January 2007 the Commission invited the Parliament and all interested stakeholders to submit views and comments on their initial experience with the Recommendation and, in particular, on their views how the EU licensing of niche repertoire could be further encouraged. All stakeholders were invited to comment on the above-mentioned issues until 1 July 2007. As responses were still received by the end of July, the process of reviewing the submissions is still ongoing. After thorough examination the Commission will assess further policy steps with respect to how collecting societies operate online but also in the traditional offline environment. While it is too early to envisage future policy, any follow-up, if necessary, will be closely co-ordinated with the Parliament and the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0563"></a>

<p>The Commission is continuously developing with the Council, the Parliament and the Member States a common integrated border management policy. The FRONTEX Agency is a key component of that policy.</p>
<p>Since its setting up, numerous border control operations have been successfully coordinated by FRONTEX. The joint operations have proven their added value at European level and will be further complemented by the establishment of Rapid Border Intervention Teams (RABIT). The Council and the Parliament adopted this new regulation on 11 July 2007<a href="#defann_24_1" name="refann_24_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As regard the technical equipment at FRONTEX disposal, the Commission should recall that in accordance with Article 7 of Council Regulation (EC) no 2007/2004 establishing the FRONTEX Agency, "the Agency shall set up and keep centralised records of technical equipment for control and surveillance of external borders belonging to Member States, which they, on a voluntary basis and upon request of another Member State, are willing to put at the disposal of that Member State for a temporary period following a needs and risks analysis carried out by the Agency".</p>
<p>It should be highlighted that the technical equipment, which can be used for control and surveillance of the external borders, is made available by Member States on a voluntary basis and upon request from another Member State. Furthermore the technical equipment remains the property of the contributing Member State. The list of technical equipment is an evolving list, which needs to be adapted on a regular basis to take into account new or changing situations related to the control and surveillance of external borders of the Member States.</p>
<p>As the information on equipment provided by Member States to the FRONTEX Agency is not in the public domain, the Commission is not in a position to provide an overview of the contributions by Member States.</p>
<p>In this context the Commission would like to refer to the reply it provided on written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2007-1676_EN.html">E-1676/07</a> by Mr Vanhecke on the same subject.</p>
<p>Readmission and return are important elements of the European efforts to tackle illegal immigration. Specific initiatives are taken to identify the country of origin of those who arrive at the borders of EU Member States, also in view of their possible repatriation. The EC has concluded readmission agreements with several countries like Sri Lanka, the Russian Federation and Albania. EC readmission agreements with Ukraine, Bosia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, FYROM, Serbia and Moldova are in the process of ratficiation and negotiations with Morocco should be finalized soon. Article 13 of the Partnership Agreement between the African, Caribbean and Pacific States and the EU and its Member States also includes clear readmission obligations.</p>
<p>In this context the Commission would like to underline the importance she attaches to ensuring that return operations take place in full compliance with fundamental rights, the international humanitarian obligations and the rule of law.</p>
<p>Moreover, in its Communication on circular migration and mobility partnership adopted on 16 May 2007, the Commission announced that the EU is ready to negotiate mobility partnerships with third countries that have committed themselves to cooperating actively on management of migration flows, and would be ready to work closely with the EU and its Member States in the fight against illegal migration, including readmission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>At the initiative of the Commission a proposed new framework directive on type-approval has been submitted to the Institutions on 14 July 2003. This Directive is a recast of Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers<a href="#defann_25_3" name="refann_25_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. Its main objective is to extend the Community whole vehicle type-approval to categories of vehicles which were partially excluded until now, i.e. commercial vehicles (vans, trucks, buses and minibuses, coaches, trailers and semi-trailers ).</p>
<p>On 23 July 2007, the Council has accepted the amendments adopted by the Parliament in second reading. Therefore, the publication of the framework Directive is expected to take place in October 2007.</p>
<p>One of the major consequences of the implementation of the Community whole vehicle type-approval to commercial vehicles is that more than 40 separate directives dealing with safety will become mandatory in the European Union. Concretely, that means that vehicles will have to be fitted with type-approved safety devices such as antilock brakes, new rear-view mirrors, front-, rear underrun- and side-protections, day-time running lamps etc. The mandatory fitting of electronic stability control is under consideration.</p>
<p>Community type-approval for commercial vehicles will be enforced on a voluntary basis in a first step from January 2009 and a bit later on a compulsory basis in relation to a timetable which has been settled by the Institutions.</p>
<p>The Commission is convinced that these important measures will significantly contribute to improve road safety.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission attaches great importance to the protection and promotion of human rights and consistently calls on both parties – Israel and the Palestinian Authority – to comply with their commitments under international law. The Commission is of the view that there is sufficient human rights monitoring capacity in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory.</p>
<p>The EU Presidency, the Commission, and Member States on the ground monitor the situation very closely and have regular exchanges on the human rights situation both in Jerusalem and in Tel Aviv. Abundant information is also available through various other reliable sources, such as the non-governmental organisations monitoring human rights.</p>
<p>The situation of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is also regularly on agenda of the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council and is monitored by Mr John Dugard, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.</p>
<p>Respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, and international law constitutes an essential element of our Association Agreement with Israel. In the framework of the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) Action Plan with Israel, special attention is given to the respect, promotion and upholding of these values. Human rights issues, including those related to access and movement, are regularly raised with the relevant Israeli authorities in the framework of the political dialogue subcommittee as well as in the Informal Group on Human Rights.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission is committed to continue close cooperation with civil society in promoting human rights. This includes providing funding to local organizations through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR). Human rights issues are mainstreamed to all EU assistance, including the civil society programmes.</p>
<p>With regard to hindered access of the Palestinians to work, health and education facilities, the European Union has consistently called for the full implementation of the Agreement on Movement and Access of 2005.

<p>Growing dairy product demand from countries such as India and China is causing the price of milk to rise. Milk, containing very many vitamins and nutrients, is of vital importance to countries threatened with famine. Most people in Africa already only drink powdered milk, since there are no means of producing real milk locally. For those countries reliant solely on imports, the increase in the price of milk on the world market is life-threatening. Other poor countries which do produce milk and can see that demand is rising do not have the resources to increase their production and compete with the large European firms.</p>
<p>A very considerable rise in milk and dairy product prices over the next few years is forecast. In a development cooperation context, too, how will the Commission respond to this change?

<p>The current developments on the world dairy market are simply the result of supply and demand. This market situation may continue for some time, but it seems likely that in the medium term, prices will come down from their current very high levels.</p>
<p>With all aid schemes for the EU dairy sector at zero, the milk quota system is the only "active" dairy market management instrument.</p>
<p>Changes to the quota system should be well prepared and not based on conjunctural movements on the international market. Although it is true that the milk quota system is not very flexible for the short term, it is also a reality that milk production cannot be increased from one day to another, even in the absence of a quota system. Increases in EU quota of almost 500.000 tonnes are programmed for this year and next year.</p>
<p>The upcoming discussions in the context of the Health Check are meant to see if the policy reform of 2003 achieves its objectives: a competitive, market oriented and sustainable agriculture. This includes the dairy policy.</p>
<p>It must be born in mind that milk production will only expand if it is profitable. Since producers are confronted by increased prices for their raw materials, their profit margins can only be maintained (or increased) if they are rewarded with higher prices for their milk.</p>
<p>In its Development Policy, the Commission encourages and supports all initiatives which can help our partners in reaching the Millenium Development Goals. The livestock sector, including dairy, is a major contributor to poverty reduction and to equitable, safe and sustainable economic growth promotion.</p>
<p>The conjunctural market situation will not change dramatically the development process engaged in by developing countries to develop their national dairy markets, but high prices may actually facilitate this process and underline the relevance of investments made. In addition, through Development Cooperation, the Commission tries to assist farmers in developing countries to comply with the demanding rules for regional and international market access.</p>

<p>The Commission supports the projects of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) Roadmap through the preparatory phase grants of the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme (FP7). The preparatory phase will allow each project, in particular, to develop a financial engineering plan needed for the actual construction phase.</p>
<p>Around €147 million will be used in 2007 and 2008 for the preparatory phases which should have a catalytic effect on national funding, the main source of funding for the construction. The next call for proposal for Community support concerning the preparatory phase is planned for 2010 with an indicative budget of €70 million. It should be noted that from 2009 onward, €130 million, of which €60 million for the e-infrastructures projects, should be made available to support directly the construction of a few projects in complement to national funding.</p>
<p>As regards financial support through Cohesion Policy Funds, national or regional authorities are expected to support a limited number of projects of the ESFRI Roadmap. In the majority of cases, financing through Cohesion Policy Funds would be based on the contribution of the projects to the objectives of the programmes and used mainly for satellite regional installations that should allow for the preparation of national teams before they can access directly large installations.</p>
<p>The European Investment Bank (EIB) is a possible source of financing with the instruments specific to a bank (loans, guarantees, etc.). Within this framework the Commission is planning to organise before the end of 2007 (the date of 16 November 2007 is envisaged) an information day, including bilateral meetings, for the coordinators of the ESFRI's list. The representatives of the EIB will present the financial instruments proposed by the EIB to support such projects and will be available to discuss with the coordinators the specific needs for their projects.</p>
<p>In addition, the Risk Sharing Finance Facility (RSFF), a new scheme developed by the Commission and the EIB and managed by the EIB, may be used, to support the projects of the ESFRI Roadmap. Already, in 2007, €40 million have been provided by the FP7 Research Infrastructure Programme to the RSFF. The FP7 legal basis foresees a total contribution for this action for the period 2007 – 2013 amounting to €200 million.</p>
<p>As an output of the Communication recently adopted on the synergies between FP7, the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP), and the Cohesion Funds ("Competitive European regions through research and innovation: A contribution to more growth and more and better jobs"), the Commission will prepare by the end of 2007 a practical guide looking at the funding opportunities through the eyes of a research institution or a company wishing to use EU funding to undertake research and innovation activities.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the work programme 2008 of the Regions of Knowledge Programme of FP7 (Capacities Specific Programme) will identify "Maximising the benefits of research infrastructures<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> for regional development" as one of the two themes of the call for proposals in its dimension "Analysis and formulation of research agendas and definition of a Joint Action Plan" (budget foreseen: €9.3 million; funding scheme: coordination and support actions of an average amount of €1 million).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all these potential sources of funding it is clear that the smooth implementation of the projects of the ESFRI Roadmap will also require a very substantial increase in the infrastructure budget of the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The railways privatisation policy, involving the payment of subsidies worth billions of euros to undertakings in this sector, has adversely affected labour relations and workers' rights in the railway sector. It has also led to staff shortages in most Member States, notably in all branches of the Hellenic Railways Organisation, in the UK and elsewhere; this in turn has led to poor standards of maintenance and repairs of rolling stock, which poses a danger for the safety of workers and passengers. It is particularly alarming that the number of accidents has increased recently, especially since services were handed over to the private sector and with the leasing of train services by companies. The crash between a passenger and freight train in Athens on 12.07.2007 in which 53 people were injured and the 15 train derailments in Greece recently illustrate the scale of the problem.</p>
<p>Does the Commission not agree that rail transport is a social benefit which cannot be provided satisfactorily by private companies? Does it consider that a radically new policy is needed to transform railways so that they provide cheap, modern and safe transport for workers?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission considers that railway transport has a number of positive socio-economic effects, notably by providing mobility to all social groups in an environmentally sustainable manner. Rail is also a very safe mode of transport. However, in many countries the national railway undertakings have not been able to adapt the service offer to the changing needs of modern societies and economies.</p>
<p>This has led to a decline of railway transport in Europe since the 1970ies. In order to revitalise the railway sector the Commission has initiated in the 1990ies a new policy aiming at integrating the market at EU level and at overcoming the technical and regulatory fragmentation of national rail transport systems. The implementation of this policy calls for a restructuring of the national railway undertakings to enable them to organise production more efficiently and to provide modern transport services geared to the needs of their customers and users. It does not however require necessarily the privatisation of these undertakings.</p>
<p>This new policy starts to bear fruit as the Commission concluded in its report on the implementation of the first railway package of May 2006<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.

<p>The Tourism Sustainability Group , which was set up in 2005 and is chaired by the Commission in order to provide input for the Agenda 21 for European tourism, has debated the effect of tourism on the economy, the environment and the quality of life of inhabitants in tourist destinations, but there has been no particular focus on management of “popular” destinations.</p>
<p>However, the Commission has published studies that are linked to this issue, such as the “Early warning system for identifying declining tourism destinations and preventive best practices” (2004) where the signals of decline pertain to the economic, social and environmental dimensions and where the focus is on destinations with a certain tradition in providing tourism.</p>
<p>The Tourism Sustainability Group has considered the possibility to propose a charter of rights and obligations of European tourists. It came to the conclusion that more knowledge on the effectiveness and exchange of practical experience of these approaches in different parts of Europe is needed. The Group also discussed a European code of conduct for tourist undertakings, but decided to first consider thoroughly the existing certification schemes (i.e. eco-labels).</p>
<p>The first experiences with the initiative "European Destinations of Excellence" are very encouraging. 9 Member States (Austria, Belgium (Wallonie), Cyprus, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Malta) and 1 candidate country (Croatia) had participated in the first year of the pilot project. The number of participating countries in the second year has almost doubled (16 Member States: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Spain - and 2 candidate countries: Croatia and Turkey). Three more countries have shown an interest in being associated to the project.</p>
<p>This high participation is a clear demonstration of the interest in the pilot project. The involvement in the first year of the project has been used by participants to raise awareness of the importance of rural resources, local heritage and sustainability in tourism, to cope with seasonality, to award destinations which have implemented initiatives and strategies helping to stimulate tourism demand, to encourage other destinations to launch new initiatives and implement successful pilot projects and to help model initiatives to gain international recognition.</p>
<p>Thanks to the project, hidden and not quite well known European destinations will be brought to the forefront. The opportunity of networking with European destinations selected in other countries, domestic networking among applicants, the promotion of best-practice and the exchange of experience in the field of sustainable destination management have also been considered as an important opportunity provided by taking part in the pilot project.</p>
<p>The Commission launched the pilot project which has been requested by the Parliament with the intention of highlighting the variety and quality of tourism destinations in Europe and to further promote this important sector of European economy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0582"></a>

<p>There is no specific budget line for allocation of funds to the Baltic Sea Strategy. However, it is important to promote a regional approach to existing problems in a more coordinated way, for example by getting the countries in the region to think about programming their structural funds interventions, in order to take account of the common needs of the regions involved. It is important that the Member States in the region should be committed to such an approach.</p>
<p>Under the European Territorial Cooperation objective, the transnational cooperation programme "Baltic Sea Region" (BSR) covers the whole region. It could therefore provide a useful instrument for further coordination, should the partners so wish. Participating Member States are Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Germany (northern parts), Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. The total allocation from the European Regional Development Fund for the programme is € 208 million for the period 2007-2013.</p>
<p>The neighbouring countries of Norway, Russia (north-western regions) and Belarus also participate in the activities of the BSR programme. Norway will make available their own additional funding and some € 23 million will be provided by the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) to allow participation of the eligible regions in Russia and Belarus.</p>
<p>The overall strategy of the BSR programme is to strengthen the development towards a sustainable, competitive and territorially integrated region by connecting potential interests and partners across the borders. The focus is on preparation of investments aimed at improving the territorial potential of the region, minimising the considerable differences in the level of socio-economic development between the western and eastern parts and at resolving several issues of common concern for all the countries around the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>The priorities of the BSR programme are as follows:</p>
<p>Fostering of innovations across the BSR,</p>
<p>External and internal accessibility of the BSR,</p>
<p>Management of the Baltic Sea as a common Resource,</p>
<p>Promoting attractive and competitive cities and regions.</p>
<p>Moreover, numerous other programmes cover different parts of the BSR. These include convergence programmes, competitiveness and employment programmes and territorial cooperation programmes and they are financed from the budget lines of the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0585"></a>

<p>The infringement procedure to which the Honourable Member refers relates to non-compliance by Malta with the hunting provisions of Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> (the Birds Directive). The non-compliance in question concerns an annual spring hunting season for the hunting of two species, Quail (Coturnix coturnix) and Turtle Dove (Streptopelia turtur). The problem is one which presents itself on an annual basis, during the months of March, April and May, corresponding with the period of the spring migration for the birds.</p>
<p>In this case, the Commission launched infringement proceedings under Article 226 of the Treaty, sending to the Maltese authorities a Letter of Formal Notice in June 2006 addressing the breach of the Birds Directive and a supplementary Letter of Formal Notice in March 2007. Responses from the Maltese authorities to both Letters were subsequently received in April 2007.</p>
<p>In view of the need to assess the detailed information provided by the Maltese authorities under the infringement procedure, no decision as to the next possible step in the infringement procedure has been made yet. In addition, the Commission also sought to assess whether the decision taken by the Maltese authorities in May 2007 to prematurely end the spring hunting season (permitting 30 days spring hunting rather than 40 days) indicated a change in policy by the Maltese authorities.</p>
<p>If, in light of the information provided by the Maltese authorities, the Commission considers that the grounds for the breach remain, the Commission will continue the infringement procedure in accordance with the Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
