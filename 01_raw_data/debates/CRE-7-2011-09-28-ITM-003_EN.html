<p class="contents">We are currently facing the greatest challenge that our Union has ever faced, I believe, in its entire history. This is a financial, economic and social crisis, but also a confidence crisis; a confidence crisis both in relation to our leaders in general, to Europe itself, and in relation to our ability to find solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The causes of the crisis are known: Europe has not met the challenges of competitiveness. Some of our Member States have lived above their means. In the financial markets, there has been irresponsible and unacceptable behaviour. We have let the gap widen between our Member States, particularly in the euro area. What is more, the shocks that have shaken the international order and the pressures of globalisation have made the situation even worse.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome is there to be seen: our societies are deeply concerned. Many of our citizens fear for the future. There is like never before a danger of national withdrawal, or even nationalistic withdrawal. Populist responses bring into question the European Union’s great successes: the euro, the single market, even the free movement of people.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we can safely say that the sovereign debt crisis is now first and foremost a political crisis of confidence. Our citizens, but also the outside world, are watching us and are asking themselves: Are we really a Union? Do we really have the will to support the single currency? Are the most vulnerable Member States determined to implement essential reforms? Are the most prosperous Member States really committed to showing solidarity? Is Europe really able to achieve growth and create jobs?</p>
<p class="contents">I am telling you now: yes, this is a serious situation, but there are solutions to this crisis. Europe does have a future, provided we restore confidence. And to restore confidence, we need stability, growth, but also political will on the part of political leaders. We must work together to present our citizens with a European revival.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We now need to make a reality of what we concluded in the Berlin Declaration, signed by the Commission, Parliament and the European Council at the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome – at the time, we said …</p>
<p class="contents">‘Today we live together as was never possible before. We, the citizens of the European Union, have united for the better.’ </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">President of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> ‘Today we live together, as never was possible before. We, the citizens of the European Union, have united for the better.’ This is a declaration, and the words count. We must live out this will in the courage of each day. With our institutions, and not against them, we can succeed. We know that some see the need for stability as paramount. For others, it is growth. I say to you: we need both. Some preach discipline, others solidarity. We need both. We can no longer have ad hoc or partial solutions. We must be determined in finding comprehensive solutions, we must have a greater ambition for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I really believe that we are currently at a turning point in our history, a time when, if we do not move forward with integration, we run the risk of fragmentation. Therefore, this is a matter of political will, an ‘ordeal by fire’ for our entire generation.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, it is possible to end this crisis. Not only is it possible, but it is necessary. Herein lies political leadership: making possible that which is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span> </p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with Greece. Greece is and will remain a member of the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Greece must implement its commitments in full and on time. In turn, the other euro area members have pledged to support Greece and each other. As stated at the Euro Area Summit on 21 July: ‘We are determined to continue to provide support to countries under programmes until they have regained market access, provided they successfully implement those programmes.’ That is why I created the Task Force for Greece. We have just launched an action plan based on two major pillars: around 100 viable and high-quality projects, investing in all Greek regions, to make the best use of Greece’s remaining allocation of the Structural Funds, and a major drive to reduce bureaucratic procedures for European co-funded projects. EUR 15 billion remain to be spent in Greece from the Structural Funds. This will support the Greek economy with an urgent programme of technical assistance to the Greek administration. A programme of EUR 500 million to guarantee European Investment Bank loans to Greek SMEs is already under way.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also considering a wider guarantee mechanism to help banks start lending again to the real economy. All of this represents huge support for Greece’s fight-back and Greece will have to deliver concrete results. It must break with counter-productive practices and resist vested interests. But we have to be clear about this. This is not a sprint, but a marathon.</p>
<p class="contents">The task of building a Union of Stability and Responsibility is not only about Greece. The economic outlook that we face is very difficult. We are confronted with the negative effects of an ongoing global reassessment of risks. It is therefore our responsibility to rebuild confidence and trust in the euro and our Union as a whole. We can do this by showing that we are able to take all the decisions needed to run a single currency and an integrated economy in a competitive, inclusive and resource-efficient way.</p>
<p class="contents">For this we need to act in the short, the medium and the long term. Let us start with the short term. The first step is to quickly fix the way we respond to the sovereign debt crisis. This will require stronger mechanisms for crisis resolution. We need credible firepower and effective firewalls for the euro. We have to build on the EFSF and the upcoming European Stability Mechanism. The EFSF must immediately be made both stronger and more flexible. This is what the Commission proposed already in January. This is what Heads of State or Government of the euro area agreed upon on 21 July. Only then, when you ratify this, will the EFSF be able to deploy precautionary intervention; to intervene to support the recapitalisation of banks and intervene in the secondary markets to help avoid contagion.</p>
<p class="contents">Once the EFSF is ratified, we should make the most efficient use of its financial envelope. The Commission is working on options to this end. Moreover we should do everything possible to accelerate the entry into force of the ESM. Naturally we trust that the European Central Bank – in full respect of the Treaty – will do whatever is necessary to ensure the integrity of the euro area and to ensure its financial stability.</p>
<p class="contents">But we cannot stop there. We must deepen economic coordination and integration, particularly in the euro area. This is at least as big a political task as an economic one.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, you will vote on the ‘six-pack’ proposals that we have put before you and the Council one year ago. This ‘six pack’ reforms the Stability and Growth Pact and widens surveillance to macroeconomic balances. We are now back very close to what the Commission originally put on the table. You have played a decisive role in keeping the level of ambition of these proposals, and I really want to thank you and congratulate you for that.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislation will give us much stronger enforcement mechanisms. We can now discuss Member States’ budgetary plans before national decisions are taken. This mix of discipline and integration holds the key to the future of the euro area. Only with more integration and discipline can we have a really credible euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">These are indeed important steps forward, but we must go further. We need to complete our monetary union with an economic union. We need to achieve the tasks of Maastricht. It was an illusion to think that we could have a single currency and a single market with national approaches to economic and budgetary policy. Let us avoid another illusion that we can have a single currency and a single market with an intergovernmental approach.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">For the euro area to be credible – and this is not only the message of the federalists, this is the message of the markets – we need a truly Community approach. We need to really integrate the euro area; we need to complete the monetary union with a real economic union. And this truly Community approach can be built how? In the coming weeks, the Commission will build on the ‘six pack’ and present a proposal for a single, coherent framework to deepen economic coordination and integration, particularly in the euro area. This will be done in a way that ensures the compatibility between the euro area and the Union as a whole. Of course, we do not want the euro area to break the great acquis of the single market and all our four freedoms. At the same time, we can pool decision-making to enhance our competitiveness. This could be done by integrating the Euro Plus Pact into this framework, in full respect of the national implementation competences.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of this to work, we need more than ever the independent authority of the Commission to propose and assess actions that the Member States should take. Governments, let us be frank, cannot do this by themselves. Nor can this be done by negotiations between governments. Indeed, within the Community competences, the Commission is the economic government of the Union; we certainly do not need more institutions for this.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">For the same reason the Treaties have created supranational institutions. For the same reason the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the Court of Justice of the European Union were created. The Commission is the guarantor of fairness. Moreover, the Commission, which naturally works in partnership with the Member States, is voted by and accountable to this House, the directly elected Parliament both of the euro area and of the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is also time to have unified external representation of the euro area. In accordance with the Treaty the Commission will make proposals for this purpose. A Union of Stability and Responsibility built on this basis and with a common approach will also allow the Member States to seize fully the advantages of a bigger market for the issuance of sovereign debt. Once the euro area is fully equipped with the instruments necessary to ensure both integration and discipline, the issuance of joint debt will be seen as a natural and advantageous step for all, on condition that such eurobonds will be ‘stability bonds’, bonds that are designed in a way that rewards those who play by the rules and deters those who do not. As I already announced to this House, the Commission will present options for such ‘stability bonds’ in the coming weeks. Some of these options can be implemented within the current Treaty, whereas fully fledged eurobonds would require Treaty change. This is important because, we can do a lot within the existing Treaty of Lisbon. And there is no excuse for not doing it, and for not doing it now, but it may be necessary to consider further changes to the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also thinking particularly of the constraint of unanimity. The pace of our joint endeavour cannot be dictated by the slowest. Today we have a Union where it is the slowest member that dictates the speed of all the other Member States. This is also not credible from the markets’ point of view; this is why we need to solve this problem of decision-making. A Member State has of course the right not to accept decisions. That is a question, as they say, of national sovereignty, but a Member State does not have the right to block the moves of others; the others also have their national sovereignty and, if they want to go further, they should go further.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Our willingness to envisage Treaty change should not be a way or an excuse to delay the reforms that are necessary today, but I believe that this longer-term perspective will reinforce the credibility of our decisions now.</p>
<p class="contents">A Union of Stability and Responsibility means swiftly completing the work on a new system of regulation for the financial sector. We need well capitalised, responsible banks lending to the real economy. Much has been said about the alleged vulnerability of some of our banks. European banks have substantially strengthened their capital positions over the past year. They are now raising capital to fill the remaining gaps identified by the stress tests in summer. This is necessary to limit the damage of financial market turbulence on the real economy and on jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last three years, we have designed a new system of financial regulation. Let us remember, we have already tabled 29 pieces of legislation. You have already adopted several of them, including the creation of independent supervising authorities, which are already working. Now it is important to approve our proposals for new rules on derivatives, naked short selling and credit default swaps, fair remuneration for bankers. These propositions are there; they should be adopted by the Council and by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will deliver the remaining proposals by the end of this year, namely rules on credit rating agencies, bank resolution and personal responsibility of financial operatives. So we will be the first constituency in the G20 to have delivered on our commitment to global efforts for financial regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last three years, Member States – I should say taxpayers – have granted aid and provided guarantees of EUR 4.6 trillion to the financial sector. It is time for the financial sector to make a contribution back to society.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am very proud to say that today the Commission adopted a proposal for the Financial Transaction Tax.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Today I am putting before you a very important text that if implemented may generate revenue of about EUR 55 billion per year. Some people will ask ‘Why?’. Why? It is a question of fairness. If our farmers, if our workers, if all the sectors of the economy, from industry to agriculture to services, pay a contribution to society, the banking sector should also give a contribution to society.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">And if we need – because we need – fiscal consolidation, if we need more revenues, the question is where these revenues are coming from. Are we going to tax labour more? Are we going to tax consumption more? I think it is fair to tax financial activities that in some of our Member States do not pay the proportionate contribution to society.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is not only financial institutions who should pay a fair share. We cannot afford to turn a blind eye to tax evasion. So it is time to adopt our proposals on savings tax within the European Union, and I call on the Member States to finally give the Commission the mandate we have asked for to negotiate tax agreements for the whole European Union with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Stability and responsibility are not enough on their own. We need stability, but we also need growth. We need responsibility, but we also need solidarity. The common economy can only remain strong if it delivers growth and jobs. That is why we must unleash the energy of our economy, especially the real economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The forecasts today point to a strong slowdown, but significant growth in Europe is not an impossible dream. It will not come magically tomorrow, but we can create the conditions for growth to resume. We have done it before. We must and we can do it again.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we do not have much room for a new fiscal stimulus. But that does not mean that we cannot do more to promote growth. First, those who have fiscal space available must explore it – but in a sustainable way. Second, all Member States need to promote structural reforms so that we can increase our competitiveness in the world and promote growth. Together, we can and must tap the potential of the Single Market, exploit all the benefits of trade and mobilise investment at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with the Single Market. Full implementation of the Services Directive alone could, according to our estimates, deliver up to EUR 140 billion in economic gains, but today, two years after the deadline for implementation, several Member States have still not adopted the necessary laws so we are not benefiting from all the possible gains from having a true services liberalisation in Europe. But we can also do more. We must adopt what is on the table. We have adopted the Single Market Act in the European Commission. A number of key initiatives are ready. We are close to having a European patent which would cut the cost of protection to 20% of current costs. I expect this to be concluded by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, for the Single Market Act, we should consider a fast-track legislative procedure. By the way, in many areas we should follow a fast-track legislative procedure because we are living in real emergency times. This will allow us to respond to these extraordinary circumstances. Growth in the future will depend more and more on harnessing information technology. We need a digital single market, which will benefit each and every European by around EUR 1 500 per year by using the possibilities of e-commerce to end for instance mobile roaming charges. An extra 10% in broadband penetration would bring us between 1 and 1.5% of extra annual growth.</p>
<p class="contents">In a competitive world we must be also well-educated, with skills to face these new challenges. We must innovate and we must act in a sustainable way. We have already presented detailed proposals on innovation, resource-efficiency and how we can strengthen our industrial base. Modern industrial policy is about investing in research and innovation. We need to accelerate the adoption of our efforts to boost the use of venture capital to fund young, innovative companies across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainable jobs will come if we focus on innovation and new technologies, including green technologies. We must see that ‘green’ and growth go together. For example, the renewables sector has already created 300 000 jobs in the past five years in the European Union. The global green technology market will triple over the next decade.</p>
<p class="contents">We must focus our action on where it makes a real impact. Growth in the future means we must actively pursue also our smart regulation agenda, which will give a saving of EUR 38 billion for European companies, particularly for SMEs, but Member States must also do their part in reducing the administrative burden. But we also need investment. These reforms are important, but we also need some kind of investment at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">A Union of Growth and Solidarity needs modern, interconnected infrastructures. We have proposed for the next MFF (Multiannual Financial Framework) to create a facility to connect Europe – in energy, in transport, in digital. This innovative part of our MFF proposal has to be seen together with another very important innovative idea: the project bond. In the coming weeks the Commission will publish its proposals for EU project bonds. We are also proposing pilot projects, so that we can frontload growth. We can do it even before the MFF is adopted. In this way we can frontload some of the major infrastructure investments Europe needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union and its Member States should urgently consider how to allow our own policy-driven bank, the European Investment Bank, to do more – possibly much more – to finance long-term investment. To do so, we need to explore ways to reinforce the EIB’s resources and capital base so that it can lend to the real economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the year 2000 there was EUR 22 billion of venture capital in Europe. In 2010 there was only 3 billion. If we want to promote entrepreneurship we must reverse this decline and we need that support namely for SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">We can also get more growth out of the Structural Funds, by increasing absorption capacity, using the Structural Funds to support macroeconomic performance. They are essential for innovation, for training, employment, and for SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to urge this House to adopt by the end of the year the proposals we made in August to increase cofinancing rates to those countries with assistance programmes. This will inject essential funding into these economies, while reducing pressure on national budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Reforms to our labour markets, public finances and pension systems require a major effort from all parts of society. We all know these changes are necessary, so that we can reform our social market economy and keep our social model, but it is imperative that we hold on to our values – the values of fairness, of inclusiveness and of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Right now we need to give concrete hope to the one in five of our young people who cannot find work. In some countries, the situation of our young people is dramatic. I want to call on companies to make a special effort to provide internships and apprenticeships for young people. These can be supported by the European Social Fund. By getting businesses, the social partners, national authorities and the European Union level involved in a Young Opportunities Initiative, we can make a difference. This I believe is the most urgent social matter: to respond to the anxiety of our young people who cannot find a job. It is much better to have an apprenticeship, a traineeship, than to take their anxieties onto the streets expressing their lack of confidence in the Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We must accelerate the most urgent parts of our Growth and Jobs Plan, Europe 2020. The Commission will focus on the situation of young people in each and every Member State in its country-specific recommendations for next year. I believe we must give our future a real chance. But right now we also need to act to help the 80 million Europeans at risk of poverty. This means that the Council must finally approve our proposal to safeguard the programme for the supply of food for the most deprived persons.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank this Parliament for the political support it has given to our proposed solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifty years ago, 12 countries in Europe came together to sign the Social Charter. To be precise, it was in October 50 years ago. Today, the Charter has 47 signatories, including all our Member States. To guarantee these fundamental values in Europe, I believe we need to boost the quality of social dialogue at European level. The renewal of Europe can only succeed with the input and the ownership of all the social partners – of trade unions, of workers, of business, civil society in general.</p>
<p class="contents">We should remember that our Europe is a Europe of citizens. As citizens, we all gain through Europe. We gain a European identity and citizenship apart from our national citizenship. European citizenship adds a set of rights and opportunities – the opportunity to freely cross borders, to study, to work abroad. Here again, we must all stand up and preserve and develop these rights and opportunities, just as the Commission is doing now with our proposals on Schengen. We will not tolerate a rolling-back of our citizens’ rights. We will defend the freedom of movement and all the freedoms in our Union.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span> </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">President of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Honourable Members, the Commission works in many other areas, as you are aware.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot mention them all here, but you can find them in the letter that I sent to the President of the European Parliament and that you will have all received. Nonetheless, before concluding, let me talk about the European Union’s external responsibility. I want an open Europe, a Europe that is involved in the world. European action in the world is not only the best guarantee for our citizens, for defending our interests and values, but it is also much-needed in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">These days it is trendy to talk about the G2. I think that the world does not want a G2. Even the two in question would not find it beneficial to have a G2. We know that a bipolar world brought about tension during the cold war. I believe that Europe is more than ever indispensable, if we want a just and open world. I believe the changing world we are living in needs a Europe that assumes its responsibilities. An influential Europe, a Europe of 27, and soon with Croatia’s accession, a Europe of 28. A Europe that continues to lead the way, whether in terms of trade or climate change, at a time when we are coming up to major events: from Durban to Rio+20. Europe must hold on to its leadership on these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us also turn our eyes and our attention to our southern neighbours. The Arab spring represents a deep transformation that will have far-reaching consequences, not only for the people in those countries, but also for us, for our Europe. That is why Europe should be proud. We were the first to stand alongside the Tunisians, Egyptians and Libyans who wanted democracy and freedom. That is why Europe supports these legitimate aspirations, particularly through our partnership for democracy and for prosperity. The Arab spring, I hope, also opens the door to the hope of peace for the whole region, to the idea of a Palestinian State that must live in peace with the State of Israel, which is what Europe would like to see.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let us also turn our eyes and our attention to our eastern neighbours. This Friday I will be attending the Eastern Partnership Summit in Warsaw. I shall go there with the following ambition: closer political relations and closer economic integration between us and our partners in the region. The European Union has an extraordinary power of transformation and inspiration for many around the world. Furthermore, if these countries undertake deeper reforms, we can help them and involve them in a closer way, from a political point of view, and we can also achieve closer integration with them from an economic point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let us not abandon the poorest of the poor and let us live up to our commitments to reach the Millennium Development Goals. Let us also be realistic and let us recognise that, for Europe to be fully influential, for Europe to be a real power, we need to strengthen the common foreign and security policy. It must be credible. It must be based on a common dimension for security and defence, if we really want to count in the world. Gone is the time when some people were able to argue that the idea of European defence could harm the Atlantic Alliance.</p>
<p class="contents">You are already aware: at present, it is the Americans themselves who are asking us to do more as Europeans. The world has changed, the world is changing in a fundamental way. Do we really want to count in the world? That is why, at a time when defence budgets are under pressure, we need to do more together, with the resources that we have. In this respect, the Commission is taking its share of responsibility by continuing the efforts towards a single market in the area of defence and by drawing on the competences granted by the Treaty in order to develop a European industrial base for defence. Honourable Members, let us not be naive, the world is transforming, and if Europe wants to count in the world and defend the interests of its citizens, if it wants to count and influence the world’s future, it needs a political dimension and a defence dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, I shall conclude. At the end of our mandate, the mandate of this Parliament, in 2014, it will be exactly one century that the Great War broke out on this continent, a dark period followed by the Second World War, one of the most tragic pages of European and world history. Today, I think that we can safely say that such horrors are unthinkable in Europe. To a large extent, this is the case because we have the European Union. Because, thanks to the European vision and thanks to economic and political integration, we have succeeded in ensuring peace on our continent.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is why we cannot let this great achievement be endangered. We have received it from the previous generations. Our generation will not be the one to undermine it. Let us be clear: if we start to fragment Europe, if we start to go back on ourselves, on Europe’s great successes, our objective will undoubtedly run the risk of fragmentation. As I have said, at the root of the crisis we are currently experiencing, there is a political problem. It is our will to live together that is being tested. That is why we must take the European Union to a deeper level. That is why we have built common institutions. That is why we must protect European interest. And today’s reality is that intergovernmental cooperation is not enough to get Europe out of this crisis, to provide Europe with a future. On the contrary, I have to tell you quite frankly: a certain amount of intergovernmentalism could well lead to renationalisation, to fragmentation. A certain amount of intergovernmentalism could well sign the death warrant of a united Europe, as we would want it.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that the decisions we take or do not take today will impact on our future. There is one thing that I would like to admit to you: I feel really offended when I see some people, elsewhere in the world, telling us Europeans, with a fair amount of paternalism, what we need to do. I honestly believe that, while we have problems, very serious problems, we do not have to apologise for our democracy. We do not have to apologise for our social market economy. Therefore I think that we need to claim from our institutions, but also from our Member States, in Paris, Berlin, Athens, Lisbon, Dublin, a burst of pride about being European, a burst of dignity. We should answer our partners like this: ‘Thank you for your advice, but we are capable of working together. We are capable of overcoming this crisis.’ I want this pride in being European.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">And the pride in being European is not only being proud of our great culture, our great civilisation, everything that we have given to the world; it is not being proud of our past only, but also of our future. It is that trust that we need to recreate between us. I believe that it is possible. Some say: ‘It is very difficult, it is not possible’. In response, I would like to quote a great man, a great African, Nelson Mandela: ‘It always seems impossible, until it is done. Let’s do it.’ We can do it, we can do it with confidence, we can achieve the revival of our Europe.</p>

Like you, I may give an analysis, but after this speech, we will act together.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is going through a confidence crisis and a growth crisis. As if that was not enough, it is going through a leadership crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time that Europe came up with a political answer to the crisis. A united and strong answer, which puts politics in its rightful place, that is to say in the driving seat; I am talking to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Because, after all, what are we talking about? We are talking about a currency – the euro – created 10 years ago. We truly believe that we are giving ourselves the means to secure its governance. We talk about countries which, for decades, have lived above their means, always more, without wondering whether or not the money spent actually created growth and jobs. We talk about a Europe born to prevent internal conflicts and to ensure its peoples’ prosperity, a Europe that, until now, has succeeded on all these fronts. But we also talk about a Europe that is misunderstood, even criticised, because its leaders have not been able to explain why the choice of Europe is the only choice for the future and why the answer to global challenges can only be a European one.</p>
<p class="contents">All too often, one forgets that the European Union is one of the most advanced and developed regions. It is the world’s leading power in terms of trade. Our duty is above all to make sure that it remains in that position. What is the problem, then? And how can it be solved? The problem is that, even though economists agree on the reasons behind the financial and economic crisis, and on how to respond to it – namely a mix of rigour and incentives for creating wealth and employment – the political class has not had the courage to set about the task.</p>
<p class="contents">The reforms proposed these last few months by the Member States of the Union and of the euro area, in particular, are along the right lines. However, they are clearly insufficient, late and poorly explained, or not explained at all. They stem from the intergovernmental method which – it is plain to see – paralyses Europe, as you rightly said.</p>
<p class="contents">The national approach, ladies and gentlemen, must give way to the European approach. We do not want to discuss subsidiarity here, but the Community approach is the only one that will enable us to meet in a united and effective way the urgent and huge challenges that are before us. I can understand that, in times of crisis, one feels the need to turn in on oneself. No, we must reach out and seek the Community approach. The European method is not two, three or four Presidents bringing different messages, but a single and swift exit strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, you are the head of the executive for economic governance. You demonstrated it this morning in your speech. That is why the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) urges you to fully play your double role of proposing and implementing European legislation decided with the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has a crucial role to play: that of guarantor of the European general interest. This is difficult and demanding, but necessary: we must resist national interests which are not always compatible with the common interest.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is essential. That is why this Parliament placed its trust in you at the beginning of the mandate and continues to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I ask you to go even further in your ambitions, because there is urgency. There is urgency to save the euro, to demonstrate our solidarity towards Greece and towards all the member countries that are seeing their markets attacked and their rating downgraded. At the same time, it is urgent that these same countries adopt and implement measures that are a match for the events, for European solidarity comes at that price. We must act urgently, not in the months, but in the days and weeks to come, to prove to the world that Europeans are able to defend and stabilise their currency. If they do not do it, the whole European project will suffer in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision that – I hope – this Parliament will take today on economic governance, the famous ‘six pack’, is an important step in the right direction. We now have to apply it as soon as possible, and the same goes for the decisions of 21 July on the stability funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, entrepreneurs need visibility and security. The markets expect the euro area and the countries of the Union as a whole to take strong and consistent measures for reducing expenditure but also for supporting growth.</p>
<p class="contents">On the first aspect – that of streamlining public expenditure – a few days ago I called for a ‘big bang’, a common decision of the 17 on fiscal, budgetary and social convergence. I reiterate this call today. It is very difficult for one country in isolation to take the strong measures that the euro area’s financial situation requires. However, we must recognise that the election campaigns that are coming up in several European countries in the next few years will undoubtedly not be conducive to courageous measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I ask the Commission to seize the proposal to bring into line tax rates, particularly for businesses, but also retirement age and weekly working time. Europeans will only stand shoulder to shoulder with each other if they see the same rules applied. That is when we can feel European.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that strong and swift decisions by the 17 on this triple convergence would have considerable impact and would be a tangible sign of leadership on Europe’s part.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I said this earlier on: the current crisis is as much a crisis of confidence, which calls for collective decisions like those I have just described, as it is a growth crisis. And without growth, Europe will be unable to reimburse even the interest on its debt. Without growth, Europe will not be able to develop or survive competition from emerging countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This growth requires increased competitiveness, more resources allocated to education and training, as well as increased efforts in research, development and innovation. I call for a new public-private partnership with a view to creating centres of excellence in research and innovation and to creating – why not? – an Erasmus programme for first jobs, following the success of the Erasmus university scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see the European political policy-makers listening more to entrepreneurs and to social partners, since they are the ones who live with the reality of globalisation and who can help us emerge from the crisis. Ladies and gentlement, achieving growth also requires that we pay special attention to small and medium-sized enterprises. We must not ride roughshod over them. They are the ones who bring us jobs and who help us to overcome the crisis. Yet they are asked to bear administrative, fiscal and social costs that are too high. If we want them to be able to expand and hire people, this growth will require greater flexibility for investing as well as for keeping and creating jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the single market was the great idea of the 1980s. With the single market, Europe has won growth points and our manufacturers have been able to achieve economies of scale by gaining access to a continental market instead of a national one. Nonetheless, we all know that the European single market is far from being completed, especially in the services sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I am asking the European Commission to get down to the task with as much ambition and determination as it showed 20 years ago. That is where growth is. Ladies and gentlemen, growth cannot be decreed. It is achieved by a whole series of structural measures, the ones precisely that we have already adopted in the Europe 2020 strategy. We now need to roll up our sleeves and above all apply these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time for Europe to speak strongly and intelligibly, not only to counter populism, which is the enemy of the European people, but to propose long-term solutions that our citizens understand and expect. It is time that our elected national representatives accept that voluntarily shared sovereignty is the only future for our countries, and I mean the only one.</p>
<p class="contents">I am asking you, Mr Barroso, to propose to the European Parliament and to the Council a plan to get us out of the crisis. A plan that can be, for the 500 million Europeans, the chance for a fresh start, the chance to overhaul their project.</p>
<p class="contents">We need bold actions and proposals, understood – I repeat – by our fellow citizens. Europe has always made progress in crises, but we still have to make the right proposals and believe in them. I always say that, before the crisis and after the crisis, nothing will ever be as it was before. Things will be different. Mr Barroso, we must propose this change to our fellow citizens so that once again they believe in politics and in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There was the certainty that European integration would continue to make progress. It became obvious as early as 2005, with the votes against the constitution, that this was no longer the case. There was the certainty that the European project was irreversible. That is also no longer the case. There was the certainty of generations of people that Europe would do its share and that their children would have a better life than they had. My parents were sure that I would have a better life than theirs. That was how things were. Generations of people were certain of this. We younger people knew that we would have a better life than our parents. It was obvious and it was within our grasp. Behind all of this was the idea of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the situation like today? Can we say that our children will have a better life than we have had? Our children are the ones who are asking us: How are you planning to make sure that the prosperity that you have enjoyed all your lives will also be there for us?</p>
<p class="contents">Countries where more than 50% of young people, some of them highly qualified, are without jobs, are not compatible with the certainty that Europe as it is today is laying the foundations for a return to full employment, for social security and for investment in education which brings results, and parents are investing a great deal in the education of their children. Why is that the case? Is it because the European approach to integration is wrong? I believe we all agree that the idea that Europe, with the institutions created for the purpose, can ensure the continuation of this prosperity by taking joint action from an economic, environmental, social and cultural perspective remains the right one. What is wrong is how the idea is being handled and how it is being managed. There is no crisis in the European idea. There is a crisis in European leadership. This is why the things that you said here today were correct. The intergovernmentalism which is flourishing in the European Union can no longer even be referred to as intergovernmentalism. One of the institutions of the European Union that we never talk about is the Council. The Council itself, the body which represents the governments of the European Union, is being stripped of its powers. You only have to speak to the people who sit on the Council to find this out. Decisions are no longer being made by the Permanent Representatives Committee, by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) or by the General Affairs sessions in the Council. We are sliding back into a situation where the Member States are acting alone and this is bringing Europe to the brink of collapse.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is happening even in the light of the challenges which we are facing in the 21st century. We can genuinely compare these methods with those of the Congress of Vienna in the 19th century, when the great powers of Europe, as they have now informed us, want to come together once every six months to debate the issues behind closed doors and then to tell their astonished subjects about the matters that they once again cannot agree on. That, ladies and gentlemen, must not be the future of Europe. This is a patchwork democracy that they want to present us with, where ultimately not even the spirit of the community is responsible for decision making, but rather the political opportunism of the relevant capital city. The political tactics of the party most recently in opposition or in government in a Member State, whether the country is large or small, are ultimately more important than the worldwide stability of the monetary system. That is the crisis in Europe and that is what we must fight against. I believe that we have seen the first signs of that today.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the European Union suffering from? It is suffering from the fact that the policies of the Member States who are acting alone are being driven by the markets. By the way, these are the same markets, as you have rightly said, which had to be stabilised with the help of the national budgets a few years ago. When we talk about the markets, we need to be specific. We are referring to banks which have gambled away billions of euros on the basis of the Anglo-American economic model that is still being sold to us today as the perfect solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Three years after the most serious banking crisis we have ever seen, we are in the situation of standing by and watching helplessly while a young man in his early thirties gambles away EUR 1.5 billion belonging to a Swiss bank. He sat down at his computer, entered a few numbers and, in a flash, EUR 1.5 billion had disappeared. It is only three years since we last experienced orgies of speculation of this kind. This was a Swiss bank which, I assume, has accounts containing capital that has been taken out of Greece for the purposes of tax evasion. I am absolutely sure of this.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is why I am asking these Heads of State or Government: when will you finally come up with some concrete proposals for regulating the markets? When will you finally put a stop to this devastating speculation involving financial products that no normal person can understand? When will the countless promises that have been made finally be followed up with action? These are the crucial questions.</p>
<p class="contents">A dangerous vacuum has formed in Europe because of this behaviour. This vacuum is the result of the governments’ failure to act. You have begun today, which I think is rather late, but I hope not too late, to play your part in filling the vacuum. We in the European Parliament are being called on, together with the Commission, another European institution, to establish the legal foundations for putting in place these market regulations in areas where we can have an influence.</p>
<p class="contents">It is completely clear that if I, as a head of government, reduce the pensions of people in Germany, Greece, Finland, Slovakia or wherever, and then say that I have to stabilise the banks, and these are the banks with managers who are saying that they knew nothing about this young man’s speculation and who then go home with compensation amounting to millions, despite their complete lack of awareness, then I can understand why the people are going out onto the streets and demonstrating. I can understand why this is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">The vacuum caused by the failure to act and the failure to regulate the markets is being filled by a dangerous mixture of emotions: hopelessness among young people and despair among their parents, who are now beginning to realise that the project which they believed in is no longer delivering what it used to. The result is huge mistrust in the European Union and in the concept of community values. We need to counteract this mistrust by taking clear and specific action.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what we have heard today. You are right. The man who can solve this problem is not someone who has been appointed behind closed doors, however nice he may be and even if he is called Herman Van Rompuy. Anyone who wants economic governance in Europe can have it here. It is just over there. Anyone who wants it to be democratically monitored by this Parliament only needs to look at the Treaty of Lisbon. That is where it is described.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do not need is for the Member States to act alone, alongside the Treaties. What we must have is a European legal framework. This is a community based on the rule of law and not a random number generator. Anyone who wants this crisis to be resolved must strengthen the institutions of the European Union, because the challenges of the 21st century – the environment, the monetary system, migration – cannot be resolved in the individual Member States, but only by the European institutions presenting a bold and united front. That is the task of the European Parliament. I believe that the overwhelming majority of this House is prepared to do this and the few Members who believe that they need to drum it into us using flags or words that the national state is the right solution are the people who are taking an axe to the social, peaceful future of the next generation. Therefore, I am calling on the pro-European groups to act together.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Guy Verhofstadt, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group. </span><span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the President of the Commission for his speech on the state of the Union and also for a number of his proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be very blunt about this. As you have recognised, the state of the Union is bad. Let us also repeat here in this House that this crisis is not about Greece and Greece’s debt. This is a crisis about the euro, about the European Union and, in fact, a crisis today about the existence – the vital existence – of the European Union. We are confronted today <span class="italic">(shouting from the Chamber)</span> – yes, the only difference is that you gave bad answers to that question, that is the problem – because the real questions we have to ask are: are we able to stand together in this crisis? Are we able to stand united in this crisis? Are we able to show real solidarity in this crisis, and have we the vision to do so, the courage to do so and the political leadership in the European Union to do so? These are the questions that we need to face today.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us start with the state of the Union. The state of the Union is bad, but I think we have to face today’s reality. We are in the middle – not at the end – of a crisis, really in the centre of it. Look at the reality. Mistrust of banks has again risen over recent days and weeks. Markets and stocks are at the lowest level since 2008. The International Monetary Fund yesterday lowered its growth forecast for Europe for next year to only 1.1%, down from 1.6%. Some economists are already talking about recession in the Union. Finally – this is important because we will come back to this later on – spreads: the tensions inside our markets have never been so high. Before the financial crisis, the spreads in the eurozone – that is the difference between the average of the obligations, the bonds of other countries (and Germany) – were only 19 – less than 20 – basic points. Today the spreads are ten times higher. The average of the bonds in the eurozone – NT bonds – is more than 200 basic points, with, naturally, Greece at 2 149 basic points of difference – a 21%-higher interest rate. In Portugal there is a difference of more than 1 000, as there is in Spain. In Italy there is a difference of 400 basic points. These are tensions that are not sustainable. This must be solved not yesterday, not today but in a short time period because it is unsustainable to continue like this.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second question that we have to answer today. What solutions were provided for this crisis – mainly by the Council, as has been indicated, and mainly by the Member States? They were half measures, measures that have been seen as too little, too late. You will remember that the first Council initiative after the start of the crisis in December 2009 was to announce a European solution to the crisis by launching EUR 30 billion of bilateral loans to solve the crisis. That was the big idea in February 2010 of the Member States and the Council. No European answers, no: bilateral loans to a single country in the south of Europe. That should create the solution. What we saw was the crisis becoming more and more difficult to overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I should say that the highlight of this bad approach to the crisis has been the casino deal of the real world. The decision was taken between France and Germany not to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact but to weaken the Commission’s proposal on the Stability and Growth Pact. We were in the middle of the crisis on the Stability and Growth Pact and then the Member States came forward with a proposal, saying that they had a deal in Deauville, near the casino – which is not such a bad one, everybody wins there – and in the end the outcome was that we lowered the sanctions, we lowered the penalties and you could simply continue the game inside the Stability and Growth Pact. This has ruined the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Mr Barroso, the most important conclusion of today has to be the message that you gave. You gave it here, very well and to much applause, but now you have to repeat it in another place, somewhere in Brussels, at the Council. I am no longer there, but I am sure we will know what you say there. You will have to repeat it there, telling them that the intergovernmental method is a bad method that cannot work. And why can it not work? Because it needs unanimity; the Polish know about that, as Poland disappeared in the 18th century because of the unanimity rule in the Polish Parliament: that is history and reality. The same could happen in Europe if we continue with this unanimity rule. We have to abolish it. Colleagues, this is the real problem. Why is there such a problem in this crisis? Because the Member States are reluctant to transfer new sovereignty and powers to the European Union. We all know that the only way out of this crisis is a new transfer of powers to the European Union and to the European institutions. That is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I am pleased with a number of the initiatives that you have announced today. They are key to my group. You have said that we shall take an initiative in the coming weeks on eurobonds. You have already found a new name: stability bonds. No problem. You can call them what you like – eurobonds, stability bonds – if they are bonds to mutualise debts and, as you have indicated, to make and create more discipline – not only solidarity – in the Union. Very well, we look forward to this in the coming weeks. You have said that we shall put proposals on the table to organise economic governance beyond the six pack. I think this is necessary and is a first step to real economic and fiscal union. You have also said that you should reflect on the external single representation of the eurozone at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what I am asking is that you go further than this and that in the coming two weeks, at the European Council on 17 October, you put a global plan on the table of the Council. Why do you have to do that? Because otherwise they take their own initiatives in the Council. You have the right of initiative; they do not. If you do not use your right of initiative by putting a document on the table with these different initiatives in it, others will fill the vacuum.</p>
<p class="contents">This should be done on three specific topics. First of all, the organisation of the real economic government inside the Commission. You have said here that we are the real economic government, but the reality is different. Mr Juncker, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Rehn, Mr Barroso, the President of the European Central Bank, we have at least five people who represent Europe. We need one, and it can only be a senior Commissioner that you have to appoint. Make him European Minister of Finance and then all this discussion of who is representing the euro would be over.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I missed one important element in your proposals. There is a European plan to recapitalise the European banks. The problem of the European banks has not been solved, and we shall not recover from this recession or the stagnation or economic downturn if we do not first of all recreate trust between the banks and recapitalise them. Only a European solution can solve this. I know that Mrs Merkel refused that proposal on 4 October 2008. She heard on the radio that there were some problems with a German bank. So you see what history can signify: if she had heard that news maybe three hours before, she would have accepted the solution of a European rescue plan for banks.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us come back to this. Mr Barroso, my request to you is that you put all this in a document on the table of the Council in two weeks’ time. We cannot do it as a European Parliament. The European Council cannot do it. You have the power, you have the right of initiative, and I can tell you that this whole Parliament will be behind you if you take such an action.</p>

I must admit I feel a lot of sympathy for you because I genuinely believe that you are aware that the situation is serious. At the same time, I have to admit that I do not share many of your views. I agree with you that fiscal consolidation, curbing of public expenditure and financial rigour are necessary because markets are very sensitive and markets at the moment do not forgive any mistake. However, good intentions are not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us make one thing clear: the euro currency was imposed on states of different development, different purchasing power, different GDP per capita, different living standards, different budgeting and different levels of competitiveness. It was done purely for political and ideological reasons because the euro should have served as a tool for further integration, not primarily as a single currency per se.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interjection from Mr Cohn-Bendit)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Then came public overspending, lack of discipline, and this directed some countries to the verge of collapse. In normal situations at such a time countries would devalue their currencies to cope with those consequences but, of course, as members of the eurozone, they cannot do that because they are not allowed to do so. So the only solution remaining are firstly bail-outs, more bail-outs and even more bail-outs, or whatever you want to call them, and secondly, transition of monetary union into a fiscal union and, thus, most importantly the debt union.</p>
<p class="contents">The logic of the first step, the bail-out step, is that the debts of some will be paid by the others, and the second step will mean a further shift of national power to the European level and further diminishing of the role of Member States. Mr Verhofstadt might like it, I very much doubt that most members of his own group like it as much as he does but, again, the most important thing is whether the people of Europe like it and whether it will help to promote more pro-European thinking amongst European nations. If you think that it does, you are wrong, ladies and gentlemen. I can tell you in my own country a recent poll has shown that 75% of people are against joining the euro, and do you really think that this is a result of some anti-European propaganda? No, it is not a result of anti-European propaganda, it is just a result of people who see and think. They simply do not buy into this idea any more of a federal Europe – that is very simple.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask you frankly, President Barroso, do you concede that it may come to a situation where, as the only solution to the current problems, it might be that one or more of the eurozone members would have to leave the monetary union? Secondly, would you admit that some other still non-eurozone members could re-evaluate their thoughts about joining the eurozone or not? Please do not get me wrong. If it comes to that, my feeling is that it will not mean the fall of the euro, because none of us wishes that, but the mentality of the euro at all costs is precisely the way to destroy the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that, if it comes to a reduction of the eurozone, that might be a political disaster for those who invested a great deal of their political capital into that idea, into the idea of a United States of Europe, but that is their problem. President Barroso, I can agree with you when you stressed the necessity to reinforce competitiveness, to complete the single market, to improve the legal background. Believe me, you achieve none of these things with an old and outdated EU framework. Mr Schuman, Mr Monnet, they were undoubtedly nice guys but their ideas are 50 years old. So please let us stop thinking in these terms because now, President Barroso, unfortunately for you, you have almost no choice between bad decisions and even worse decisions. For instance, another ‘worse decision’ you came with, which you have just mentioned, is the financial transaction tax. It sounds fine at first glance, just a small fee for transactions, but in the real world such a tax will lead to only one conclusion: that countries and institutions will seriously reconsider their location and they will leave the European market and this will undermine further the European economy. It is very simple. We need a new EU paradigm for the 21st century. Unfortunately, there is very little chance, almost no chance, of this new paradigm being born in this very building, in this very assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">The longer I am here, the more I feel that this assembly is more a part of the problem rather than a part of the solution. I am sorry to say that, I am sorry for you President Barroso, but anyway I wish you good luck. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You will have noticed this from the applause you received. Before we come to an understanding about the next stages of this leap forward, I would like to say something about the analysis of the situation as we see it. Mr Verhofstadt has said that Europe is in a bad state. As far as the financial and economic crisis is concerned, I would say that until now we have managed to prevent the worst case scenario from occurring, but we are a long way from having everything under control. If we take a look at the Member States, it is clear that what we have been saying all along, namely that we have done too little too late, is still the case today. Some Member States are now voting on the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). I am not saying that this is the wrong thing to do, but if we put it in the context of time and space, a decision should already have been made about the permanent crisis mechanism, its structure and the genuine establishment of economic governance.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this ‘too little’ and ‘too late’ applies not only to the actions of the Council. When I look at the economic governance package which we will be deciding on, I have to say that we have taken our time over that as well. There were good reasons for doing so. Nevertheless, we are now missing out on some opportunities with regard to this package. It is not a leap forward in terms of positive growth. We have talked so many times about the imbalance between stabilisation policy and the policy for development and for finding ways out of the crisis and this has still not been resolved in this package.</p>
<p class="contents">What I believe is the real subject of the political crisis in the European Union will not be resolved by our proposals on the financial crisis, nor by our proposals in the context of the ‘six pack’. Our real problem is that over the last few years we have created more injustice in various areas using a number of different measures. If we do not resolve this, we will not be able to control and bring an end to the centrifugal forces which exist not only because of the tendency of Member States to act alone, but also because the citizens of Europe are losing confidence in the ability of the Union to function.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of injustice, I believe, Mr Barroso, that we cannot go on in this way. For years the players on the financial markets have been earning huge amounts, until it came to the crunch. Then the decision was made to nationalise the problems and leave the profits with those people who had happily been engaging in speculation. I believe that this is a big problem and that the citizens have understood that until now the stabilisation process has taken place at their expense. I believe that, because of the increasing necessity of taking action to resolve the debt crisis, we are once again doing things that will lead to even greater injustice. We cannot rely solely on austerity measures. When we look at what is happening in Greece and in Ireland, the increase in the suicide rates in these countries alone is enough to make us blush with shame. We cannot unilaterally restructure budgets and introduce savings. We must at the same time do what my group has always been committed to during the negotiations on the economic governance package. We must consider how we can combat poverty in the European Union. We must resolve the issue of how we can invest in education. We must also make genuine investments in sustainable economic development, otherwise we will find that most of citizens are no longer prepared to support more Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise once again, Mr Barroso, three months before a delegation from this Parliament travels to Durban for the next world climate conference, that even though you mentioned renewable energies and investment in sustainable development in your speech, it is really disturbing how quickly things are forgotten in European policy. In 2007 and 2008 we agreed that it would be more expensive not to invest in ambitious plans to combat climate change than we had realised up to that point. We will not be able to bring about intergenerational justice with our existing austerity measures, unless we have a clear plan that defines how we will organise sustainable development, with a focus on preventing climate change and ensuring the efficient use of resources. What you have to say on this subject is unfortunately very weak.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to say something about the Southern Mediterranean region, but I will not do so now. I would like to wish Baroness Ashton every success in turning our past, the history of Europe in the Southern Mediterranean, into a topic for discussion. I also wish her luck in the negotiations on Israel and the Palestinian state, because the two-state solution and peace in the region are further key factors in improving development in the Arab world.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Barroso, I would like to say something on the major leap forward that you have announced. You know that we want you to be the person who ensures that something which we have constantly been referring to as economic governance is actually tackled. I believe that in the next few weeks your ears will sometimes be burning, if you consistently implement the things that you have promised here. If you discuss this with the German Government or the Dutch Government, you will think about Mr Verhofstadt and ask yourself why he has not strengthened the resolve of his Liberal colleagues in government.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verhofstadt, we love your European wit, but we sometimes miss it when we have to deal with your colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to discuss one more point and turn to the other side of this House. Mr Barroso, the Polish Presidency could be very important for the approach that you are taking. With its attitude to Europe and to the tendency of the Member States to go it alone, the Polish Presidency could bring about a genuine move towards preparing for another amendment to the Treaty and could lay the foundations for what we understand as economic governance.</p>

However, there is one thing that we really must not forget, which is that the governments, including those with Liberal members, do not share and are not promoting the unconditional commitment to less intergovernmentalism and more Europe, as presented by Mr Verhofstadt.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns our criticism of the three reports which are being adopted here today and which cover stability policy and the process of dealing with budget deficits. We are fully convinced that we need a sustainable budgetary policy. Our focus in budgetary policy is also on intergenerational justice.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are not in favour of the way in which budgetary policy is being implemented and you can take Greece as an example of this. If there is no possibility of creating a future for young people at the same time and if there is no possibility of saying how sustainable development, which is constantly being discussed, should be started, we do not believe that this contributes to intergenerational justice.</p>

This is something that we definitely all agree on. It is, of course, all about the economic, financial and debt crisis, about Greece and about the euro. The Member States and the European Union have not put in place sufficiently effective regulation of the financial markets. As a result, the policy is likely to end up at the mercy of the speculators.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures which have been taken so far are aimed at budgetary consolidation by means of cutting spending. In concrete terms this primarily means reducing social security budgets. It means cuts in salaries and benefits, rising unemployment, falling public investment and a drop in real economic growth. More and more decisions are being taken on an intergovernmental basis without prior agreement with parliaments, but instead in agreement with bank bosses. As a result, the European Union is increasingly losing confidence and support. The eurosceptics are gaining ground and that is a fact. The European Union is in the midst of a crisis of political credibility. I believe that we are all of the same opinion in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, we do not entirely agree either on the analysis of the causes of the crisis or on the best ways of resolving it. Despite the need for criticism, I would like to emphasise that we on the left are aware of our responsibility for the European Union. The idea of European unity is a left-wing idea which has been defended by many left-wingers past and present. We will continue to defend this idea in the future and we will make sure that it is not surrendered to the profit interests of the markets and the speculators.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that Europe needs much more cooperation, rather than a further withdrawal into national interest. Europe needs a jointly coordinated, democratically legitimate, economic, fiscal and social policy based on solidarity. Therefore, we will support you, Mr Barroso, when you finally present the promised legislative proposals, which have been called for by Parliament, as the first steps towards comprehensive regulation of the financial markets, taxation of financial market transactions and Eurobonds in order to reaffirm the principle of solidarity in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to emphasise the value of solidarity between states and between people and the urgent need for it. Solidarity does not just involve financial aid. It also involves resisting the governments’ mania for austerity measures. As the main representative of a genuine European institution, you should be able to support our call for a step back from this culture of austerity.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the social divide within society is growing much wider also seems ominous to me. The politicians are focusing on saving the banks and making available credit facilities of hundreds of billions of euros. However, the ordinary people are being left to pick up the tab for the failed policy of deregulation and privatisation. Huge austerity programmes are being imposed on them, they have to work longer hours and their wages and benefits are being cut. They are at the mercy of the governments’ austerity programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Social justice is simply being trampled underfoot and we cannot go on like this. The mass demonstrations in Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain are making this quite clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that either we will take a joint route out of the crisis based on solidarity, which will allow the EU to emerge from the crisis in a better, more social, more sustainable and even more democratic form, or there will be no solution for the EU as a whole, with damaging after-effects that are hard to predict.</p>

Mr Barroso, whilst you admitted to there being one or two little economic problems, you made it perfectly clear that jobs and growth were to follow, that everything is going well. In fact you painted a vision that a new period of European renewal is upon us.</p>
<p class="contents">As a former Communist yourself you probably remember the old Soviet leaders getting up to give their speeches and telling everybody that there was a record harvest or that tractor production figures were terribly good, and they of course believed that history was on their side. In fact President Khrushchev got up and said to the West: we will bury you. So much did he believe in his own Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Now of course we look back at that and we laugh. I think that in our tomorrows people will look back at you and they will say: how on earth did this unelected man get all of this power and how did Europe’s political class sitting in this room decide that the Community method should replace national democracy? I think people will look back in astonishment that we have surrendered democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">But what you want to do is to say, right, we have a European Union and what we have to do now is have more of it. So, as an architect – and you are one of the key architects of the current failure – you say that even though everything to date has been wrong we are going to do more of the same.</p>
<p class="contents">I thought that was a definition of madness. I cannot believe that this is a rational response to any situation in which you find yourself and, far from it being a State of the Union, I would argue that the Union is in a state because just look at the confusion. We have got you as President of the European Commission, we have a President of the European Parliament; we have got my old friend Herman van Rompuy who is the permanent President of the European Council; we have got the Poles, they are now presidents temporarily of the European Council; we have got presidents all round this room. Goodness me, even I am a President. I am not sure what the collective noun for presidents is, perhaps an incompetence. I do not know.</p>
<p class="contents">But certainly when you take away democratic accountability it is clear that nobody really is in charge and it is developing as a Union of intolerance. Anybody who stands up here and dares to give a political view which is different from the received wisdom is written off as mad, insane, violent and fascist; we have heard it for years from these people. The intolerance is so deep that, when we get referendums in France, the Netherlands and Ireland that reject your view, you as a political class see it as a problem to be overcome. So I am very worried about the whole root of this Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a new nationalism that is sweeping Europe. You want to abolish the nation states, in your case, Mr Schulz, perhaps because you are ashamed of your past. And you now want this flag and a new anthem to replace nation states and you do not care how you get there. If you have to crush national democracy, if you have to oppose popular referendums, you just sweep this aside and say that it is populism.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is not, it is democracy. What is sweeping northern Europe now, starting off in April with that amazing result in the Finnish general election, is a new democratic revolution. It is not anti-European. It wants a Europe of trade; it wants a Europe of cooperation; it wants a Europe where we can do student exchanges and we can work in each others’ capital cities; it wants those things. But it does not want this European Union model. Frankly, you are all now yesterday’s men.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr Duff, the answer actually is that an independent Britain that trades and cooperates with her European neighbours in an age of globalisation would be able to forge her own trade relationships across the world. It would make sense for a country like ours to start off with the English-speaking world, which shares common law – our own kith and kin in the Commonwealth who we turned our backs on so shamefully.</p>

Stassen (NI)</span></span>  . <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us face it, the European Union is bankrupt already. This is slowly dragging the Netherlands into a sinking morass. The EEC was adamant that countries like Greece should adopt the euro despite the enormous risks which it was aware of beforehand. As a result of that decision, we are now dealing with a crisis of unparalleled proportions. Meanwhile, the Dutch citizens are being asked to foot the bill.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europhiles, who have created these problems, now even want to go a step further. President Barroso, for example, is now openly advocating the introduction of Eurobonds. That is an absurd idea, Mr Barroso. The euro crisis was caused by the southern euro area countries being allowed to borrow money too easily. The last thing we need now are Eurobonds because they will make it even easier for Member States to run into debt. That is the recipe for another crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Who do you think you are actually representing, Mr Barroso? Surely, you realise that Member States such as the Netherlands fiercely oppose these Eurobonds. Why are you not supporting the countries which are still keeping the European Union going? Mr President, the situation is clear as far as we are concerned: Mr Barroso has sided with the euro sinners. In the meantime, Member States, such as the Netherlands, whose household budgets are in order, are being squeezed out like a lemon in order to foot the bill for fraudulent Greece, for example. Mr Barroso, as far as my party, the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV), is concerned, you might as well clear your desk and go and look for another job. The President of the Commission ought to protect the interests of all Member States. The PVV is of the opinion that you are not capable of that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank President Barroso for his remarks, and I especially want to emphasise what he said about the need to restore growth in the European Union. This has been reflected in a number of interventions today. The growth agenda is also at the very heart of the Polish Presidency programme, where we are working very closely with the Commission ahead of the October European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Here let me mention two elements: first of all, the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy. It is the EU institutions and the Member States working together in the framework of EU 2020 which will ensure that we emerge stronger from the crisis. Second, the negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework, which we started this autumn. There are, of course, very different opinions on the MFF to be reconciled. Everybody refers to the economic climate that underpins those discussions. In any case we will have to find compromises, and for the Council Presidency there are two elements which are absolutely crucial in those discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we must have a comprehensive, profound debate on the basis of the proposal from the Commission. Secondly we must find consensus on the idea that the money should be spent on supporting Europe in its search for stable and balanced growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, let me use this opportunity briefly to say that we are looking forward to the very important vote today in Parliament: a very important vote for economic and monetary union and a very important vote for the European Union. This vote on the ‘six pack’ is a milestone on our way out of the debt crisis and towards more fiscal and economic transparency and discipline. This will also mean more power for the Commission, and I am happy that we have found support for these proposals in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to acknowledge in this process the role that Parliament has played in making sure that the package is coherent and ambitious and the fact that you have shown flexibility and responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Another example, from the last 48 hours: correlation tables, where we actually enhance the role of the Commission as the guardian of the Treaties. This is also a way of showing that we are transparent in the implementation of European legislation and that the Union works.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, another example from the last twelve hours: a compromise in the trialogue on the external financial instruments. The reason why I mention those three – the six pack, correlation tables and the external financial instruments – is very simple. The message is: the Community method works. The sceptics can be proved wrong, and I address this to Mr Zahradil in particular, because I think people from your party in the Czech Republic and Poland do not read the facts, they just live in a dream that the European Union will crumble. I think you will be proved wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I just want to say that, concerning economic and monetary union, Schengen, foreign and security policy, the single market, energy and all the issues that President Barroso raised today, you can count on an approach by the Presidency which will include more Europe, not less Europe; more support for the Community method rather than intergovernmentalism; and finally, support for ever-closer union and not for ever-looser union. That is the only way to rebuild trust. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From today, I believe that we must call you ‘Barroso the Lionheart’.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic crisis is also an institutional crisis, and it is right, as you said, that we should relaunch the European project and seek new solutions to the crisis that we are experiencing. Fear is actually the driving force of a populist and nationalist vision, and it is courage that is, by contrast, the value that created Europe and has given it peace and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">Mind, though, Mr Barroso, although our ideas and your proposals are the antithesis of populism, our voters are often that way inclined. This means that if the reforms that you outlined are not implemented in the course of the next few months, they will paradoxically become the pretext for Eurosceptic criticism. You began this round with three aces, Mr Barroso. Now play the ace of hearts of the ‘Lionheart’, submit your proposals to Parliament and the Council, and together we shall win this hand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We will soon be taking a crucial vote on the ‘six pack’, which will see the European Commission set up as an independent authority. It has taken months to get the Council to come this far. However, this Parliament has stood firm. It is now crucial that we in this House come together and vote ‘yes’, because that will allow us to build on this achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on you to make sure you see through these ambitious proposals, because we are standing at a crossroads. We could decide today to build further on the Community method for economic governance in Europe and to reform it. The alternative is: chaos on the financial markets and Heads of State or Government having the final say. That too is an option, of course. We in this House will then have to do further work, together with all political groups, on the proposals you have presented today in order to strengthen future governance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need tangible action, and young people need hope.</p>

We are also losing countries waiting to join the Union, the countries of the Western Balkans. These countries have a European perspective but, President Barroso, you have not mentioned their future once today.</p>

I have to say that it is actually the first time in two years that I believe what you are saying. I think that you made a good speech today. Having said that, however, I would also like to say that we are experiencing a very serious crisis, both in political and in economic terms. We therefore need to put words into action. You need to show us results, and you need to show us concrete proposals. I would like to make a few comments in this regard, because we need something that goes far beyond what we have on the table right now. We need a comprehensive, coordinated crisis plan for Europe, which will ensure stability, sustainability and social justice.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, we need three things: 1) a resolute assurance to the markets that we are standing shoulder to shoulder with regard to the euro – there must be no more hitches, and you must take the lead here; 2) we cannot use cuts and savings to bring us more growth and employment – we need an investment plan and a jobs plan; 3) the focus needs to be placed on revenue again in Europe. Thank you for your proposal for a financial tax – we have waited a long time for it. Mr Barroso, we must convert what you have said today into concrete action. We need to stop believing that cuts and pretence can save Europe. We must have an overarching, comprehensive crisis strategy, and that is the most important job for you to do over the next few months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is important now is putting it into practice, in other words, the follow-up, as Mr Verhofstadt has said, and ensuring that something really happens here. I believe that we agree almost unanimously that we need more Europe in order to be able to overcome this crisis. However, we need the right Europe and for us that means that we want a stability union rather than a debt union. We need to include a ‘debt brake’ in the national constitutions. We still need, and here my opinion differs from that of the Chair of my group, different interest rates, because they act as an economic ‘debt brake’. We also need an organised process for national bankruptcy. We need rules which determine what happens when a country becomes unable to pay its debts, so that we can keep it in the eurozone. That is the crucial point. We need a stability pact with teeth and with automatic sanctions. I would like to say one thing. The plan by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to vote against this tougher stability pact here today is a continuation of Gerhard Schröder’s policy of 2003, which aimed to destroy the stability culture of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Therefore, although the state of the Union is not good, I join those who have expressed their conviction that the unrest that can be felt throughout Europe is not a result of what Europe does, and much less what Europe says – which is often applauded in this Chamber – but rather the lack of Europe, what Europe does not do, and the contradiction between what it says and applauds, and what it actually does.</p>
<p class="contents">Our governments talk about making difficult decisions. They impose those decisions on the citizens, but they do not impose them on themselves. Are they willing to give up their short-sightedness and short-termism, their strictly local and national interests, in favour of necessary solutions? Are they ready to do what has to be done, rather than doing too little too late, in a fragmented way and in the wrong direction?</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I might add that it is not true that in order to do what must be done, it is necessary to reform the Treaties. Absolutely not. I agree with those who believe wholeheartedly that there was a time when we did not have instruments, but we did have determination and will. Now we have the instruments, but we are lacking the will and leadership.</p>

<p class="contents">We all want Eurobonds, Dr Barroso, but the truth, and the problem, is that the secret agent that we currently have, who has secret plans and a licence to kill, is Chancellor Merkel. Today we have found out about the Eureka plan. If you have any information about this plan, Dr Barroso, I should very much like you to give it to us, because we too would like to know about these secret plans to, supposedly, save Europe from crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">However, changing subject, I should like to ask you if you have spoken about Palestine, Dr Barroso. We already know that the European Union does not have a common position on Palestine. What I cannot grasp, but would like to understand, is how it is that Europe has a word to say about these peace process negotiations, when the proposed budgetary support for the Palestinian Authority in 2012 represents half the sum implemented in 2010 and a cut of one third in relation to 2011. I should like you to comment on this please.</p>

Using the crisis as justification, the Union wants not only to recover, but also to move forward, strengthening integration and creating the foundations of a European superstate. However, all the talk about the economic crisis is ignoring the crisis of democracy and the crisis of values. Further possibilities have been announced today concerning amendment of the Treaty of Lisbon, which was adopted against the will of the citizens expressed in referendums held in several EU Member States. Indeed, the process of constructing a European state is being carried on without any reference to the most important values upon which Europe is built, by which I mean Christian values.

Where was the European Commission in August, Mr Barroso? Where was the European Parliament? We can criticise the Heads of State or Government, but at least they broke their holidays. Europe cannot be governed with such an attitude. It is unfortunate that the Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) postponed the final vote on the legislative ‘six pack.’ What would have been appropriate in June is no longer enough, it is now insufficient and more is needed. A policy of austerity is not enough, yet all the European right-wing, including the Hungarian right-wing can come up with is austerity.

The economic debate is marked by indecisiveness, doublespeak and an inability to take bold decisions which, when they are taken, albeit belatedly, are called into question the very next day.

Today, the result is that our European Union is weakened. So, is a shake-up possible? You said that it is. Well, I wish you were right.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several conditions for this: firstly, we need to press all the political players and all the European institutions to come together. Secondly, we need to reaffirm loud and clear the principles that have made Europe, namely solidarity and the community spirit. Thirdly, we need to say that a single country leaving the euro area is not a possibility. You said so and that is good. Fourthly, we need to put on the table a coherent comprehensive package. Mr Verhofstadt talked about this in detail, so I will not go over it again. Finally, we need to make progress towards real economic governance, but we will also have to move towards real political governance. Never have there been so many responsibilities.</p>

<p class="contents">Secondly, it needs this debt to be used on a plan for economic recovery, for jobs, for public investment, and for the construction of infrastructure. We agree on that.</p>
<p class="contents">It needs a third thing. It needs the political legitimacy to use this debt and to make this economic recovery plan.

<p class="contents">The purpose of this would be that, in the end, when there are good ideas on the table, they cannot be killed off by the leaders of Paris or Berlin at a summit next door to a casino, and that the voice of the 500 million would make itself heard so that we could have a European Union with genuine solidarity; not the type of solidarity that we have now, which, I must confess, scares me a little more each time I hear it mentioned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot nor do I wish to imagine the scenario that would unfold if Europe and the euro were to fail. Therefore the choices turn on three issues: on reforms to the way that things work, a plan to emerge from the crisis and attention to timing. I shall refer solely to the plan for a solution to the crisis, which is growth, and which must be achieved. Here we have a great game, which you mentioned in connection with project bonds, relating to this Marshall plan, which we can now call a modern ‘Barroso plan’, concerning the EUR 1.6 trillion that are going into the construction of this great infrastructure plan.</p>

<p class="contents">We would have liked to have seen the same indignation when, on 21 July, you accepted the conditions that the banks dictated to you for the second Greek rescue package. We would have liked to have seen the same indignation when you adopted new rules for banks. The fact is, the CRD IV is merely a pale imitation of Basel III. When are you going to impose the separation between casino banks and the banks that genuinely finance the economy?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to go back to the two figures you quoted on the financial transaction tax. You say that European citizens have committed up to EUR 4 600 billion and you proudly announce that the financial transaction tax could bring in EUR 50 billion per year. I do not see that as a reason to be elated. In any case, I do not see in that the sign of a genuine indignation towards those who are tearing Europe apart. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the Commission, the Council and the ECB took considerable steps to calm the international markets, we have yet to see a satisfactory solution to the financial crisis and Greece’s bankruptcy. I agree with you that it could give reason for hope that the EU already took a historic leap once in the past fifty years, similar to the one required to solve the current situation. We are now in a similar historic situation, as today we will be voting about the legislative ‘six pack’ that redefines the foundations of economic governance and also contains the key to our common economic success; however, all of this is has no meaning if the single currency is not sufficiently stable. The founding fathers, too, would probably be rather taken aback if more than fifty years after the founding of the Community they had to thank the BRICS countries, of all, for leading the euro area out of the crisis. Mr President, I respectfully ask you to submit your proposal as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should remember that when the Stability and Growth Pact was breached and when the Schengen Agreement was breached by countries such as Denmark, one thing became clear: it is the Member States which are breaking the rules via the Council. If we want to restore credibility in the markets, we must follow the rules. The potential offenders are not able to do this. This is why we must strengthen the institutions of the European Union. I believe that we need to make that clear to the public and not the other way around. I would like to thank you for this.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that the Councils of Ministers are handing over more and more responsibility to the European Council when the situation gets difficult. Now there is a proposal to introduce a European Council of the 17. We have been fighting for 25 years in the European Union for majority voting in the Council of Ministers and now we are reintroducing the unanimity rule via the European Council. The European Council and the intergovernmental method not only involve a lack of democracy and transparency, but also inefficiency. We must also make this clear to the public and I would like to thank you for this.</p>

However, we have also had an upbeat speech from the executive about not only exiting the crisis, but also about the European Union’s future. Unfortunately, the measures implemented by some European Union governments have proven to be ineffective. This is why now more than ever we need complete mobilisation to revive the European Union’s economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I think that the European Union needs to take action as an entity and acquire the skills for coordinating fiscal policies at EU level and, if applicable, implement common economic governance, but with a well-funded budget.

I think it is very important for all of us in the European Commission to feel that support coming from the most important political forces in Europe and for you, who have been directly elected by our European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course I was not expecting unanimity. One Member of Parliament, a British nationalist, attacked me on the fact that I am not elected. I want to tell you that since the age of 29 I have always been elected by my own Parliament. I was Prime Minister of my country, I was leader of the opposition of my country and I am here, as President of the Commission, because this Parliament voted for me to be President of the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If you do not respect the institution to which you belong yourself, this is not my problem. Regarding Britain, I would like to make this point to you. As far as I know, you have tried several times to be elected to your own British Parliament. How wise the British people are that they have never elected you to your own Parliament and sent you here.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If you want your country to leave the European Union, say it in London and try to get your country to agree. But do not say it here because, as far as we know, your institutions and your country want to remain in the European Union. If your country does not want to be in the European Union, do not speak on behalf of the others, do not speak on behalf of Poland, that just today set their commitment to the Community approach and to a stronger and ever-closer European Union. If Britain believes that it can, because of its past empire, or because of its dimension, defend its interests in the world alone, try to get that point across in your country. But I think the majority here believes, as was said, that to protect our interests, to defend our values in the world of globalisation, to speak with one voice with our American friends or China and Russia, we need a stronger European Union. This stronger European Union is also a way to reinforce our countries, the countries that we all represent around this House.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This point is very important. This is a point of substance, apart from the other funnier parts. How we build a European Union is a point of substance. Are we going to build a European Union against each other or with each other? That is why I welcome this message of support, not only from the most important political forces here and the consensus expressed, but also from the current Presidency of the Council, Poland. We need a Community that matters: a Community spirit and a Community approach to reinforce our common interests. We need to build a European Union with our Member States, but we also need to build a European Union based on the <span class="italic">rassemblement</span> of all the major pro-Europeans, the most important political forces of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Andrew Duff that we also probably need to reform some of our European political parties, so that we can also have a collective expression in the European public space of this European democracy. Today some of you said ‘yes, but’. Please, among pro-Europeans, do not say the ‘but’, just say ‘yes’. You do not say to your loved ones – your wife or your girlfriend, your husband or your boyfriend – ‘I love you, but’, you say ‘I love you, I support you’. We need your support to make Europe stronger because Europe’s real problem is, as I said, also a problem of confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be completely clear. The problems we have in Europe today did not arise because of the European institutions. The problems we have in Europe today arise because of narrow national interests that have prevented the European project from moving forward. So I say to those of you that criticise me, or the Commission, that we are ready to accept all your criticisms, but the Commission is proud of the work it has achieved. Today we have not only made a speech, but we have put forward a programme with proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything I said last year in the European Sate of the Union I checked; we have delivered. Every proposal I made today to you, we will deliver and we need your support and not your doubts and your scepticism. That is very important today because we need to build this stronger support for a stronger Europe in a spirit of confidence. Today you are going to vote on the ‘six pack’; some of you do not agree but the proposals were made by the European Commission one year ago.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tabled 29 proposals for the Financial Regulation. Some of the points you have made are already on the table for the Council. About capital of banks we have put forward a capital requirements directive. Some of you do not agree but it is there, our proposal. About tax evasion we have asked the Council, and so far we have not yet received a mandate to negotiate with third countries the issues of taxation because what is happening so far is that countries are negotiating alone.</p>
<p class="contents">We have put forward the tax savings directive. Regarding the <span class="italic">services publiques</span>, the public services, I have committed to present it before the end of the year and we will do it. We are going to respect all our commitments and today I also put forward before you the financial transaction tax. So there is no lack of proposals. The question today is to get the support, not only of Parliament but also of our Member States. So when we speak about Europe we have to be clear about what we mean by Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Because this is one of the problems in terms of the scepticism in Europe. Some people say Europe does not deliver. Let us put it frankly: is it Europe that does not deliver or some governments that do not deliver? This is the real question in terms of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As I said, one of the problems is political and political confidence and we need to make the case for Europe. Today when some governments say: ‘we do not have enough support for the euro; we do not have some support for the European Union’, probably they are right. But we have to ask them: did you make the case for Europe? Did you make the case for the euro? Did you explain to your citizens what we have to lose if we do not keep our strong commitment to our common achievements? So we need to make the case for Europe. And this is a collective task from the European Commission, of course, from Parliament – and you have been elected and you can of course discuss this matter and I know you are doing it with your electors but also from our governments.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to make the case for a stronger Europe, that is why I have highlighted the importance of the political leadership, the political responsibility, and I believe that we can unite ourselves in terms of the points I have made.</p>

As the situation in Greece demonstrates, there is a need for an alternative agenda to extreme austerity, and for protection of the weakest and the unemployed, who have nothing to do with the cause of this crisis. As such, in addition to the necessary budgetary consolidation, Europe needs to ensure its ability to invest for growth, to create services and to maintain essential public services. The economic governance package should include a growth pact, in order that the Member States might make productive investments, capable of reversing the current economic situation. Moreover, Europe is not demonstrating long- and medium-term vision, and is exhausting itself with an austere reaction to the present crisis. Budgetary targets should exist in parallel with the Europe 2020 strategy targets. Decision-making processes should be made more democratic and robust, without nationalism, so that Europe can respond faster and more effectively. Europe also needs a system of Eurobonds to help stabilise the markets, a financial transactions tax to obtain new income and limit types of speculation, a stronger European budget equipped with own resources, and an end to tax havens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The only way for us to remain a Union of solidarity and unity is to review in principle the entire EU governance model. The Commission must become the body that draws up common guidelines on economic governance and has all the powers to monitor the economies of the Member States.

We are laying the foundations for a healthy and strong single currency. These are the measures that will enable us and Europe to emerge stronger from the crisis. It is essential that the European Commission is put in the driving seat here, because that will enable it to ensure that governments respect these measures without fail and that Member States which go off the road are taken to task. On the basis of these clear rules, we now need to take further steps in order to kick the European economy into a higher gear. Eurobonds and project bonds, which President Barroso has announced here today, could play a vital role in this respect. Introduction of a financial transaction tax (FTT) is another important step forward. Europe is taking the lead with this and creating a very important instrument (EUR 55 billion of revenue per year) in order to bolster the economy and promote jobs. At the same time, the introduction of a FTT would send out a strong political signal to European citizens. With the FTT, Europe will be making it clear that financial institutions must themselves make a substantial contribution in times of severe financial and economic turmoil. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are reasons why these have come under attack. They are unworkable and opposed by many within the EU. To adhere to them demonstrates how dismissive of public opinion and devoid of reason the Commission is. Regulating the financial market to resolve the outcomes of poor judgment by the Commission over the eurozone is thieving from the success of the City of London to feed the failures of the single currency. The naïve utopian view of the Commission is little more than a foolhardy path to failure. Such is the case with common migration policy. How can the Commission control and balance migration without impeding the liberty and mobility they claim are central tenets of the European vision? Expansion is laughable when the EU struggles to effectively operate in the extant Member States. Inking new FTAs undermines national variance and independence.

At the same time, it was an attempt to silence the critics who had been accusing the Commission and its President of inaction and of systematic submission to the German directorate of Chancellor Merkel. In the end, the applause that united the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is enlightening and symbolic of a ‘unity’ that has driven the EU and its Member States to the current crisis, which is still there, as can be seen from the adoption of the economic governance package, welcomed by Dr Barroso. That package represents the reinforcement of the Stability and Growth Pact and the restrictions inherent to it, which particularly affect the weaker economies and are largely responsible for Portugal’s weak economic growth over the last decade. As for the rest, strengthening the European Financial Stability Facility represents nothing more than transferring yet more public debt held by banks to the public sector; that is, onto the backs of the workers and the people. The financial transaction tax has been announced for the umpteenth time; doubts remain about its practical effects. For the time being, the most speculative products – such as derivatives – have been saved, with derisory taxes, whilst tax havens remain untouchable. Combating speculation has, therefore, had scant practical results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That the situation is critical I agree. On the other hand, a bit of historical perspective would not be out of place. The EU is still a successful project, which during its short time in existence has succeeded in uniting European nations and become a leading world force. Even if individual steps taken in its history can be criticised, I personally see the EU project so far as a huge success for multilateralism and international cooperation. At the same time I should like to add that I have my doubts on some of the scenarios that are presented here on a daily basis regarding the situation in the eurozone. I am particularly ashamed by the fact that at this very moment it is the Slovak government that is putting the brakes on measures to prevent the crisis from breaking out in its imminent next stage. That is why I would like to appeal to absolutely everyone involved in today’s debate to put aside their party colours and national interests, stop their short-term political point-scoring, and treat the EU as a single entity in the context of its history. The EU is still in good working order, even if the outlook is unclear. It all depends on our resolve, and I believe firmly that when the state of the Union is evaluated in the near future, we will not have to find that it has deteriorated or completely disintegrated.

Regarding the future of the Union, you spoke of the need for further integration. Your next proposition, however, that not all countries of the Union would be able to proceed towards greater cooperation at the same speed, is astonishing and even unacceptable to me. My understanding of it is that the Commission is committed to the model of a two-speed Europe, and that it wishes to continue dividing Europeans into first and second class citizens. In my opinion, bodies such as the European Parliament or the Commission should unify, not divide, Europe. I do not want to be a second class citizen and I do not want anyone else to be one either. I would therefore like to call urgently on the Commission to focus on drawing up the model for a future, unified – not fragmented – Europe.

We do so despite the fact that the financial sector is but a very small segment of economic policy. We, both as EU decision-makers and as national legislators, should be discussing economic policy in its entirety, and should take our decisions after weighing every one of the means it offers. Economic policy is indeed about more than just financial steps. It should provide guidance to industry, make way for innovation and R&amp;D, and encourage investment. It should take care of the three I’s: innovation, industry and investment. If we do not decide as soon as possible about the direction the economic role of the European Union should take, it will be exceedingly difficult in these crisis-hardened times to guarantee common, effective and successful action. We carry a responsibility for the generations to come and it is we who must now ensure a secure future for them. For that, we will need innovation, a once again solid European industrial policy, and incentives for investment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is more, this crisis concerns not only the economic situation, which is where its impact has been most noticeable, but it is also a crisis of politics, of society and of identity. We are currently focussing on rescuing the single currency and trying to hammer out a support plan for Greece and other Member States in danger of bankruptcy. However, we should first of all be asking ourselves the question as to what the Union should be like – a Union which will very soon number 28 Member States. While concentrating on economic reforms, we must not forget that our Union is of a much broader nature and that we are not just a community based on economic and monetary union. I think the budgetary crisis in some countries of the euro area has obscured other threats from our view. Have we noticed the rising wave of xenophobia in our societies? Have we registered that our economy is increasingly being penetrated by China, and that Beijing is setting individual Member States against each other? Do we have a strategy in relation to what is happening at the moment in North Africa? Have we noticed that the United States is now ceasing to be a dependable and stable ally? Do we have answers to these questions today – do we have a strategy which we can follow? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The outcome of today’s vote will show what kind of vision we have for the EU and the euro area as well as which direction we are going to take. I firmly believe that the road we choose will be one of stable finances, low deficits and falling debt.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember, however, that just tightening our belts will not be enough. The next decisions we are going to have to make will be decisions about ways in which we can achieve a growth in competitiveness for our European economy. In my opinion, we should begin implementation of the measures contained in the Euro Plus Pact as quickly as possible, which means carrying out responsible pension reforms, undertaking reforms relating to wage indexation, reducing the burden of work associated with VAT collection and building a truly single market. Other questions to be resolved are matters concerning the method of funding research, education, innovation and infrastructure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the Union wants to continue to boast of being known as the guardian of fundamental rights, it must urgently face up to these problems. Furthermore, two of the EU’s Member States, namely Poland, which currently holds the Presidency of the Council, and the United Kingdom, have not adopted the Charter of Fundamental Rights in full.</p>
<p class="contents">2. Women – women and men have equal rights only in theory. In practice, women suffer discrimination politically, economically and socially. They earn on average 17% less than men, they hold lower positions and it is more difficult for them to be promoted and combine a professional career with bringing up children. Half of Europe’s women have experienced violence, and between one and two million suffer it daily. Women are underrepresented in legislative and executive authorities at all levels, on the boards of banks, economic organisations and large firms and in science and scientific research.</p>
<p class="contents">3. Poverty – almost 84 million Europeans are at risk of poverty. The fight against poverty and social exclusion must be a priority. During the economic crisis, poverty has risen significantly among children. In relation to this, I call on the Council and the Commission to draw up and implement a strategy aimed at reducing poverty among children by half by the end of 2012. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But you did your best. You told us that the answer to the Eurozone crisis is the issuing of Eurobonds. You know full well, however, that Germany has rejected the idea. Eurobonds are going nowhere. We hear much talk about the need to address the democratic deficit in the EU. But you spoke to a parliamentary chamber that appeared to be less than half full. Your speech should have inspired, and shown the way to salvation, but MEPs could not even be bothered to turn up and listen. So do not be surprised if the people of Europe fail to report to the polling booths in large numbers, or if the level of citizen engagement is low. We hear much talk of the Commission's environmental concerns and priorities, and yet we, our staff, and the press corps had to come all the way to Strasbourg, as we do 12 times a year, to hear a speech that you could have made in Brussels.

The road to economic recovery remains long and difficult, and the effects of the crisis have been repeatedly and severely felt by the European public. I agree with the statements about the need for all pro-Europeans to join forces to defend the European project and act to meet challenges through closer European integration. Here, the role of Parliament and its work alongside the Commission are particularly important. It is crucial to strengthen the EU, specifically through its institutions supporting the Commission to defend Europe’s common interests and support European integration. I would congratulate Dr Barroso on his determination and courage, and I am counting on his College of Commissioners to table concrete proposals that will have a genuine impact by 2020. The Multiannual Financial Framework will play a crucial role, focusing on the areas where the EU can make a difference. It is essential that we join forces and be able to build a stable, responsible Union; an EU of growth and solidarity, with an active and effective voice on the world stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the moment, the European Union has 23 million citizens who are unemployed and 80 million citizens exposed to the risk of poverty. One young European in five is unemployed. Europe’s citizens fear for their own and their children’s future.
