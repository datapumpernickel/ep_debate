<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have just been speaking about the human, ecological and social consequences of yet another oil slick which has reached French shores. We are now speaking – and personally, I am very happy that we are – about the consequences of an historic storm, a veritable hurricane which affected France, and also the Federal Republic of Germany and Austria in the same period. </p>
<p class="contents">When speaking about the consequences of such accidents or such terrible weather conditions, we are not only talking about the damage to the environment and to property, we are also talking – and this is a point I wish to make too – about the consequences of the storm, as well as of the oil slick, for men, women and families who, as Mrs de Palacio said a moment ago, are seriously traumatised, wounded, bruised, demoralised, the weakest of which are desperate. I have seen this myself. </p>
<p class="contents">I really think that today we are seeing an expression of European solidarity, a solidarity demonstrated by words of moral support, but which is above all human. This is the solidarity that I would like to express on behalf of the whole Commission and, particularly, within the Commission, on behalf of my colleagues who have not forgotten their roots or their citizenship: Franz Fischler from Austria, Michaele Schreyer and Günther Verheugen from Germany, and Pascal Lamy and myself from France. This expression of feeling is to complement that already shown by the national authorities of these countries and by the tremendous surge of generosity and kindness that has been shown. And as we are talking about Europe, I would also like to take my hat off to the spontaneity and the willingness of the volunteers from the public electricity and telephone services, to the firemen and the road-workers who came spontaneously from all over Europe to help to re-open roads and to restore electricity and telephones. In some parts of France, some families have only had their telephones and electricity working again since yesterday or the day before. </p>
<p class="contents">At the request of President Prodi, the Commission has held its first talks on this whole issue, a discussion during its first meeting of the year and now, as the President asked us to, I would like to tell you the results of our work to provide every response that the Union can muster in terms of rebuilding those parts of our economic, social and cultural heritage that were affected. This must be done within the limits of the regulations and the budget, having expressed our human and moral solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission will therefore make use of every instrument it has in order to help the affected Member States in this reconstruction and to provide any possible aid to the people and businesses affected. This will be done in order to complement and to top up the support and aid which have already been decided on by the national and regional authorities. As you know, the Commission has several instruments and tools which can provide aid for this rehabilitation and reconstruction effort and we intend to use all of these instruments, with the same desire to help, which Mrs de Palacio expressed when she spoke of the lessons to be learned from the Erika disaster.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As far as the structural policy is concerned, I am personally going to look into how we can use the current decisions on the new generation of strategies for economic development which will be implemented over the next seven years. I will also look into how the appropriations, which have already been allocated, particularly to regions of rural, industrial and urban conversion and to fishing areas, that is, all the regions covered by Objective 2, can help this reconstruction. The Objective 2 zoning was stopped by the Commission after consulting the various governments. In Germany’s case, the Commission’s decision was taken in December and today, the Commission has stopped the Objective 2 zoning plan, not only for Luxembourg and Sweden, but also for France and Austria. </p>
<p class="contents">In France’s case, where the damage is objectively the most extensive, the total available appropriations for the new Objective 2 are EUR 5.4 billion for the period 2000-2006. A preliminary study by the Commission services shows that on the basis of a financial allocation set up in proportion to the eligible population, 70% of people affected by the storm may benefit from aid eligible under Objective 2. The 69 devastated French departments could thus receive around EUR 4.1 billion over the next seven years. For Germany and Austria, the corresponding total sums are respectively EUR 3 billion for Germany and EUR 600 million for Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that the devastated areas which do not feature on this new zoning plan – and unfortunately there are some – which are not covered by Objective 2, but which were eligible under the previous Objective 2 and Objective 5b zoning, could also have access to appropriations available in the new programming period as provisional support. I would therefore like to suggest the most straightforward way in which structural appropriations could broadly contribute to the economic rehabilitation of devastated areas. Of course, it is not a question of providing emergency aid since, as you know very well, two years ago the meagre appropriations available in the European budget under emergency aid were discontinued. It is a question of repair and lasting restoration in the context of the programmes currently in preparation and this, in my view, is our most important task.</p>
<p class="contents">Powers for programming actions and selecting priorities have, as you know, been devolved to each State. Each government will therefore, under the conditions that I have just stated, have to establish its priorities and make choices. They will probably have new priorities, in order to take into account the consequences of this storm or of the oil slick. It is up to the governments of the countries concerned to distribute Community financial support among the various regions eligible for Structural Funds, and therefore to propose to the Commission plans for action to be carried out at grass roots level. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to be more specific though, by way of an example, I would like to remind you that all of these programmes in devastated areas will be able to finance the restoration of our historical and cultural heritage, areas of economic activity, and industrial or trading areas. They could also finance the channels necessary for the flow of raw materials and industrial products, for port infrastructures – both commercial and leisure ports, the infrastructure of airports involved in business travel or tourism, productive industrial investments, aid to businesses, and historical and cultural heritage for tourism as well as training for employees qualified under the European Social Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore entirely at the disposal of each of the Member States, in order to adapt, to rearrange this programming to the best effect. I would like to stress that this also applies to those who suffered the effects of the other storms at the beginning of December in Denmark, the United Kingdom and in Sweden. I know that Parliament adopted a previous resolution to this effect, on 16 December last year. </p>
<p class="contents">I hope you do not mind if I stress, even though I have already said it twice, that this applies to Greece too, with regard to the consequences of the earthquake which occurred at the beginning of September, in accordance with Objective 1 of the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, my colleague, Franz Fischler, adopts the same approach with regard to rural development. Following the reform of the common agricultural policy which your Parliament approved last year, measures for rural development can, for the first time, be cofinanced throughout the Union’s rural areas by the ‘Guarantee’ section of the EAGGF. France will therefore benefit by EUR 760 million per year, Germany by EUR 700 million and Austria by EUR 423 million. This aid is available for devastated regions and is not constrained by the zoning which I am bound to apply under Objective 2. Of the measures eligible under the EAGGF Guarantee section, I would like to mention restoring agricultural and forestry production potential which has been damaged, reforestation, infrastructures for country roads and infrastructures for prevention and protection such as dykes and warning systems. In this context, probably the most special case is that of the timber industry, which has been affected particularly badly by these storms and to which we will be devoting all our attention, in both economic and environmental terms. I would like to say that the EAGGF could also allocate a Community cofinancing grant for the storage of wood. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in the fisheries sector, it is also possible to employ the structural instruments for cofinancing grants. France would thus have access to EUR 225 million for the period 2000-2006. Community aid will thus be able to contribute to compensating fishermen and boat-owners for the temporary cessation of their activities in case of unforeseen events, up to a maximum of two months per year. It is also conceivable that the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance, FIFG, will be able to provide assistance which could be used for standard investment projects. I am thinking here of fish-farming equipment, community facilities, restructuring, developing fish-farming sites, equipping fishing harbours, modernising boats, and I have already discussed these matters with Franz Fischler. Finally, following consultation of course with my colleague, Mario Monti, the Commission would like to underline the fact that State aid earmarked for making good the damage caused by natural disasters or other extraordinary events can be considered compatible with the common market. It would therefore, in these circumstances, be authorised by the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">We can, then, embark on various courses of action straight away, for example in the area of energy, within the framework of the Trans-European Energy Networks. I know that where the transmission of energy is concerned, there are many technical problems, particularly in the transmission of very high voltage energy. Nevertheless, looking back to my quite recent time as Minister for the Environment in France, when I campaigned for underground lines, I would like to point out, as one of you did a while ago, that in this area as in many others, prevention is much cheaper than a cure. I therefore hope that the Member States will vote in favour of laying telegraph, telephone and electricity networks underground, when this is technically possible, and that they are encouraged to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">And that, ladies and gentlemen, covers the Community instruments, which offer many opportunities for very practical intervention. The European Union does not and will not do everything. It can nevertheless do a great deal, on condition that we are able to make use of these instruments, that you keep us informed and that Member States are able, in the days following these storms, to set out their priorities and to make choices. It is therefore very important that this House, as well as the Commission, passes this information and this practical expression of solidarity on to all partners involved and to the people concerned and affected. As far as I am concerned, I shall endeavour to do that myself this week, when I visit, the day after tomorrow, two French departments which have been particularly badly affected by the storms: Charente-Maritime, affected both by the hurricane and the oil slick, and Creuse. I shall also present today’s decision on Objective 2. Tomorrow, 19 January, my colleague Michaele Schreyer will visit one of Germany’s most devastated regions, the Black Forest, in the state of Baden-Württemberg.</p>
<p class="contents">With thanks for your patience, I should like to conclude this presentation, Mr President, by mentioning a subject close to my heart. This is one of the lessons we should learn from these disasters, which do not always have natural causes, but which often do. We are convinced that such disasters reinforce the need for better coordination within the Union of each State’s resources for repairs, emergency aid and civil protection. The Commission already has a unit for the coordination of civil protection, for which my colleague, Margot Wallström, is responsible. This unit, I might add, worked well when it had to deal with the oil slick, to find boats, arrange protection for beaches, machines for cleaning oil-covered birds to the extent that it is possible. The resources of 11 European countries were employed here, a fact which is sometimes forgotten, and which justifies the tribute I wanted to pay to the spontaneous solidarity shown by all European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I think that we must go even further. President Prodi, Margot Wallström and I are convinced that we need to find a more systematic way of developing a European intervention strategy, which is based on existing mechanisms in each country, on specialised units, such as fire brigades, vaccination and civil protection teams, mountain rescue dog teams and many more. Members of these units, whilst staying in their own countries, would undergo a common course of training. If needed, they could be mobilised, both within the European Union, as we have seen with this storm and the earthquake in Greece, and outside the Union, as happened in the cases of Turkey and South and Central America, following the tragic events that have taken place there. This really is an opportunity to create a genuine European civil protection force.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Today, we have a long way to go, even if the Helsinki European Council did take a step forward in this direction and Margot Wallström’s services are working on extending the role of the ‘search and rescue task force’. For the moment, of course, the Commission has neither the manpower nor the financial resources to take responsibility for such a task. We think, though, that with Margot Wallström and under the authority of President Romano Prodi, this is one of the lessons that we will be learning from this series of disasters, natural or otherwise, which have had such tragic consequences. In terms of efficiency and also of political clarity, this task force would be a symbol of our idea of the European Union. As far as I am concerned, I intend, within the Commission, to promote this idea as one of the lessons to be learned from this disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sad to say that it accounted for more than 100 deaths, 88 of which occurred in France. The human cost has been enormous, but so has the material damage, and both public amenities and private property have been destroyed or seriously damaged. Millions of homes are without electricity, telephones or running water. Economic activities have been brought to a halt. In France alone, insurance companies are already estimating the costs of the damages at a total of FF 35-40 billion, which is between EUR 5 and 6 billion. </p>
<p class="contents">This unprecedented natural disaster has called all available forces to action and has given rise to demonstrations of solidarity both within the Community’s borders and beyond. This is why I would like to thank all of those who gave a hand to the emergency services, and to the authorities and public services which were overwhelmed by the magnitude of the task. Thank you, everyone, from the bottom of my heart, for this invaluable help.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Now that the shock has passed and the authorities’ vital functions have been re-established, I wonder, and I ask the Commission and the Council to consider as well the opportunity once again to incorporate a budget line for emergency aid into the Community budget, in order to address this kind of occurrence. The risks of weather-related disasters must not be ignored and, in the light of the consequences of such disasters and the speed of intervention that they require, I think that the Community would do well to have these resources again. It should be possible to release the emergency aid that we once had from the strict rules applied to the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with Commissioner Barnier’s proposal to gradually set in place a European civil protection force – a proposal he put forward several months ago now – which we discussed, Commissioner, at the time of the earthquakes. It is obvious that the answer to the question I am asking about re-establishing Community emergency aid must be “yes”.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Next, I would like to address the huge problems encountered by one industry that has been particularly badly affected by this storm. I am talking about the forestry sector, whose business has been seriously damaged by the havoc that the terrible weather wrought on the forests. It must be understood that forests are not just landscape or environmental features. They also represent a major socio-economic sector in some regions, and this should not be overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In France, more than 120 million cubic metres of wood were brought down by the wind. This represents around three years' full harvest for producers. The consequences of this have been immediate. Some foresters have lost everything. Entire areas of forest have been devastated, which will, in a few weeks, cause security and fire-fighting problems. Prices have already fallen because of the huge availability of timber, which has led to market saturation. Infrastructures will suffer as a result of the abnormal volume of heavy goods vehicles, logging and handling gear on the roads.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, it is crucial that we re-establish access routes, restore the land, and implement technical solutions, which will enable us to refit storage areas, and prop up timber prices. In the long term we will have to reforest, with all the resources we can muster. This is a whole raft of measures which should be adopted, Mr President, and I am delighted at the indications which the Commissioner gave, even though he knows that not everything is eligible under Objective 2. Médoc is not, Commissioner, and I hope that, given the circumstances, the EAGGF will be able to replace Objective 2. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is certainly a tragic one, but it must be seen as something exceptional.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, these storms and their consequences are political events of major importance. How so? Why is this not an exceptional matter? Firstly because we now know that the occurrence of this kind of climatic phenomenon is never entirely unpredictable. We now know that this kind of storm is often related to phenomena of climate change and to greenhouse effect phenomena, with regard to which our citizens are waiting for the European Union to develop a comprehensive strategy of studies and forecasts.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond that, though, what is at stake here, and this is why I say that it is, for us, an exceptionally important political phenomenon, is Europe’s ability to be what it claims to be, that is a Europe which is close to its citizens. This means, of course, that today we must send out a powerful message of solidarity to everyone affected by the storm and to the families that have lost a loved one. I would like to reiterate that we deplore the death of at least 90 people during this storm. This message must go to the craftsmen who have lost their work tools, to the farmers who have seen years of hard work disappear in a few minutes, and to everyone who saw in the 21st century in the cold and by candlelight. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this, I am delighted at the work that has been done in recent days in this House between the various political groups in order to reach a joint resolution which, I hope, will be adopted tomorrow. But in specific terms, and going beyond fine words, this solidarity must obviously be translated into a major mobilisation of finances which will enable us to set about rebuilding the devastated economic sectors, the destroyed communications networks and, quite simply, to provide people with decent living conditions once again.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that some of the devastated areas were eligible under the Community Structural Funds and that everything possible will be done to mobilise them as quickly as possible. I would like to say, though, that this is not sufficient. It is not sufficient because the reallocation of these ongoing appropriations, simply towards making good the damage, penalises long-term projects for investment and development already in place. Above all, I think that public opinion will see this solution as unacceptable in terms of our political responsibility to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Our fellow citizens do not understand why the European Union is able to release considerable sums of aid in exceptional emergency conditions to help third countries which have suffered natural disasters, even if this aid is quite legitimate. From now on, if we want to ensure that Europe is not perceived by our citizens to be a machine churning out complex and pernickety regulations, this is something we must change. We have to come up with a new budgetary mechanism which will enable us, eventually, to raise sufficient funds in the event of an emergency and in the light of the great logistical and human mobilisation which we saw, with specialists coming from all over Europe. We must effectively facilitate the creation of a Europe-wide civil protection body. It is only when times are hard that we recognise our fellow human beings and appreciate their solidarity, and I think that this is the price of building a citizens’ Europe.</p>

In the days immediately following this terrible storm I wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to redraw the boundaries of Objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2. I think that you must have done so, because you have not mentioned it. In fact, we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid. We should therefore put this situation right immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem, but also a medium and long-term one. Let me explain. I was in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20% of deciduous forest. Indeed, for some ‘forestry’ districts, which have lost 20% of their trees, this represents a huge loss. We know, for example, that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity, so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one, two or five years, but over many more. The towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years. I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues. I think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one. Indeed, you spoke of releasing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate. On the other hand, districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer, as the National Forestry Office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years. Those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case. I am telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is, and I thank the Commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, although there has indeed been an economic disaster, the real ecological catastrophes are still to come. As you yourself said, Commissioner, these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes, and we think that these are the first signs of climate change. We should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No sector has been spared: road, air, rail, ports, electricity and telephone infrastructures, homes, school buildings and historic monuments, not forgetting of course agriculture and forestry, which have been devastated in many regions. </p>
<p class="contents">People may have been traumatised in the areas where the damage has been greatest, but nobody has given up in the face of these terrible circumstances. In the days immediately following the storms, a fantastic spirit of solidarity and generosity developed, and still exists. Elected representatives, municipal employees, citizens of France and of all Europe have rallied round to offer their help. I would like to pay special tribute to the commitment and the devotion of the public service employees who gave freely of their own time with the sole aim of helping those affected, to re-establish normality with regard to electricity, transport, telephones and the utilities. At this testing time, demonstrating their efficiency, the public services have reminded everybody how essential they are to the life of our society. I think that this should give us pause, particularly with a view to halting the current process of deregulation and privatisation. It is, of course, also crucial to tend to wounds, to make preparations for reconstruction and repair, while learning all the lessons that this terrible disaster has to teach us.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I clearly heard what Commissioner Barnier was saying and indeed I appreciate his proposals, but personally, I would not set emergency goals and long-term goals in opposition to one another. On the contrary, I think that the situation shows in hindsight the relevance of the proposal my group made to restore a specific budget line for natural disasters in the Union. It would also be appropriate, of course, to increase the Structural Funds for reconstruction in regions which have been devastated, particularly appropriations for rural development, for agro-food measures and for forestry. I took particular note of the proposals concerning Objective 2. Finally, the idea that this type of disaster is connected to climate change due to the consequences of human activity upon the environment has been advanced. If this idea were to be confirmed, the European Union would have to make considerably more effort to ensure that the commitments given at the Kyoto Conference are respected. It should also make protection of the planet a priority, rather than the unbridled pursuit of profit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What can the Members of the European Parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster? Firstly, I would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who, on a daily basis, have had to reassure their constituents, organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services. They have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens. Next, I would like to thank the emergency services and the armed forces of the Union’s Member States who, in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation, came to support the efforts of their French colleagues. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid. If this disaster had taken place in Guatemala or Turkey, we could have immediately used the Community budget to help the victims, but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so. </p>
<p class="contents">We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authorities and individual States from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying Community competition rules too strictly. I am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies, which have been particularly badly hit. As you said, Commissioner, we must ensure that there is compensation for the forced cessation in activity and that appeals can be made to FIFG for investments that have been totally wiped out.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond this, I think that implementing MAGPs in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected. I therefore ask the Commission to stop doing so and, on the contrary, to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments, which they urgently need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Almost three weeks after the disaster, several thousand people were still without electricity and telephones, 500 000 hectares of forestry land, or 100 million cubic metres of forest, have been ruined, and our historical heritage has also been affected, as the sad example of the park at the Palace of Versailles demonstrates. </p>
<p class="contents">It seems quite natural that given such a disaster, national and European solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected. As the previous speakers have said, and as you said, Commissioner, in response to my fellow Member, Mr Martinez, with regard to another tragedy, the floods in November in the Southwest of France, you have certainly noted these disasters with concern, but all you are doing is pointing out that the budget line for emergency appropriations for natural disasters has been discontinued, which has resulted in this shocking paradox. This paradox, pointed out by the previous speaker, is that it is easier, a great deal easier, to offer help to victims of natural disasters outside the Union than within it. </p>
<p class="contents">We know full well that what you are doing, Commissioner, and that is, limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the Structural Funds of the new Objective 2 or from the provisional Objectives 2 or 5b. These are the terms of the written answer you gave Mr Martinez on 11 January 2000. I can show you a copy if you wish. We would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the Commission, but also of this Parliament, and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so. But for pity’s sake, and I am not saying this to you in an aggressive way, please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms. </p>
<p class="contents">As a matter of urgency, therefore, we must restore, within the framework of a supplementary budget, the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters. We must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the Union. That, however, is another problem altogether. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in mourning as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated Europe in December. </p>
<p class="contents">These storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests. I hope you do not mind if I make particular mention of the forests in my region, Lorraine, which have suffered enormous destruction. I would like to congratulate the regional authorities, the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but, unfortunately, their troubles are not yet over. It is Europe's duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of Member States affected by the disaster. </p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Mr Barnier’s statement and I also welcome the measures which the Commission has announced. I am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter, as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this. The Community action programme for civil protection, established by a Council decision on 9 December, was launched on 1 January 2000. I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity. This programme must work at full capacity. Although it may have been effective in certain areas – and I do not doubt the sincerity of Commissioner Barnier’s words – unfortunately it is still in its infancy when it comes to forestry. Our priority, as we wait for Community-level funds to be freed up, is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads, and to repair them as quickly as possible. Lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure. Our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of phytosanitary problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest, and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood. Finally, it is essential that we slow down the logging of standing wood, in order to give priority to the purchase of windfalls. These timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States. This aid for gathering timber is, of course, only the first stage of an aid package, which will take the form of aid for reforestation and aid for the development of rural areas. I ask the Commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over. </p>
<p class="contents">This is a very sad opportunity for Europe to renew its forestry heritage in line with the role that this plays in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economies. It is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between Member States in the face of an ecological and economic calamity. If this solidarity is to have been worthwhile, it is up to Europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it has now achieved notoriety. The hurricane of the same name swept across Europe claiming numerous victims, mainly in France and Germany, but also in Switzerland, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. The wind triumphed over electricity pylons, roofs, traffic signs and, ultimately over the forest. We have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cubic metres of solid timber, and this is only an estimate.</p>
<p class="contents">I have listened to you very attentively Commissioner, and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in France and in Germany. If Mrs Schreyer is to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few days, then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual. What would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an Objective 2 region, or in a 5b region? What answer will the Commission give, when it is on the scene, when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam-building, and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attractions etc.? All this is well-intentioned advice. However, I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predominates and I can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage. The thinning-out we need is not being attended to; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree.</p>

Firstly, at the beginning of 1999, NATO, with the participation of most Member States of the European Union, flattened Kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom. We are now endeavouring, at huge cost, to get the country back on its feet again and help its people, and rightly so.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the EU. The Commission in Brussels responded to the victims’ cries for help with a shrugging of shoulders. “We do not have the wherewithal for that,” they said.</p>
<p class="contents">This is wrong! And no one can comprehend this attitude. Certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss. The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity, also from within this Community. I say they have a right to solidarity. Indeed the European Parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need. I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms. It knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority. I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to support me in bringing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit me one further comment. Although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm, the tanker disaster off the French coast has made it very clear that we need to give the Commission a helping hand on another matter. The European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency. We can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations. We must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment. Then, for example, people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart.</p>
<p class="contents">When, in 1994, over five years ago that is, I joined the Legal Affairs Committee in this Parliament, I became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier. To this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission, which will actually enable me to start work. It is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste, and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters. There have always been natural disasters and there always will be. Of course, there is a need for solidarity here. There is certainly a need for European civil protection, and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">But, most importantly, it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned – despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries – and never nature, for nature cannot make mistakes.</p>
<p class="contents">The extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density, the type of infrastructure, and, of course, the many monocultures, if we are talking forests. Of course, I am in favour of providing assistance where we can. But when it comes to aid, we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future, more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cabling underground. We must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation, rather than monocultures.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate. To this day, we in Europe remain in the privileged position of having the Gulf Stream, and the Gulf Stream still does its stuff. America and south-east Asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go. We are fortunate in having the Gulf Stream. But in common with others, we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect. This is partly the work of human hand, as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take more account of the guidelines produced at the Kyoto environmental conference. We must reduce CO2 emissions, employ renewable energies, and generally make enquiries, in this connection, as to how the forests of Europe are faring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, we welcome the solidarity between the French departments and citizens, and the solidarity of other countries with France, which is the country worst affected.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have little time, Mr President, I would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution. I believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the Commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not. That is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities, in general terms, are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years. In fact, over the last decade, the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century. Therefore Europe must be clearly committed to the Kyoto Protocol and make specific proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I was rapporteur for civil protection in Europe and I completely agree with the Commissioner’s proposal to create a European civil protection body. Furthermore, we should utilise an extraordinary budget line, since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this. I want to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and regions that have tragedies like this. That is important.</p>
<p class="contents">The other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past. It was very small. It was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by Members of this House proposing action when the disasters were not even major. Officials and ministers from Member States were coming to Brussels, whispering with the Commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies. So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we should reinstate this budget line. When we had the earthquake in Greece, which was a big disaster, the Community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the Greeks. The same when the floods came in France and the same again now. These are major disasters, we should have an instrument, we do not have it. We should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument. We can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it.</p>
<p class="contents">We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic. We had floods in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffered from these. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that there was a joint decision by the Council and Parliament seeking to discontinue emergency lines. It is also true that there is a lot of European money around. Commissioner Barnier has pointed out that oyster farming and agriculture would be eligible under Article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development, forestry would be eligible under Article 33, companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in Article 87(2) of the Treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">It is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical, active solidarity. It is nothing more than the States playing at taking from Peter in order to give to Paul. This is inadequate, and I am personally delighted that Mr Barnier has stated an idea close to my heart and which, moreover, I expressed when I told the press in Bordeaux what I am hoping for, and that is the establishment of a reinforced policy of European civil security. </p>
<p class="contents">If the European citizenship that we all want to see is to come into being, if the mandate that our President, Mrs Fontaine has staked on a closer relationship between the Union and Europe’s citizens is to be effective, our citizens must be able to feel that we are acting with some urgency. I therefore believe that a European civil protection force, real civil relief blue helmets, who would go to areas in difficulty within the Union, as we currently have no emergency procedure, but also outside the Union if needs be, in Venezuela or anywhere else, is something that we should hope to see. I would like to tell Commissioner Barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly European in spirit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, the storms that took place in the last week of December showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us. Anyone travelling to Strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that storms raged in Alsace as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the storms raged so furiously, and at the same time, from my position here in this Chamber, point to how important it is to support these regions and people. Each and every one of us knows that any other region of Europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow. What we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible. For it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long. For instance, it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the bark beetle’s larvae, and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have. That is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the warmer weather arrives.</p>
<p class="contents">Decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry. For we all know how long it takes a tree to grow. The calculations are in decades rather than years.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production, for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a shield against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions. I am therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry workers are also prepared…..</p>

We had high winds and unprecedented, prolonged rainfall which, adding to existing difficulties, resulted in thousands of acres being submerged, sometimes, in up to 15 feet of water. We experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms, no sanitation, no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E.coli-infected water.

I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe. For the storms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of Europe, and I believe we need, in the long-term, to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt with in future. We certainly do not want market organisation for forests, but maybe we should set up a system, perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector, which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future. As has already been mentioned here, there are indications – no proof, but clear indications – that the increase in storms world-wide has to do with the climate catastrophe. Of course, the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet, but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we are doing, these storms will, of course, hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century. I believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Chamber by a former fellow MEP of ours, Tom Spencer. He suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women, we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect – he proposed the oil companies at the time. However, an exception should certainly be made in the case of Shell and BP, for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate, rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability. We must be aware of this connection; I do not support those who make sweeping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm, but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Next, I would like to say that as a Commissioner, but also as a French citizen, I have been very touched by the expressions of sympathy and solidarity that I have heard from many European Members of Parliament from throughout the Union. We can therefore see, thanks to this debate, a picture of the Europe which I believe in, one which is not merely a supermarket, but which is also a place of humanism. I would like to thank Mrs Scallon, Mr Martin, Mr McCartin, Mrs González Álvarez and Mr Savary who have, in particular, taken up or supported the idea which I am putting forward for a more united, more operational, more easily understood response, for civil security or civil protection. This could be achieved by creating a European civil security force, and we shall continue to advance this idea, which we shall keep you informed of in the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of you (and I listened closely to Mrs Gebhardt, Mrs Patrie, Mrs Isler Béguin, Mr Souchet, Mr Gollnisch, and Mr Savary) have said that there is not enough money or rather that there is no extra money. But, I have been a parliamentarian for a long time, and I shall not tell you your job, as you know how the budget and the general regulation of the Structural Funds work. You voted for this budget and therefore you understand perfectly well the framework in which I operate. I am not going to pull the wool over your eyes. I want to discharge my responsibilities seriously. This does not mean that I think it is in fact impossible to reintroduce an emergency aid line in any rigorous way with a very strict specification. This line only ever consisted of a few million euros in any case. That would not have any effect on the scale of the disasters and their consequences from which we are currently suffering. </p>
<p class="contents">You know this budget. This is the framework in which I have to operate and I try, as I am responsible, together with Mrs Diamantopoulou, for Objective 3, and with Mr Fischler for the EAGGF, to ensure that when we respond to these disasters immediately and in the medium term we are able to use this European money as efficiently as possible. I am therefore not opposed to changes to these budgetary rules, and perhaps at the next budget, we will discuss this again, particularly in order to establish, at least in symbolic terms, the emergency line which was discontinued two years ago. </p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, there is a great deal of money and, Mr Gollnisch, I cannot allow you to say that it will be used in some remote, hypothetical time. This money is available now, this year. If the national authorities do their job properly, and I am sure that they will, we will be able to raise appropriations for specific problems and projects from the middle of 2000 and in the next few years. This money is plentiful, even if it cannot, according to Objective 2, cover all the areas affected. In particular, it could be made use of, and I am saying this to Mr Liese, to Mrs Mathieu – and I did not mention a policy in its infancy where forestry is concerned, Mrs Mathieu – to Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert and to Mrs Schierhuber. In addition to Objective 2, as regards forestry, a subject which I consider to be extremely important, that is the restoration of our forestry heritage, there are opportunities, apart from zoning, which the substantial appropriations from the EAGGF “Guarantee” section have made possible.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say – or repeat – that not all of these disasters necessarily have natural causes. I say this with great humility. Some of you are extremely knowledgeable and competent in these matters, even if, in the past, I have happened to write several works on ecological and environmental issues. Indeed I think that through political will, we could limit the consequences of certain disasters. I think that this applies in the case of both floods and storms. Mr Kronberger, Mr Messner and Mrs González Álvarez mentioned the important issues of climate, and I would like to say that there is probably, somewhere, a link between the consequences of these natural disasters and the policies, for which Europe must remain one of the driving forces for prevention, in terms of the major environmental issues. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank you, Mr President, and Parliament, for giving the Commission the opportunity to state its views. We shall now work, within the framework of the budget and the current rules, to ensure that the available appropriations, which you have made available to us, are used in the most constructive and rapid way, in order to deal with the consequences of these disasters. They must also provide an economic, political and human response to families that have been seriously affected by them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
