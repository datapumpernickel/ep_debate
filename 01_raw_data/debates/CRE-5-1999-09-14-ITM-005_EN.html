Now, all the possibilities of steering the actions of the EU are better than ever and the confidence of the citizens is growing in that direction. Before us we have a new Commission, which has bound itself in the hearings to making the actions of the Union more transparent, more efficient and more comprehensible. We have also heard from each Member of the Commission that the Commission will be getting leaders in each field who have committed themselves to working more closely with Parliament. As a College, the Commission has affirmed that it is prepared for real reforms through the mouthpiece of its President.</p>
<p class="contents">The hard rebuke given to us in the parliamentary elections in June by the citizens of Europe is still fresh in our minds. We cannot continue on the present course, but the Union must engage in prompt reforms which will transform the procedures of all the institutions of the Union for the next Millennium. The Commission has to move forward at the same pace as the reality of the Member States and their citizens. Here, Mrs Roth-Behrendt has drawn attention to a particularly important matter: the Commission really must bear in mind the true matters of concern for the citizens when choosing its own priorities and publicising them, such as environmental issues, an enduring development in all areas as well as the need to protect the consumer. To this, I would also add equality of citizens and social equality.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I did say that all of the opportunities facing us are better than they have been before, I fear that it will not be possible to make use of them. First and foremost, the question is whether the future Commission will have the ability to carry out fundamental reforms instead of just being content to gloss over the real problems with sticking-plaster policies. We cannot afford to do this, and I am sure that real reforms are on the way. For the tasks ahead, I also wish the future Commission a long life.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But we must judge you and decide whether to put our confidence in you on the basis of your statements and what we know about you, leaving these statements to one side.</p>
<p class="contents">As European federalists, we can have absolutely no confidence in you whatsoever. The picture you painted of politics and the programme lacked all mention of the urgent institutional problems or supranational issues.</p>
<p class="contents">As liberals and liberalists we know, especially from your references to the programme, that we run the risk of importing the postcorporate and postfascist heritage into Europe which has characterised the so-called mixed economy of Italian party politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as Italians, we fear that through you on the continental political stage, there will be a return to sharing the spoils of party power which goes against every notion of the Constitutional State, every effective feeling of a Europe which stands for progress with regard to revolution and the reform of freedom and rights, progress in this sense. And so I, along with the other elected Members from the Bonino list, announce our determination to vote against you and we clearly refuse to put our confidence in you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Personally, and on behalf of the group I represent in Denmark, I have to say that I cannot vote for the Commission. I shall emphasise two points. The first is that the political programme which has been put forward promotes a degree of integration which goes far beyond what there is a mandate for from 80% of the Danish population and, what is more, from the populations of the other Member States. It is politically unacceptable. The EU is to make its presence more keenly felt across national borders, and, to an extent, that is a threat to our nation states. The second point is the background to the Prodi Commission. As we know, this was the scandal that was uncovered in connection with the first report by the Experts’ group this spring. One might have imagined that, as a prior condition of endorsing the new Commission, Parliament might have demanded radical changes to put a stop to the systematic abuses that have taken place and to the consistent lack of proper supervision to be found in the system. However, none of this even enters into the equation. In the course of these hearings, a completely perfunctory explanation from the designated candidates for the Commission has been accepted. It is especially scandalous that someone like former Commission President Delors’ right-hand man, who was responsible for setting up the criticised security services, should have been waved through this Parliament without so much as having to answer a single critical question. For these reasons, it is impossible for us to vote for the Commission-designate.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He mentioned the need for rapprochement with the USA, the Mediterranean area and even between religions. I may have misheard, but I did not detect any reference on his part to the Northern Dimension of the Union, the area from the Barents Sea through northern Russia to the Baltic States and Poland, and also from Scandinavia to northern Germany. The longest borders between the Union and applicant states are, however, to be found in this area, and in addition there is the only border with the largest European state, Russia. I hope that the problems of this area, as well as the opportunities, enjoy the attention of the Commission. Likewise, I hope that the renewal of the strategy on Russia will continue although I know that Russia with its scandals and problems is a truly great question mark at the present time. The report of the Group of Independent Experts shows that the structures of the EU and the Commission have been confused and obscured with regard to responsibility and power-relations for years. Commissioner Kinnock truly has a task as great as that of the fabled Hercules when he continues Commissioner Liikanen’s work reforming the structures of the Commission. I wish him success and await the results.</p>
<p class="contents">Professor Prodi was looking for more glasnost. This is quite correct when one considers relations with Parliament. It must, however, be remembered that Gorbachev’s Soviet Union dissolved into too much glasnost and too little perestroika. The word perestroika can best be translated as “to build a new house on tried and tested foundations”. The Soviet Union experienced its own disappearance. I hope that the Prodi Commission will also focus on perestroika in the Union. Only in this way will the Commission be able to make progress in matters of substance and to “build a new house on tried and tested foundations”.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must ask you though, what specific action are you planning to take – in co-operation with the UN of course – in terms of consolidating Timor’s now irreversible independence and making it viable, and in terms of supplying emergency aid to the long-suffering people of Timor?</p>
<p class="contents">As for your statement overall, I approve the fact that it touched on some very important points but I do not think that it emphasised sufficiently the social dimensions of the objectives of the Commission over which you preside. The fact that a word as symbolic as “cohesion” was removed from the Directorate-General for Regional Policy strikes me as rather unfortunate. I must admit that I was shocked that you were perfectly clear on the freedom of trade and on the demands of competition on businesses, but you were silent or vague on fighting unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, all veritable scourges of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner António Vitorino, who made an absolutely brilliant statement to this Parliament, highlighted the need to integrate refugees and to give effective protection to ethnic minorities. He presented an excellent programme for the area allocated to him and which deserved the agreement and applause of the majority of this Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to know if, as President of the Commission, you will attempt to commit yourself to resolving the very serious social problems which exist within the European Union, and which, to my mind, should be an absolute priority for the Commission.</p>

The huge problem of confidence in our institutions has been exacerbated by the problems of the Commission in recent months.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s response to the Balkans, on our very doorstep, was generally viewed as too little, too late. On East Timor – and I note, Mr Prodi, what you said this morning – where are we? Two weeks after the world is advised of the most brutal genocide following elections in an attempt to establish the very essence of democracy which we, as Parliamentarians, above all should uphold, we are not yet in gear and not seen as relevant to the solution by any commentators.</p>
<p class="contents">While Parliament must look at its own role very seriously, especially following the poor turnout in the recent elections in many Member States – evidence at best of disinterest but more likely cynicism and disdain by our citizens – our job today is to respond to the hearing of the Commissioners-elect and to the case put by the President-elect, Mr Prodi.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, Mr Prodi, we need “ambitious reforms of the European Union institutions”. I take that to be your <span class="italic">perestroika</span>, to match the <span class="italic">glasnost</span> which you refer to, but not an everlasting reform, not a constant state of flux. We need stability and we need to get down to the business of policy as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the view of the Commission’s relationship with Parliament being akin to that of a government’s relationship with its parliament. But let us reflect that in most parliaments a vote of no confidence in a single member of the government results in the entire government resigning, not just the individual minister. Is that what we are asking for? We are giving confused signals.</p>
<p class="contents">In insisting on the political reflection of the outcome of the recent European Parliament elections within the European Commission, how far should we go in restricting the choice of and dictating to national governments their selection of Commissioner? We must learn from our hearings. We must never allow a government to use the Commission as a retirement home for politicians past – to use a consumer term – their “sell-by date” or for a political pay-off for old pals or indeed to export a national embarrassment to Europe. At the same time there is a need for an important balance between the Commission, Parliament and the rights of governments.</p>
<p class="contents">We have no choice, Mr Prodi. It is all or nothing in terms of your new college. On balance I feel we must accept it and support your team. Yes, we have concerns about a few individuals but the responsibility for ensuring that none of them hit the headlines adversely over the next five years is yours, not ours, given the limited scope of the hearings in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The key to the future of a credible Europe lies in a proper relationship between the Commission and Parliament built on mutual respect. I hope you agree with that. I wish you all well.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Imagine if each of our national governments had to go through a procedure whereby they had to fill in fifty pages of answers to a questionnaire and were subject to three hours of grilling and questioning in public before the national parliaments took a vote of confidence allowing them to take office. We have achieved something that we can be proud of.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course this is a new procedure and a young parliament and things were not perfect. Some of the questions were less than forensic. There are things that could be improved next time. Nonetheless, with the outcome of this procedure on this side of the House we are confident that we have a Commission that is a distinct improvement on the previous one. Granted there were questions on the past activities of two candidates in particular; but both have been cleared by the national investigations that pertained to their activities and, in the absence of anything new, it would be difficult for the European Parliament to press this issue further. But the fact that the President of the Commission has secured a right not available to his predecessors to dismiss any Commissioner, should that ever be necessary, means that we can rest assured – and we shall be vigilant on this – that, if anything new emerges, we will be able to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not tried to play party politics or national politics and petty games of that sort on this side of the House. We thought that Parliament should approach this professionally and responsibly. We are satisfied with the outcome of these opportunities afforded to us in this new procedure.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, of course, clear that the question of individual responsibility and how this new Commission will give it shape over the next few years, will become an important issue. Great stress has been laid on collective responsibility in the past, but if you read the Wise Men’s report, the last report that has just come out, then the situation has been rather different in practice, with cases being founded primarily on the principle of non-intervention. I am not concerned with your affairs, you are not concerned with mine, and ultimately no one takes responsibility. That too is the painful truth that has emerged. I believe that the need to exchange the non-intervention principle for real collective responsibility represents a challenge. How exactly do you give shape to this personal responsibility?</p>
<p class="contents">I would in fact like to make the following proposition to Mr Prodi. He will produce an annual programme and this will, of course, include the things to be done within the various Directorates-General. Would it in fact be possible for an annual programme of this kind also to include a number of political obligations in terms of the results to be achieved by the various individual Commissioners? You would continue to be responsible as a collective entity, but even within this context you could specify the results that an individual Commissioner was to deliver that year in more precise terms. You could then address him or her on these issues afterwards. I would argue in favour of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the unease over the question of whether it should not in fact be a number of Commissioners, i.e. one or more, against whom criminal proceedings are initiated. I take it for granted that Mr Prodi would ask a Commissioner against whom criminal proceedings have been initiated, to resign. I also take for granted, and this is also in the Wise Men’s report, the fact that if a Commissioner should be found to have knowingly supplied Parliament with false information, then this same Commissioner would depart.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In spite of announcements, you have not succeeded in achieving a better balance between men and women in your new team. The EU Commission remains a male domain. The mission conferred in the Treaty of Amsterdam, to oppose all forms of discrimination, is still, for women at least, just a vague hope. We may speak the same European language, but you have not in fact understood us.</p>
<p class="contents">A third of your candidates did not answer the question from the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities about gender mainstreaming. The Social Democrats’ demand was and remains – again, I stress the word “remains” – to have in future an Equal Opportunities Commissioner with the power to implement equal opportunities. We demand that the College and yourself as its head become ambitious about gender mainstreaming, with measurable developments and improvements as a result. Mrs Diamantopoulou, whose portfolio includes equal opportunities alongside employment and the social dimension, has in fact shown a lot of commitment but, Mr Prodi, how will she react when she has been gagged by you in advance and when the struggle against violence, as well as the issue of non-discrimination, has been placed in other hands?</p>
<p class="contents">You speak of a new balance, a new partnership, but do not waste a single word on the women of Europe who, at the end of the day, do represent half of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We want you to take steps to ensure that substantial improvements in income and in access to power and money are achieved, and that you join us in our struggle against violence and against the everyday discrimination faced by women. </p>

<p class="contents">On the hearings, I agree with Mr Corbett that it has been a good start, but there are several things that need to be improved when the issue comes up again in 2004, for example, the possibility of our voting on individual Commissioners after a committee or at least an indicative vote to see whether the committee was really in favour or not. Secondly, we should have time in the hearings to follow up questions which it was quite clear were treated unevenly by the committees. Last but not least, the committees should have equal time. The Committee on Fisheries for instance had only one hour whereas other committees had three hours. We in Parliament need to sort out these details.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the results, without referring to individuals, many in my Group have already indicated which performers have been good or less good in the incoming Commission. Our Conservative position has been set out by the Conservative Leader Mr McMillan-Scott. We are left with an imbalance in the Commission and it is there that I believe we need to make some progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in the light of our experience from the discharge for 1996 for which I was responsible, can we really be sure that, if we do vote against an incoming Commissioner, that Commissioner will resign? Secondly, how can we be sure that we will get the information which we need? There was so much frustration in the last Parliament about not being able to get the information we required. Finally, as regards the codes of conduct, we need to know that promotion will be on merit and that promotion at the highest levels of the Commission will involve managerial competence, which has not always been the case up to now.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, these are important elements, at least for my Group. We want to see these included in our operating agreement between the Commission and Parliament because the numbers abstaining or voting against the Commission tomorrow on the final vote will depend on how far those elements are in place by tomorrow.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The number one priority must be the reform agenda. If you fail to deliver on this then we will all judge you very harshly and will in fact all suffer as a result. But as Mr Kinnock said yesterday, you will be judged on your deeds and not on your words.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Socialists in the Budget Control Committee, I would like to comment specifically on Mr Kinnock’s presentation at the hearing. Mr Kinnock’s record within the Commission is second to none and we accept fully his commitment to accept collective responsibility in terms of past problems whilst agreeing that he bears no individual guilt. Performance and management of the transport directorate has been exemplary and we believe that with his experience of modernising the Labour Party in the UK, he has the relevant qualification to undertake this work. If you can turn the Labour Party around from the lamentable state it was in the 1980s to getting us to a position in the 1990s where we swept everything away, then you must really be able to perform miracles.</p>
<p class="contents">We note the Commission’s commitment to the reform agenda and, in particular, Mr Prodi, your commitment to consult the European Parliament on the reform programme. We expect this to be before its presentation in February. We note the commitment to consult us on the reform of the Staff Regulations which addresses some of Mr Elles’ concerns, the new commitments given to whistleblowers and the need to develop new disciplinary procedures. The idea of giving legal effect to the codes of conduct once established is also something we welcome and the overhaul of the Commission’s management and control systems. We expect active consultation with Parliament at all times and we have no doubts that the Commissioner will fulfil his commitment on that score. We do have concerns that the Commission must respect the independence of OLAF. We will not allow you to play budgetary games on this issue. This is the beginning of the reform process and we now look forward to some action.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not piecemeal improvements, but root and branch reform is to be carried out, as you plausibly inform us Mr Prodi. That is a difficult task for Mr Kinnock, however, because words are not enough. Deeds must quickly follow, and in a way which is fully open to scrutiny by Parliament. For us, constructive co-operation with the Commission is a prerequisite for achieving a sustained improvement in the regrettable image our citizens unfortunately have at present of Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, I should like to touch upon three points relating to budgetary supervision. Firstly, it is normal practice to separate the power to spend and the responsibility for supervising spending. You, Professor Prodi, have combined both areas in the one department. What is your view on possibly separating the two areas, either now or in the future? As matters stand, don’t you fear conflicts of interest?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I was pleased at what you said about keeping the public informed. I also wish to see openness of this kind in relation to our Committee, especially within the framework of the discharge procedure where we are entitled to expect the information we require from the Commission to be of a particular quality. In future, we do not want initially to have to find out from the press when there have been difficulties, poor management and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point concerns OLAF, the new office for combating fraud. This year’s staffing of the office is quite inadequate. Unfortunately, Mrs Schreyer has not expressed a clear opinion about the possibility of a further 15 posts this year, giving a total of 30. From the answers at yesterday’s meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control, there was no evidence of any change to the, so far, secretive attitude of the Commission and its administration. </p>
<p class="contents">There is still a lot to be done here in the services. This also applies to work on the 30 cases on the UCLAF-OLAF list which have still to be cleared up, not to mention the 900 other cases. I am counting on the fact that some life is going to be breathed into the words “transparency”, “efficiency”, “responsibility” and “accountability”.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We had part of this House announce even before the hearings started that they intended to reject the Commission. We need the progressive forces of this House – and I say this to people like Mr van Velzen and to others – to unite after the vote tomorrow to work with the new European Commission so that we can actually make progress, because we have had nine months of stagnation. We must stop the political guerrilla warfare that is going on in this House. We must work together.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a comment on the fact that two members of the potential Commission have been criticised. We are not offering the European Commission a blank cheque, Mr Prodi; we will be watching very carefully what you and your colleagues do. But we will not see members of this Commission hounded by the press in any Member State of this Union. If there is evidence, it will be presented, and we rely upon you to take action where it is necessary. We will be voting within the Socialist Group in the European Parliament not on a party political basis but on the objective basis of the hearings and the questions that we had answered over the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me pick up the point made by Mr van Velzen because I think this process is in two stages. We have had the speech by the President of the Commission and we have had the hearings, but the second stage is the work programme of the European Commission. The work programme should be an exciting indication of where the European Union is going and of what the European Union intends to do. In the past even under Delors and under Jacques Santer it never appeared that way, but the second stage is vital. That is why I agree with Mr van Velzen: we must make sure that this work programme is understood by the public, and that it is important to the public; and we have to work with you to deliver that work programme.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made a good start with the hearing and after that vote tomorrow let the progressive forces in this House work with the Commission to deliver what the people of Europe want.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Certain opinions which we could sum up in the following way: firstly, we know that Europe has been built on the basis of two forces for construction which are dialectically opposed: those who, aware of the weight of history, defend the survival and validity of the national State and those who, with greater courage, imagine a future with greater integration, whose political definition we still do not know, and this is perhaps one of the advantages of construction.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, I speak on behalf of all those who share your principles, who share your programme, who share the idea that Europe must establish a new order of peace, prosperity and stability and that Europe must show <span class="italic">coraggio</span>, <span class="italic">ambizione</span> and <span class="italic">visione</span> (courage, ambition and vision).</p>
<p class="contents">And in their name, Mr President, I understand that we must respect the essential equilibrium laid down in the Treaty. In this respect, for example, we must respect the Commission’s right to initiative. And, of course, we must ensure that the Treaties, the legislative texts and the activities of the institutions are more in line with the demands of society. And society demands something else – you said it yourself, Mr Prodi – it demands realism and demands that we are in closer contact with that society.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, all I can do is, in the name of those I speak for, underline the commitment that, at the Intergovernmental Conference, we will carry out the fundamental reform which the citizens demand, the importance of which they have demonstrated through their low turn-out in the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The texts and our attitudes should be brought into line with today’s society, but we should not lose that which has been the key to the vault of Community construction.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President Prodi, good luck with next Commission which, with no doubt whatsoever, will be voted in tomorrow.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The French Socialists also have a certain awareness of their political responsibilities. This is why tomorrow, they will vote in favour of your investiture, because we believe that the composition of your Commission is balanced, in line with the Council. We judged the quality of your team’s members. But as you know, as you must realise, this is by no means a carte blanche or a vote of confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as we are concerned, the political aspect is not an issue. Our expectations of you rest on your programme. We expect commitments from you, to define and defend the European Social Model, to re-establish balance, as the Treaty of Amsterdam suggests you should, between the policy of competition and other policies. To ensure that the great reforms of the labour market structures do not necessarily result in greater unemployment. In short, to take into consideration these great projects which will enable Europe to experience the kind of growth which creates jobs and which does not make thousands more people unemployed. </p>
<p class="contents">We also expect you to implement a development policy which will allow Europe to maintain its position of solidarity between the North and the South. We also expect you to let us know how you think international standards can be developed. Do you think that it is up to the WTO to lay down what the internal legal system within the Union should be, or do you think that it is up to us to define the rules which will serve us? </p>
<p class="contents">Regarding institutional matters, we are pleased with the stances you have taken on giving the Intergovernmental Conference a broad mandate, and we await with interest the report of your three Wise Men. But we are anxious to find out who in your team will be responsible for the development and the drafting of the Charter of Rights. We shall also be asking you about this idea of the future make-up of the Union. This is a matter of urgency for your Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">Briefly, the setting-up of your Commission has allowed new relations to be established between your institution and ours. We are delighted about this. By holding these hearings, our Parliament has shown what a modern and democratic Parliament is capable of. We expect the same from your institution, and if you meet these conditions, you will have our support.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have not heard you speak about fishing and, nevertheless, you must be aware that thousands and thousands of fishermen depend on it, thousands and thousands of families, thousands of secondary businesses and businesses involved in the processing of products which are necessary in the European Union, employment which is furthermore located in European regions and territories which are highly dependent on fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to be very clear in this intervention, Mr Prodi, and I want to tell you that Mr Fischler, who obviously knows a lot about agriculture, nevertheless knows little about fishing. He admitted this himself during his hearing and has also demonstrated it. However, he made us some political commitments which I would like to remind you of in your capacity as President-designate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Fischler expressed orally the political commitment to maintain the current Directorate-General for Fisheries, amending the statement that he had made in writing in his questionnaire and thereby accepting the maintenance of the current Directorate-General for Fisheries. And I say current in the sense that we are talking of a specific Directorate-General, for Fisheries, with the status of Directorate-General.</p>
<p class="contents">I say this because this is a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> condition which we have established in our Committee and this is what was communicated to you in the letter which I signed myself. I ask you therefore to take good note of it, and I ask the same of Mr Kinnock, who is to the left of you, as Vice-President responsible for reform, since this is a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> condition for maintaining the parliamentary trust which we have granted Mr Fischler in our Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to remind you that Mr Fischler granted us the written mandate for the negotiation of the crucial fishing agreement with Morocco, which is a matter of extreme urgency, so that this Parliament can continue to maintain the budgetary reserve of the item agreed by the Council and that your Commission, Mr Prodi, will not be responsible for the fact that there is no finance for this agreement in the future.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This programme will be met with some apathy and reactions as regards the wording and the actual execution of it. In order to overcome all that, Mr President, originality and dynamism are necessary of which I hope you have plenty in reserve because many of us believe that these elements appear to have been lacking, judging by your speeches so far. Likewise, there have not been sufficient signs of a new attitude of mind emerging, which would be necessary to deal with the deepening confidence crisis facing Europe as regards not only the issue of unemployment but also the issue of security</p>
<p class="contents">You made reference to the Balkans, Mr President. It is a good job that Europe understands the importance of the Balkans and I agree with you wanting to convey the urgency of the matter. You are right in saying that the Balkan states cannot import their conflict into Europe, but you are not right in distancing yourself from the problem by telling them that they must resolve the conflict themselves before we can accept them.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe, Mr President, imported the Balkan problems the moment it decided, with the force of weapons, to find a settlement to those problems. And it is not only the Balkans, if we are to begin naming names. How is it possible that an applicant country, for example, can threaten to attack a Member State without being warned that attacking one Member State is tantamount to attacking all the Member States, just because there is no common European border. I hope that at the Intergovernmental Conference, Mr President, you will be able to propose measures for creating such a border and for instilling a greater sense of security into many of us who do not feel secure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We now have a joint policy on currency which is being managed by the European Central Bank. What we now need is a common economic policy. This should include consistent application of the rules on competition, including the Stability and Growth Pact. It should also include joint minimum regulations for taxation and a number of basic principles.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that this common economic policy can only succeed if it is designed in accordance with the principles of a social market economy. What we need in this connection – and this, Mr President of the Commission, is a further point to which you referred quite specifically – is a number of projects which are visible to the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly – and I know that there are criticisms about this – food safety is one of people’s basic concerns yet also one of the things which stops the Common Market from really working. I should like personally to encourage you, Mr President of the Commission, to take up this theme, for it seems to me to be of fundamental importance, on the one hand for our citizens but, on the other hand too, for the proper functioning of the Common Market.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: the supervision of air space. For this, America has one authority, to which you also referred in one of your initial speeches. In Europe we have three authorities concerned with this issue. That is unacceptable to the airline companies and is dangerous for the citizens of Europe. This seems to me to be a second big priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: the further dismantling of monopolies. From the costs of telephone calls and of electricity, it appears now for the first time that dismantling monopolies is of practical value to our citizens and also entails tangible advantages. I think this ought to encourage us to go further down this road, that is to say, in the fields of postal services, energy, telecommunications and railways where similar conditions prevail. In my opinion, dismantling monopolies is to the advantage of the citizens of the European Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have our support, provided of course that the Commission fulfils all those conditions that you yourself have imposed. You gave a speech this morning and we have heard a lot in the course of the hearings. What is still very much conspicuous by its absence as far as we are concerned, is that element of social concern. First and foremost, that element of social concern towards the rest of the world. 125 million children will not be going to school today, which means they have no future in this world. Our world is not millennium-proof. I am so keen to see January’s programme become one of ambitious endeavours on the part of Patten, Lamy, Nielson and your Commission to make Europe really socially-minded towards other countries in this respect, and then towards its own.</p>
<p class="contents">The solidarity, free market and need for reform we have spoken of, will only work if we keep everyone on the same track. Too many people are excluded at the present time, in our own European world too. Internal solidarity and solidarity towards others, as I said, that is what we would like to judge you and your programme on in January. For our part, we are looking at all the Commissioners and we hope to be able to make a confidence-inspiring new start in Europe, in the way described so effectively by Mr Van Velzen when he set out how the programme could achieve this.

In my view these hearings were flawed because there was insufficient time available to the committees to pursue their lines of questioning. I speak from our experience on the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. Because we had to make time available to delegations from other committees, neither the members of my group nor our committee nor the members of the delegations had sufficient time to put all the questions that they wanted to candidate Commissioners Liikanen and Lamy. This is a matter for great regret.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point where the hearings were flawed was in the failure to hold indicative votes at the end of each hearing. I know there are different views on this issue but it seems to me that without an indicative vote the key element of whether Members feel the candidate Commissioner is competent or not cannot be determined exactly.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me come to the substance. I have mentioned two candidate Commissioners but there was a third who appeared before us, candidate Commissioner Busquin. It is no coincidence that this was a hearing where there were no delegations from other committees and we had more time to pursue questioning. I am afraid that Mr Busquin did not satisfy a majority of colleagues on the committee either with his answers on his part in past financial scandals or with his answers on his competence with the portfolio and whether he would have a sense of responsibility and leadership appropriate to the tasks facing this Commission. Fresh information has come to light since the hearing in <span class="italic">The Sunday Times</span> <span class="underline"> </span>this weekend which casts further doubt on whether Mr Busquin was truthful in his answers to Parliament. I have asked the President to consider this matter. So, I am afraid he would be a flawed Commissioner, Mr Prodi.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has been enough evasion and we need a strong Commission. Besides, without an authoritative leadership, Parliament is in danger of losing its way.</p>
<p class="contents">This period of adjustment could not have been more difficult. The crisis in the previous Commission occurred just at the time when Europe was going up in flames! If it were not for Emma Bonino, in the face of the Balkans tragedy, the Commission simply would not have existed. However, the European citizens and peoples have been left with an impression of fragility, if not powerlessness and a sense of weakness in the crucial area – the area Europe was created for – of ensuring peace in our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke of the Europe of peoples more than the Europe of the institutions. It is the view and feeling of the European peoples that Europe is already one from the Atlantic to the Ural mountains, from the tundra to Anatolia. You rightly put at the top of the list enlargement of the Union to include those countries that are ready, and then you spoke of the different degrees of co-operation by drawing concentric circles of ‘virtual Membership’ to include nearby countries not yet ready to accede. You also mentioned a partnership with Russia and Ukraine and a cultural partnership with the Mediterranean countries. And encompassing all these circles is the joint and strengthened leadership with the United States of America. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, are you sure that this view is shared on the other side of the Atlantic? You will no doubt have read yesterday that the American Minister of Defence is already putting obstacles in the way of common European defence. And yet Mr CFSP is non other than the former Secretary-General of NATO. NATO’s borders already stretch to Warsaw and Budapest while Europe’s borders clearly end in Berlin. </p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is the main priority, but it is not without its problems, both for the countries concerned and for the Union itself. And I am not only thinking of the disproportion between larger aims and a smaller budget. If we do not want to lose in substance what we gain in size, if we want to give a soul to the Europe of the single market and currency, if we want to regain the citizens’ and people’s faith, we – Commission, Parliament and Council – must work together on what only a more robust foundation and new energy can bring: European citizenship, a Charter on Rights and a real Constitution. What is the point in having ensured free movement within one border yet maintaining fifteen different laws on immigration and political asylum? What is the point in having one parliament that is formed on the basis of fifteen different types of electoral system? A new frontier remains to the South, and a common citizenship: this is the perspective I would like you to focus on between now and January </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Brian Simpson attacked Mrs Palacio quite unashamedly and for no apparent reason. I emphatically reject these attacks on her on behalf of my group.

<p class="contents">The Committee recognised Mrs Palacio’s professional qualifications by a large majority. The Committee has confirmed that the priorities which Mrs Palacio has set out orally and in writing reflect the opinion of Parliament. A majority of the Committee was also satisfied with Mrs Palacio’s answers to the Socialists’ accusations in connection with the flax subsidy investigation in Spain. Mrs Palacio has convincingly shown that the investigating committee of the Spanish Parliament has rejected all accusations against her as unfounded. We decisively reject the attacks by the Socialists who take up this old theme again and again and repeatedly put forward accusations. We look forward to co-operating with Mrs Palacio.</p>

Because of his political experience as a national minister and also as chairman of a regional assembly, Mr Barnier is in the best position to understand, apply and transpose regional policy. He said something which I found very convincing, namely: “Yes, we respect the principle of subsidiarity, that is to say, the Member States and the regions decide first, but, as a Commissioner, I am responsible for ensuring that the goals of regional policy are adhered to, and I shall take that responsibility seriously.” In this respect, we also look forward to collaborating with you, Mr Barnier.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to wish you all well: Mr Prodi, Mr Kinnock and everybody else who is taking on enormous responsibilities on behalf of the people of the European Union. They are enormous responsibilities because they relate to the way people will lead their lives over the coming decades. There are people in Europe killing each other because of differences over religion, ethnicity and nationality, there are people going to bed hungry, there are people sleeping outdoors and there are people without adequate health care. These are all problems that Europe has to solve in partnership, not only between the Commission and Parliament but also between the Commission, Parliament, the Member State Governments and the Member State parliaments. One of the things we should try and do over the next five years is to forge a closer partnership between national and regional parliaments and the European level.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to develop a Europe in which our people have a share, we must give them a role in creating that Europe and sharing that Europe. The only way we will do that is if we give the social dimension of Europe – the social convergence that is needed in Europe – the same status as we give to monetary convergence and to economic convergence. We cannot create a Europe that the people will feel is theirs if we simply talk about economics and money all the time. We have to talk about social issues, culture and what concerns people in their daily lives. We have to demonstrate that the politics of this Union can solve their problems.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Donnelly appears still to abide by the old Marxist principle that the Socialist Party is always right and anyone who disagrees with this is wrong. But I did not want to talk about that today, Mr President, I wanted to speak, as co-ordinator of the Committee on Employment, about the hearing with Mrs Diamantopoulou.</p>
<p class="contents">The answers provided by this Commissioner-designate were, in principle, satisfactory. It is clear that not everyone was in agreement with all her answers, but everyone on the Committee on Employment feels that the answers she gave provide a sound basis for future co-operation. The same goes for the vast majority of the European People’s Party. This Commissioner is not one of those against whom the PPE rightly raised objections.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, a few comments need to be made here. The Commissioner-designate was not prepared to accept more intensive co-operation with the European Parliament as regards the Employment Pact and its further development. I refer now to the celebrated Cologne Summit. There is every risk of the successful Luxembourg process that we now have being swept under the carpet by the unsuccessful Cologne episode without parliamentary contribution. That is why the Commission must continue to involve Parliament in the process. Another critical point, which our British colleagues were particularly concerned to raise, is that concerning deregulation. The Commission should also pursue this issue, insofar as it can create employment. The position of non-governmental organisations in the social sector still has not been determined. A legal basis must be created as soon as possible which will enable organisations for the disabled, the elderly, children and families in particular, to create a real civil society at European level. The social dialogue is very important. Europe can count itself as lucky that the social dialogue has achieved so much. But the social dialogue, Mr Prodi, must never be a reason for the Commission and Parliament to renounce their political responsibilities. As long as Parliament’s role in judging the outcome of the social dialogue remains undetermined, there is a need for an interim solution.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, I very much appreciate the fact that the Commissioner went into great detail during the hearing about my report, the aim of which is to bring about a kind of Luxembourg process in relation to security for the citizens of the Member States.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was captivated by your comments to this Parliament when you said that you were going to act, that you were not going to be afraid of making mistakes, that you would prefer to get things right but that, if by taking decisions, you make mistakes, you would run the risk of making those mistakes. Congratulations. These are good intentions which we hope to see shortly reflected in deeds.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission on Budgetary Control, the members of the Group of the European People’s Party are primarily concerned with the need to be honest. The Committee of Independent Experts says that OLAF must be given the necessary resources to put an end to this aura of corruption which brought about the downfall of the former Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">But I believe that we must go further. We must soon adopt a genuine personnel policy which will ensure that those who work in the Commission – on whose successes and failures we depend so much – may work with a personnel policy which values merit. I asked Mr Kinnock whether those 500 or so vacant posts in the Commission were going to be filled. If you lack resources, why do you not fill the posts which this Parliament has authorised?</p>
<p class="contents">We want to see action soon. In a month’s time, the Council on Home Affairs will take place. This could be the moment to introduce those measures which the Committee of Independent Experts proposes, and which on the whole are common sense measures which should have been carried out long ago. This Parliament demanded some of them a long time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Are you, Mr Prodi, ready to include those measures which will be dealt with in Helsinki? We want to see facts because time is at a premium, Mr Prodi. If tomorrow you receive the approval of this House – and I hope this is the case – you have a huge job to do on behalf of all the citizens of Europe. Make haste, Mr Prodi.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, Mr Prodi, I would remark that Mr Fischler was very well prepared on the matter of agriculture and provided convincing proof of his specialist knowledge. In the hearing before the Committee on Agriculture, probably one of the most important questions was that of Parliament’s participation in decision-making in the matter of Community agricultural policy. In this connection, my group expressly welcomes Mr Fischler’s statement that basic legislation affecting the way in which the general direction of agricultural policy is conceived should be decided as part of a joint decision-making process and that he would actively put forward this view at the future Intergovernmental Conference. Mr Prodi, I am assuming that you support Mr Fischler on these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a lot of time at the hearing was devoted not only to the outstanding questions concerning enlargement of the Union but also to the question of introducing the European agricultural model to the international stage in the future WTO negotiations and, above all, safeguarding it. Here too I can state, on behalf of my group, that it is clearly the settled will of the Commission to include such questions as, for example, socio-agricultural standards and European environmental provisions in the Millennium Round. Our colleague, Mr Garot, has already referred to this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: if, in the next legislature, the Commissioner-designate for Agriculture succeeds in listening more to the draft amendments introduced by Parliament and to parliamentarians themselves (as long as, it is only fair to say, the latter do not exceed the budgetary limits and do not put existing legislation out of force), then a majority of my group is of the opinion that the Candidate’s experience, skills and commitment suggest that he will do some good work as a Member of the Commission.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And if you bear in mind that a Spanish politician once said that the Spanish are characterised by their willingness, you can imagine the mood I am in.</p>
<p class="contents">Why am I going to vote unwillingly? Well, because I believe that what Europe needs are three things that in my language begin with “i”: <span class="italic">ideas </span>(ideas)<span class="italic">, ilusión </span>(aspiration)<span class="italic"> </span>and <span class="italic">impulso </span>(motivation). I believe that the speech which you have made today has suffered from a lack of all three. It has been a speech with no clear political objectives, no edge, and has been downright boring. You have said that you want the Commission to be the Government of Europe. So do I, but I believe that your speech has not been that of a President of a European Government but more like a speech of a Secretary-General of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">I will give you an example of what I mean by specific commitments. The next European Council will cover constitutional reform. Mr Barnier made an excellent contribution before the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and he made certain compromises, because this Parliament does not simply aspire to co-operating with the Commission. What was it that you said today: “the Commission and Parliament will co-operate”? No, we already take co-operation for granted, it is in the tradition of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have wanted since 1997 is to prepare for the Intergovernmental Conference in conjunction with the European Commission. The Commission must consider this matter – and this Parliament will do the same thing – and these two institutions of the European Union will together try to produce a preparatory document to facilitate the adoption of agreements. You have not said a word about this although it has been the doctrine of this Parliament since 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr Prodi, allow me to give you a piece of advice. We have to make more commitments, we have to be less prudent, because the Europeans want a strong Commission, which works hard and strives for the interests of Europe. Mr Prodi, I believe that our citizens are going to demand this objective more and more every day, and not speeches void of commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To my mind, there is a double challenge facing this Commission: winning the confidence of Parliament and also, and especially, that of our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Member for a border region between Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, I can describe for you the everyday expectations of many Europeans but, in particular, their lack of comprehension concerning the many instances of bullying which affect relations between our Member States. Investments, employment protection, health protection and fiscal policy are just a few examples of the points at issue. These problems are not those of a minority in Europe. No, Europe’s shortcomings in these areas are particularly sensitive issues on the national borders. They are everyday problems which, unfortunately, have only been acknowledged somewhat late in the day as problems for Europe as a whole. Devoting ourselves to these problems, Mr President, means winning over our citizens, in their work and with their problems. It is in their thinking and in their creative activity that we also have to win them over to the European idea.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament has given clear signs to the previous and future Commissions. We therefore expect genuine co-operation, and right from the start. We expect strengthened supervision, for EU funds are not anonymous in origin but are tax payments from all our citizens. We are also awaiting, however, a precise definition of political responsibility from this Commission. I shall express my confidence in you and your team because you alone at present bear the responsibility for this College and for its strengths and weaknesses. The power is in your hands, Mr President, to ensure that Parliament’s signals are correctly interpreted. One thing I know already. A highly critical Parliament will not be fobbed off for weeks with arguments about overall responsibility. Our vote of confidence is no blank cheque but an offer of constructive co-operation from many Members of this Chamber.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But time does not permit it and I shall simply content myself by thanking those who sent me here for doing so and saying that I will try and serve their interests as best I can.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not vote for the Prodi Commission. Firstly, despite my fondness for my former parliamentary colleague, Neil Kinnock, my party and I made a commitment at the European elections that we would not support any Commission which had within it previous members. Although I do not expect anybody else to support that, I hope those who disagree will understand that in a democratic society when you make a commitment to people who elect you, you try and comply with that commitment when you get elected.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I shall not vote for this Commission because I do not believe that in real substance anything has changed in the last few weeks as a result of the hearings which we have had. We have not had enough time to question Commissioners; we have not had enough time to follow up with an interrogatory process. There has been not one individual vote in any committee on any Commissioner, not one Commissioner has been forced to withdraw as a result of the questions as to his suitability and not one Commissioner has accepted any sort of responsibility for the events of the past. Because we cannot vote for individual commissioners tomorrow and because I cannot individually record my vote in this Chamber that my colleague Mr Patten would make a fine Commissioner for External Affairs, I am left with simply no choice but to vote against this whole Commission in order to send a message to Mr Prodi and his colleagues that if and when they are elected they will respond to this Parliament; they will accept that it can no longer be business as usual and that we have to change our ways if we are to give the people of Europe the confidence they must have in this Parliament and its institutions.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And make no mistake, the discussion in the PPE Group this evening will still be very exciting. These are the reasons why I shall be voting “no” if no far-reaching change is to take place. Firstly, your Commission reveals a democratic deficit, Mr Prodi. The result of the European election is not reflected at any point in your team. I can appreciate why you’ve accepted a “green” Commissioner in view of the result achieved by the Greens in the European election. People will not, however, understand why ten Socialists are to be represented when they ask what influence their votes have really had upon the composition of the European Commission. And let us ask your predecessor, Mr Santer. Who, in this connection, has achieved any kind of success with the various national governments? </p>
<p class="contents">My second reason is the answers given by the Commissioners-designate at the hearings about the van Buitenen case. The citizens of Europe will not understand it if a new strategy is not at last applied here and those who care about transparency do not also finally receive stronger support in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest problem for me and many others, however, is the proposed successor to Mrs Cresson. I do not, of course, want to pronounce any legal judgement upon Mr Busquin. I do not represent Belgian justice, and none of us want to put him in prison. The question is that of how we can restore trust in the European institutions. Do you really believe that we can win the citizens’ trust when the only answer we are ever presented with is “I have not been accused personally”? Mr Busquin is involved in the Inusop affair and has not been accused for the sole reason that the case became statute-barred. This is an astonishing parallel to the case of the EU’s Balkans Co-ordinator, Bodo Hombach. And in the Dessault-Augusta affair it has since become very clear that he knew of an illicit fund. I wonder who can guarantee us that we will not have illicit funds in the Commission in future, in the DG XII or elsewhere, if this subject is not tackled in a better way than has so far been the case. So, Mr Prodi, you can still convince me by active intervention, but you must provide a very clear sign to Parliament and to the public. Otherwise, I shall be voting “no” tomorrow like a lot of other people. It won’t be a “no” vote for Europe but a vote for a clean, democratic and transparent Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I said to myself, “he has spotted me”, but you had your back turned to me. Thank you, Mr President, for having unintentionally quoted me because I have come to the European Parliament as leader of the Pensioners’ Party to represent for the first time the needs of the elderly. So this statement by Mr Prodi, in which he went on to say that he will keep matters relating to pensioners in mind, has given me hope for what the next few years will bring. </p>
<p class="contents">I must say that I and the pensioners who sent me here to seat 270 of the European Parliament were pleased by the comment made by Mrs Anna Diamantopoulou. When she replied to one of my questions during the hearings – and we should point out what did not go well but also what did – she said that she is fully aware of the issue concerning the elderly who expect a pension which the fifteen Member States are no longer able to pay because the pension funds are weak and are in deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">The elderly live for too long, and we and our supporters will do our best to make our lives as short as possible, but I am afraid this will not be enough. So I hope that the European Parliament and the Commission will finally speak out for the elderly so that the fifteen Member States give them the respect they deserve and, above all, establish rules that ensure that the money people have to pay every month is safe, so that they will have a pension in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many of you have pointed out that not much can be said in the space of two minutes, but I have taken full note of your remarks. Please excuse me if I am unable to answer all the points raised in depth because of the lack of time available. I have tried to group together the most important problems, namely those which may sway votes or determine a change of course by an institution.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, however, allow me to turn again to the question of East Timor, a problem raised by Mr Barón Crespo, Mr Soares and many others. I wish to inform Parliament that at 2 p.m. today, I had a long telephone conversation with President Habibie of Indonesia, following his meeting with the Ambassadors of the 15 Member States of the European Union in Djakarta. During this conversation, President Habibie formally undertook – and I repeat, formally – to give all foreign journalists free and unlimited access to East Timor, to give full and unconditional support to the intervention by the United Nations, to create the conditions for this to take place as soon as possible and to make every effort to alleviate the conditions suffered by the population of East Timor, stressing that there are 200 million Indonesians facing difficult circumstances. Lastly, he undertook to respect the decisions taken by the people of East Timor. For my part, I told President Habibie that we would seek to monitor compliance with these conditions as strictly as possible and I told him that I would report the content of our conversation to the European Parliament, as I am now doing.</p>
<p class="contents">He then told me of his keen desire to maintain good relations with the European Union, a position we reciprocate in our desire to see the rights and dignity of the people of Indonesia respected, a point I impressed upon President Habibie. Commissioner Nielson has told me that we are doing everything in our power to provide direct aid and we shall use all possible channels. The problem is that it is not easy from a technical point of view and we are using all the organisations which currently have direct access, including the United Nations, the Red Cross and others.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point I should mention, of which I was reminded this morning, is that the committee chaired by Mrs Ana Palacio has called on Commissioner Bolkestein to consider resigning from his position as president of the Liberal International. Commissioner Bolkestein has now done so and has instead become honorary president of that organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">My third remark concerns a matter frequently raised in this House and one which I believe is in the thoughts of all Members of Parliament. I am referring to the important problem of organising measures to combat fraud. We have strengthened our anti-fraud campaign and shall continue to do so, but what we need is a specialised body of high-level inspectors – and this is not just a question of increasing the numbers – for I am firmly convinced that this is of crucial importance. As in any organisation which has grown, shall we say, more quickly than we would have liked, and has taken on new tasks, what is lacking – and the report of the five Wise Men provides an extremely useful analysis of this question – is an organisational model with the firmness and, above all, the necessary links to ensure that fraud can be prevented. Unfortunately the problem of fraud is on a vast scale and I can assure you that it will be the focal point of our activities, not least because these problems tend to occur where there are fewest controls, namely at the new frontiers of the European Union, the very ones which project our image to the outside world. Consequently, it is also a very serious problem from a political point of view. </p>
<p class="contents">With reference to other matters raised, such as food safety or air-traffic control, I would remind you of what I said in my earlier speeches to Parliament. As this is now the fourth time I have addressed this House, I am trying to avoid boring you by repeating the same things over and over again. Let me repeat, however, that I stand by what I said in my four previous speeches, which can be taken as a single statement of position.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, I wish to touch on a number of essential points. One vital issue – which everyone has mentioned – concerns transparency and openness. I have already stressed the importance of this issue. Transparency is an objective which goes beyond the mere fact of mutual openness on the part of institutions; it is the foundation, the social contract of the European institutions. On the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we are being asked to legislate on the question of public access to documents. We must seize this opportunity – and we intend to do so – to open up this sector and ensure that all institutions and not just Parliament help to define the rules, which must be rules rather than general principles with operating rules derived from them.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to certain specific documents, the problem remains, for example, of how to obtain documents just released by the Commission, which Parliament should receive before anyone else. This is right and proper and whenever the press asks to receive documents before Parliament, there is clearly a problem. I am afraid that there may be cases where the problem cannot be avoided because of procedure involved, but I am determined to ensure that it does not happen, while seeking also to speed up the information provided to Parliament. With this in view, we have already begun to make extensive use of electronic communications and I would also stress the Commission’s commitment to attend Parliament’s debates and discussions at plenary and committee level, since I believe that exchange of information is of the utmost importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, this is a process which we must try out together and it will not be easy to do so. It is one of the most delicate issues, because Parliament too needs to be fully and actively involved. This means better links with the Commission’s decision-making process, not only at the planning stage but also as regards information and the decisions which each Commissioner – Commissioner-designate today and confirmed Commissioner tomorrow – takes and which must be distributed in an appropriate pre-established way.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally think that there are good reasons for supplying information about the Commission’s work too and, after the event, about the Minutes of Commission meetings, and we must reach precise agreement on this too. It has also been suggested that at least during the Strasbourg week, the agenda for plenary should include an item designed to inform Parliament about the Commission’s meeting. I shall devote a great deal of attention to these initiatives and I would also like a debate to be launched on the issue of confidential information. I consider that considerable progress has been made towards an interinstitutional agreement on this issue – I refer in particular to the discharge – and we ought to continue in this direction in the interests of mutual collaboration.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to equality of the sexes, I feel it was quite right to raise the question. Unfortunately, it is a gradual process – we have made some progress, for example in the cabinets and the administration. I can only assure you that it will be high on the agenda, since it is linked, as many of you have said, to other problems of equality, not only of the sexes, and in the interests of avoiding other forms of discrimination which are habitually practised in our society. </p>
<p class="contents">Another series of questions dealt with the issue of assigning and modifying portfolios. The distribution of portfolios raises questions for me too. We have split the portfolios in what I myself consider to be an arbitrary way but I also think that it is the best possible distribution at the moment. For example, you asked – Mrs Theato asked the question a short time ago – whether it is appropriate for the budget and financial control to come under the responsibility of a single Commissioner. I feel that we must discuss these issues further. I consider the division of tasks to be sensible, decided in all good faith but on an experimental basis, and since I have the power, under the terms of Amsterdam, to redistribute these competencies, I believe I will be able to do so fairly easily. I am therefore devoting particular attention to the critical points; I would only ask you to put forward considered reasons so that a firm consensus decision can be reached.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the issue of the answerability of the Commissioners and possible sanctions, a problem which hovered over the hearings and which has come up several times today in your contributions to the debate – the issue of the answerability of the Commissioners and possible sanctions to be adopted in the event of behaviour which does not meet the standards of correctness which must be observed by the Commission, as by any public institution – the issue of fraud, on the one hand, and the issue of the behaviour of the government, hence the Commission, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a distinction between two aspects: one is Parliament’s loss of trust in an individual Commissioner and the other the relationship with an individual Commissioner accused of criminal offences. I believe we must keep these two aspects separate, although they are part of the same set of problems.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Parliament’s loss of trust, I should like to remind you that each Commissioner has undertaken to resign if I ask him or her to. A vote of no-confidence against an individual Commissioner by the European Parliament would obviously for me be a reason for the most lengthy, serious and thorough consideration. When I say ‘reason for the most serious and thorough consideration’ what I mean exactly is that I can undoubtedly not take lightly the wishes expressed by the European Parliament. However, I am well aware that politics and political dispute can also have unforeseen results and we must therefore consider the subject in depth and, above all, reflect on the fact that the Treaties do not provide for the possibility of individual sanctions. It must therefore be a non-political move, it must be dictated by the relevant authority, not by a legal provision which at present does not exist.</p>
<p class="contents">I obviously undertake to endeavour to ensure that every time this problem arises it will be tackled in the most decisive and clear terms possible. Finally, it is clear that in any case I will have to offer an explanation for any decision I take and I must of course offer it to Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">Now I should like to talk about the other point, that is to say, a Commissioner called upon to answer criminal charges. I clearly understand your message and I would say that as far as I am aware, no Commissioner in the history of the Commission has yet been called upon to answer criminal charges. However, I do not object to considering hypothetical situations which have not happened but can always arise. I must say that, in any democracy, the fact that a member of the government may be required to answer criminal charges would seriously jeopardise the possibility of his continuing to carry out the mandate of minister. The same applies to the European Commission and a European Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, of course, there has been much talk of criminal charges relating to acts of corruption; other types of charge, which are equally unpleasant, do exist and should be taken into account, but I think the talk has been restricted to criminal offences linked to corruption merely owing to the present context. However, we must not – and do not wish to – forget the existence of the rule of law, the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence. And let us not forget also the fact that our legal systems, which are so diverse throughout Europe, provide for different procedures between which it is often impossible to draw a meaningful comparison. Therefore, all issues of this nature must be approached with the utmost care, considered in good faith and then explained before Parliament. Situations of this kind need to be considered in depth so as to ensure that no political decisions are taken until a full and intimate knowledge of the facts at issue has been gained.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore assure you once again that in the event of such situations arising, I would examine the facts of each case with the utmost thoroughness.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude with a general comment. Mr Méndez de Vigo said that I would be voted in without any great enthusiasm. One could, of course, say that votes are votes, whether enthusiastic or not. But I believe it to be extremely important for a vote to be given with enthusiasm, since we are in not just any old Parliament and are about to embark on not just any old political project. We are heading in a wholly new direction, and one which has never been taken anywhere in the world. When I think about what monetary union really represents, I realise that nothing of its like has ever occurred in the past. When I think of these fifty war-free years in all the countries in and around the Union and of the wars outside those countries, I realise that we are not faced with something for which one can vote against one’s real wishes; we are faced with something which we must see as being a new frontier in the history of humanity. Will we be capable of taking up this difficult challenge? I do not know. What I do know is that I have attempted to do so by adopting the sort of tone appropriate to such moments: a tone of responsibility, in full awareness of the events which have occurred over the past ten months within the Commission, which needs to restore its credibility by keeping its word on each statement it makes and which cannot therefore at this present moment allow itself to make the ambitious pronouncements which are needed – and which I myself firmly believe are needed – and which we will be able to make only if we manage to elicit trust in each of the pledges we are now making. These pledges are, Mr Méndez, like all pledges on matters of detail, unexciting, because everyday life is not made up of important issues alone. But I can assure you that I am fully aware of the fact that we are faced with what I myself called ‘a major project for Europe’.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not succeed, it will obviously not take long for the grudging vote in favour to become a quite deliberate vote against. But it is this project which must bring us together; a project which you called for yourselves and which many of those who voted against also called for. All are looking for an appropriate response to the major challenges ahead; all are looking for a European project, a project for Europe, a project in which the impetus for a new Europe will be found not in the Secretariat or the Council, but in the Commission, the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what we intend to achieve, and I should like to thank those who have acknowledged that, despite the difficulties involved, we have put together a serious and balanced Commission. These are the two qualities on which I want us to base our work for the time being. In future, I believe that, starting with our programme in January, which is a strong programme, we shall also be able to offer you a Europe which has moved out of its period of crisis and can start building again, and which can thus be voted for not with a sense of resignation but with joy.</p>
