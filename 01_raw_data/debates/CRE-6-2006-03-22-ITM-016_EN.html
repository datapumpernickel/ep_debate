<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Luisa Morgantini (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (IT) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ‘You will eat when you are competitive’ is a slogan on a poster: in the background, a starving African child. The phrase is very emphatic, but it actually seems that the European Union, and this is a euphemism, is placing too much emphasis on the effectiveness of trade in the fight against poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The report under debate today is incomplete, and in the draft, in fact, there were some points where the effects of liberalisation on the economies of developing countries were called into question. Various econometric studies, a report by Christian Aid and the study entitled ‘Winners and losers’ by Sandra Polanski, published last week, have shown that many developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, would be experiencing better conditions today if we had not introduced unbridled liberalisation measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Polanski study, which analyses the winners and losers in the liberalisations launched under the Doha Round, confirms data previously published by UNCTAD and the UNDP and reaches certain conclusions: developing countries will probably be the losers in the game, since they do not have the agricultural or industrial capacity to compete with the rich countries; the winners will in fact be the rich countries: the United States, Europe and Japan, and also China.</p>
<p class="contents">Free trade will produce modest gains at the global level, partly because the adjustment costs which countries have to deal with when they undertake the liberalisation process promoted by the industrialised countries can be greater than the benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a question of being against trade, since the opening up of the markets can also be an effective instrument in the fight against poverty, but like any instrument it must be used with great caution. First of all, it is necessary to put the countries in a position to meet their own internal requirements, by boosting productive capacity in line, above all, with internal goals of self-sufficiency in food, and then it is necessary to allow them to tackle competition and limitations on supply, by providing adequate resources which are currently not present in the financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is then necessary to work on the basis of realistic timetables, which take into account the time that structural adjustments require and, thirdly, it is necessary to restrict the opening up of the market, and to lay down, in addition, mechanisms for suspending the liberalisation process, if necessary, and to give the ACP countries the opportunity to protect their own incipient and strategic industries; in any case, we used this criterion ourselves throughout the last century and some in fact are still trying to put it forward again today.</p>
<p class="contents">These principles are almost present in the report, partly because these are the requests of the ACP countries, and it is those countries that are putting them forward. Because an effective principle of partnership requires that we take into account the requests of our partners, above all if they are justified, and above all if they are backed by civil society in Europe and in the ACP countries. Also and above all because the economic partnership agreements arise from the legal and institutional framework of the Cotonou agreement, signed by the European Union – and I underline this – and they have development and combating poverty as their ultimate goals.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of this same principle of partnership, we do not have the right to impose agreements. I believe that it is those countries that have to do it, and one of the main points in the report is the call for the Commission to carry out an immediate study of the alternatives so that the ACP countries can evaluate the options and decide whether to sign the agreements or not. The reciprocity that is being called for in the implementation of liberalisations, then, means applying equal laws to those who are not equal in economic or development terms; this is no way to produce equality or democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Thinking about development solely in terms of increasing a country’s gross domestic product is very reductionist. Development is hard to define, but when in my report the Commission is called upon to protect the sectors of water, health and education from liberalisation, what we are fundamentally talking about is rights that must be guaranteed, as when the Cape Town Declaration is quoted. The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly also has the power to set development indicators in order to assess the achievement of results and trade agreements, requesting that social and environmental indicators be included such as the creation of dignified work, health, education and gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about rights – the same rights for which we have struggled in Europe, the same rights on which the European Union is founded. The European Parliament cannot wish to remove these values. We are at a crucial point in the struggle against poverty and we must meet the objectives that we have set ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Development, we all agree, is indeed the starting point, the vital issue and the priority for our action. We shall, of course, continue to insist on that throughout the negotiations and during the implementation of the EPAs, when the time comes.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I am delighted that we share the same opinions on very many points, such as the importance of the dialogue with civil society and the national parliaments of the ACP countries, the objective of regional integration and economic governance, the role of investment and the diversification of exports. I find, in this report, opinions that I myself have often put forward to our partners, who have a vital role to play in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The prime objective is development, and that also involves a flexible approach that makes it possible to take into account the economic weaknesses of the countries concerned, which we are trying to strengthen. This approach manifests itself, for example, in the way in which trade liberalisation is biased in favour of the ACP countries, in flexibility in relation to the opening of their markets, in the extent to which we cover their products and in the necessary safeguard mechanisms. These are all principles that were clearly stated in our negotiating positions from the first day and that the Commissioner, Mr Mandelson, has himself confirmed on several occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I have also observed that, on certain sensitive issues, the report raises doubts that I feel are not justified. For example, the report questions how coherent our position concerning the EPAs is with the commitments made in the Cotonou Agreement or in the recent declaration on the European Union’s development policy. Perhaps there is a communication problem, which I shall try to resolve this very day. There should be no misunderstandings between us, because Parliament’s support is obviously more necessary to the Commission than ever in the delicate phase of negotiations that we are in and that should come to an end in a little more than a year.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I think that we need to put the compatibility of EPAs with the rules of the WTO back into the right perspective. Of course, this compatibility is imperative if we wish to ensure the stability of the EPAs, as of all our trade agreements, and the Commission must attend to this. We are also willing to improve on the WTO rules, if possible. Some proposals have been made along these lines, but I think we should have no illusions and that we must be aware of the objective limitations and difficulties of this approach. Above all, however, one must not forget that the real reason for the EPAs’ existence is not the WTO but the urgent need, amply demonstrated and confirmed in the Cotonou Agreement, to make better use of trade as a driving force for economic growth in the ACP countries, as it has been for so many other countries, including developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion the success of the Economic Partnership Agreements will depend on three key factors, all of equal importance. Firstly, negotiations genuinely targeting the development of our partners, which is, as I have said, our only strategic objective. Secondly, the commitment of our ACP partners to establishing a statutory framework that favours investment. Thirdly, the support that the European Union, but also its Member States and other sponsors, will be able to offer to the countries concerned in order to prepare for, and bring about, the implementation of the EPAs. I understand the attention that our partners and Parliament are giving to this last point. From my very first day at the Commission, I promised to ensure that the necessary answers would be found.</p>
<p class="contents">We have succeeded – in obtaining the commitment of Member States to progressively doubling their aid for development, and I thank Parliament for its support without which this would not have been possible. May I remind you that that will represent an increase of more than EUR 20 billion per year from 2010? We have succeeded in reaching an agreement on strengthening the cooperation between the Commission and the Member States within the framework of the European consensus adopted in December and confirming the priority to be given to the effectiveness of aid. We decided to focus first on Africa and we developed a coherent strategy for Africa. A trust fund for infrastructures, including those that facilitate trade, is already in place. In the context of the programme for the tenth European Development Fund (EDF), we are deciding with our partners on the best means of supporting regional economic integration, for which our partners have themselves drawn up agendas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Economic Partnership Agreements are part of this action and represent an important part of it. From this point of view, the timescale is essential. For example, loss of tax revenues resulting from the dismantling of customs tariffs will arise once the EPAs have come into force. This will be offset partly by the expected economic growth and partly by the rationalisation of taxation systems, which has already been initiated in several countries, often with our support. Furthermore, in order to make the transition easier, macroeconomic support measures are already envisaged for certain regions. I can tell you that I am actively working on devising measures to support the Economic Partnership Agreements, particularly in terms of the consequences there could be, initially, in terms of the resources necessary for the operation of the sovereign State. </p>
<p class="contents">I know that there are some who would be in favour of a debate on the possible alternatives to the EPAs. Personally, I do not think that an academic debate of this kind would be useful. Firstly, an in-depth debate already took place when it was agreed, at Cotonou, that EPAs would offer the greatest benefits in terms of development, of market access compatible with the WTO and of support for good governance and regional integration. Secondly, all the ACP countries are continuing to negotiate EPAs. Finally, countries benefit from the effects of having access to markets forming part of the system of generalised preferences and of the ‘everything but arms’ initiative. We know, in the meantime, after virtually half a century of unilateral preference under the Lomé Convention and the Cotonou Agreement, that this preferential access to our market is not in itself enough to meet the needs of our partners.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the report conveys our common position on a wide range of subjects. In order to set so many countries on the road to development and growth, I am ready to continue working with you on the objectives and challenges that we and our partners face in this complex, ambitious and vital project constituted by the EPAs.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, I have a seminar on East Africa. You know that I am doing the rounds of all the regional organisations and that, on each visit, I hear anxieties expressed by all those involved in development. You have conveyed these anxieties perfectly and, believe me, I am acutely aware of them. I am acutely aware of the very real questions that you are raising and I can tell you openly that investigations and discussions are making good progress, and creative thinking too, in order to develop a range of ways to give better support to the partner countries and to respond more directly to their concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, then, I thank you. I completely agree with the essential features of this excellent report and I remain more than ever open to the idea of a debate with you, particularly about the best ways to give support to this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The present arrangements are, however, no longer consonant with the rules agreed within the WTO, in that the special treatment enjoyed by the ACP countries in comparison with other developing countries contravenes WTO rules and must therefore be brought into line with them.</p>
<p class="contents">The present system may continue to apply until 2008, and must have been adapted by then at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">There are those in the House who reject EPA’s from the outset; they do not believe that a certain measure of trade liberalisation, in whatever form, can make any contribution to the development of poor countries.</p>
<p class="contents">My group, though, is convinced that trade can indeed play a part, certainly that the liberalisation of trade among the ACP countries can do so. We have no objection in principle to EPAs, provided that they are arrived at on the basis of sound agreements, providing for such things as adequate time for the countries in question to adapt to the new circumstances, and support for them in doing so. It is important that EPAs should make provision for that.</p>
<p class="contents">So, as far as we are concerned, let there be EPAs, if they stand a chance of helping to fight poverty. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wants them to retain the development goal as a top priority, which means that liberalisation must only be gradual, for the benefit of the ACP countries and adapted to their specific and varied circumstances, with important basic services such as water, education, transport and energy remaining available to all. The PPE wants a realistic timetable, in other words enough time for necessary changes to be made. The PPE-DE Group wants sufficient support measures (for example technical assistance, capacity-building and reforms in such areas as customs and taxation) and it wants to see cooperation on a regional basis promoted between the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There are four areas about which the PPE-DE Group has concerns, and they are as follows.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the limited supply of information from the Commission on the course of the negotiations. Then there is the pressure of time under which these are now being conducted and under which they will also have to be implemented. The negotiations have been in progress since 2002 and still no draft texts have been made available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there are the financial aspects. The EPAs’ success will depend on a decent sum of money being made available. In the first place, this will have to come from the European Development Fund and then from other sources as well. It is not yet sufficiently clear where the money will come from then. There are emergency rules that make provision for this, and they are necessary. If the system appears not to be working in some places, the process must be capable of being slowed down or stopped for a period of time. Scope for that already exists under current WTO rules. We have as yet no specific proposals to make about this. The Commissioner has already gone some way deeper into this issue, and I look forward with pleasure to closer cooperation and more detailed information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to begin by referring to his remark that talking about alternatives to economic partnership agreements is ‘academic’ – that was the word he used. It is very clearly stated in the Cotonou Agreement that alternatives are part of what the ACP countries have an option on deciding to follow. Therefore, Commissioner, it is not an academic issue, but something that is very definitely an option for the ACP.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic partnership agreements are very complex and complicated for the ACP and are the most complex and complicated negotiations they have ever engaged in. I suspect that they also present the Commission with certain difficulties, if not only because of the tensions which naturally exist between DG Development’s concerns and priorities and DG Trade’s concerns and priorities, which are very different. We know from our own experience in this Parliament that there is not always that necessary coherence between our objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">My impression is that there are concerns that are common to all the regional negotiations and I am following them very closely. There are examples of the Commission wanting a framework that facilitates trade as a first priority. The ACP regions are far more interested in addressing supply side constraints and the link between EPAs and development support. Market access remains absolutely central as an issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed opening of the economies of the ACP countries – most of which are least-developed countries – is a major concern. The benefits of regional integration, market access and integrated trade and development, as my colleague Mrs Martens said, are absolutely clear. However, what we understand in the Committee on Development is that any potential benefits could be outweighed by the potential costs which they might be expected to pay. Therefore, the agreements they might have to make on market access – market opening – may not be exactly what they need and perhaps they could get more from other kinds of arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">To be competitive and to market their goods, there needs to be substantial investment in their ability to do so. ACP countries need training and their workforce needs to be improved; they need improved infrastructure, transport and institutional capacity-building. All these are major priorities for the ACP.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be said that it is not for the Commission to tell the ACP what a good EPA is. It is up to the ACP – in consultation with their parliaments, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and civil society – to make that kind of decision. Any criteria we make on economic partnership agreements must be based on their relationship with the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask the Commissioner one question. The central Africa negotiations are portrayed as a model of these regional negotiations. My sources tell me that DG Development at its highest level – that probably means you, Commissioner – is very worried about the capacity of the secretariat of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community in their negotiations. Is it the case that you, Commissioner, have publicly called for the executive secretary and chief EPA negotiator in CAEMC to be dismissed? If that is the case, then how does this sit with DG Trade’s description of this as being the absolute role model?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to draw attention to the Cape Town Declaration of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2002. Benchmarks were put in place there to assess the conduct and outcome of the negotiations on the basis of key social and environmental indicators, including decent work, health, education and gender. The potential for this was confirmed last year by the ACP Council. Will the Commissioner act upon these proposals? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As Commissioner Michel and Commissioner Mandelson have stated, economic partnership agreements must be development-friendly. That means that liberalisation must, of necessity, be asymmetrical. There can be no question of forcing ACP countries to open up their markets to European goods until their own domestic markets are much more firmly established. From the European side, we can offer aid for trade measures to help with this market-building and with supply-side constraints.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the amendments tabled for Plenary, the ALDE Group will be supporting those which underline that the pace of market opening should be driven by the ACP and that there is scope for the EU to work much more closely with ACP partners in world trade negotiations. Together, the ACP countries and the EU form a substantial block.</p>
<p class="contents">The ALDE Group will also be supporting those amendments from the PPE-DE Group which offer improved wording and avoid overly restrictive definitions of, for instance, decent working benchmarks.</p>
<p class="contents">Some NGOs have campaigned on a simple platform of ‘no’ to EPAs, but that could be throwing the baby out with the bathwater. The regional integration which is part of the EPA process will help ACP countries to prosper, to increase South-South trade and the removal of tariff barriers between neighbouring ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The essential point at every stage of the EPA negotiating process is to ensure that the outcome works in favour of development. I hope the Commission will at all times be genuinely and consistently guided by that principle and by this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That objective must under no circumstances go by the board. The <span class="italic">quid pro quo </span>mentality or idea of reciprocity, based on a principle of equality, is therefore quite wrong. The fact is, we are concerned here with two quite unequal partners, the EU and the ACP countries, so it is not the ACP countries that should be helping the EU countries, but the other way around. That is something I am absolutely certain Mrs Morgantini agrees with me about.</p>
<p class="contents">Poor countries’ only export opportunities are in the fields of agriculture and raw materials and in relation to very labour-intensive products, such as textiles, which they should be allowed to export to ourselves in the EU without restriction. The ACP countries also have extremely weak economies. We cannot therefore demand that these countries just go ahead and open up 90% of their markets in return for the EU opening up its own markets as a kind of payment. That is a view also expressed in Mrs Morgantini’s report. I hope, then, that I am right in interpreting paragraph 17 of the report as saying that it is of course only the ACP countries that are entitled to introduce temporary import restrictions in relation to industries threatened by surges in imports. It would be very unfortunate if we were entitled to prevent the ACP countries from selling us textiles and agricultural products just because we had not been skilful enough to adapt to the changed conditions of competition in a globalised world. The fact is that we too were allowed to protect our own markets when our economies were still developing. That being said, protecting markets is a very uncertain way of achieving growth and a healthy economy, and it should therefore be a limited, including time-limited, measure for developing countries too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mrs Morgantini’s excellent report has now provided us with an assessment of the contribution economic partnership agreements can make to actually achieving this task. We expect the Commission to give clear priority to development and the elimination of poverty in the ACP countries in the negotiations. The criticism that I am about to make is clearly aimed at the appearance of a representative of DG Trade at a hearing of the Committee on Development. Let me be quite clear about this: we do not want negotiations that reflect the style and behaviour of a colonial power; we believe that the decision-making sovereignty of our partners in the ACP countries must be preserved.</p>
<p class="contents">This sovereignty should be encouraged by investment in trade infrastructure, and, of course, by means of support for national strategies to combat poverty, which is fully in line with the principle of subsidiarity so prized in the EU. If governments exercise their sovereignty by deciding to view the economic partnership agreements with scepticism, then there have to be alternatives such as those offered by the Cotonou Agreement. That is why I wonder why the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wishes to delete that reference. Why does the PPE-DE Group suddenly no longer feel bound by agreements? The PPE-DE Group is also seeking to delete virtually every sentence from the report that gives the ACP governments negotiating sovereignty and their own political room for manoeuvre as to whether liberalisation should be implemented in a given sector, to what extent and in what time frame. Why, I would like to know?</p>
<p class="contents">The Morgantini report calls for basic provision with drinking water, education and other key public services to be excluded from liberalisation from the outset. The PPE-DE Group wishes this to be deleted, and instead calls for the liberalisation of the water sector to be based on affordable prices. I regard that as pure cynicism. Given the widespread poverty in many parts of the ACP countries, that is simply not acceptable. I urge you to reject these amendments tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In a society that is now dominated by a globalised economic market, the Community institutions have a duty to encourage development cooperation, in a world in which three billion human beings live on less than two dollars a day and over a billion survive on one dollar.</p>
<p class="contents">For this shared aim, we must search for suitable means which can lead both to an improvement in the economic situation of developing countries and to gradual and increasing integration into the world market. The European Union’s cooperation policies must contain priorities designed to change the internal processes in those countries, promoting a stable, open and democratic political climate as well as an increase in prosperity<span class="italic">. </span>Within this context it can be said that the economic partnership agreements represent a suitable tool to boost and implement trade relations between the ACP and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also emphasise another point: development investment in the so-called ‘sensitive’ sectors such as education, health and energy should be constantly monitored, and where necessary restrictions should be imposed on economic liberalisation. We ought always to remember that in order to be successful and have a positive impact on the social fabric of developing countries, effective integration and economic growth must necessarily be accompanied by an improvement in people’s general living conditions.

This approach strengthens the report before us and supports its objectives to make Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) a workable means of implementing the EU’s targets for development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">WTO rules force us into separate Economic Partnership Agreements, because the trade relationship based on the Lomé Conventions and Cotonou Agreement is non-reciprocal and therefore inconsistent with the WTO’s enabling clause. Under this clause, industrial countries are permitted to give unilateral and non-reciprocal preferential treatment to just two categories of countries: either all Least Developed Countries or all developing countries. Since the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) regions include countries from both groups, the original preferences granted to the ACP countries are incompatible with current WTO rules, and our transition period giving entitlement to waivers expires in 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to make the EU-ACP trade relationship WTO-compliant in the long term, a solution has been sought in the EPAs. Under the proposed EPAs, the trade relationship between the EU and the different ACP regional groups will be reciprocal. Under Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), countries at different levels of development can enter into a reciprocal free trade agreement provided that the liberalisation of essentially all trade occurs within a reasonable length of time. In the context of the EPAs, this has come to be understood as roughly 90% of trade within 10-12 years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that implementing a reciprocal free trade agreement will be a major challenge for the ACP countries, whose level of development varies a good deal. Reciprocity represents a major shift in the EU’s approach to development and trade policies with ACP partners.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we know that the support allowed by Lomé and Cotonou did not halt the decline in ACP market share. Since we are worried about premature liberalisation, we need to ask whether in this context there is such a thing as timely liberalisation. Sometimes bold steps have to be taken, which means we must at the same time make sure that the eventual outcome of negotiations on agreements leaves sufficient time for ACP domestic and regional markets to adapt.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself also think that it is important to allow everyone unobstructed access to nature’s own ‘free’ services. Therefore, on World Water Day, I feel it is necessary to mention how essential it is, for example, that water resources are managed fairly.</p>
<p class="contents">The opening up of markets in some cases has also led to the spread of poverty in developing countries, and for that reason the progress of talks should be monitored carefully.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kader Arif (PSE). – </span></span>  <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank my fellow Member, Mrs Morgantini, for the excellent report that she has submitted to us today concerning the impact of Economic Partnership Agreements on development.</p>
<p class="contents">The general philosophy of this text is right. It advocates the necessity for Community solidarity in the face of regulation that carries the risk of uncontrolled liberalisation. This work was welcomed unanimously within the Committee on Development. It is my wish and hope that it will receive the same support in tomorrow’s vote.</p>
<p class="contents">One essential principle must guide our thinking: development in accordance with, and closely linked to, the Cotonou Agreement. It is a prime objective in all the negotiations and within the framework of the implementation of EPAs with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand the need to bring trade relations between the European Union and the ACP countries into line with the WTO rules; I am talking about unilateral preferential access between Community markets. Nonetheless, compatibility with the WTO rules must not take precedence over our international commitments to promoting sustainable development and eradicating poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the fears of our ACP partners and of many NGOs with regard to the way in which negotiations are now conducted by the Commission and with regard to the logic underlying these negotiations. There is, indeed, a glaring asymmetry between the two parties. If we do not attend to this, the swift and harmonious reciprocal opening of markets that is being sold to us will be fatally unbalanced and, I fear, will lead only to disillusionment.</p>
<p class="contents">This liberalisation of trade between unequal partners, far from promoting development as intended, runs the risk of having devastating effects on the fragile economies of the countries concerned and on their vulnerable populations. And this at the very moment when, in our speeches, we are claiming to want to help these countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals which, as we already know, are out of reach.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that if these agreements are conceived gradually and in a concerted manner, within a rational and predictable framework, in order to promote trade and investment in this area, they will represent a real opportunity for the ACP countries, an opportunity both in terms of economic diversification and harmonious regional integration and in terms of real and successful integration within the world economy.</p>
<p class="contents">A few priorities must be stated. The first of these is the exclusion of the Singapore issues and of essential public services, without neglecting the principle of the right of these countries to use safeguards to defend their sensitive strategic sectors. The second priority is to respect our commitment to seek out alternative trade systems to EPAs for those countries that request it, as is stipulated in Article 37.6 of the Cotonou Agreement. These alternatives must be based on the principle of non-reciprocity established in the generalised system of preferences (GSP) as well as on the introduction of a clause establishing special, differentiated treatment at the WTO. These priorities depend very much on the willingness of the European Union to give its full weight within the WTO to facilitating improvement in the rules in terms of development priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, stating a wish is no use without the means to achieve it. I should like to conclude by saying that, beyond the concern about the European Union’s financial perspectives, we must, on the one hand, keep the promises made by the President of the Commission at Gleneagles concerning aid for trade. On the other hand, we must envisage new financial commitments to compensate for the cost, to the ACP countries, of the removal of preferences and customs tariffs, strengthen technical support to ACP countries and, finally, ladies and gentlemen, reject the unacceptable reduction in the European Development Fund. Since, however, I am not convinced that these aims will be achieved quickly, I suggest that, where the reciprocal opening of markets is concerned, the Commission consider, as a token of its goodwill, prolonging the period of transition according to the specific needs of the ACP countries, as defined at the time of the negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I warmly welcomed the speeches on this subject this evening, and that of Eija-Riitta Korhola in particular was excellent. In terms of quality, I cannot add anything, but nevertheless I would like to say a few words about Luisa Morgantini’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of development cooperation must not be underestimated. As welfare societies and European communities, we want to help fellow human beings who are worse off than ourselves, both in our own countries and elsewhere. In a way, this is a measure of how civilised we are.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that today, in many Member States of the European Union, there is some debate about what proportion of financing should be channelled into development cooperation. For example, in Finland, where I come from, this issue has just been discussed, and I know that the 0.7% target recommended by the UN has not been achieved: we have kept at around the 0.4% mark. It is also to be hoped that the other European countries, Finland included, will make progress in this matter. Hopefully, we in the European Union will establish a common will, as well as the funding, to attend to the needs of our brothers and of nations worse off than us.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, however, we should ensure that the aid we give is in harmony with the principles of sustainable development. Economic, social and environmental factors must always be taken into account in EU development cooperation. It is not merely money that is important, but, above all, partnership, aiding development and helping countries to get off to a good start.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also be careful to promote European values such as democracy and human rights through development cooperation. It is important to take these into account in development cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Do you really believe that a free trade agreement is what is needed to reduce and eliminate hunger and poverty?</p>
<p class="contents">Consider Burundi: the theoretical abolition of tariffs, as envisaged by the EPAs, would result in a gain for the European Union of a trade share equal to USD 12.4 million, which Burundi would lose, and that is after having calculated the gain to local consumers. This fact emerges from a study by the Economic Commission for Africa, a UN organisation, which also showed how that continent already has a rather high proportion of wealth owned by foreign residents, higher than any other region in the world: 39%.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea that a further expansion of free-market ideas can produce wealth in these areas is also refuted by the data on subsidies. In Nigeria the cheapest meat is German and English and in Senegal 52 000 tonnes of onions exported in 2005 alone from the Netherlands placed farmers in very serious difficulties. The EPAs were originally conceived within the framework of the Cotonou agreement, which enshrines the fight against poverty and the struggle for social development, but they have instead become something which promotes not social development but rather greater poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As regards the apparent lack of information coming from the Commission, the Commission is, of course, willing to provide all the information it has available. Perhaps you feel that there is too little information. I shall see to it, for my own part in any case, that I give you all the information that I have.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the need to have large sums of money available, if extra money is needed, the Member States will have to provide it. You know very well the amounts available from the European Development Fund: I have only the money that is allocated to me.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mrs Kinnock’s speech, I should like there to be no misunderstanding. When I spoke about an ‘academic’ debate on the alternatives, this was not intended to be impertinent. In fact, it is possible to make alternative proposals to those who do not wish to negotiate, but, as matters stand at present, they are, as you well know, Mrs Kinnock, all negotiating. The word was perhaps ill chosen, but starting a debate on the alternatives when they are all already negotiating does not seem very useful to me.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to you that I am fairly broadly in agreement with the other comments you have made. Thus, I agree with your comments concerning access to the market, but you have to admit too that access to the market is not everything. Our experience of 50 years of liberalisation clearly shows that it is not enough and that there is a whole list of other factors to consider. You will find none more convinced than I of the fact that we must focus on the benefits of development. I am, therefore, completely in agreement with this principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding production problems, it is clear that production is one of the areas in which we can most usefully provide support to the countries in question. It is at this level that one can provide the necessary funding for technical or technological upgrading, for technology transfer, for product quality, in short to finance the added value so necessary for access to the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with you in recognising that the European Union must not impose diktats. That would not correspond at all either with my convictions or with the idea I have of development. There is a negotiation and, in a negotiation, each partner puts forward his arguments. There is no diktat in that. I am also in agreement with Mrs Martens when she says that the timescale must be realistic. I completely agree that it is necessary to safeguard access to water, to energy and to a whole range of essential goods. I share your views on this matter completely and I am extremely doubtful about the idea of liberalising these sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Kinnock, on the question of the dismissal of the secretary that I am said to have called for, firstly, I do not have the power to dismiss the secretary concerned and, secondly, I have not called for anyone to be dismissed. What is true – because I am anxious to take full responsibility for what I have done – is that, in answer to an appeal from the secretary of CAEMC, the Central African Economic and Monetary Community, I simply said that I did not agree with granting a request for extra money for someone who has done nothing, and I can vouch for the fact that he has done nothing. I am, moreover, not the only person to complain about the fact. To justify himself, he said that he had no right of injunction in relation to Member States. The work that should have been done was not done. We do not receive the documents in proof that we ask for. There is a problem about transparency in his management. In these circumstances, I feel that it is part of my job to point out some of the basic principles of governance, especially when we are concerned with a request concerning funding from the Commission. I acknowledge, therefore, what I did, but I never called for the dismissal of anybody and, in any case, I do not have the power to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I shall say that the package, in the negotiation, must be comprehensive and coherent. Peter Mandelson negotiates the EPAs, and I have a supporting role. We work in tandem, therefore. My starting point is, of course, development and, more specifically, economic development as the driving force for growth. I would point out, moreover, that countries have agendas for the fight against poverty, which include this aspect. The regions covered by economic integration agendas are asking us to support them, which we are doing. This integration involves an aspect of commercial liberalisation between them; we support this, and the EPAs support this demand for regional integration.</p>
<p class="contents">I can see that some of your fears are justified, but I can assure you, as far as I am concerned at least, that the development aspect will be a priority. It is on this aspect that the negotiations will focus, and the support measures will have to make possible, according to the pace that these countries are capable of maintaining, an upgrading that should give them, in the long run, much easier access not only to regional integrated markets but also to the world market.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I understand all your misgivings and anxieties. I am prepared – and I think that this is really very important – to have an exchange of views with you, including about all the supporting measures. I am looking for all the creativity of which you are capable and I am completely open on these questions, without any preconceptions. In any case, I assure you that I am more than ready to continue to look for the best possible solutions for supporting developing countries within the context of the EPAs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
