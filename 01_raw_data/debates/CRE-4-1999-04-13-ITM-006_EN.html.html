<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ghilardotti </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the information, consultation and participation of workers has been a key subject of debate in Europe ever since the first social action programme was adopted by the Council in 1974. Since then the Commission has launched several initiatives, but these have often met with resistance. In a context of continuous change, the adaptability of employees is of crucial importance and forms an integral part of the employment strategy adopted by the Luxembourg European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost all the EU Member States have a legal framework – be it statutory or contractual – to ensure that employees are informed and consulted. It has to be said, however, that the current state of affairs – with its limitations and flaws – has proved not to give workers sufficient information and opportunities to be consulted on issues that really matter for the decisions of the undertaking. Consequently, the purpose of this initiative is to complete the existing national and Community framework, thereby helping – by improving the legislation – to prepare for change, ensure that restructuring takes place under reasonable circumstances and give employment the priority it now deserves. The proposed framework is therefore aimed at remedying the gaps and countering the shortcomings of the existing national and Community legislation currently in force.</p>
<p class="contents">The objectives are: to ensure the existence of the right to regular information and consultation of employees on economic and strategic developments in the undertaking and on the decisions which affect them; to consolidate the social dialogue and relations of trust within the undertaking in order to assist risk anticipation, develop the flexibility of work organisation within a framework of security, enhance employees' awareness of the need to adapt and encourage them to participate in measures and operations designed to boost their employability; to include the situation and anticipated development of employment within the undertaking among the subjects of information and consultation; to ensure that workers are informed and consulted prior to decisions which are likely to lead to substantial changes in work organisation or in contractual relations; and to ensure the effectiveness of these procedures by introducing specific penalties for those who seriously violate their obligations in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate the Commission on its initiative. There is no doubt that, with a single currency and a large single market, with increasingly interdependent economies and fiscal policies which, albeit belatedly, are starting to be coordinated, social policies are bound to become increasingly supranational in scale, so as to preserve and further promote our social model, which is recognised by a large number of authoritative sources as one of the decisive factors in our competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, this proposal will ensure minimum standards for information and consultation to be applied throughout the Community, by harmonising the fundamental rights of employees and helping to strengthen the European social dimension. It is therefore deplorable that the negotiations between the social partners at European level for an agreement in accordance with Article 4(2) of the Social Protocol have failed, in particular because of one side's total unwillingness to negotiate. The Commission was quite right to fully exercise its right of initiative as sanctioned by the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, through my report, is proposing certain amendments. Here I wish to thank all those colleagues who have tabled amendments, thereby contributing significantly to the committee's work. Our amendments – on which we must hear the views of the Commission and which I hope the Council, in adopting its position, will regard as the European Parliament's firm wishes – are designed in particular to specify the means of implementing and defining information and consultation, especially as regards the point in time when information must be communicated, in other words planning, so as to enable employees to anticipate change, extending the content of information and consultation to other subjects which directly involve the rights of employees and their future; to extend the scope of this directive, proposing that it should include the public sector, and that the Member States should consider the possibility of including SMEs; and to ensure that minimum requirements are laid down at Community level from which it is not possible to derogate except to the benefit of employees.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I am absolutely convinced that if the period of profound change which we are currently experiencing is to have a positive outcome, both in terms of increased competitiveness on the part of undertakings and of greater civil and social harmony, a major readiness for dialogue is required. This proposal, improved and strengthened by the report now under discussion, is an innovative means of promoting social dialogue, by informing and consulting employees, so as to guarantee stability and respect for the laws of the Europe we are striving to build.</p>

This is a plank in the Commission's overall plan, to have information and consultation of workers and should be considered along with the directives on consultation in collective redundancies, consultation in transfer of undertakings, the European Company Statute and the European Works Council directives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Legal Affairs has supported me and we have put forward a number of amendments. There are concerns in some quarters that there is a problem with subsidiarity in this draft proposal but I believe that the reports I have already mentioned show that it is entirely appropriate for the Commission to act in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">More particularly it fills a gap in employment legislation which was vividly exposed by the closure of the Renault plant at Vilvoorde and I congratulate the Commission – I should say acting Commission – for plugging this serious gap. My own country has some misgivings about the need for this legislation, but I would suggest that Her Majesty's Government visit some of the factories in my own constituency. All the factories that I have visited in the last few years in the West Midlands have information boards where they show productivity levels, productivity targets, health and safety information, etc. All sensible employers I know see informing and consulting workers as a top priority for increasing productivity.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Weiler </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I should first like to thank Mrs Ghilardotti for her report, which we support in every respect. I should, however, also like to thank the Commission for presenting a report here which has made it very easy for us to endorse its conclusions on this issue. This directive constitutes a further building block in a social Europe, coming after our adoption of the European works councils and – I hope – shortly before the European Company and worker participation legislation is adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it also constitutes a counterweight to capital in Europe. I believe that this is very important and sensible, particularly at the present time, so that the public realise that Europe does not adopt laws in a vacuum. I agree with Ms Oddy"s assertion that of course this will not lead to national rules being abandoned. Those Member States which believe that employee involvement gives them increased and more extensive consultation rights will obviously keep their own rules. If you take a closer look, however, you will see that in many countries – including Germany – there are sectors in which employees are still unable to participate in decision making. The specific issue which I should like to address here is the size of the company. There is inadequate provision for small and medium‐sized enterprises, including in Germany. That is why we would have preferred the company size threshold to have been set at 20 employees.</p>
<p class="contents">I am mentioning this here quite specifically and hope that the PPE Group can, after all, decide to go along with our proposals. Similarly, I also hope that you, Mr Menrad, and the other members of the PPE Group will vote against excluding certain media companies and charitable organisations from the information and consultation obligations in connection with the provision on the protection of certain interests, and will endorse our proposal. The view expressed by one media company in a letter to us – that the human rights and fundamental rights associated with the freedom of the press will be violated if we do not vote for it – is one which I find absolutely absurd.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, there is a pressing need for there also to be worker involvement in media companies. I do not share Mrs Ghilardotti"s misgivings about UNICE. I think that perhaps it is even a good thing that UNICE declined to negotiate. As a result, we have a reasonable proposal from the Commission which, particularly in terms of sanctions, contains much more far‐reaching measures which we all support and which would certainly not have emerged from a social dialogue. Finally, I should like to express my hope and voice my request that the German Presidency and the Council as a whole should support this important building block in a social Europe as soon as possible.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Menrad </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Commissioner, a central tenet of Christian social doctrine and of the PPE Group"s statement of principles is partnership; that includes participation and joint decision making, as well as informing and consulting employees. It was on this basis that our group made an important contribution here in Parliament in 1994 to the directive on European works councils, which was adopted almost unanimously. Since then, it is true to say that European works councils have been a real success story and that with the agreement of employers, employees and unions they are increasingly widespread. One of the aims of the EWC is to pass on information received from central management to the local employees" representatives in good time – across borders – so that they can do their job. The system only works if national laws give the local employees" representatives adequate rights. Amongst other things, this directive seeks to ensure that this is the case by setting minimum standards – minimum standards for information and consultation, not for participation in decision making.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ghilardotti has produced a good and very thorough report, on which I would congratulate her. In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, she accepted a compromise solution on thresholds of 50 employees. That is acceptable, Mrs Weiler, and it is what the Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee had in mind. We are against total deletion of the provision on the protection of certain interest groups, as the report demands. However, in our amendments we propose a solution along the same lines as the works councils directive, which provides for this protection but severely restricts it. Quite simply, this is also about gaining broader support. It is particularly important – especially for small and medium‐sized companies – for the Member States to provide for waivers if passing on information does considerable damage to the company. A release from these responsibilities must not be arbitrary, however, and that is why objective criteria need to be laid down and provision made if necessary for the granting of official or judicial authorisation. A framework for national rules on information and consultation which is structured in this way and which respects subsidiarity, Mrs Ghilardotti, is something we want to vote for. It is an important step towards building the social dimension and towards creating a proper partnership in the European Union and – you are right – it also has economic advantages. It is precisely at a time of rapid change and in a global economy that a lack of information engenders mistrust and ultimately fear, leading to a breakdown in relations. Information means transparency, which creates trust and avoids losses in European companies due to friction. Employers and employees are equal winners here.</p>

I would remind you of the debates we had here on Vilvoorde and the Renault affair, for example, when we found that our rules on information and codetermination were not strong enough, and certainly not as far as penalties were concerned. This proposal is a major step forward in terms of informing and consulting employees at European level. The majority of my group will be voting for the compromise reached, namely that the legislation should apply to firms employing more than 50 people.</p>
<p class="contents">I must reiterate how important it is to have information and consultation. Many firms which do this well take great care over how they treat their workers. And it makes for a level playing field that consultation and codetermination requirements of this kind should apply Europe‐wide. It is, furthermore, a sign of the times. The rapporteur speaks tellingly in her report of the need to strengthen the social dialogue and promote mutual trust. And I think it can be seen as an example to the rest of the world, because we know that Japan and the USA lag behind us on this.</p>
<p class="contents">From my own experience in the Netherlands, I know that works councils have often acquitted themselves better, when firms close down, than the management which was accountable to investors. I think we need to realise – certainly those who are still reluctant, and I am looking at my colleagues in my own group here – that this is an area which offers great opportunities for modern‐day entrepreneurship. So I think we should wholeheartedly endorse this proposal, together with some of the amendments.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ribeiro </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, this issue of the framework for informing and consulting employees is controversial. It would be even more controversial if participation in the decision‐making process, which this House has already asserted in various resolutions as being the right of employees, were added to information and consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with its well‐established practice, the Commission was in favour of the social partners establishing these rules themselves. However, UNICE, the employers" organisation at Community level, believes this issue falls within the principle of subsidiarity. There were therefore no negotiations because the Commission was forced to present its proposal for a directive outside the social dialogue. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy was charged with drawing up an opinion on this report. This task fell to me and my intention was to help make real progress in the direction previously taken by the European Parliament. Most members of this committee did not believe this to be the way forward and actually adopted UNICE"s position. No opinion was approved and the procedural page of the report states that the committee ‘decided not to deliver an opinion". This is to be regretted because this opinion would have contributed to the resolution which Parliament is going to adopt, whether my formulation was used or another one subject to more general agreement. This is why I congratulate Mrs Ghilardotti on her work and her report. If you will allow me, Mr President, I must say something briefly on another report on this area which came before this House today and which, due to Rule 52, was not debated or voted on. I am referring to the report on the organisation of work which must be regarded as a minor issue as it was rushed through Parliament. How our priorities are distorted! We voted on the monitoring of marine biotoxins and roll‐over stability, which are technical reports whose importance I do not deny, but we passed over the report on ‘modernising the organisation of work – a positive approach to change". Yet there are those who want the information, consultation and participation of employees to come under the principle of subsidiarity. And then we complain about the public"s lack of interest in the European Parliament!</p>

Clarification is needed on what information requirements actually exist. This is provided in the important and very fine piece of work produced by Mrs Ghilardotti. Of course compromises have had to be made. We particularly regret one of them: it is absurd enough as it is to bring company size into play where obligations to provide information are concerned, and then on top of that, 50 is far too high a figure. We have therefore given Parliament another opportunity to go further and have tabled an amendment proposing 20 as the threshold, well aware that actually this figure is absurd as well.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the protection of certain interest groups is concerned, we really have to say once again that this is a problem in any case because, for example, the freedom of the press is not the freedom of the newspaper owner, but the freedom of journalists. In churches too, church members have freedoms and these also need to be protected. But when it comes to information rights, this cannot have anything to do with the protection of certain interest groups. In German law, protection is provided for certain interest groups in joint decision making. There is some confusion here. If UNICE is now complaining that it is being ignored, then it ought to have cooperated constructively!</p>

Allow me nevertheless to make one or two points. I believe in particular that it is only right to try to reconcile this legitimate expectation of information and consultation with the actual requirements of companies, above all small ones. In an economic climate as difficult and unstable as that of Europe at the moment, it would be inadvisable to burden companies with further legal and administrative obligations. I would point out that, at least in Italy's case, it is only large companies which, when experiencing a crisis, quite rightly and properly receive support from the State, whereas small firms, although they too are a precious resource for the Union, do not enjoy any such privilege. All too often, the heads of small firms have to face the uncertainties of the market all alone, shouldering all the risks without any protection or public assistance. I would therefore point out that prior consultation of employees would be meaningful only if it were one aspect of a genuine system of participation. What I mean is that, in a company which practises forms of participation – profit sharing or share ownership – prior consultation on company decisions is conceivable. In this case, there is a give‐and‐take relationship between employer and employees: joint decision making but also joint risk taking; the profits are shared but so are the responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, this proposal for a Council directive, and Mrs Ghilardotti's position in particular, introduces further elements of rigidity which the labour market – above all with regard to small businesses and micro‐firms – can well do without, in my opinion. Such elements of rigidity would certainly not encourage job creation.</p>

However, they are still less than the participation measures recommended some time ago, in particular by the studies of the European Foundation. This body carried out a major survey in 1991 and defined the following three models of participation: participation as a productive force, participation as a democratic force and participation as a set of positive forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Participation is actually the main objective which we must pursue but it is just one point which Mrs Ghilardotti has made more effective, broader and more efficient. I must draw the Commission"s attention to the fact that, in countries such as Italy, Portugal, Spain and Greece, only 5 % of managers allow consultation and information on subjects which are not exclusively related to health and safety in the workplace.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore a long way from the European citizenship and democracy which we want for everyone. Political democracy is currently kept outside the company walls. We must hope that we can successfully implement this Commission initiative and the report which are intended to give people more freedom and make companies more productive while ensuring a greater human quality.</p>

I think that Mrs Ghilardotti has made a good effort in this direction, but I feel that, carried away by her – albeit very good – intentions, she has gone somewhat over the top. I think that if we adopt the report as it is at the moment we may end up achieving the opposite to what we all want, which is the protection of workers. Discouraging enterprises from making investments will, in the end, be detrimental to workers.</p>
<p class="contents">I hold this view because we have different legislative approaches in the various Member States. Whilst in some Member States, such as Germany and Austria, what is being stipulated here is more or less already incorporated into their law, in other Member States a sudden change in legislation and a change of standards may have an adverse effect on the economy and on the labour market. Indeed, a positive step was taken when the original idea to implement the directive in enterprises with 20 workers was abandoned and 50 was introduced as the threshold. Nevertheless, there are still some things in the report I regard as negative and I would like to highlight a few as illustrative examples.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission proposal provides for derogations, for example for certain specific organisations with religious and charitable aims. Amendment No 15 rescinds Article 2(2), which permits such derogations. I feel this is a mistake. These are specific cases and therefore special provisions are required to guarantee information and consultation and the proper functioning of these organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Amendment No 24 (new) provides for final decisions to be postponed to allow consultations to continue so as to avoid adverse consequences for workers. In this way, companies will be unable to take decisions, possibly for long periods of time, and thus their survival may be compromised.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Amendment No 26 offers workers the possibility of requesting the assistance of experts. Experts should not take part in information and consultation meetings, since they may disclose important information to third parties, and the protection provided in Article 5 is inadequate.</p>

The proposal is a blatant example of a lack of respect for the principle of subsidiarity. Firstly, there are no cross‐border aspects to the proposal and, secondly, the matter is already regulated in most Member States, including my own country, Denmark, through cooperation agreements. This question should be regulated nationally and between the social partners. This would take account of both the principle of subsidiarity and the national differences and traditions in Europe. There is therefore no need for more EU rules in this area. It should be up to individual countries to establish national rules or set up agreements, as we have done in my own country.</p>

I should also like to thank the Commission for its proposal. There can be no doubt that this directive is needed, as developments during recent years have shown. I think it is obvious that employees should be regarded as a resource. It is therefore essential that they should have a right to consultation and information. However, I do not think the proposal goes far enough. In my view, 50 employees is far too high a figure – even 20 is too high. I believe that every single employee should have the right to consultation and information.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I shall vote in favour of the proposal, since it establishes minimum rules. Countries which already have better systems – like my own country, Sweden – should be able to retain them. Therefore, all things considered, I regard this proposal as a successful step in a process whereby all employees will have the right to consultation and information in the future.</p>

Many important decisions certainly take a long time, but then are not as good as we social affairs politicians would like them to be. The question of informing, consulting and participating has been under discussion at European level since 1974. All the Commission initiatives were defeated in the Council, because until the Maastricht Treaty came into force, unanimity was necessary for them to be adopted. The framework directive on the working environment was the first to include the field of information and consultation. Then in 1994, it became possible to adopt the EWC. Nevertheless, constant change and increased cross‐border activities mean that there is an urgent need for action to be taken on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of limitations and shortcomings, workers have not been given sufficient information and opportunities to be consulted on issues that really matter for undertakings. Admittedly – and this is true – legislation does exist at national level. Unfortunately, this is increasingly ineffective in cases involving cross‐border activities. That is why a minimum social standard is absolutely essential in this case too. This is nothing more than that. In this way, subsidiarity is fully guaranteed. After lengthy discussions in the committee, we agreed on the threshold of 50 employees. In smaller companies, business developments are clearer and information harder to conceal.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection of certain interest groups has remained an open question. The PPE Group supports it here as it did in the case of the EWC, and we are still hoping for the PSE Group"s agreement. However, we all agree that the minimum requirements must be adhered to, as must be the case for all minimum social standards. The right to have expert support must definitely be guaranteed, in the context of subsidiarity, because without it workers could be taken for a ride. After 25 years, I am looking forward to this directive for the benefit of workers finally being adopted. The idea behind this directive is also that European companies are different from American and Japanese ones, and work best if a consensus is achieved between the companies and their employees by means of information and consultation.</p>

Unfortunately, this point of view has not gained much support in Parliament. In Denmark, both employers and workers believe the proposal could be a time bomb under the special Danish negotiating model whereby information and consultation are regulated in agreements on works councils between the social partners. During the committee procedure, I proposed an amendment which would have allowed Member States to refrain from implementing the directive if the social partners agreed that adequate schemes already existed. Unfortunately, it was not adopted. I would not like Member States which do not have adequate schemes for informing and consulting workers to be able to evade the directive. That is why it is needed. On the contrary, I am in favour of solidarity among workers in the EU, but at the same time I want a Member State such as Denmark – where over a period of more than 100 years the social partners have developed a successful model for information and consultation through collective agreements, in a spirit of cooperation and dialogue – to be allowed to retain such a system. Conversely, we should not prevent others from being raised to the level that we enjoy.</p>

We should demonstrate that we respect the subsidiarity principle. To incorporate the contents into European legislation might run directly counter to our desired objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a directive is at odds with the different traditions that exist in the Member States. It is an old‐fashioned idea that the unions should acquire more influence through the EU. This should be replaced by a modern approach – which obviously means influence and participation on the part of workers – in every organisation that wishes to be competitive and dynamic. The necessary frameworks are best devised within individual workplaces and would only be hindered by the bureaucratic superstructure of a labour market policy, for which some people would now like to use European cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our role in a Europe in which human resources are being misused through high unemployment should be to create the right conditions for new jobs. The introduction of more rules and restrictions would mean fewer new jobs and less growth, development and prosperity. In other words, there would be many fewer workplaces in which there was consultation and information. I should not like to be a party to that, and I am glad that many of those present in the House today have said the same thing.</p>

Today we are dealing once again, perhaps in an almost final version, with this fundamental matter of how to involve the basic elements of companies – in other words those who work in them, those who invest their labour to help them grow and remain competitive on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Many important considerations are set out in the rapporteur's text, for which we thank her. In particular, it is vital to include the public sector, provided of course that the Member States create mechanisms to encourage social dialogue. Clearly, social dialogue is especially desirable for SMEs, which appear to be excluded from this document, although – as we all know – they account for 90 % of companies in the Community. Therefore, in agreement with the Member States – and this is crucial – we must ensure the maximum involvement of employees in small firms, or rather micro‐firms, those with up to ten employees, which currently form a majority in certain economic sectors and offer the greatest potential. The report has of course amended the initial proposal by ruling out a number of derogations on non‐profit‐making companies. We agree on this aspect, as long as it is properly applied within the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, in this age of globalisation, it would be unthinkable not to step up – and indeed to maximise – the involvement of employees in Community undertakings, because obviously business success or failure ultimately depends on them.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Flynn, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Ghilardotti and all the other rapporteurs for their work on this particular Commission proposal. I also wish to thank those Members who have taken the time to make valuable contributions to this debate. I should like to express my personal satisfaction and gratitude for your support for this very important initiative of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, in our view, an important proposal, which, once adopted, could add an indispensable missing element to Community European labour law. Having listened to what has been said here – and I have read the draft opinion – I believe you are willing and ready to play a decisive role in the negotiations leading up to the adoption of this proposed directive. Once adopted, it will complete and make more coherent the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in the field of employee involvement and make a decisive contribution to building the social dimension of the internal market. In a way Ms Oddy is right: it will fill a gap that needs to be filled in European labour law.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it is a controversial proposal, which is illustrated by the reservations which employers and some Member States have expressed. We are aware of the difficulty of the debate and that is another reason why I am particularly pleased with your position of clear support for the initiative, while having to be prudent about the caretaker Commission at the moment and what it can do with this proposal just at this time. So while the Council has not even started discussions on the text, and taking into account the absolute need to preserve the political viability of the proposal – notably within the Council – it is wiser at this time, and particularly at this stage, to act with some caution.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully understand all of your requests at this time. Most, if not all, of the issues they raise were the subject of <span class="italic">intense</span> debate within the Commission in the period leading up to the adoption of the proposal. In the end the Commission reached a delicate balance between the different points of view and divergent interests on what is regarded as a very sensitive issue. It would be inappropriate to depart from this balance at this stage, at least as regards the proposed amendments relating to the four main sensitive issues of the proposal: the thresholds, the definitions of information and consultation, the extent to which the social partners may derogate from the directive's provisions and the question of sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that all your proposals on these central issues are going to be very much at stake in the discussions between the European Parliament and the Council leading up to the adoption of the proposal. The Commission will play the role attributed to it by the Treaty in the course of the codecision procedure while facilitating the approximation of the positions of both parties and, in the end, ensuring consensus. So you will understand my caution when reacting today to some of your amendments, even if some of them could certainly be envisaged by the Commission in the future, in the light of the developments that will take place in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of my caution, I should like to be as positive as possible today. Some proposed amendments can clearly be accepted by the Commission immediately, and they certainly improve the text. This is the case for Amendments Nos 1, 17, 8, 10, the first and the third elements of Amendment No 13, and Nos 19 and 35.</p>
<p class="contents">A second category of amendments concern more substantial issues. Nevertheless, I believe I can express my support for them as they are reasonable and do not seem to affect the delicate balance of the text. This is the case of Amendments Nos 4 and 15, Nos 6 and 32 – they are related to the non‐aggression clause – No 16 on the level of information and consultation, No 22 – the illustrative list of issues subject to information and consultation – and the first part of No 33, concerning the application of the principle of the directive to the public sector, which is referred to, although the proposed formula needs to be reworked somewhat.</p>
<p class="contents">While Amendment No 34 is wholly consistent with our approach of involving the social partners, we could not envisage that change to the basic formula used for the implementation of Community legislation. I could, however, accept a recital based on this amendment. As for the other amendments, in the light of the circumstances I have mentioned, the Commission feels it will be difficult to accept them. In any case, as I have mentioned before, they will be very much present in the future institutional debates on this important proposal and so the debate on these central issues is far from being closed.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say to Mrs Weiler that it really is about minimum standards. It is very important for the European social model. As Mrs Ghilardotti said, in a way, it is all about mutual confidence between employers and employees. I regard this particular proposal as a key piece of European labour law. Even though I shall be watching it from afar, I will be extremely interested in the adoption of this particular piece of European legislation. It will do an amazing amount of good for employers and employees in the development of the European social model. I thank you for your support.</p>
