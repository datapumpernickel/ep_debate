Our thoughts are with the families and friends of the victims and with the Belgian people.</p>
<p class="contents">After that, I will turn to Russia. Mr President, honourable Members, it is a pleasure to be here again today to discuss with you the outcome of the presidential elections in Russia on behalf of High Representative/Vice-President Ashton.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me first of all thank Parliament for the strong voice it has consistently given to European citizens’ concerns about democracy, fair elections and human rights in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia is our largest neighbour; it is an important business partner and a strategic partner on many global and regional issues. So it matters to our citizens what the situation is with regard to human rights and the rule of law in Russia. Parliament followed both the Russian State Duma elections on 4 December and the presidential elections on 4 March very closely. It has adopted several resolutions expressing the expectations of European citizens that Russia will live up to her international commitments to ensure free and fair elections.</p>
<p class="contents">You have also given High Representative/Vice-President Ashton several opportunities to address the plenary on these crucial issues. In addition, several hearings, organised by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Subcommittee on Human Rights, the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee and individual political groups, have taken place since December on these elections and on human rights more generally. Catherine Ashton has asked me to thank Parliament for all this important work. She also asked me, in particular, to convey the message that she shares Parliament’s concerns about the case of the arrest and death in pre-trial detention of lawyer, Sergey Magnitsky.</p>
<p class="contents">Restrictive measures are a sensitive instrument that should be considered in specific situations and in accordance with the respective EU guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The European External Action Service is currently looking into possible ways to convey our expectation that the investigation of this case will be taken forward properly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Russian presidential election went largely as expected. OSCE and Council of Europe observers gave a clear evaluation: opportunities were not equal during the preparations, and procedural violence occurred during the voting and counting process itself. We agree with their preliminary report and will remind Russia of its international commitment to free and fair elections.</p>
<p class="contents">High Representative/Vice-President Catherine Ashton issued a statement the day after the elections with five main elements. She recognised the clear victory of Vladimir Putin, noted international observers’ recognition of the significant civic engagement in these elections, referred to international observers’ findings of irregularities, encouraged Russia to address these shortcomings and looked forward to working with the incoming President and new government on our shared modernisation agenda, which should cover both economic and political reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">The day after the elections, outgoing President Medvedev instructed the Prosecutor General to examine the verdicts handed down to 32 convicts considered by the opposition as political prisoners, including Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his former business partner, Platon Lebedev. The President has also ordered the Justice Ministry to prepare a report on the legal reasons for denying the registration of Mikhail Kasyanov’s, Boris Nemtsov’s and Vladimir Ryzhkov’s People’s Freedom Party. These are encouraging signals.</p>
<p class="contents">The next step: we have a strong consensus in the EU that we must engage with Russia – critically, yes, but also constructively. Without Russia, we cannot solve the regional challenges in our common neighbourhood, in Syria or Iran, or most of the pressing global challenges such as climate change and the environment. This approach has been quite successful recently. With Medvedev and the government led by Mr Putin, we have been able to build more constructive relations and to achieve results. Russian WTO accession is one key result that will bind this large economy into the international rules-based framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The Partnership for Modernisation is another one. Many projects have already been prepared and launched, including technical and regulatory modernisation as well as reforms of the judiciary and civil society involvement. We have also begun a process on common steps to be fulfilled before we could consider launching negotiations on a visa-waiver agreement. All of this will be of mutual benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">The new civic and political awakening in Russia has already led to some political reforms, with the first Duma reading of bills introduced by President Medvedev to liberalise political party registration rules and presidential candidates’ registrations and to reinstall direct elections of regional governors.</p>
<p class="contents">The process is encouraging and will have consequences, especially in Russia’s many regions. Change may be slower than one would hope, but we should have patience. It is a good thing that both authorities and protesters want gradual evolution, not revolution. A cautious but real dialogue has begun between them, and the quality and dynamics of the political situation in Russia have changed.</p>
<p class="contents">The key issue for us now is how we can support this reform process. The bilateral initiatives just mentioned provide us with an excellent basis to build on. As Cathy Ashton has stated, the EU looks forward to working with the incoming Russian President and the new government in full support of our shared modernisation agenda. The next major step in our Strategic Partnership, apart from all the ongoing regular work, will be the next EU-Russia Summit, due to be held in Russia just before the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you and look forward to hearing your views and to your resolution, which will be adopted tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The resolution that Parliament will have to vote on tomorrow addresses the very specific set of circumstances that have followed the presidential elections.</p>
<p class="contents">We are faced with an official Russia which still harks back to the era of the Soviet Union and which feels entitled to veto freedom within the United Nations Security Council. This is a Russia where the President and the Prime Minister shamelessly take turns to be in power. A Russia where elections are not held in compliance with international standards, and a Russia where opposition figures are detained, which takes us back to the recent and far from glorious past.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr President, this is also a Russia which is a member of the Council of Europe and of the World Trade Organisation, which duly collaborates with the OECD and wishes to become one of its members, and a Russia where, as in the Arab Spring countries, there are men and women who are fighting for their freedom and dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I think what is central to this resolution is to work for change and to open a space for dialogue and conversation with the opposition whose rights have been infringed and ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">We should leave until later, until Mr Swoboda’s report, the issue of the institutional framework, the new association agreement between the European Union and Russia, two entities that need to come to an understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I think that from the viewpoint of the European Union – I would like to appeal to the President-in-Office of the Council and to the Commission’s representative – that we should mobilise all our efforts and influence to make what is desirable become possible, so that fundamental freedoms and the rights of all will soon become a reality throughout Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hannes Swoboda, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, in recent times, we have, in fact, seen two elections in Russia that we could not describe as free and fair. Progress has been made compared with previous elections, but this progress is slight and, to a certain extent, it has been eliminated and the situation has deteriorated as a result of the behaviour of some leading officials.</p>
<p class="contents">In both cases, the problem started with the registration of the candidates. Many candidates who would doubtless have been permitted in other countries were not even able to take part in the elections. I believe that there is no justification for this, as the conditions set out for this are designed right from the start to make it impossible for some candidates to stand for election.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have to be critical of the reporting in various sections of the media, which was not at all balanced, in particular, in the electronic media, of course – after all, television is the most important media these days – even though the purely formal election broadcasts were fairly reasonably distributed. However, if Mr Putin took every opportunity to be seen as an animal lover and rescuer of the Siberian tiger, in whatever capacity, that is also clearly an indirect form of election campaigning.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there were also various instances of pressure being applied during voting, with the result that we are, unfortunately, having to give this critical appraisal of the elections. That met with unwillingness, incomprehension and resistance – which is also a sign of the progress of democracy and progress in the development of Russia. After all, whatever criticisms we have, people in Russia nevertheless now have the courage, to a greater extent than ever before, to go out onto the streets and demonstrate. It is then clear that some of our reactions should be rejected and repudiated. Thus, we absolutely must express our criticism if, for example, demonstrators are treated brutally or are imprisoned, at least for a time. These are things that we cannot tolerate. However, I would choose to see it as a positive sign that many demonstrations took place and, in many – although not all – cases, the police acted entirely properly.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, it is not now a matter of arranging one of the umpteenth assessments of the elections; it is a matter of pointing out and emphasising the opportunity that now exists in Russia. I believe that is what matters. The purpose of this resolution is not to be yet another one condemning the elections, although we are obviously also expressing some strong words of criticism regarding a few things. What is important now is to call on all sides finally to adopt a reform package. It is the chance for Mr Medvedev to finally stand up, still in his role as President, and say: I have caused something to happen in this country! After all the hopes that were placed in me and that for years were not fulfilled, I have now shown that something is happening. It is a chance for Mr Putin to begin his new Presidency with a reform programme and to say: yes, I have been much criticised, but now I will demonstrate that I am also capable of taking Russia forward in terms of democracy and modernisation. It is also a chance for the opposition to show that not only can it oppose, but it can also exert an influence. That ought to be the message from this House. We want to join together to support the forces in Russia that want reforms and that want to say that Russia must take a new path into the new millennium that has already begun. Russia must carry out its reforms. It must become more democratic, because one thing has to be clear: modernisation without democracy cannot work, and therefore there needs to be more democracy in Russia along with more modernisation.</p>

I would just like to remind you that this is not about our circumstances and whether or not we recognise something. What is important here is that there is now a chance to further a reform process. If the opposition in Russia says that it now wants to implement reforms, should we then say ‘no, you cannot do that because this is a false system, as these were not proper elections’? Let us not try to be holier than the Pope, but let us try to help the opposition in Russia. Let us help the opposition to do something, and, Mr Migalski, of course we could criticise a great deal more. The question is, however: how can we help the two to come together? After all, the main thing that we are interested in if we want a partner in Russia is that we have a partner that is strong and democratic. That is my goal. It is not about the past; it is about the future, and that is also what the opposition wants.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Stadler, who is new to this House, I would say: we are not talking about Austria today; we are talking about Russia. Perhaps you did not notice that. It is about Europe and Russia – that is the key issue – and next time, I would like us to be able to talk of genuinely free elections. These elections were still not free and fair, but let us help the opposition to find a solution with Mr Medvedev, so that Mr Putin will become a different President because he has different rules. We will not be able to change Mr Putin, but, with our support, the opposition can now change the rules according to which Mr Putin governs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are speaking today about the elections, or so-called elections; the presidential elections in Russia, and I must say that yesterday, the ALDE Group in this Parliament organised a very good, extensive hearing on the results of the presidential elections, We have Ms Garzinova and Mr Kasparov two opposition leaders visiting Strasbourg today; they are also on the balcony here now; they were actually telling their first-hand experience of these elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group Chair, Mr Verhofstadt, also visited Moscow on 5 March right after the elections and he was on the streets. He saw that the military presence was so enormous and the people had not seen such a military presence since 1993. Speaking about these elections and the fraud which has been reported by the OSCE, ODIHR and also the Council of Europe, it is extraordinary: they are even increasing the results from the Soviet times when normally, the polling stations did not have more than 99.9% attendance. Now they were 100% in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the results, the conclusions, are evidence that these elections were not free; these elections were not fair. This is now the question for the international question: what does it really mean? What kind of consequences should we draw from this? Is this President legitimate?

The local election observers were also able to verify that the official final result was not correct. Although Mr Putin’s campaign leaders claimed that this was the cleanest election that Russia has ever experienced, it leads, conversely, to the conclusion that things were not all above board in the previous elections. That goes for the fraudulent Duma elections, in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the restrictive conditions and one-sided advantages, we cannot exclude the fact that Vladimir Putin narrowly won the presidential elections. However, it was an election with no alternatives, a victory without opponents, as Mr Putin’s challengers were not on the ballot slip but on the street protesting against his policies. It was to be expected that, with all his resources and with all the power that he has over the state apparatus and the media, Mr Putin should decide the election in his favour in the first round. That is one way to win elections, but not the country’s confidence for the future. We need to take note of that, but we should hold back on our congratulations as far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The government of Russia has, unfortunately, missed the opportunity to overcome the existing division in society by holding fair elections. However, Russia needs these critical and creative citizens in order to develop. Their exclusion would only lead to further emigration and outflow of capital. Mr Putin has been in power for 12 years. His promise of stability means, in practice, stagnation. He will at best get the publicised military reform under way, entailing armament on a huge scale. The repeatedly promised economic and social modernisation is, to a large extent, yet to be realised. Rather, the most recent defamatory statements suggest that he remains trapped in his outdated world view, his KGB methods and the constraints of an autocratic system. That is why there are great expectations of the opposition. It must now attempt to ensure that the street protests do not become an empty ritual and just a roll-call count. Of course, political change in Russia must be desired and supported by civil society itself, but we, the EU, can assist this process by supporting, on the basis of a new electoral law, the unobstructed approval of parties and a fair and transparent election campaign, the challenge of the protest movement and its main demand for early Duma elections. That should speed up the structuring and setting of objectives called for by the opposition and, ultimately, demonstrate that there is an electable alternative to Vladimir Putin in Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps the simplest solution would be not to adopt any resolution at all, if while we sit here, having been returned in democratic elections held across Europe, we cannot see the difference between elections which are democratic and elections which quite simply do not deserve to be called elections. So perhaps sometimes, we should simply not adopt a resolution, but if we do, we should put it in a single sentence: not everyone who wanted to stand in these elections was able to do so, and these elections have not contributed anything to democracy – they have nothing to do with democracy at all. Today, it is this kind of realism which we need, and not a realism in which we write things that are not true and in which we write these things over and over again and then become the object of ridicule. I say this because we, too, are losing the position we have enjoyed as the European Parliament, and the European Union is not being treated as a serious organisation. So today, I would like us to tell it like it is in Russia, since we have decided to draft this resolution, but if not, then sometimes in life it is better to say nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have to speak to those who are on the streets and say to them that we understand the young generation and its protests. Russia is not any different from any other post-Soviet country. We must tell them very clearly that if force is used, we will take the same action as we have taken in every other case, and the use of force must today be a borderline which we set, here in this House. We have to be certain that on this issue, we are now definitely in agreement – both we, who sit on this side of the House, and those who sit on that side. I am in no doubt that this also includes Mr Swoboda, whom I know and respect. This should be said clearly here, today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Your first motion for a resolution was pleasantly balanced and specifically unemotional with regard to what can be said following the presidential elections. In signing the European Convention on Human Rights, the Russian leadership made a voluntary commitment that it is not fulfilling. These elections, too, were once again not fair or free of fraud. Even a EUR 300 million investment in surveillance technology by the government did not solve a problem that can only be solved at a political level. These are the sober facts that do not leave us, as a partner, indifferent. They also highlight the contradictory nature of a Russian society, which, as everyone can see, is nevertheless changing. This is something we should welcome and support, because emerging democracies thrive on efforts to develop and change, and also on protests. Russia is becoming normal.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore consider a number of the conclusions drawn by some of my colleagues here in Parliament to be politically wrong. There must be no compromises in the text here, either. This House must finally decide what line it wants to take. At the ‘Russia after the Elections’ event yesterday, organised by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I discovered that some Members are of the opinion that Russia is no longer normal. Was it ever normal? They believe it represents a potential danger and that we cannot simply carry on as before, but must now finally take a different course.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to say something about this. Those who want to think in terms of escalation spirals should now explain how far they want to go with this and, moreover, not only in terms of where that leaves our partnership. For all the justified criticism and all of the differences, partnership for me means, above all, a balance in terms of our common interests, and, at least in my mother tongue, partnership and subordination are not synonyms. People who advocate this path are also saying, as far as I can see, that they do not believe in the power of society to change and that they have not taken note of the changes in Russian society, to which, incidentally, the reports of the election observers from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) also refer, as here is where alternatives to the Putin-steered democracy are being sought. All of this must, ultimately, be discussed in political terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The dynamism that some people are currently developing here in this House following the elections is something that I consider to be disconcerting, however. In my view, it cannot be reconciled with the political dignity and self-perception of a House that stands for plurality in Europe if representatives of part of the Russian opposition here in Strasbourg were able, unchallenged, to discredit the alternative presidential candidates by describing them simply as ‘Putin’s pigs’, when these candidates, without rectification of the election fraud, received the vote of more than 25 million citizens in Russia. Despite knowledge to the contrary, these same people have been speaking for weeks in this House, likewise unchallenged, of the possible bloodshed caused by Mr Putin and of potential revolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">All I can say is that it is not the clear majority in this House that is deliberately taking the wrong course in its criticism of the elections in Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Why is that? Does it not concern us? Perhaps both sides are making a mistake and we cannot be efficient when it comes to relations between Europe and Russia. If we really want cooperation with Russia, and I consider that we desperately need that cooperation, we need to carefully design a new approach. The accession of Russia to the World Trade Organisation is a big, new and very good step.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, what the European Union and the European Parliament have been doing is to denounce everything that is happening in Russia. All we do is denounce.

At that time, he had just returned from Moscow and he described how he and President Putin had agreed that ‘these Europeans want to tell us how to govern our countries’.</p>

I also believe, however, that Mr Putin’s new presidential term represents an opportunity now to take a new step towards further democratisation, that there is a chance to review the imprisonment of political prisoners, that the non-registration of opposition parties could be examined and that Mr Putin’s election promise to tackle corruption could become a reality. We ought to give Russia this chance. In general, I believe that we Europeans should not always wag our finger with democratic superiority. There are enough democratic deficiencies in the EU, too.

What really struck me is that one still knows nothing of what really went on in these presidential elections. Yes, on election day itself, everything may have proceeded in a relatively normal fashion, but the way in which the votes were counted the next day and, also, the candidates nominated, as well as the role of the media in the run-up to the elections, was simply unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Russia, a country that is also a member of the Council of Europe, ought not to permit itself to act in that kind of a fashion because it, too, has to keep to the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, there are also some hopeful signs. I have never seen such peaceful opposition, such a peaceful gathering of ordinary civilians, turning out on the streets, protesting and showing that they can no longer take what happens in the Kremlin seriously. What we have to do today is ensure that we bring those people, those peaceful marchers, together with those in the Kremlin or in the Duma who are also willing to carry out reforms; we need to bring them together. That is the text of our resolution. And that is why we all ought to accept Mr Swoboda’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the other aspects of this matter are concerned, in a few months, Mr Swoboda will come up with a new text that we will then be able to refine further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also convinced, however, that our Parliament, our groups, the parties behind these groups and the foundations could, and must, do more to help Russia as good friends and advisors.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Duma elections, there have been numerous demonstrations and the involvement of civil society has increased dramatically. It is not only politicians who have taken to the streets; there are also many citizens, consisting increasingly of middle class, well-educated people and people who have educated themselves further through travel. We need to step up our dialogue and increase our contact with these people and ensure that there is more people-to-people contact, including by dealing swiftly with the outstanding issues relating to visa-free travel.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should step up our parliamentary dialogue now, too. I know that some people think less dialogue is the right response to the elections. I think that is wrong. We need more talks with our colleagues from the State Duma in order to discuss and to persuade and to offer them our experience. In so doing, we should present our views clearly so that our colleagues there can also learn from our experience and avoid the mistakes that we have made, and continue to make. We will best achieve this through clear dialogue and by showing as little as possible of the superior attitude that we sometimes see in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The Partnership for Modernisation is a good instrument for this purpose. We surely all agree that economic and technological modernisation is not sufficient and that without modernisation of the law, politics and society, Russia, and therefore our joint partnership, cannot succeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this House today, no one is in any doubt that the elections in Russia were not true elections – and that the opposition in Russia is being persecuted – not just in terms of the procedure for counting votes itself, although practically every day brings to light new facts about how the counting of votes was not conducted fairly during the recent presidential elections, because democracy is, of course, something more than just the technical process of voting and of counting the votes – it is also all the circumstances: freedom of the media, freedom of political parties and freedom of speech. These things do not exist in Russia, and so even if a technically fair system of voting was guaranteed – going to the ballot box, casting your vote and the fact of counting that vote – even then we would not be able to speak of fair elections in Russia, because nothing else besides the technical act of voting is democratic in Russia. Today, the European Union should be taking a much stronger line because – and I want to say this very clearly – the Russian people deserve freedom, and this is what we wish them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, we are seeing a new middle class who are seeking to inform themselves and who want freedom, democracy and the rule of law in order, by such means, to develop a modern, economically sound, middle class-based state on the basis of the rule of law. I believe that we should support this. These people stand for the future of Russia in the interests of Russia. President Medvedev has now made an offer in a working group with the non-parliamentary opposition parties to make progress in terms of reforms. We intend to watch closely to see whether any steps forward are agreed on and implemented on the initiative of the next President. That is what this resolution is about. We want to see whether promises are kept here and whether words are transformed into action and the path to reform is taken. Allowing these reforms really would give President Putin the opportunity to achieve a fruitful Presidency. If this does not happen, Russia will develop into an authoritarian, dictatorial regime. For that reason, we would like to observe whether the opposition is treated fairly during the period leading up to the inauguration of President Putin.</p>

<p class="contents">With regard to the question put to me by Mr Schulz, I would say that we will see what reforms are implemented there and draw conclusions from that. I believe it is important, first of all, that the conditions are created for the rule of law to be in place, for it to be easier for parties to register, for this registration not to be manipulated by the authorities so that signatures are not recognised, or for fewer signatures to be sufficient for registration. Freedom of the press is necessary in order for opposition parties to have a fair chance of holding their own in an election campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">These are some of the conditions that are necessary for further democratic development to be possible in Russia, and I believe that these will then enable the relevant conclusions to be drawn.

Despite the fact that during the Duma elections in one of Moscow’s districts, I bore witness to electoral fraud, this was also recorded on video by one of the members of the Central Election Commission, and as I returned from Russia, I was not overly depressed. My biggest impression was the huge public interest in the elections in Moscow and St Petersburg and the sincere desire of many people, particularly young people, to prevent any fraud. Undoubtedly, this was mostly demonstrated by those members and observers of the Central Election Commission who supported opposition parties and opposition Presidential candidates. It is therefore very regrettable that more parties and Presidential candidates were artificially prevented from participating in both elections, and that in the media, the government’s party and candidates enjoyed greenhouse conditions, while the opposition had to endure political draughts and cold.</p>
<p class="contents">However, that desire to finally organise honourable and fair elections ran through not thousands, but hundreds of thousands and millions of Russian citizens, as demonstrated by the mass demonstrations in Moscow, St Petersburg and elsewhere. Surveys show that 10 years ago, Russia’s progress down the European road would have been supported by approximately 20% of the country’s population, whereas now such a route would be chosen by 30%, and more than half of Russia’s youth. This tendency allows us to take a more optimistic view of Russia’s future, but it should be remembered that around 40% would like a particular Russian road that may lead even further from democracy and human rights. I therefore very much support those colleagues who are in favour of intensifying dialogue with Russia at all levels and using all European Union opportunities so that we encourage Russia to take the European road. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I hope you will all also allow me to draw attention to the procedure for adopting this resolution, because the way this resolution has been taken through its successive stages has also had the effect of hindering its progress and work to strengthen it. It is a weak resolution and, in my view, Mr McMillan-Scott and other speakers in the House are right when they say that this resolution should be stronger and that it is the European Parliament’s role to make it stronger. Therefore, I have the honour of asking you all at tomorrow’s sitting to support three amendments tabled by the European Conservatives and Reformists Group which strengthen this weak resolution.

That is not the case. Russians know very well who they want to elect and who they do not want to elect, and they wanted stability. That is what I have been told in numerous conversations that I have had with Russian citizens on the streets, unobserved and unimpeded. They want stability, and they never again want a return to the thieving times experienced under the government of Mr Yeltsin.</p>
<p class="contents">I was an election observer myself and I only met a single Member of this House, that being Ms Gardini from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). I visited polling stations in the provinces 1 200 kilometres from Moscow. There were election observers for the candidates in all polling stations, particularly for Gennady Zyuganov, Vladimir Zhirinovsky and Mikhail Prokhorov. Committees were present and there were transparent, sealed ballot boxes. There were webcams in 15% of the polling stations, so that people could watch the elections themselves at home via the Internet. Everything that has been claimed here regarding the presidential elections in Russia is, from my subjective observation, incorrect. I do not wish to say anything about the Duma elections, but I observed the presidential elections for myself and what is being said here is not true.</p>

I would like to say that I asked to speak under the blue-card procedure twice and, unfortunately, Mr President, you did not notice. This was during the speeches made by Mr Mölzer and Mr Fleckenstein, but since I have now been given the opportunity to speak by my political group, I would like to say – and I am speaking now to Mr Fleckenstein – I hope you think that we should be having a dialogue today not just with the Duma, particularly in this situation, where the opposition has been pushed out of the Duma and, in some cases, opposition candidates were prevented from standing in the presidential elections, but that we should also be having a dialogue with political forces in Russia which are outside parliament, which today are either emerging new political parties or non-governmental organisations such as associations and others. In my opinion, we should also be engaging in dialogue with these groups and these candidates.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have a comment about our resolution. In the resolution, we address ourselves to President Medvedev. I think that before we adopt the resolution, we should note that, firstly, during his term of office, President Medvedev has not been the person making the strategic decisions on matters of Russian policy, and secondly, he is already, in fact, the outgoing President today, so we should really be addressing our appeals to President Putin, who is going to take over as President in Russia again soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me say that such a policy shift would be a strategic blunder.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should continue to do what it is doing, only do it better. Our current approach, a strategic but critical engagement with Russia, remains sound and it is working. I agree with Mr Fleckenstein that what is happening in Russia today is a political awakening of the middle class. The ever louder demands for political reform in Russia are a direct consequence of its economic prosperity and openness to the world, but that prosperity and openness is, in a large part, due to the density and volume of the EU-Russia interactions: investments, trade, tourism and all that.</p>
<p class="contents">We need more of that, including visa-free travel in the future. I am not saying that we should not be critical of the Russian Government whenever it disregards human rights or fails to uphold the principles of the rule of law and democracy but, in the end, constructive engagement will do more to advance our values in Russia than tough talk in rigid positions. Therefore, I would say that recent events in Russia and the presidential elections actually present a case for staying the course in terms of our policy. In that framework, I support the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two decades on, the challenge facing Europe is to prove that freedom and democracy are still of the highest value and that there is no political situation pushing them into the background.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the duty of Europe’s leaders to prove this, first of all, to their own electorate, some of whom are recently starting to wonder both secretly and openly whether the era of division lines did not provide them with greater peace of mind. It is the duty of Europe’s leaders to prove this to the reformers of the Arab Spring who have embraced the ideas for change, having believed in the democratic ideals, and not on the basis of a geographical or historical affinity for Europe. They owe it also, now more than ever, to the thousands of democratically minded citizens in Russia who have come out in protest against the gross, large-scale human rights violations, the rigged elections and the acts of repression against the independent media. Their demands are mostly for uncompromising anti-corruption laws.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that what will turn Europe into an actual player in the democratic process in Russia is not the comfortable stance of a distant observer restricted to glib phrases and loads of non-binding recommendations. As Russia’s biggest trade partner, and especially as a major attraction for its assets, Europe has sufficient mechanisms available to guarantee both compliance with fundamental democratic rights and an effective battle against corruption, principles which it should place at the heart of its cooperation with Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rulers in the Kremlin feel that support but they must realise that a lack of democracy breeds corruption and deprives the citizens of their dignity. Events in North Africa and the Middle East are showing that sooner or later, people will rebel against corruption and will come out on the streets to demand to be treated with respect. The same is true of Russia and the democratic reforms are essential in Russia if future turbulence is to be avoided.

In this sense, I would like to point out that the opposition to Mr Putin also has the opportunity to hold street demonstrations.

It has been exciting to listen to the debate, and I will make sure that some of your views are passed on to Baroness Ashton, so that she can be inspired by them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention three points to conclude the debate. Firstly, I believe that everyone in the EU shares the disappointment over what has been referred to as the manipulations leading up to these elections, including in the form of a lack of approval of candidates, a lack of, and unequal, access to the media, and in relation to the instances of fraud that have been found, where the results of the elections themselves were manipulated. The EU has also expressed its criticism of this, and it is important that we continue to express this criticism in order to get Russia to hold considerably freer and fairer elections. Russia has undertaken – in relation to the Council of Europe as well as in relation to recommendations by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) – to hold free and fair elections. I would like to emphasise that if we are to move Russia from where it is now to where we want it to be, it will be by continuing the dialogue. We need more dialogue, not less, in order to enable the Russians to move to where we want them to be with regard to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time – and this has also been discussed in the debate here today – we must appreciate the positive aspects of these elections. Firstly, President Medvedev promised to contact the Russian opposition. We believe that this represents an outstretched hand. We also have more international observers there than we have had before. It was previously extremely difficult to bring in observers – this time we succeeded. This also represents progress. Civic engagement in the elections in a number of areas indicates progress compared to previous elections. The large public demonstrations are probably, in reality, an expression of what we also know from other countries, namely, a vibrant democracy, where people also have the right and the opportunity to demonstrate.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a new situation, and it is one that we must utilise. We must use it to exert pressure for the economic and political modernisation of Russian society. We must use it to gain contact with all parts of Russian society. We must ensure that we instigate and continue to maintain contact with Russia in a large number of areas. Thus, I believe that we will achieve the most by continuing a dialogue because, as some speakers also pointed out today, there are a number of international contexts in which it is absolutely crucial that Russia is involved. One speaker mentioned Syria, but I could also mention Iran. I could mention the whole immense discussion concerning the forthcoming Rio+20 conference. Therefore, we need to bring Russia even closer to steadily increasing democratic rule. We must continue in our efforts to bring this about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although Vladimir Putin was declared the ‘winner’ of elections, which were neither free nor fair, Russia’s young educated urban middle class is no longer willing to exchange economic prosperity for political freedom. They demand political reforms, rule of law and civil liberties. These people are Russia’s future. The European Parliament must support this Russian progressive movement by strongly condemning irregularities and violations in the preparation and conduct of the presidential elections and by demanding and closely observing implementation of political system reforms, announced by the outgoing President. Mr Putin’s authoritarian system took more than a decade to build and will not be dismantled overnight. But, in the end, Europe will see a modern, democratic Russia as its neighbour and trustworthy partner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not understand the attachment of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe to the somewhat wishy-washy wording of the text. And I do not believe that Russian democrats Garry Kasparov and Mikhail Kasyanov, who are presently here in Strasbourg, would be proud and happy that the European Parliament has adopted a toothless text. In my opinion, the chair’s conference decision to permit this resolution to be conceived at this very moment was a mistake. We can, however, perhaps correct this mistake by referring to more independent analyses and by having a candid and dignified dialogue with Russia, and not by attempting to please the highest ranks of the regime in the name of business deals. One such egregious example is the French decision to sell Russia Mistral-class offensive weaponry, which will then proudly sail around near the coastal waters of EU Member States. <span class="italic">Ceterum censeo</span> – the sale of the Mistrals is a fateful error! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a fact that, when there were suspicions of electoral fraud in the presidential elections of 1996, neither the EU nor the US refrained from praising Russian democracy and the election of the candidate who suited them: Boris Yeltsin. The Russian Government has been demonstrating a certain economic and political independence, as well as defending its national resources, particularly in terms of energy, and advocating the role of the state in certain strategic sectors. More recently, Russia’s veto in the UN Security Council of military intervention in Syria meant that the US and the EU saw their expansionist aims blocked. The issue worrying the EU and the US, therefore, is not the defence of democracy, but their desire for Russia to have a government that better serves their interests. We would like the EU to pronounce on other issues too, such as the defence of strikers’ rights, and of social and labour rights, but this is an issue that appears to be of little concern to the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
