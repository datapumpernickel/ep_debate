It will be a very important European Council that should take major audacious decisions that will protect Europe, the euro, the citizens and our economy from the shocks that are around.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say at the outset that the decision of the President of the European Council to delay the meeting by six days is, I think, a good decision that has been welcomed by the Member States, because it will give us more time to prepare a package of decisions that the citizens and the markets are waiting for.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to say that, despite some signals you may have heard about the process of ratification of the EFSF by the Member States, the Polish Presidency wants to express full confidence that we will have ratification completed on time by all the Member States concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The next meeting of the European Council will once again be mainly dedicated to economic issues. As you all know, the economic situation is worsening with a slowing down in growth, and a continued impact of the sovereign debt risks in certain countries. In this difficult context, it is essential to intensify efforts to secure sustainable and job-creating growth, to ensure the sustainability of public finances and restore confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me go through some of the main issues on the European Council agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, economic policy. The European Council will discuss a number of key priorities which should be fast-tracked because of their significant impact on jobs and growth in the short to medium term. It will also call for stronger focus to be given to the growth-enhancing aspects of the European Union’s external policies in order to maximise their contribution to growth in Europe and to shape the conditions to attract more foreign investment.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue that we will discuss is the G20. The European Council will set out the Union’s position for the upcoming summit in Cannes, giving top priority to maintaining financial stability and restoring growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The third item will be climate change, and I am pleased to say that the Environment Council agreed conclusions on Monday that will put the European Union once again in the lead ahead of the climate conference in Durban in December.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding economic policy, in the light of the Commission’s report on the growth-enhancing areas and the political conference that the Presidency and the Commission co-organised on 6 October, the European Council will identify a number of key priorities for internal economic policy that will have a significant impact on jobs and growth in the short to medium term. Economic policy in the European Union cannot be just about fiscal consolidation, discipline and austerity, much as we all need those words. We also need growth to boost the confidence of citizens too in the European project. This is why the Polish Presidency is giving such a high priority to the growth-enhancing measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council will set specific timelines for the implementation of some of those key priorities, namely, the 12 priority proposals foreseen in the Single Market Act on which agreement should be reached by the end of 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">Among those priorities, utmost priority will be given to those which can bring the most benefits for growth and jobs, notably, finalisation of the unitary patent protection system in Europe, modernisation of the Professional Qualifications Directive, promotion of SME access to finance, modernisation and simplification of the legislative framework for EU public procurement, promotion of green development, in particular, through energy efficiency, and the rapid adoption of the standardisation regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, full implementation of the Services Directive will also deliver significant economic gains. Member States will be called to complete the implementation by the end of this year and show that the points of single contact are operational.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, measures to promote a fully integrated digital single market through the facilitation of e-commerce and the cross-border use of online services, including the instrument on European contract law, the so-called ‘Blue Button’.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, reduction of administrative and regulatory burden. As regards the administrative burden, momentum should be maintained in implementing the 2007 action plan in order to meet the objective of a 25% reduction by 2012. The rapid adoption of the simplification proposals pending before the Council and Parliament is essential to being able to meet this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the regulatory burden, further efforts are needed to reduce the overall regulatory burden, in particular, for SMEs, including by proposing concrete working methods within the context of the smart regulation agenda. The European Council looks forward to the Commission’s forthcoming report in order to return to those issues at its December 2011 meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards budgetary and structural reforms, Member States will be called to continue to ensure that the country-specific recommendations are fully reflected in national decisions, particularly as regards those which are of crucial importance for creating jobs and growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding economic governance, the EU now has powerful tools to ensure that the measures required are taken to pull Europe out of the crisis: the Europe 2020 strategy, the European Semester, the Euro Plus Pact, and the package of the six legislative proposals recently agreed on economic governance. And here I want to stress that the so-called six-pack must be rigorously and timely implemented in a most serious fashion by all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the European Council will discuss the external aspects of the Union’s economic policy in conjunction with the preparations for the summits which will be taking place in the autumn as part of the follow-up to its September 2010 conclusions on strategic partnership. The intention is to adopt a thematic approach to this exercise with a focus on efforts to promote Europe’s competitiveness in the world. This covers potential issues such as trade, access to raw materials, investment treaties, public procurement and intellectual property rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Briefly, on the G20: the European Union considers that the G20 should send a strong message of confidence at the Cannes Summit through an ambitious action plan with concrete commitments and measures from all G20 countries to respond to the challenges emanating from the current slowdown and to ensure strong, sustainable and balanced growth, while implementing credible fiscal consolidation. In this context, I just want to recall that the main orientations for the EU position were discussed by the Finance, Agriculture, Employment, Development and General Affairs Councils and they form the basis for the discussion in the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Briefly, the EU position is based on the following EU priorities: restoring growth and tackling global macro-economic imbalances, making tangible progress on implementing the financial market reform agenda, making the international monetary system more resilient, boosting trade as the most effective way to support global growth, enhancing the social dimension of globalisation, ensuring food security and promoting the G20 development agenda and innovative financing, the need for the G20 to further tackle the global climate and energy challenges and continue the fight against corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally on climate change, I just want to say that the European Union will work towards an ambitious and balanced outcome at the Durban conference, building up on what was agreed last year in Cancún. It is urgent to address the issue of the second commitment period on the Kyoto Protocol and agree on a process towards a legally binding framework by a clear timeline, ensuring global participation, including from major economies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I just want to say that the Polish Presidency, together with the President of the European Council and the Commission, stands ready to make sure that this summit will be a success. We are also considering two additional meetings of the Council formations, notably, Ecofin and the General Affairs Council, just before the European Council, before 23 October. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, the European Council of 23 October will be held against a backdrop of urgency over the threat of systemic crisis now unfolding. There are many issues on the European agenda: the Minister of the Polish Presidency mentioned most of them. I will not speak in detail about many of the important challenges, from the conference in Durban to very important external items. I will focus today on the most urgent response to the financial and economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">To break the vicious cycle of uncertainty over sovereign debt sustainability and over growth prospects, we need comprehensive solutions now. In my State of the Union address to this Parliament two weeks ago, I promised responses. Today we are delivering: I can announce that the Commission has just adopted a road map for stability and growth. And we have set out concrete terms and timelines for its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">You are the first to whom I have communicated the main elements of this road map. I am sending the President of Parliament the document that we have just adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last three years, the European Union has come out with specific responses to different aspects of the crisis. Now it is time to bring them all together, to once and for all meet the depth of the crisis with a full, comprehensive, credible response.</p>
<p class="contents">The elements in this road map are interdependent. They must be implemented simultaneously. They must be implemented immediately. This is the only way that the European Union can, convincingly: first, give a decisive clear response to the problems of Greece; second, enhance the euro area’s backstops against the crisis; third, make a coordinated effort to strengthen the banking system, including through recapitalisation; fourth, frontload stability and growth-enhancing policies; and finally, build a more robust and integrated economic governance.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the five points of our road map, the road map I put before this House today, and that I will take to the European Council on 23 October as a coherent and comprehensive plan for Europe that embodies a Community approach.</p>
<p class="contents">This is how.</p>
<p class="contents">First, on Greece, we need a decisive solution. Doubts and uncertainties over Greece’s future jeopardise stability in the entire euro area and beyond. The time has come to definitively remove these doubts. This means three immediate and sustained actions. First, paying the sixth tranche of the loans to Greece. The result of the Troika mission has sent a positive signal in this respect. Second, deciding a sustainable solution for Greece within the euro area. This should be through an effective second adjustment programme, based on adequate financing through public and private sector involvement, backed up with robust implementation and monitoring mechanisms. Third, we also understand that Greece must fully carry out its programme in a timely manner, with continued support from the Commission’s Task Force and maximised disbursement of Structural Funds focused on growth.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is a more general problem in the euro area. Despite the assurance given by Heads of State or Government on 21 July to support countries under programmes, and despite their assurances that private sector involvement would be strictly limited to Greece, contagion risks have not been contained. To decisively put a stop to this threat that is hampering all our efforts, we must strengthen the euro’s firewalls. We must have credible, stronger instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">At the European Council, I will strongly urge the Heads of State or Government of the euro area to complete and complement the measures they agreed on 21 July. This is crucial, to give a much-needed injection of confidence to market participants.</p>
<p class="contents">It means making operational the agreements taken to increase the flexibility and effectiveness of the EFSF and the future ESM, to allow for precautionary programmes based on conditionality, on which the Commission and the ECB should be consulted in advance. Stronger monitoring and surveillance could be included as part of the Stability and Growth Pact. But the EFSF must be more than just a firewall. It should have real firepower. We should maximise its capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">To further consolidate the expression of unity and responsibility inherent in these crisis resolution mechanisms, we must accelerate the adoption and entry into force of the permanent ESM – preferably to mid-2012. We must trust that the European Central Bank will continue to provide the background of financial stability needed for all this to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">The strengthened and more flexible EFSF is in the interest of all euro countries, including, I am sure, the Slovak people. Our common currency plays a crucial role in investment decisions, in growth, in jobs all over Europe. I commend those in Slovakia who have risen above partisan attitudes and voted in favour of what is important for all Slovak citizens, for the euro area and for the European Union as a whole. And I call upon all parties in the Slovak Parliament to rise above the positioning of short-term politics and to seize the next opportunity to ensure a swift adoption of the new agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The third element of the road map is the need for a coordinated approach to strengthen the banking system. Let us be clear – over the last three years, huge efforts have been deployed to this end; billions of euro in aid and guarantees; an overhaul of banking supervision, boosting capital requirements and protecting citizens’ deposits.</p>
<p class="contents">However, all this has not yet been sufficient to lift the weight of uncertainty hanging over the banking system, or to halt the volatility and pressure on European banks. While these doubts persist and spread, sufficient confidence cannot be restored to allow liquidity to flow again and to oil the growth that our economies so badly need. For confidence to return, we need to fix the sovereign debt problem, which can only be done through a coherent package.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore urgently strengthen the banks because, in fact, those two issues – the sovereign contagion and the banks – are now, whether we like it or not, linked. This must be coordinated through the Member States, the European Banking Authority, the ECB and the Commission. The strategy should comprise five key steps. It should include all potentially systemic banks identified by the European Banking Authority across all Member States. It should take account of all sovereign debt exposure in full transparency; it should involve a temporarily higher capital ratio after accounting for exposure. Banks that do not have the required capital should present and then implement plans to have it in place as swiftly as possible and, until they have done so, they should be prevented from paying out dividends and bonuses by the national supervisors.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Banks should use private sources of capital first. If necessary, the national governments should provide support as a next step, as a last resort, drawing on a loan granted from the EFSF. Any public support should be compatible with the State aid rules. The Commission intends to extend the existing State aid framework for bank support beyond the end of 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, details on capital ratios and evaluation methods should be proposed by the EBA with national supervisors, who are best placed to judge on this. At the same time, the ongoing work on a new financial regulation system should be completed as swiftly as possible. To that end, the Commission will present its remaining proposals to implement the full G20 commitments by the end of this year. We also urge rapid adoption of the financial transaction tax I presented to you two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The fourth element is to frontload policies that consolidate stability and boost growth. We all know that most Member States do not have much room for fiscal stimulus. Those who do should use it. However, all Member States have at their disposal the means to implement structural reforms, to focus spending on priority areas, and to remove obstacles to growth.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said to you in my State of the Union address, growth is within our reach if we can break down the barriers that stop money, services and people from flowing through our Union as they should.</p>
<p class="contents">This means firstly: getting more out of what has already been agreed at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">I am talking about implementing, for instance, the Services Directive. I am talking about delivering on the digital agenda. I am talking about maximising our trade agreements. These are measures that we can take today, that do not require significant additional investment or budgetary effort, but which can have an immediate and significant benefit for our companies, for our citizens and for our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">This means secondly: accelerating adoption of what is on the table. There are many proposals on the table that we can fast-track for adoption. I am talking about unitary patent protection. I am talking about the Energy Savings Directive. I am talking about concluding ongoing trade agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">This means thirdly: fast-tracking the most urgent growth boosting proposals. I am talking about the Single Market Act. I am talking about forthcoming proposals to facilitate access to venture capital because, today, there is a lack of venture capital in Europe and this is especially felt by SMEs. I am talking about the Young Opportunities initiative to increase youth employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Where agreement on fast-tracking proves difficult, we should be able to use enhanced cooperation so that those who want to move forward are not held back. Frankly, dear Members of this Parliament, it is time to say that the speed of the European Union should not always be the speed of its slowest member. We need sometimes to use reinforced cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">All this should be done in conjunction with targeted investment at European Union level, such as through the Europe 2020 Agenda, where we propose also our project bond initiative. The Commission will propose it next week, and will maximise the resources of the European Investment Bank so that it can lend to the real economy.</p>
<p class="contents">So, reforms, implementation of everything that we have agreed, as well as trying to fund some of this effort through new sources of investment, using the appropriate instruments we have and some we can create, such as the project bonds.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth and final element of the Commission’s proposed road map is the pursuit of sound economic policies by Member States, especially those in the euro area, reinforced by stronger Community governance.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have the six-pack – and once again I thank you for your support in getting these ambitious proposals approved. We have the European Semester and all that it entails in strengthening governance. But we must go further to match the ambitions of our monetary policy with those of our economic policies. As we have said, we must complete the monetary union with a real economic union. The future of the single currency depends upon it.</p>
<p class="contents">In its road map, the Commission is proposing a much stronger euro area dimension in planning, implementing and assessing national policies. This dimension will be backed up by strict constraints enforceable at euro area level and is based on an enhancement of the Community approach, which will reinforce also Parliament’s role in economic governance. We will further reinforce the role of the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs in full respect of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other actions we can take very quickly without changing the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We must improve working methods and crisis management between the Commission, the European Council and the Euro Group. Proposals to this end will be made soon, in line with the agreements of 21 July, by the President of the European Council, the Commission President and the President of the Euro Group, and the aim is to have a more streamlined process between the euro area summit, the Euro Group and the euro area working group.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we should streamline and reinforce the instruments we have, not only by rapidly implementing the six-pack, but also by strengthening the European Semester by intensifying surveillance and integrating the Euro Plus Pact into the Semester – hence reinforcing the Community method.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also go further than the measures set out in the six-pack, by setting out provisions for strengthening the economic and budgetary surveillance of euro area Member States requesting or receiving financial assistance from the EFSF, the ESM or other institutions. The Commission will make a proposal to the Council and to the Parliament under Article 136.</p>
<p class="contents">We must monitor the national budgetary policies of Member States in excessive deficit procedure or countries under programmes through a Commission-Council procedure which would enable the European Union to intervene.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, in serious cases, a second reading of draft budgets could be requested to suggest amendments in the course of the year and to monitor budgetary execution. The Commission will make a proposal to the Council and Parliament under Article 136 setting out the graduated steps and conditions that should apply in such cases. You see that we are really speaking seriously when we mention the need for more discipline, more integration. It means more euro, more Europe. That I think should be the goal of all of us.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">All this is in addition to the proposals on a more unified external representation for the euro area and options for ‘stability bonds’ that the Commission will bring forward by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point on governance: in the State of the Union address, I said that the Commission would present a single, coherent framework for better economic governance based on the Community method. We are developing that right now.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal will ensure compatibility between the euro area and the Union as a whole. It will be done in a way that aims to integrate the Euro Plus Pact, because coordination and integration must be carried out at a single, Community level. How can we talk about coordination and integration in a disintegrated manner? It is obvious that we need a Community approach to do that. Yes, we need stronger governance. Yes, we need the euro area Heads of Government to meet more frequently. But no, we do not need to create yet more institutions or yet more titles, when we already have the structures in place to do the job.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that we do not create a division between the 17 members of the euro area and the 27 Members of the European Union, most of whom wish to join the euro.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Such a division could deeply harm the European Union as a whole. It could call into question the single market or be an invitation to renationalisation of Community policies. That is why we need to have stronger governance for the countries that are in the euro area, but to have it in full compatibility with the rules and the <span class="italic">acquis</span> for the European Union as a whole. This is why it is essential to keep the Community institutions – Parliament, the Commission – at the very core of the process of coordination and integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of these institutions is also to guarantee this link, to guarantee that no Member State is jeopardised, to guarantee that Europe remains strong and united.</p>
<p class="contents">The solutions to Europe’s crisis are, I believe, known to most of us, but it requires courage and political will to grasp them. To do so is to fully acknowledge our interdependence and to take a bold leap towards further integration. The problem of Europe is not too much integration; it is, in fact, the lack of a European approach.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Such changes to the nature of our Union may need to be enshrined in changes to the Treaty; changes that must keep the Community method at their core.</p>
<p class="contents">But one thing is for sure – as the crisis narrows in on us, I see no other option than to act now. So the fact that we are considering more ambitious changes for the future should not be an excuse not to take the decisions now and this is why we need to act together in a unified and coherent way.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis is not partial. The response cannot be partial. Our responses cannot be piecemeal. That is why this road map is a single, comprehensive approach and all its elements must be implemented in parallel.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the message I intend to take to the European Council on 23 October and for which I would like to have your support, the support for a united and stronger Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again, a resolution will be adopted, tomorrow, by an overwhelming majority of MEPs, calling on the Heads of State or Government to show a sense of responsibility when they meet on 23 October.</p>
<p class="contents">Like most of my colleagues who are present, I sometimes feel as though I am repeating myself and taking part in a discussion between the institutions and our Member States in which everyone is talking at cross purposes. Yes, we agree on the significance of the crisis, on the urgent need to come up with solutions, and on the vital mix of deficit reduction measures and measures to boost growth and employment, but we differ as to the measures that need to be taken and whether those measures should be taken piecemeal or with surgical precision.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Europe must stop debating the ways in which it could possibly take its decisions and whether or not it should embark upon yet another reform of the Treaties. Europe must stop analysing, weighing things up and, above all, hesitating. Europe must act; Europe must put a stop to the debate about solidarity with Greece. Of course it must show solidarity, and the decision taken by the Troika yesterday was just as responsible as the political point-scoring episode in the Slovak Parliament was irresponsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must stop questioning whether or not we should cut our public deficits. Of course we should tackle public deficits at national and regional level! It is just a question of knowing how to do so and of making sure that any action we take is completely fair from a fiscal and social point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso, I am not going to read the text that I prepared for the Commission. I am simply going to congratulate you and tell you that I agree with what you have said today and that I am behind it. The only thing I would add is that I wish you luck in getting it past the Council, and you will have the support of our political group. Go for it, do not be afraid. Measures need to be taken before Christmas. Thank you very much, then, for this presentation that you have delivered to us today.</p>
<p class="contents">When I talk about Europe, I am not just talking about Brussels and Strasbourg. I am also talking about Bratislava, London, and all the European capitals. They must understand that real sovereignty is not just the gilded treasures found in republican or royal palaces. Real sovereignty, ladies and gentlemen, is the ability to give our fellow citizens the life they deserve, the standard of living they work for, and freedom. We will not achieve that by withdrawing behind our national borders, closing the Schengen borders again or bringing back protectionism.</p>
<p class="contents">Growth and jobs – although I know that the anti-Europeans do not agree, and I love the fact that they are grumbling, because it means that we are on the right track <span class="italic">(Applause)</span>. Mr Farage, you gave a good example of this at the last Conference of Presidents, and I hope that it will be the same today – growth and jobs, President-in-Office of the Council, will only materialise again in Europe if, as from 23 October, our Member States play the game, the European game, the solidarity game, the game of ‘all for one and one for all’ fully, unconditionally and quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say it again, for the third time in my speeches: we need to bring into line tax rates, retirement age and weekly working time, to mention just a few examples. My group has not given me enough time to list everything that is impossible in Europe. However, you know that the word ‘impossible’ is not in the French vocabulary. Therefore, anything is possible, and that is also my party’s slogan. Europe must act, and I am convinced that it will succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso, we need a response for our fellow citizens. What kinds of questions are we having to answer today in our campaigns? When I listen to people who have worked hard all their lives, who have a savings book, I find that the question they ask is: ‘Are our savings and what we have struggled to acquire throughout our life protected by Europe and the euro?’ Yes, they are protected! Yes! Therefore, that is the response we must give them; that is the guarantee we must confirm to them.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a duty, at Heads of State or Government level and in the European institutions, to give them that initial response. As far as everything else is concerned, you are right; we do have the tools, we do have the political means. If we implement them, we will overcome the crisis. Moreover, I should like to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that European countries are not the only ones that are contacting our offices today. We are also being contacted by those who are already worried about whether we are going to succeed and whether the euro, at EUR 1.10 perhaps, is going to revive the European economy in relation to that of other continents, which are beginning to ask themselves questions. As you have said, then, let us take action together, ladies and gentlemen; let us not play cat and mouse, but let us be bold. I am convinced that we are now going to pave the way for our exit from the crisis, for Europe’s exit from the crisis, so that we can restore it to its place in the world in which we want to live.</p>

I can only say that what Mr Barroso has proposed and presented to us – repeatedly – reflects the will of the overwhelming majority of this House. In other words, the Community institutions are moving closer together. That certainly cannot be said of the other side – the side of the government institutions, that is to say, the Council and the European Council, because it is not the case, Mr Daul, that we need solutions by Christmas; we need solutions now. The situation in the European Union is namely so dramatic that we need to do two things at the same time: we need to keep in view the stability of the economic situation in the States of the European Union that are at risk and in those that are still stable, and we must also understand that the Treaty of Lisbon cannot be the end of the road of European integration, but that it is an intermediate step and that we need further communitisation of policy areas, because otherwise we will create another serious democratic deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is absolutely clear that if we leave the decisions on our currency, economic and financial policy, budget policy and fiscal policy in general exclusively to this permanent Vienna Congress, which in this case calls itself the European Council, where those holding power in Europe will travel to Brussels and meet behind closed doors only to then tell the astonished population what they have once again failed to achieve – that cannot be an efficient way for Europe to operate and for it to gain the confidence of the markets and the citizens. This dismembered Europe, where each Head of State or Government is maintaining the tactical equivocations of its national parliamentarians, this Europe will not strengthen the euro. Therefore, we need communitisation. When you cite Article 136 here with the Commission and the Council, Mr President, we as Parliament always want to be involved in future. Whatever executive action is to be carried out in Europe, Parliament wants to be involved. For this reason alone, we need to amend the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">‘The people are losing faith in their governments’ – that is the headline in the <span class="italic">Handelsblatt</span> today. The governments are confusing the people. It was your fellow party member, Jean-Claude Juncker, who said that, and he is right. Every day there is another idea, but no solutions. Now we have to recapitalise the banks. We also had to recapitalise the banks three years ago. We said then: ‘but in a controlled way and with unbundling’ – as is now the case with regard to Dexia – investment banking and traditional banking must be unbundled. Nothing has happened in three years! We debated the issue of capital reserves on risk capital balance sheets – nothing has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in a situation where we have to recapitalise the banks once again three years after the most severe banking crisis, without the necessary regulations having been established in the meantime. This is a situation in which the people really are losing faith, because Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Dowgielewicz, ladies and gentlemen, one thing is absolutely clear: banks are too big to allow them to fail, and individual States are not important enough to save them! That is the reality of the European Union. Ordinary citizens and their state are unimportant; corporate enterprises are everything!</p>
<p class="contents">I will quote you the words of one expert: ‘The reason why people are losing faith in their governments is that they take money from taxpayers and give it to the banks, and the shareholders profit from it. If taxpayers are the ones paying, then they are also shareholders, if you please! The banks have to give a proportion of their profits to the national budget. That is my old fashioned view of the matter’. – said Jean-Claude Juncker, Prime Minister of Luxembourg. The President of the Commission says: ‘We need the financial transaction tax’. Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy are not managing to bring that about. Therefore, we cannot wait until Christmas; we must act now.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore want to make it very clear: we hope that, on 23 October in the Council, you will also show the courage that you have now shown twice before this House, and then I would have liked you to come back and give us a report. However, I have heard that you will be in China at the EU-China Summit and so cannot come. Mr Van Rompuy will also fly out there with you and so cannot come either. I assume that Mr Tusk will not be able to come either. I do not know what all three of you will tell the Chinese, perhaps it is always the same thing – everything has already been said, just not by everyone. Perhaps you can tell Mr Van Rompuy that he can come, because it should suffice for Mr Tusk and Mr Barroso to be there.</p>
<p class="contents">It would therefore be important, after such an important summit, for the President of the Council to make a statement before the European Parliament so that we will at least know whether the Heads of State or Government are doing their job. We are doing ours, you are doing yours – the Council must now do its job.</p>

Yet why not? It is the presence of a coalition partner that explains such a huge change. They are asking for an economic and fiscal union, Mr Swoboda: that is the big change.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as has been said, the British Government is asking to have a more integrated Europe – and that seems to be what they are asking for – then it is in their interests too. Let us recognise that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, we now have certainty that you will put a global plan before the Council. I presume you will do that by tabling a document at the European Council on 23 October. It would be good if Members of Parliament could also receive a copy of that document in advance so that we can see what aspects of the Commission proposals the European leaders are accepting and what they are still not accepting.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I will ask for your attention on three points, where I think you have to reinforce your proposals, and you still have quite some time before 23 October to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that you have to change the rules of the European Financial Stability Facility – because it does not work. A unanimity rule in a rescue system cannot work, as we have learned today in Slovakia and a number of other countries. You need to make it clear not only that a majority voting system is needed but also that the funds for the system must be increased. We have to help Member States in difficulties; we have to recapitalise the banks; we have to help countries that have insufficient liquidity. So you must tell the truth, and the truth is that we have to triple – at least triple – the funds in the EFSF, otherwise it will not be convincing to the financial markets. That is the first point that needs to be made on 23 October: you should tell the Council that you want to change the EFSF, that there should be majority voting, and that the funds must be at least tripled. Then you will have real firepower, and not merely a ‘firewall’ against the financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns Eurobonds. We know what the solution will be in the end because what the EFSF will do is to create Eurobonds covered by the European Central Bank – and who do you think is covering the capital of the European Central Bank? The Member States of the eurozone! It is exactly the same system, so come forward with the Green Paper as quickly as possible. A few weeks ago, you said that you would come forward with the Green Paper in a few weeks. A few minutes ago, you said it would be by the end of the year. I know that still means a few weeks, but I am asking you to move as quickly as possible because, in the end, that is the only way to convince the markets that we have created real solidarity and real discipline in the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and last point is recapitalisation of the banks. Mr Barroso, you have indicated a number of aspects of that operation. Our Parliament is asking for a European plan for recapitalisation. Do not make the mistake of 2008 when, at the Elysée Palace on 4 October, some Member States – and Mrs Merkel was involved here – refused a European plan for recapitalisation of the banks. Mrs Merkel thought that no German bank would have to be rescued. A few minutes later, in the car, she received information that there was also a German bank that had difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a European plan and not, as you said earlier, action by the national governments in the first instance. No: it is at European level that we have to decide which banks to help and with what money. The national governments can then come in with money if the EFSF does not have the possibility of doing so, but it has to be a European plan, not a coordination of national plans. So do not repeat the errors that were made in October 2008. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Analysing mistakes is, in my opinion, the best way to make sure we do something better in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to recall a situation that, for me, was typical of the crisis management of the European Union, particularly the European Council. I will not forget how Josef Ackermann, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank, and Baudouin Prot, the chief executive of BNP Paribas, became directly involved in the discussions of the Council at a very decisive moment in July of this year. I believe that – before we move on to the next bank rescue package – we need to agree in general in the European Parliament that we must no longer do this on the basis of erroneous considerations. These grey eminences of capital must not be allowed to determine how we change our regulation of the banking sector. That is my fundamental plea today.</p>
<p class="contents">We talk so loftily in euro jargon of the recapitalisation of the banking sector. In my view, up to now, we have only kept the banks on life-support; we have not really rescued them. In particular, we have still not rescued a single country in the European Union during the crisis of the last few years. Therefore, before we call for the second bank rescue package, we need to ask at what cost we actually want to do this. I firmly believe that these costs should be low, because they will be borne by taxpayers. I believe that we need to link recapitalisation with as comprehensive control of these banks as possible. In Germany, there is talk of intelligent nationalisation. Something like this should be regulated at European level. It needs to be clear that, if we provide the money again, the party has to be over for those who are making money in the banking sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I have yet to hear anything about a genuine European regulation of the recapitalisation of these banks. Dexia is, for me, a name that is synonymous with the failure of European politics in the banking sector. Dexia passed the stress test without a problem. If I have judged the situation correctly, Dexia would also comply with all the new rules that you have proposed without a problem. Every obstacle posed by the rules that we are now planning for 2013 would be overcome by Dexia. This is a situation, Mr Barroso, that we need to rectify. The same applies to the European Parliament. There needs to be a strict brake on debt for the banks, and this must not wait until 2019. We also need binding liquidity rules, even if it means that we in the European Parliament suddenly find that we do not have the same level of agreement as we would have in a vote on the Community method.</p>
<p class="contents">What should the banking sector in Europe look like in the future? In our view, it must be reduced in size. How many troubled large banks can we sustain in the long term? We believe that it is a lot fewer than we currently have. We need to achieve a situation where the banks once again become service providers for the real economy and where they are not the ones that are primarily making profits through speculation. That is also something that we need to decide. Mr Schulz is nodding. I am aware that we are more in agreement on one side of this House than in the House as a whole. Our decision today is all well and good, but there is still much to discuss in terms of the details.</p>

<p class="contents">I have to say, however, that the situation is serious, and that you are, in essence, offering nothing different from what the nation states you criticise so much here are offering. You are offering that the European Union jointly redeem those who have too much debt and who have acted irresponsibly, whether banks or entire states, and I say to you that the European economy simply does not have the resources for this. No Eurobond can be large enough to deal with this. When you embark on such a course, you never reach the end.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you are offering a European economic government. You are therefore offering a <span class="italic">de facto</span> liquidation of the nation state and, in my opinion, this can be proposed only by a politician who is completely out of touch with the prevailing mood in the Member States. Look at Finland, look at Slovakia, look at the Netherlands. In my opinion, people are now fed up to the back teeth, Mr President. All we are doing is piling on the pressure, and one day the boiler will explode.</p>
<p class="contents">The only real solution, and the only fair solution, is an economic solution, in other words, handling each case on its own merits, allowing controlled bankruptcies, allowing devaluation and shrinking the euro area, all of which takes courage. It takes courage, Mr President, because the other solution does not require courage. If we cannot muster the courage, ladies and gentlemen, and if the European institutions cannot recover, then this Parliament will be good for only one thing – to sing that Beethoven song, the one they call the European Hymn. We will be good for nothing else. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to say that none of the proposals have been taken up and implemented. I recognise that the situation has become rather critical. That is perhaps our problem. We are a long way from a comprehensive solution. It seems as if the players on the financial markets are just telling themselves that they do not need to take all this very seriously and that they will just carry on regardless – and they are carrying on regardless.</p>
<p class="contents">They are cheerfully betting on the interest rates for Greek, Spanish and Italian bonds, while the credit rating agencies, which are caught in a conflict of interests, are fanning the flames by reducing the credit rating of Spain and Italy. Greater attention is now turning to those European banks, whose undercapitalisation poses a growing risk, as demonstrated by the Dexia bank, for example. The people of Greece, Portugal and Spain are organising mass protests against the drastic measures to reduce public expenditure. Unemployment, the situation among young people and the austerity measures are mostly burdening citizens rather than those who have caused the crisis, namely, the players on the unregulated financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">In our Member States, there is an increasing lack of confidence in the institutions of Europe. This week, marchers from Spain, the <span class="italic">indignados</span>, are here in Brussels. They want to give expression to their protest against the consequences of the policy of privatisation and liberalisation, which has led to the excesses of the markets. This movement of dissatisfied people encompasses all of those countries that are placing the burden of the crisis on the shoulders of ordinary people. The clear failure of neoliberal policy affects not only the financial markets; it is clear here that speculating on rising and falling prices has long since reached other areas, for example, the global agricultural market and the commodities markets. The functioning of the real economy itself is at risk, because only a few large international companies can cope in a financially sensible way with the extreme fluctuations.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we talk about it frequently, we have ended up in a hare and tortoise situation in which the market participants, representing the tortoise, proudly proclaim ‘I am already here’. I believe that if we want to take ourselves seriously, we need to ensure that we also discuss the follow-up to the debates. I would say that, in my opinion, nothing of any consequence has changed. If the sensible proposals that have been put forward here, including by Mr Barroso, cannot be put into practice, then the situation really is desperate. That is the crucial point of criticism that I would like to express. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure many of you here will agree.</p>
<p class="contents">It has produced, I think, the quote of the crisis. Richard Sulik, who led the rebels said: ‘I would rather be a pariah in Brussels than have to feel ashamed before my children who would be deeper in debt’. Well I know how he feels because I have been somewhat of a pariah here perhaps for the last 10 years, but he has got it right because he summed up the detachment between Brussels and the real people of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Listening to this debate today, it is almost as if this debate has been going on inside a padded cell that is the European Parliament, as people compete for who can be the most stupid; who can waste the maximum amount of taxpayers’ money. I really do think as a political class you are all wrong, and you are all wrong democratically because nobody has ever given consent for this behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">When people vote ‘no’; when the French vote ‘no’, you ignore them. When the Dutch vote ‘no’, you ignore them. When the Irish vote ‘no’, you say vote again and get it right. When Slovakia votes ‘no’, we are told today it will all be OK because they can vote again this week until they get the right answer.</p>
<p class="contents">We have 17 countries trapped inside this economic prison of the eurozone and all you can do, Mr Barroso, is stand up and say: we need more power. People like you – who have been the architect of this failure, the architect of the misery that is being inflicted upon millions – want more power. It is like Barroso in the bunker, unaware of what is happening in the outside world, but planning world domination.</p>
<p class="contents">In economic terms, it is getting madder and madder. I hear that the new idea is that the bail-out fund will be multiplied, geared up times five, by the European Central Bank so that you have got your two trillion, Mr Verhofstadt. Two trillion – good God! Greece is going bankrupt. If you lot continue, the whole banking system in Europe is going to go bankrupt. The former British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, this morning described the attempts to save the euro as the most gigantic Ponzi scheme. I am tempted to think he is right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The truth is, you treat the European peoples and their opinion with utter contempt. Recently, the Portuguese changed their government knowing that the austerity policies that the new members of parliament were going to implement would be dictated elsewhere, anyway. The Greek Government cannot even choose the price at which it is going to sell off its state assets: that is decided in Brussels, in Strasbourg, and at the IMF in Washington. Today, Europe’s leaders, and the Commission in particular, have disregarded the Slovak vote and expect the Slovak Parliament to vote again for what they believe is the sensible option, in other words, a vote for ‘ever more Europe’. ‘Ever more Europe’, Mr Verhofstadt, means trebling the European Financial Stability Facility. How far do you want to go, Mr Verhofstadt? 900 billion? 1 200 billion? But where are you going to get the money from?

As I am always criticising Mr Van Rompuy – and I will continue to criticise him, not personally, but because I consider the office of President of the Council to be inappropriate, as it should be combined with that of the President of the Commission – because I always do this, but wish to be fair when I criticise him, and he did not deserve it, I would like to take this opportunity to set the record straight publicly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have now listened to eight speakers and eight different solutions. That demonstrates the problem that we have here in this House. I am, of course, pleased that there is a more united approach in the Council and that things can be brought together more quickly than the many proposals that we have now heard from the various political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">If we need to be clear about one thing, however, then it is that we need to make immediate and united efforts to put in order what the Member States have so far prevented us from sorting out. It was easy for the US to establish a European regulation because the country already had institutions at a Federal level. We needed jointly to establish these first, and we have done that together as Parliament, even in the face of opposition, for example, from the United Kingdom. By tightening up the Stability and Growth Pact with the Governance Package, we have shown that we are capable of action here and are able to strengthen Europe to enable it to function.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr Barroso, I also have a very strong point of criticism: we cannot now talk about accelerated procedures if we still have no proposals from the Commission for the majority of the necessary regulations. We are waiting for the regulation of financial markets and the Market Abuse Directive to name but two, which will probably not be tabled until next week. We cannot adopt something that is not even on the table! Therefore, my sincere request is for the Commission to press forward with these matters. All of this was intended to be done in the first half of this year. It is now October! You cannot accuse Parliament of not doing its job. We are genuinely doing everything possible to find appropriate solutions. Therefore, please table the proposals and then we will adopt them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We not only have a crisis in the European Union; we also have a crisis in our crisis management or, you could almost say, a crisis in our lack of crisis management. This is a crucial problem. Whenever a summit is held, or at least a summit between Mr Sarkozy and Ms Merkel, the message which comes out is that the markets will now be reassured. When we adopted the six-pack here in Parliament, it was said that the markets would be reassured. Nothing has happened. We will not be able to bring an end to the crisis without economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, you have put forward some proposals today and that is a good thing. We will take a careful look at them. I hope that they go further than the suggestions recently made by some Conservative and Liberal prime ministers. We are very much in favour of completing the internal market, but that alone will not generate the necessary growth within the European Union. We need an appropriate concept.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a serious point. Mr Daul is now speaking to his colleague and he is fully entitled to do so. Mr Daul has mentioned Bratislava. What sort of a situation do we currently have in Europe? A government is formed in the full knowledge that some of the coalition partners think and act in an anti-European way. Then, when a crisis occurs, the Social Democrats have to step in to help the government out of it. That is exactly how it is, Mr Ferber. The situation is just the same in the Netherlands. Now a new government is being established in Latvia, where precisely the same thing is happening, because the Latvian Conservatives are saying that they would rather join together with anti-European, right-wing extremists than with voters of Russian origin, who are seen by this new party and the new coalition party as not being true Latvians.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Daul, this is not just about an integrated Europe. It is also about finally having national governments which take a pro-European approach and not governments which come to power and fail when it comes to acting along European lines and then find that they have to turn to the Social Democrats. That is not a proper concept for Europe. We need both things. We need a strong European Union and we also need national governments which think in a European way. That is also important.</p>

That is what we believe should be happening in Europe, not what the party of the President of Parliament is doing. It is apparently still taking shelter with the Liberals.

We have insisted on this matter. We are therefore rather pleased that things are moving in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, nevertheless, to make two comments. The first concerns the timetable. You have announced measures concerning the banks that I believe are along the right lines, since they would involve the non-payment of dividends to offset measures and so on. Please be aware, however, that some large European banks have already begun to take steps in that direction; <span class="italic">Erste Bank</span> did so the day before yesterday, for example. It would therefore be good if we took action before it is too late, and if the European banking authority that we helped to set up together could offer some guidelines so that the banks are seen for what they are, namely European entities, and if the same rules applied in every country in which they operate.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the question of substance, failing to take action at European level is a problem from the point of view not only of efficiency but also of democracy: how can a handful of politicians – in Slovakia today, but possibly elsewhere tomorrow – representing a very small minority of people being addressed take a decision by themselves and, furthermore, on behalf of the nation, in other words, without giving the others any opportunity to put pressure on those who have to decide? That is why we support a European approach; our need for more Europe is not ideologically motivated. No, we want more Europe for very practical reasons, because our countries, our governments have proved that this does not work. It is ineffective and it is dangerous for democracy. It is therefore in order to tell the European Council this that we are asking you to address it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say one last thing, briefly. You have a knack for using up the leftovers, Mr Barroso. It might be an idea to whet the appetites of investors and citizens with something other than recycled ideas that have already been in the fridge for some time. Project bonds date back to the debate on the State of the Union in 2010, but they have yet to materialise. As for the Single Market Act, I recall that, in 2009, before you were appointed, measures were discussed here before us, and still there is nothing. All of this is along the right lines, but to be perfectly honest, we need to move faster, otherwise we will lose all credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have quite rightly drawn attention to conditionality, which must be linked to this recapitalisation. You said, in any case, that the private sector must be the first to contribute. You said that there should be no more bonuses and no more dividends while this exercise is under way, and you emphasised once again the issue of a tax on financial transactions. I support you on that.</p>
<p class="contents">I am asking you to be consistent. I am asking you to insist that those same conditions are applied to all banks that are still receiving government support today – and there are many of them – but I am also asking you to ensure that they are applied to all banks that fail to meet the new Basel III requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The transition period is very long, much too long. Well, I believe that the conditions that you have set out should be applied for the duration of that transition period. Ultimately, I believe that it is important to tackle the problem at its root, as some people have said today.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have certain expectations of your Commission regarding this infamous casino issue, and it is true that it has disappointed us so far. Today, the derivatives markets are 30 times the size of the real economy. You need to start by isolating this casino, in other words, separate the different types of banking, and then actually close it. This must result in far more ambitious measures regarding the derivatives markets. So far, we have the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, we have the question of credit default swaps, and on that point I feel that your Commission has not demonstrated the ambition that you wish to convey today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the Commission is occupying too much of its time with distractions such as the financial transaction tax or with financial services reforms that could dry up liquidity when it is most needed, rather than pursuing the vital competitiveness or deregulation which President Barroso has historically proposed.</p>

The country is facing economic and social devastation resulting from intervention by the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the Commission. It is obvious that the Greek people can no longer put up with the process of distortion to which they have been subjected. It would be preferable for them to draw the proper lessons while there is still time, and to rein in immediately identical processes already under way in other countries, such as Portugal. If the same steps are taken, the results will inevitably be the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, it is the Franco-German directorate making the decisions. National and European governments and authorities heed these decisions. It is obvious who is master and who is servant in this Union. The recapitalisation of the banks, which they are currently preparing, will be another huge transfer of bank debt to the public sector; that is, onto the backs of the workers and the peoples of Europe. The answer to this is organised social struggle that builds and intensifies, as is happening in Portugal, with countless protests, strikes and demonstrations, involving ever more sectors of society.

Our citizens also fail to understand your proposals because someone determined Slovakia’s contribution in such a way that a Slovak citizen must work about 300 hours to cover the guarantee, whilst a German or Belgian citizen would not have to work even half of that.

The problem with the eurozone is a problem of political credibility more than economic fundamentals. The financial markets are nervous because they doubt the ability of Europe’s leaders to take action. There are two problems with Europe’s response to the crisis: first, it has always been too little, too late. Europe’s problems need a European solution, and piecemeal national approaches will not do the trick.</p>
<p class="contents">The second has been a lack of strategy for growth. The markets understand that there is no route out of deficit and debt without a credible growth strategy, and the failure of Europe’s leaders has been to act as though fiscal austerity alone is a solution. But without demand, there is no growth; without growth, there is no return to sound finances. That is why the resolution – which I believe Parliament will adopt overwhelmingly tomorrow – insists on a meaningful plan for investment, growth and jobs. Council must also produce a clear response to two other urgent issues: the Greek situation and the recapitalisation of the banks.</p>
<p class="contents">On Greece: the Papandreou Government has displayed enormous courage and commitment in driving through huge painful changes. Greece now has a right to expect solidarity from the EU without further delay. The Council must now give final improvement to the long awaited package of support.</p>
<p class="contents">On bank recapitalisation: our message is ‘yes’, we need decisive and coordinated European action to ensure the security of Europe’s banks, but we say ‘no’ to an unconditional bail-out. As others have said: if public money rescues the banks, the growth and employment imperatives must be fully reflected in the conditions set. One condition must be a clear commitment from the banks to boost lending to the real, productive economy. Public funds must not finance excessive remuneration and speculation.</p>
<p class="contents">A final point: if the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) had been established under Community rules, we could now be agreeing expanding EFSF lending capacity instead of still trying to implement a decision made three months ago. We need a European answer to this crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The chair of our group has only just requested the documents that describe the proposals in detail and here they are. We have asked for the documents because I would like to reassure myself that I have correctly understood one point which is particularly important to me. The Commission proposals, which, on the whole, are excellent and far-reaching, include the following statement: </p>
<p class="contents">Deciding a sustainable solution for Greece within the euro area, through an effective second adjustment programme. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> We need a lasting solution for Greece within the euro area and we can achieve this by making Greece’s debts sustainable. In other words, this is the famous haircut. It is insolvency or, if you prefer, ‘re-solvency’. That was precisely our position. This is why we were accused of being populists a few weeks ago when we said that debt reduction would be needed to allow Greece to emerge from the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is rightly combining this with robust implementation and supervision mechanisms. This is the right thing to do. We want solidarity, we want to keep Greece in the euro area, but we also want solidity and we want to be able to monitor it, because solidarity cannot be a one-way street. That is extremely important to us. I am pleased that the European debate is now moving in this direction. I am also pleased that our position, which all the experts have long since confirmed is the right one, is now also being confirmed in the political arena.</p>
<p class="contents">I always get a warm feeling when I hear the Tory Members of this House, like Mr Kirkhope, calling for strong European solutions to recapitalise the banks. Issues like national sovereignty and the United Kingdom and its special position always come to mind in these circumstances. However, I am pleased that there are occasions when even London believes that Europe is useful. I would just like to see this happening more often.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one final point to make, which is that the news agencies are already reporting that the opposition and the governing parties in Slovakia have agreed to support the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the increase in its scope. This also pleases me. The spectacle of the last few days clearly shows that the requirement for unanimity is a means of setting up blockades. We need majority decisions, including when it comes to stabilising the euro.</p>

No, the solidarity between the Member States of the European Union and of the euro area makes various demands on us and on our voters. However, we are prepared to meet those demands because we want a stability union for Europe and, within this stability union, solidarity is a two-way street. This means that we are prepared to take on these guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the question of the banks is concerned, I am unhappy about the developments in the banking sector, just as everyone who takes a close look at it is. It is true that some of the things which were being done before the crisis are still going on now. However, one thing is absolutely clear. Without a functioning banking sector, we cannot develop a strategy for growth in Europe. As a result, the actions that we have just taken – paying the next tranche to Greece and organising a haircut which does not completely cripple the banking sector – are necessary to allow us to emerge from the crisis by means of economic growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union and the bourgeois governments are united on one thing and one thing only: the strategic choice to unleash a flood of new anti-labour measures, to abolish collective agreements, to slash wages and pensions and to decimate grassroots incomes and labour rights everywhere, in all the Member States, in order to guarantee rising profits for the monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">The process of reviewing the agreement of 21 July and the efforts to achieve a new, equally fragile and shaky compromise mark the start of even more drastic hardship for the people. The controlled bankruptcy of Greece being engineered by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, together with the PASOK government and other bourgeois governments of the Member States, whatever you choose to call them, together with the haircuts, debt restructurings and selective bankruptcies, have been on the cards for two years.

I can only hope that the market will see things differently. After all, there are truly important questions awaiting a definitive, reassuring Community response from this summit. One such question is the recapitalisation of the banks, although this is only acceptable as far as it is necessary in order to revitalise the internal market. Commissioner, the capital injections provided to the banks up to now have not achieved this. Of course it is also relevant to ask to what extent bank recapitalisation is actually aid in disguise. There may be potential that can be exploited in the EU internal market, but to ensure a balance will involve treading a very fine line indeed. Condemning some on the grounds of receiving hidden State aid, while actually handing out State aid to others under the guise of various legal entitlements, would not only distort competition; it would upset the entire system.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Central Bank (ECB) is set to launch a EUR 40 billion bond purchasing programme before the year is out. This is good news. It would be very risky, however, if these purchases can be conducted in secondary as well as primary markets. Giving the banks unlimited liquidity for a period of more than a year also carries unforeseeable risks. If this is, in fact, what happens, then the European Financial Stability Facility currently taking shape under the banner of solidarity is based on false premises. I sincerely hope that the delay, the change of date, will be worth it, and that the Council will indeed be able to approve a comprehensive strategy at its summit on 23 October. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The lack of appropriate agreement among Europe’s political leaders is intolerable. They all talk nonsense, and in doing so, they are undermining the credibility of the European Union. Prompt action and rapid response are lacking, and the European Union is losing control of the situation. Too much is expected of the current Council summit, because it is high time we reassured European citizens and the decent players in the market, and took action against speculative capital, from which the euro area is constantly under attack. We need to find long-term solutions to the debt crisis in the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we need to make the measures in the Euro Plus Pact part of Community law. Second, we need to increase the resources of the European Financial Stability Facility. Third, Eurobonds must be issued as soon as possible. And finally, budgetary discipline needs to be restored, but this is not sufficient. We need investment to create jobs in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is because the Commission has made a commitment here to use its power of initiative, and to do so in conjunction with the Council, in order to resolve this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is a hugely important step, and that it is the only means we currently have of resolving the crisis in the euro area. There is no chance of resolving it in the short term merely with an intergovernmental approach, and so it is necessary for the Member States and their governments to give the Commission the instruments and the mandate for it to lead this resolution process, and to put into practice, implement and develop the road map that it has presented here. However, I am bound to say that this is not incompatible with our creating, with our developing an ability to amend the Treaties, at the same time. I, too, am convinced that the Treaties need to be changed in the medium term, but we will also have to do this in the sense of strengthening them and giving greater power and stature to the Commission. By stepping up the Community method now, in the short term, and by subsequently changing the Treaties, in the long term, we will achieve more integration and a solution for the 17 countries of the euro area and the 27 countries of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The President of the Commission said today that we urgently need a comprehensive and credible solution and he outlined the road map which the European Commission will present to the European Council on 23 October.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Commissioner, the question is: can we guarantee today that these decisions will not go the way of previous decisions and will be applied promptly and cohesively? More importantly, can we reverse the impression being created that we are prejudging and prioritising the rescue of the banks, of the financial system, rather than the rescue of states and citizens? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The crisis we are facing is a long-acting crisis. It is not something that will end immediately. However, the decisions needed must be taken right now and the economy and economic situation need to stabilise to the extent required by Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">If we want to get serious, firstly, the Commission needs to play its part; secondly, Parliament needs to be brought fully up to speed on what is happening, so that it can support the Commission and, thirdly, the Member States need to have a sense of that interdependence and joint responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At least this contribution has added value, though. Economic governance will not improve without democratic oversight, without democratic legitimacy. Do not forget that, at EU level, what goes on in the Council must be overseen by this House and that the ordinary legislative procedure ought perhaps to be considered within the scope of the European Semester.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on, I should like, if I may, to put some questions to you as the representative of your President, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso. Mr Barroso came here to deliver a speech to us on the State of the Union, which he hailed as probably one of his greatest speeches. Then, three days later, having denounced the role of the G20, he accepted instructions from a capital to apply macro-economic conditionality to the Structural Funds. Put simply, the regions, the poor and workers are being made to pay for what the capitals have been unable to implement. Do you consider that to be an example of good European governance?</p>
<p class="contents">On 21 July, when you and the Heads of State or Government adopted the second bailout plan for Greece, you said that we needed a pillar to support economic activity, and you used the Structural Funds for that purpose. Why is it, then, that what was legitimate on 21 July has become an absurdity in your proposal on the Structural Funds? That is not good governance. </p>

We need summits when the proper preparations have been made, when it is time for decision making, and when the appropriate steps can be taken. The results of every summit should also include a schedule showing when the results must be implemented, otherwise they will generate uncertainty rather than stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I am very grateful to Mr Barroso for his speech because it continues and puts into operation the speech on the situation in which Europe finds itself. They make up a single entity. We need all the political instruments that form part of the monetary union and the internal market at a community level. We need a road map showing the date by which we can achieve economic and social union and the measures we have to take to get there.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Stability Pact and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) must be the right size for the monetary union. The requirement for unanimity leads to renationalisation, blocks progress and is inefficient and undemocratic. No measures must be taken in Europe without the involvement of all the parties, including the European Parliament. The haircut which is needed does not represent a solution on its own. We must have a complete package consisting of the haircut, recapitalisation, more funding for the EFSF, administrative reform, investment, growth, jobs and monitoring mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must monitor all the Member States itself to ensure that its rules are being followed. We must approve the financial subsidies given to Greece and to all other countries and we must support the process of managing this funding, for example, via a privatisation agency. The Commission is responsible for economic governance and Parliament must ensure that the democratic checks and balances are in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to highlight three of them.</p>
<p class="contents">First, euro area fiscal union. At last, someone has noticed the existence of Article 136; however, the President of the Commission spoke of a Commission-Council procedure. In fact, Article 136 also contemplates the possibility of regulations. It is therefore possible that, under Article 136, 17 Member States will vote in the Council and 27 in Parliament. We would like to know whether – as Parliament has requested – the Commission intends to propose regulations with the ordinary legislative procedure pursuant to Article 136 for the conditionality of the stability mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the stability mechanisms themselves. The 21 July agreement is fine, the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) is fine, but the truth is that the quota method does not work. You must tell us if you think that the EFSM, which still exists, can continue to operate, especially after the ruling from the German Court, and if therefore it is possible to think in terms of the communitisation of the stability mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Secretary General of the German Christian Democratic Union (CDU) today said that he would like to move on from monetary union to stability union. Without growth, development and employment, there can be no stability. You should tell us if the Commission agrees with this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has understood this. In the week in which we voted on the six-pack which, in line with good Polish tradition, became a true Copernican revolution, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, gave an ambitious State of the Union speech, as a passionate European, and today he presented his road map to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament, too, has understood the situation and will make it clear tomorrow, in a brief resolution, that the circumspect, step-by-step approach, which can work in ordinary times, will not give us any respite in this particular time of crisis. Only a comprehensive crisis plan, with both acute and structural and institutional measures, will break the cycle of mistrust. What I expect of us, members of the European Parliament, is that we will be able together to adopt a robust text for the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I expect the President of the Commission to be just as courageous and convincing at the European summit as he was here with us, and I ask the Heads of State or Government that, instead of continually proclaiming that we are all interdependent, they also act consistently in that spirit. Acting consistently means acting quickly by agreeing an overall European plan that will really help us lift ourselves out of this crisis and put an end to a Union which is increasingly being governed by markets and uncontrolled credit rating agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, only if the summit that has been postponed becomes the summit of regained ambition will despair turn into hope, mistrust into trust, and will we be able to set a credible foundation for our European project of peace and prosperity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important that we can create a financial firewall in order to secure the financial stability of the European economy. Let us not forget, however, that it is also important to establish the most vital firewall for Europe’s economies, namely growth. If we cannot achieve the credibility of future economic growth, none of the other things we are talking about will help in the long run, and that must not be forgotten when we are talking about ‘more Europe’.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a more open Europe, a more competitive Europe and a more dynamic Europe, but sometimes I feel that we discuss ‘more Europe’ in the sense of more institutions, more forums for decision making and more and different structures. The risk of that is that we will end up not with more Europe but with more ‘Europes’: more divided and unable to benefit from the fact that the European economy is the world’s biggest.</p>

I would therefore like to say that the European institutions must clearly take a much more aggressive standpoint and position. Gradual, considered and unanimous decision making must give way to a new approach in a time of crisis, otherwise there is a risk of collapse.

When we were negotiating the revision of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), we were aware that the Commission’s proposal was more demanding than the one that we had before.

The financial market turbulence which stems from the sovereign debt crisis is having very negative ramifications on the banking sector and its lending capacity and, even more significantly, is taking a very heavy toll on economic growth and job creation in Europe. That is why it is essential that we build up and implement a comprehensive strategy in order to overcome this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you have said you want to see our proposals more precisely on paper. I understand that very well, but I can tell you today that we have adopted a road map for stability and growth, which presents a comprehensive but focused strategy for overcoming the economic and financial crisis, and includes several concrete policy objectives. Of course, many of these need to be further worked out in consultation with the other institutions – not least with Parliament, but also, for instance, with the European Banking Authority and the European Central Bank – as well as the euro area Member States and other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of you may remember, I hope, how the Commission called, back in January in our annual growth survey, for a comprehensive response to the crisis. That has not quite materialised. We were actually criticised for daring to make proposals which, according to some people, were not within our competence. Now our proposed strategy is based on those same broad outlines but is, of course, supplemented with new, strong elements that go beyond what we proposed in January.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, we have three immediate challenges which are very clearly outlined in this road map for stability and growth. First, as many of you said, we need to respond decisively to the problems in relation to Greece. The continuing doubts over Greece have contributed very significantly to undermining confidence in the financial stability of the euro area as a whole. They must be immediately and definitively removed, and that will require a decision on a sustainable solution for Greece within the euro area, with an effective second assessment programme based on adequate financing through private sector involvement alongside the public sector, and with robust implementation and monitoring mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lambsdorff commented favourably on our proposal and said he had already been in favour of such a line at an earlier stage. I think it can only be a good thing if we have a convergence of views. As I see it, we now have to finalise this kind of sustainable solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Jaakonsaari called for a broader political consensus in Greece, and I fully agree with her. A broader political consensus is essential to support the efforts of assessment and economic reform for the benefit of Greek citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to enhance the euro area’s backstops against the crisis. The euro area must be fully equipped with financial firewalls sufficient to contain the current crisis. Recent decisions to create the EFSF and the permanent ESM have gone a long way to building these instruments, but they still need to be completed and complemented.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now essential to make operational the decisions taken in July without delay, and to increase the flexibility and effectiveness of the EFSF in order to build a really strong financial backstop. This applies particularly with regard to the possibility of precautionary programmes which are pre-emptive in nature, and to improving the capacity of the EFSF to intervene, by purchasing government debt, in primary markets and to intervene under appropriate conditionality in secondary markets where exceptional market circumstances and risks to financial stability exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the power of these backstop mechanisms need to be enhanced by maximising the utilisation of EFSF capacity without increasing the guarantees that underpin it, and within the rules of the Treaty of Lisbon. Early introduction of the European Stability Mechanism would also reinforce confidence in the crisis-resolution mechanism and would bring the advantages of a more robust permanent instrument. Efforts should therefore be made to accelerate the technical preparation and ratification procedures in order to have the ESM operational by, let us say, mid-2012.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need to restore confidence in the EU banking sector through a coordinated, targeted effort of recapitalisation in conjunction with the other elements of our overall strategy. This calls for the combined efforts of the Member States, the European Banking Authority and the European Central Bank, alongside the Commission and Parliament. Such a bank recapitalisation strategy must necessarily mean that banks which do not currently retain the necessary capital should present recapitalisation plans and implement them as swiftly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, banks should turn first to private sources of capital, including through restructuring and conversion of debt to equity instruments. If necessary, the national governments should provide support, and if such support is not available, then recapitalisation should be funded via a loan from the EFSF. Any recapitalisation from public sources should be compatible with the EU rules on State aid. We are ready to extend the applicability of the existing State aid framework for bank support beyond 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the basis of the newly adopted six-pack – for which I wish to thank you warmly – and with regard to fiscal and economic surveillance, we need to strengthen the stability orientation in our economic policy making. I count on your support for the firm implementation of the new instruments and the toolbox from day one, which should be in mid-December or, at the latest, on 1 January 2012. However, we should also be ready to look further ahead and to develop a vision and a road map for more effective economic governance. A long-term vision must combine discipline with integration and, in that context, we are also working on the report on options for the Stability Bonds, to be ready before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is encouraging to find that we – that is, not only Parliament and the Commission, but also the Polish Presidency – see eye to eye on what needs to be done to overcome the crisis. This is a major joint effort for you, for us, and for governments and oppositions in all the Member States. I count on your support and also on your efforts in terms of communication. We have only a few days to win the necessary public and political support for this kind of comprehensive strategy for a truly European way forward. Let us do it together and let us do it now! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An employment and social progress pact presupposes the complete abolition of the current Stability and Growth Pact in order to stop the exacerbation of the situation in Greece, Portugal, Ireland and other countries where problems are intensifying.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed is an end to the veritable pacts of aggression against, and extortion of, the peoples that are victims of intervention by the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the Commission. We have already seen the result of this in Greece. It would be good to take a different route before Portugal and Ireland end up in the same situation. It is time to bring to an end the impositions of the directorate, which continues to force disastrous policies on the peoples of states with weak economies and profound social injustices, in the interests of European big business. The proposal that they are drafting on the recapitalisation of the banks is an example of this, as it will be another huge transfer of bank debt to the public sector; in other words, onto the backs of the workers and peoples of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Among others, the Polish Presidency was requested to take part in organising those meetings and is treating this request as a priority. In the situation of an escalating financial and economic crisis, we must do our best and commit ourselves to the task of developing coherent solutions, for this is the only way out of this grievous situation. As regards a solution to what is referred to as the Greek crisis, the way out lies through the additional capitalisation of banks and the increased efficiency of the European Financial Stability Facility. We must ensure that the next meeting meets the hopes placed in it – unlike the recent ‘crisis’ summits whose decisions have not yet been finally implemented (there has been no ratification of the decision to boost the EFSF in all 17 countries in the euro area following the last summit), yet which already require amendments and additions. I believe that our shared ambition should be to take decisive steps to prevent the debt crisis from spreading from Greece to, say, Spain. We need not look far to find examples of how serious the situation is. For example, the deterioration of the situation in the banking sector, which requires additional capitalisation, is illustrated by the recent liquidation of the French-Belgian bank Dexia, which in June held EUR 4.3 billion’s worth of Greek bonds. In these harsh times, I would like to appeal to the Member States and urge them to take an active part in joint actions.

A new package of regulations reforming the Stability and Growth Pact and the consolidation of public finances are decisive responses to the debt crisis affecting the countries within the European Union. While restoring budgetary balance in the Member States, we should also remember that the European economy also needs investment incentives and clear political signals that will encourage its development and restore economic growth in the long term. A basis for the success of the European economy and the main source of economic growth in Europe is a smoothly functioning single market. Therefore, further integration of the internal market should be a priority for the next few months, along with implementation and enforcement of the laws already in place. When deciding on how to steer the European economy out of the crisis, we should also keep in mind that problems in the euro area are problems which affect the entire Community. All Member States involved should therefore have a role to play in anti-crisis measures, including those who currently do not belong to the euro area. Let us hope that the result of this upcoming European summit will be an ambitious and detailed plan enabling the European economy to overcome the crisis eventually and the Member States to embark on a path of long-term growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The banking sector is under extreme stress. The six-pack constitutes a sound basis, but it is not sufficient. We need strong European coordination, economic governance based entirely on the Community method. And we need a clear timeframe of measures to restore confidence. This is an all-European crisis, not only a problem of the eurozone. Reform is needed throughout Europe, not only in the eurozone. The central issue of further expansion of solidarity and the EFSF will be conditionality. Conducting real structural reforms should be the principal condition for receiving further financial support. This has to apply for all circumstances, including support to recapitalise banks. Public capital injections require public control of bank management, including strict control of dividend policies, bonuses and salaries. Next to austerity measures, we also need growth and jobs. The EC has a key role here to finally make full use of the potential of the single market. There is absolutely no moral or political justification to further delay the completion of the single market. More than two thirds of the EU economy is vested in the service sector, of which the major part is still not integrated.

The private banks which are the creditors of the main debtor countries in the euro area are on the verge of bankruptcy. The Commission’s plan to recapitalise the banks with loans from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) is totally inappropriate. On the one hand, the EFSF, which has constantly had its funding increased, has long since reached its financial limits. If a (second) bank rescue package was made available, these limits would be exceeded in a way which would amount to negligence. On the other hand, we are still failing to combat the causes of the debt crisis. Instead, we are continuing to take the wrong approach, which involves turning the EU into a transfer union with centralised economic governance from Brussels, while disregarding the losses. In defiance of all the experts’ opinions, billions of euro are being wasted on rescuing ailing EU countries, such as Greece, and the predictable failure of this solution, which is doomed to disaster, is being used as an opportunity finally to abolish the sovereignty of the EU Member States by the back door. In order to achieve this pyrrhic victory, even the European Council has been pushed into the background to enable the Slovakian opposition, which was opposed to a new wave of payments, to give way before the Council meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">More plans for centralisation cannot help us out of the crisis. They will just make this difficult situation even worse.

To strengthen its potential for development, the Union must undertake initiatives in external relations. These issues, amongst others, should be the focus of the forthcoming EU summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Emphasis should be placed on bilateral and regional agreements concerning different areas of cooperation with strategic partners whose markets are undergoing dynamic development. To increase its potential in relation to world partners, the Union must promote a European model of economic growth based on competitiveness, social responsibility and ecological sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must continue to be open to potential new members from Europe. An organism which does not grow becomes weak and then dies. It is important to pursue an effective policy on development and trade. In relation to this, it is necessary to support measures which help mitigate the effects of climate change in the poorest regions and to continue action to eliminate poverty, in particular, through the importing of agricultural products.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must be a more effective advocate of democracy, the rule of law and human rights. This requires the introduction and consistent application of the principle of conditionality, which provides for economic and financial sanctions against regimes which violate human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As in 2008, the EU is now intending to recapitalise Europe’s banks. The higher incidence of financial crises in recent years highlights that we are attempting to address only the effects, and not the causes of the economic and financial crises, using obsolete instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to bring about a more radical change to Europe’s financial system. This also means that new financial instruments need to be developed. If a rapid, major restructuring of the financial sector fails to take place, the EU could find itself again, in a few years, in the situation of recapitalising the banks. The EU must adopt measures promoting economic growth and job creation without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s citizens want peace and prosperity and are concerned nowadays about their own and their children’s future. They want decent jobs and a decent living so that each of them is included in society and makes a useful contribution to it. This is why the European Union must urgently invest in an ambitious, eco-efficient industrial policy, capable of providing jobs across the EU. The EU must also invest in its own transport, energy and information technology and communications infrastructure in order to increase its competitiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the financial situation that we all find ourselves in and, in fact, because of it, we must continue to focus on the people of Europe. This means that financial stability, sustainable economic growth and, most importantly, the creation of jobs, must be our main objectives. We must create green jobs throughout Europe and give a new impetus to the labour market. This will enable us to resolve some of our climate problems sustainably and in the long term. The next climate summit will soon be upon us. It offers a new opportunity to bring the USA and China on board in terms of international law. Too much is at stake when it comes to the climate agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
