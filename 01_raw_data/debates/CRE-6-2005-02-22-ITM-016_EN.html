I especially welcome proposals for higher standards for driving examiners. I did not like the Commission's original proposals because I thought they were too bureaucratic and too complex. They would have done unnecessary damage to certain groups such as caravanners, so I congratulate the rapporteur on producing a simpler and more practical proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we still need to look further into the question of motorcycles, where national practices and problems vary so much in the Member States. In the UK, our problem is not so much young motorcyclists, but middle aged men – like me – having a mid-life crisis, buying a very powerful motorcycle and then killing themselves. We do not have major problems with young motorcyclists because of our requirements for testing, particularly for the moped test.</p>
<p class="contents">Other countries have different problems relating to motorcycles and mopeds, so I will argue that the proposal made by the Commission and Parliament for a 'one size fits all' solution will not work. That is why, in conjunction with some of my colleagues in the PSE Group, I have brought forward amendments which will allow for a two-track approach that will respect the principles of progressive access.</p>
<p class="contents">On one track there will be a practical test for mopeds and then two further stages of progressive access. The other track will have no requirement for practical tests for mopeds, but then three stages of progressive access to the most powerful motorcycles. In both cases, with regard to decisions on direct access to larger machines, it should be at the discretion of Member States to adopt a minimum age anywhere between 21 and 27. I would hope that we can resolve this problem of motorcycles during the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The driving licence directive is very complex and intricate. Overall, I think that it is a great step forwards in terms of freedom of movement, of reducing the possibility of fraud and of attempting to improve road safety. More than 40 000 people die on Europe’s roads every year, a worrying statistic which requires serious and urgent attention.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most vulnerable categories of victim is motorcyclists. Italy has one third of all the two-wheeled vehicles in the whole of Europe, and 60% of the scooters. That is why I followed the debate on age limits with concern, but fortunately it resulted in the acceptance of a certain amount of flexibility. In Italy, for instance, youngsters can ride mopeds from the age of 14, and several studies have shown that that is not the age group at greatest risk. In our country, especially in the major cities, scooters and mopeds are extremely popular forms of transport and are valid alternatives to cars. The way to improve road safety is certainly not to take them out of circulation but to teach people how to ride safely, by introducing training and preparation courses in schools.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, the step-up approach is worthwhile, but the report introduces excessive regulation which does not improve the Commission’s proposal and does not lead any closer to the goal of harmonisation. What sense is there in granting a motorcycle licence at the age of 24 and allowing for the possibility of a car licence at just 17?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, introducing tests for access to every category does not allow users and much less the authorities to manage and monitor the system, and there is not the slightest guarantee that safety will be improved. The issue needs to be addressed boldly, without penalising motorcyclists more than drivers of other categories just to ease our consciences. I call on all my fellow Members to think carefully about these two points, so as to raise safety standards and achieve the goal of harmonisation by introducing sensible, feasible and manageable rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I am pleased that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has departed from the Commission draft by taking the view that compulsory medical examinations from a certain age should not be imposed by the Directive, because I believe that such a provision would have amounted to unwarranted discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">There are no statistics of any kind to suggest that age-related health impairments are a disproportionately frequent cause of accidents. Moreover, it must be remembered that all of us throughout Europe are confronted at the present time with closures, particularly in rural areas, of groceries, banks, post offices, and so on. Many elderly people live in these areas, and it would surely be wrong to take away their licences and thereby effectively put them at risk of not being able to meet many of their basic needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I wish to address is the question of the ten-year time limit. I was initially sceptical on this point, but I realise that, if we are to create a uniform rule, it has to be accepted that there are countries in which the driving licence serves not only as a certificate of authorisation but also as an identity document. Let me turn this on its head and suggest that, if this ten-year limit is to apply, as I believe it should, it might be worth ensuring that this driving licence serves everywhere as a means of identification. The benefits this brings would make up for the disadvantages the time limit imposes on some countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to elaborate on a few key points. First of all, we must be really serious about combating European fraud, and thus pave the way for it, but that is impossible with 110 different driving licences in Europe. I do think it vital therefore that driving licences be renewed every ten years and that we move towards one fraud-proof driving licence in credit-card format in another ten years’ time. We cannot leave this to subsidiarity. This Parliament would not take itself seriously if we took a decision and subsequently needed 80 years to introduce it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission proposal was too restrictive for owners of caravans, boat trailers and horse trailers which, in accordance with the proposal, must obtain an additional category E driving licence to add to their regular category B driving licence. I am pleased with a majority backing for my proposal so that the current situation can be maintained. Since there is no evidence that this should be unsafe, we should not make the rules unnecessarily complicated.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, with regard to driving licences for heavy goods vehicles, if we were to follow the outcome of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, gradual access to heavy goods vehicles would even apply up to the age of 24 years. And that is going too far. An 18-year old is allowed to drive a big Landrover but you must be 24 years of age to be able to drive a heavy goods vehicle straight away. That is really too crazy for words and very unfair.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, with Mr Bradbourn’s backing, I have tabled an amendment along with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which, as is currently the case, makes it possible to drive a heavy goods vehicle straight away from the age of 21. I should like to urge this House to support this amendment, which is a very important revision. The 10 years are vital to establish a uniform driving licence in Europe and combat real fraud. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this respect, I think it would be useful to harmonise four general principles, which are already included in the directive. I am referring to the principle of progressive access and the fundamental role of training; the need not to discriminate between car drivers and motorcyclists in the issuing of licences; the awareness that speed and the power/weight ratio must be regarded as one of the main causes of accidents; and the fact that the situation across Europe is highly diversified. This diversity should, however, give rise to a strong demand for greater safety and a greater sense of responsibility on the road, but not the establishment of a four-wheeled monoculture over a two-wheeled one.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework, other colleagues in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and I are tabling some amendments. On the one hand, they are designed to limit the speed of motorcycles that can be driven at the age of 18 and to recognise the differences among the various countries in the types of vehicles on their roads. On the other, they reaffirm the principle of progressive access, rewarding driving experience and practical testing when people step up from mopeds to faster motorcycles and considering that, when they move up from one category to another, people have already acquired the skills of driving in urban traffic and behaving correctly towards other road users.</p>
<p class="contents">With better harmonisation of these aspects, I believe that the motorcycle issue, which has been raised by many speakers, can be reconciled into a single scheme within the framework of this proposal, on which I congratulate the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Legislation is becoming more accessible, more transparent and more efficient in sectors which are basic to our freedom of movement within a single European market.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur, Mr Mathieu Grosch, has come down a long road and has made a huge effort to reconcile various sore points and different practices and has, in his way, contributed to the improvement of this proposal and we thank him for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, a harmonised, but not necessarily homogenised system for issuing driving licences will, to begin with, help combat the fraud and confusion which can easily arise today, due to the variety of different licences which exist in the European Union. Issuing licences in the form of a plastic card, replacing old licences within 10 years and the facility, albeit optional, to introduce a microchip facilitate controls and reduce the risk of fraud. The mutual recognition of sanctions will help this, thereby promoting an area of security and justice in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a directive also helps to strengthen road safety, which is the basic objective of the European policy. The right criteria for selecting examiners, their continuing training, periodic medical examinations of drivers, extending the principle of gradual access to driving licences for more powerful types of vehicles are elements which govern the protection of our life, the quality of our life and, finally, our democracy. They are at the heart of the European social model and we should protect them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, I wonder why we cannot consider moving more quickly to the credit card-size licence. Considering we transferred from 15 different currencies to the single European currency in a matter of weeks, it seems to me that transferring from 110 different models of licence to a single licence must be a far easier process.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the points that concerns me is the cost of licensing for young people in particular. It must be a disincentive for them, having also to pay for training and in many cases repeating their tests. This must result in a large number of young people around Europe driving without proper licensing and, therefore, presumably without proper insurance.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that in Ireland, the Automobile Association estimated that a fifth of the drivers on our roads have provisional licences. These are licences issued on the basis of paying a fee and getting a licence over the counter. There is at least a 12-month waiting list to get a test, and if people then fail that test - as a high proportion do - they drive on the roads without adequate training and proper knowledge for a period of at least two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst it is a very good idea to have common standards across Europe, we must address the question of whether Member States are ensuring that the people who get these provisional licences in particular, are capable of driving safely. Road death statistics seem to prove that they do not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very pleased that many points in the initial proposals which people rightly criticised no longer apply now, such as health checks for older drivers, on which much has already been said.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the question of time limits is concerned, we should certainly take into consideration that individual Member States have very different cultures and traditions. In Germany there have been driving licences for more than a hundred years; no other country in the EU can lay claim to such a long history of driver licensing. We have our own tradition; others have theirs. It makes no sense for European legislators in general or the European Parliament in particular to go beyond what the Member States have hitherto agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the introduction of the credit-card type of licence, this option has been available for five years now, and it is the Member States’ own fault if they have not yet taken it. Its introduction remains, however, a task for them; it is not our responsibility to impose it at this level as a binding obligation on everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to raise another point of criticism. The new driving licence is supposed to contain a microchip; this will cost money and achieve nothing. Why did we spend time discussing digital codes and the like during the penultimate legislative term? It was so that the driving licence could be understood in every country. We do not need a chip, which will only cost money and serve no useful purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the trailer problem has been resolved. I had very intensive discussions on this point with the rapporteur, and I believe we arrived at a good, practicable and people-friendly solution. Let us also please come up with people-friendly solutions to problems such as compulsory exchanging of licences and the like. We annoy people more than we help them by bestowing these unsolicited favours.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore address myself to you, Commissioner, since yours is the honourable task of taking the final decision on the 129 amendments that have been tabled. These are very close to the Council’s position, and that is what best serves the public interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support the third directive on driving licences that is before us and I thank Mr Grosch for the work he has done on it. We are trying to ensure greater freedom of movement for our citizens, to combat fraud and above all to promote road safety. The slaughter on our roads in every one of the Member States needs no underlining from me, and this is but a very small contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">A plastic credit card-type driving licence would be ideal. The current paper licences lend themselves to fraud. We could have a credit card type with an optional microchip to reinforce further anti-fraud measures. I agree that it should be regularly renewed, again to reinforce anti-fraud protection and to renew the holder's photograph. It would also put an end to driving licence tourism by ensuring one holder, one licence. At the moment, as we euphemistically say in the English language, if you 'lose' your licence you can go and get a European driving licence or get a licence in another country. 'Lose' means having it withdrawn for some major transgression of the law!</p>
<p class="contents">Harmonising the scheduling of medical checks for professional drivers has to be good and so too having minimum requirements for training for our driving examiners. This area has never been harmonised and it is most important that we go down that route.</p>
<p class="contents">I would support all driving licences being replaced by the credit card type when they come up for renewal. I know that there is some debate around this and that there are two options. The big problem at the moment is that we must not diminish the holder's right to drive. I think there is a subliminal fear of renewing all paper driving licences, as they come up for renewal. People, particularly the more elderly amongst us, are afraid that their right to drive will in some way be threatened and that they will not get their licence back. We should give assurances that there will be no diminishing of the right to drive and that all driving licences will be transferred as they come up for renewal. I also strongly support the right to pull a trailer or a caravan under 3½ tonnes with a car licence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to assure Mr Piecyk that the requirements for obtaining a driving licence in both the Czech Republic and Poland are a great deal more stringent than merely passing the <span class="italic">Idiotentest</span>. High standards are required not only of drivers, but also of welders, doctors and nurses, who are so highly sought after in the old EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to my main concern. The Grosch report combines two issues we know from experience to be extremely complex. The first of these is the drive towards standardisation, or harmonisation, and the second is the desire to ensure respect for the principle of subsidiarity. There is no question that driving licences need to be standardised, as we cannot expect any policeman anywhere in Europe to be familiar with all their various permutations. Yet although there is a great temptation to do so, standardisation should not be followed up with measures that interfere with the sovereign laws of individual states, for example those relating to the age of drivers, medical examinations or systems for training learner drivers. I should like to congratulate Mr Grosch on having resisted this temptation.</p>
<p class="contents">What is absolutely crucial, however, is to set up a European network of databases. Until such a network exists it will be impossible to reduce forgeries, and hence to increase road safety. The reason for this, as is well known, is that those who cannot obtain driving licences legally resort to illegal means, and pose a threat to themselves and to others because they do not have the necessary skills to drive a vehicle. It has come to my attention that the European Commission has experienced problems with the implementation of this database, and I have to admit that I find this perplexing. Given that nowadays one can easily purchase items on the Internet, reserve tickets for flights or carry out complicated banking operations, why should the Commission regard the setting up of such a system as a near-Herculean task? I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While it may be fascinating to flick through the catalogue with the 110 models currently in circulation and study the various periods of validity and security features, it is not practical to operate with such a catalogue. Exchanging old driving licences will not make licence holders observe the highway code any more diligently, nor will it result in vehicles being equipped with better safety devices, but it will improve freedom of movement and considerably enhance people’s security and safety, whether on or off the road.</p>
<p class="contents">Updating driving licences brings more security without additional red tape and will be effected in full compliance with the subsidiarity principle. Exercising their sovereignty, the Member States should find a host of ways to administer the exchange, for example when vehicles are licensed or undergo their regular roadworthiness test. Both of these take place far more often than the updating of driving licences, involve considerable red tape and are far more expensive too.</p>
<p class="contents">All vehicle users who drive abroad will enjoy a higher level of safety by virtue of the fact that, when they are stopped for roadside checks and even when they hire cars, their up-to-date readable driving licence will make irritating and nerve-racking complications a thing of the past. Evidence shows that such complications lead to stress, which puts these drivers at risk on the road.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the fight against terrorism, I believe that a verifiable driving licence is an entirely legitimate requirement. The licence-holder must be identifiable beyond any shadow of doubt. In this way, the scope for fraud is reduced, licences become more forgery-proof, and we may be sure that the driver of a bus or of a vehicle carrying hazardous materials is qualified to drive that particular vehicle.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to take serious action to combat driving-licence tourism, we need a registry of issued driving licences as part of a network of national registers. If the Committee’s assumptions turn out to be justified, we shall achieve this goal in the year 2030. We should certainly not defer our target dates any further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank Mr Grosch very much for a report the quality of which has been unanimously recognised. I thank him, and the Committee on Transport and Tourism, warmly for their support and, I would say, their improvement of the Commission’s text. Congratulations, Mr Grosch! It is a very sensitive subject for Europe’s citizens and you have therefore succeeded in finding the right balance. I have of course heard some of you warning the Union against excessive regulation, but I have to say nevertheless that this new driving licence, a few of which I have already seen here and there in some Member States, will in my opinion bring greater safety for everyone, simplicity for its users and a subsidiarity that leaves a number of decisions to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore say that it is a very well balanced text. It is true, ladies and gentlemen, that we are legislating on a very sensitive subject. The driving licence, Mr President, is now the most widespread qualification in the European Union: almost 300 million holders often depend on it for their mobility, for their everyday lives. On the other hand, of course, the diversity of responses shows that there are as many experts as there are holders of driving licences and that each expert has his or her own opinion on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the light of the agreement reached in the Council last October and in the light of the vote in committee – your committee – there is a very broad consensus, which confirms that the other institutions largely share the Commission’s objectives. Clearly, given the number of amendments and the variety of reactions, I cannot respond on every point.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell you, Mr Grosch, that the Commission is able to accept virtually all your amendments; on the other hand, however, it feels obliged to suggest that you reject a number of amendments which, while reflecting laudable intentions, would in a way unbalance the text and make it more cumbersome. This is one stage, and we know there will be other improvements yet. I am thinking for example of Amendments 97 to 129. Obviously, Mr President, I will arrange for the detail of the Commission’s response to all the amendments to be forwarded in writing, but I would like in particular to answer a few questions and, first of all, to explain my position on the replacement of licences that are already in circulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Your report, Mr Grosch, proposes replacing all existing licences within a period of 10 years for paper models and 20 years for other models. It is true that the Commission did not originally propose replacing all the licences already in circulation. However, recent revelations of document fraud and the fraudulent obtaining of driving licences – which a number of you have mentioned, referring to ‘driving licence tourism’ – have led to a change of attitude on the subject in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this, ladies and gentlemen, replacing every licence will allow databases to be updated, and forged licences and the duplicate and triplicate licences many citizens hold to be withdrawn. This operation will make a direct contribution to improving road checks and create an additional means of reducing impunity. The creation of a computer network will also serve this objective. With this in mind, I would like to inform Parliament that the Commission is cooperating with the Member States on the creation of a driving licence network to be known as Resper. This database will connect the national databases and the relevant work will be completed in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">That is therefore why all the amendments are acceptable to the Commission, and I have no doubt that the formulation proposed by the Grosch report opens up the prospect of a fruitful debate in the Council on this replacement of licences already in circulation. Obviously, the Commission cannot accept amendments that are not consistent with this and which might in future even prevent the problems I have already mentioned being resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a few words about limited administrative validity. The Commission has proposed an administrative validity of 10 years for future driving licences. This document in evidence of rights to drive will have to include a recent photograph and incorporate the most advanced possible anti-fraud protection. This will enable checks to be effective and road safety to be improved without excessive cost.</p>
<p class="contents">It is nevertheless true that the Commission did not propose linking this regular renewal with a medical examination because we still have to leave the Member States some responsibility in this field in the name of subsidiarity. So much for limited administrative validity, which nevertheless looks interesting to us in that it will help to prevent fraud and to update the licence without undue formality. As I said, the Commission has not proposed regular medical examinations, and limited validity is not automatically linked to such checks, which remain the responsibility of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank everyone who has raised the problem of motorcycles, bearing in mind in particular the young, and sometimes not so young, people who use them. One of you stressed that at a particular age people might want a motorcycle without necessarily being ready for one. It is true that we must be very careful. Motorcycle drivers are 16 times more likely to be involved in accidents than motorists. If the present trend continues and we do nothing, two-wheel drivers will account for as much as one third of fatalities in 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been Minister for Health in a Member State and I can tell you that the number of deaths, and also the number of accidents that leave young people quadriplegic will affect me for the rest of my life. I therefore believe we must be extremely careful.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, Mr President, I now want to express my warmest thanks to the honourable Members who, with their rapporteur, have done a quite remarkable piece of work. I am sure that our fellow European citizens will be very sensitive to the progress we have made, even if, of course, we still have some way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that the problem of the cost of the driving licence and of the need to train examiners has also been mentioned. That is another matter for action and investigation in the Member States, because the younger generation in particular must not be faced with difficulties in obtaining a driving licence, since for many young people it is a way of obtaining employment. That is what I wanted to say.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Commission, I therefore accept your amendments, Mr Grosch. I am obliged to reject a few of them, but I nevertheless thank those who tabled them for their contribution to this debate, a contribution which must not be underestimated when we see its importance for the everyday lives of Europe’s citizens.<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
