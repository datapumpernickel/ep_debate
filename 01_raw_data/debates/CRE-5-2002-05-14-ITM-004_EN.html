<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Caudron (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 14 November 2001, Parliament adopted, by a very broad majority, my report on the Sixth Framework Programme (FP6) for research, technological development and demonstration activities. We retained the structure, the principles and the philosophy of Commissioner Busquin’s plan and enhanced these aspects with contributions by citizens from the research community so as to better respond to the aspirations of the European people.</p>
<p class="contents">On 10 December 2001, the Research Council responded, in an extraordinary manner, to many of our requests and proposals. Since then, we have continued to work together to clarify some points and to further improve the framework programme in close collaboration with Commissioner Busquin and his staff as well as the Council Presidency and Mr Marimón Suñol. Everyone has made an effort, everyone has listened to and tried to understand each other; to work around others’ limitations and to seek compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">On 23 April 2002, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy adopted 90 amendments, 30 of which will be included in the specific programmes. We requested further clarification on the instruments for the implementation of the programme, on the aid to SMEs and on micro enterprises. We emphasised research, sustainable development and the reduction of external environmental costs. We reiterated our commitment to basic research. Lastly, we stressed the importance of research in the fields of health and combating major diseases, whilst bearing in mind everything which affects human and social research.</p>
<p class="contents">Before and after these votes, several informal and formal three-way meetings enabled us to reconcile the various points of view. The administrative and technical teams of the three institutions, the MEPs concerned and their assistants have worked tirelessly. And on 7 May, during a lengthy and particularly productive three-way meeting, we reached agreements involving 34 compromise amendments that the Committee on Industry approved last night, almost unanimously, thus giving me the go-ahead, as rapporteur, to substitute them for the amendments adopted on 23 April.</p>
<p class="contents">On the more delicate subject of ethical considerations, a broad agreement was reached, enabling the Commission to confirm the limits that must not be exceeded in this area, which means the Council can take these into account and that everything can be included in the specific programmes. Commissioner Busquin is expected to confirm this later. We are now on the verge of finally adopting the FP6, as the Council has already given us its written approval of the 34 compromise amendments that you are to vote on tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by once again thanking the Belgian Presidency which enabled us to adopt a very positive common position on 10 December 2001. I would again like to thank Commissioner Busquin and his staff, who have been open to our views, shown understanding and respect for Parliament and proposed imaginative solutions. I would also like to thank Chairman Westendorp and the entire secretariat of the Committee on Industry, the administrators and secretariats of the political groups and my assistant, Gaëlle Le Bouler. I extend my warm thanks to my colleagues who have worked with me on this matter for a year and a half, the shadow rapporteurs, the coordinators, the draftsmen, which include Mr van Velzen, Mr Piétrasanta, Mr Alyssandrakis, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel and also Mrs McNally. I would thank in particular, the Spanish Presidency and Mr Marimón Suñol who have been open to our views and given a great deal of their time, something which is particularly deserving of our gratitude and praise.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I have almost come to an end, with what will no doubt be my last major European report, after 13 years as an MEP. I left the French Socialist Party six months ago, and will be standing in the legislative elections in France, as a candidate of the ‘<span class="italic">Forum Gauche Citoyenne</span>’ [Forum of the Citizens’ Left], up against a Socialist Party candidate. Either I will be elected and will leave the House, or I will be defeated and the Socialist Party will inevitably dismiss me from the Group of the Party of European Socialists. Whatever happens, my life will be completely transformed and that is why I am pleased to close this chapter of my political life, having contributed to the creation of an excellent European research programme which, with a budget of EUR 17.5 billion, is the third largest European policy. Today, 14 May 2002, I would like to express my genuine pride, and to praise Europe’s scientific community with which I have worked closely and to thank once again all my colleagues and their counterparts who have helped and supported me over the last year and a half.</p>

I should personally like to let the Commissioner know that our thoughts are with him in the difficult times he is currently facing on account of his wife’s illness. </p>
<p class="contents">The PPE-DE Group wholeheartedly and fully endorses the compromises that have been made. A number of my colleagues, for reasons of their own, will be tabling an amendment on the paragraph on ethics, the so-called 32 signatures procedure. I welcome the fact that our colleagues use this right to demonstrate that, in their view, the paragraph on ethics has not gone far enough. Quite honestly, I also hope that the Council and the Commission will seize the opportunity to come closer together in the near future, and closer to Parliament, and hold discussions with each other about ethical issues. The ethical issues have not been solved by the Sixth Framework Programme – we know that there is a significant level of divergence between the Member States – but in my view it is most definitely worthwhile for us to continue to exchange ideas with each other on this score.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Mr Caudron for his excellent, open and communicative style of cooperation. I should also like to thank our chairman, Mr Westendorp, for his sterling advice and support. I should also like to extend my intense gratitude to the Commissioner, his cabinet and the members of the Commission for their extremely positive attitude and I should also like to thank the Council in particular. The Belgian Presidency was first-rate, but the Spanish Presidency is a fine example of how it is possible for the Council and Parliament to work together, and I believe that it is thanks to the Council that we have managed it.</p>
<p class="contents">Except, of course, that the budget has made a distinct shift towards us. Needless to say, as an MEP, you always want more, but ultimately you have to accept the compromise. Personally, I am delighted that in the area of cancer research we have managed to set an example of how you can allocate both National and European funds and how you can develop far greater strength in cancer research by combining two funds. I am extremely pleased about that. I also welcome the fact that the relationship between the framework programme and the specific programme has gained in strength and coherence, and I would also thank the Council for its efforts in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, I am of the opinion that the long journey we have undertaken to ultimately achieve this result has been very worthwhile. We can, however, also tell the scientific world that Parliament, the Council and the Commission have joined forces in order to produce the best possible result that we could possibly manage at the time, and in my view this is a great success today, not only for the Commissioner, but for us all.</p>

<p class="contents">Clever people all over Europe are waiting to hear what we decide this week, because next year they will be able to use their brains on our behalf. We will give them the money to do work which will help our economy and our society. There is a strong correlation between research effort and economic success, and the European Union at least is giving an example and showing that it understands that connection.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been able to reach a very wide consensus in Parliament across political and national boundaries on the Sixth Framework Programme. We are coming up with a programme which highlights key areas for research but at the same time expresses the wishes of the citizens of Europe for scourges like cancer and other illnesses and for environmental dangers to be combated with intelligence.</p>
<p class="contents">This is one part of the European research area. Member States must do the rest. It is their responsibility. The European Union is doing its part. Thank you to those who have enabled more money to be spent on the important area of science and society which includes a detailed examination of ethics. We in the PSE Group will not support amendments on ethics, but we appreciate the declaration which has been brought forward.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of a long process, may I thank once again our excellent rapporteur who has worked in a remarkable way, our shadows and everyone else involved. Clever people of Europe, the money is on its way!</p>

<p class="contents">At the moment, there is no real European Research Area. One of the key conditions for bringing this about is a well-oiled, fast communication infrastructure. This is why the liberal group has always set such great store by the progress made in the Geant project. After all, effective, rapid communication is essential in order to enable researchers to work together. I am therefore pleased that under pressure from Parliament, firstly the budget for Geant was increased, and secondly the management structure was considerably improved by means of sound agreements within the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important prerequisite for cooperation and the transfer of knowledge is the mobility of researchers. I should like to draw the attention to this aspect once again. Many of our top people – and this is echoed throughout the world of research – sometimes spend time in America to learn about new developments. However, sound pre-conditions to guarantee the return of these researchers are lacking in Europe, so that sometimes they prefer to stay in America. This is a brain drain, and we need these brains in order to turn Europe into the world’s most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point concerns ethics. A great deal has been said on this topic over the past few months, and I should like to say something about the attitude of a number of fellow MEPs who are attempting to thwart innovations in the field of biomedical research. The liberal group is also acutely aware of the ethical dilemmas posed by the ever faster evolving technological possibilities. A balanced, well-thought-out approach is what is required. But how can we ever become this competitive economy if we nip each and every innovation in the bud in the name of moral standards and even attempt to impose views on other Member States? Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you that we in the liberal group are pleased with the current wording, as laid down in the common position on ethics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Caudron was very willing to listen to our views and it was a pleasure for us to work with him in drawing up the Sixth Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Council is concerned, I must also thank the Belgian Presidency, represented by Mr de Donnea, who worked hard to include the proposals that Parliament, in particular, desired, and I would also thank the current Spanish Presidency. The fact remains, however, that the person who most influenced the Sixth Framework Programme was undoubtedly Commissioner Busquin. I would like to pay tribute to him and thank him, because he was always very open to our proposals. He considered them in a professional and sensitive manner. I would like to give him my sincere thanks for his contribution to the Sixth Framework Programme to establish the European Research Area – it was his idea – and the new instruments, such as integrated networks, networks of excellence, integrated projects and the stairway to excellence.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall, of course, discuss the various themes. There is the difficult issue of ethics which I do not wish to tackle, as this is an area of concern for us. There appears to be a majority of Green Members in favour of rejecting the amendment on ethics. We are concerned by this serious issue and we must be aware that European scientists as well as the public look to us when we take decisions in this area. I recognise that the question of the use of embryos for research purposes is a very personal question, that there are Members in each group who are in favour and against their use. It is no secret that there are different opinions, even within our group. However, we must bear in mind that Parliament, at first reading, adopted an amendment whose aim was to restrict research activities in this highly sensitive area. It seems likely, at the current time, that Parliament will accept the Council’s proposal not to deal with ethics in detail in the Framework Programme and if we accept the Council’s proposal, we are essentially recognising that ethical issues must be dealt with by the experts, by scientists, by the Commission, and not by ourselves, the politicians. There may be good reasons for accepting the compromise and it is up to each of us to decide if it is better to avoid conciliation or to find a satisfactory solution to ethical issues. All I can say to you now is that when we meet the members of our groups to discuss the issue of ethics, we must not forget that the public believes that these are political issues for which we, as politicians, are responsible: we cannot delegate this responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We have further reasons to welcome this Framework Programme: the theme of sustainable development has been included for the first time and has been given a substantial budget, more than EUR 2.2 billion; research into energy, within the framework of renewable energy, is on a par with research into nuclear energy; sustainable transport and research into urban and rural ecosystems, with, in particular, an ‘ecosite’ concept, are new themes which were accepted. We are also pleased with the appropriations which were added for international relations, particularly for the science/society theme.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now up to us to optimise the Sixth Framework Programme through these very specific programmes which will be developed, as the Commission promised, and on which we shall report back very soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank Commissioner Busquin, the President-in-Office, Mr Marimón, all the shadow rapporteurs in the political groups, the chairman of the Committee on Industry, Mr Westendorp, and all the secretarial staff involved in this procedure for the excellent cooperation which has marked it from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">Having studied the outcome, I must say that it is a significant improvement on the original text and, as such, our group will support it. However, there are certain points which I should like to raise regarding the procedure for applying the framework programme and any subsequent programmes. Although the framework programme successfully identifies a whole range of leading-edge subjects for modern research, its orientation is, in my view, excessively narrow, with little room for all the research sectors which deserve support to benefit from funding. Because, objectively-speaking, the framework programme points the way for research by the Member States, I worry that this unilateral orientation may become the rule.</p>
<p class="contents">Τhe second point which concerns us is where the money will end up. What worries me is that a large slice of the funding will go to industry, with a tiny sliver for universities, research institutes or small research groups, irrespective of the standard of work carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is huge research potential in all the Member States of the European Union. If we manage to tap into and fund it and apply the results obtained, we shall have done a very great service to the generations to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The reason for my speaking, however, if only for a minute, is once again to draw attention to the ethical issues that cannot be ignored. Our group feels that the wording of Article 3 is unsatisfactory. Hence our insistence on tabling Amendment No 89, which presents a solution that is, in our opinion, correct: the principle of legislative unanimity. This ethical question is extremely sensitive and we must trust the decisions that the various Member States take at the highest level on this issue. To this extent, we feel that European research funds must only be used for those objectives and in accordance with those methods and means that are not deemed to be illegal in any Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What was made clear, as early as first reading, by the incredible number of amendments, is just to what an extent views differ in this House on what form the Framework Programme should take. Diametrically opposed positions are appearing now at second reading when it comes to the definition of basic ethical principles. Opinions differ to too great a degree for there to be ready compromise, in the Community of Fifteen, on the boundaries of stem cell research.</p>
<p class="contents">We will certainly be concerning ourselves more in future with questions of bioethics. I have my own difficulties with the use of embryos for research.

A whole range of proposals made by Parliament have been taken up in the Common Position and in the Commission proposal, and there is a certain amount that we have achieved. What I would mention as being particularly positive is that child illnesses and their treatment now have a place in European research policy. There was, unfortunately, resistance to that at first, but that resistance was successfully overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I see it as particularly important that priority one not only includes genetic engineering, with all the opportunities it offers us, but also medical research in general. For these improvements I wish to thank all parties involved – the Commission, Commissioner Busquin, Mr Caudron, the rapporteur; the shadow rapporteurs, especially Mr van Velzen, and also the Spanish Presidency. I see, however, the compromise we have now achieved as having one great and grave defect, in that no clear rules have been enacted on how to deal with ethically sensitive areas of research.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has difficulties with this, of course, but we adopted an amendment at first reading which could at least show Europe the way ahead. Even though I do not give it my wholehearted support, it is a compromise that has taken form there. It is unfortunate that the Council has wriggled out of its responsibilities by not setting down any clear rules in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Legal uncertainty now makes this a difficult situation for all concerned. The Commission will not have an easy time of it with this text, which incorporates no mandate that might, for example, support research with human embryos, although the possibility of this is not clearly excluded either. This will lead to disagreements, and that is another reason why we, in Europe, should carry on working towards a compromise. I am prepared to join in working on a compromise even if it means disregarding my personal conviction in favour of tight restriction. Co-funding will be impossible for as long as a compromise of that sort is not reached. Subsidiarity cannot mean that we may well have no common rules, and that everyone does as he pleases, but all share in paying for it. That is why this issue demands that amendments be tabled and resolutions adopted.</p>

They have done so both effectively and speedily, thanks to Commissioner Busquin and the Belgian Presidency, who, with difficulty, were finally able to reach an agreement on the financial package, which, as you will all remember, five years ago was the bone of contention that caused delay in the adoption of the Fifth Framework Programme.

As Chairman Westendorp quite rightly said, we can be proud that the report was submitted in the form in which it was adopted by the competent committee.</p>
<p class="contents">After a temporary committee of enquiry, which tried – unsuccessfully – to clear the way, was disbanded, Parliament then adopted a position with the Caudron report. This position is, of course, a compromise, but I believe it is very important for our countries, for research, for the future of millions of people who now believe that stem-cell research can offer the possibility of life in reality, not just in fantasy, which has been discussed extensively in recent years and in recent months even within Parliament. This compromise, which states, in particular, that the framework programme could finance research on ‘supernumerary’ early stage – that is, up to 14 days – human embryos, in order to discover stem cells capable of treating diseases that are currently incurable, is a crucial but irreversible step forward. I appeal to the Commission to do everything possible so that the compromise, which, of course, excludes all manipulation of human cloning for reproductive purposes, and which, at long last, represents a significant step forward for research, can provide a glimmer of hope for millions of European citizens.

<p class="contents">On the health side, there are great prospects for breakthrough cures for some of mankind's most dreaded afflictions: cancers, heart disease, diabetes and cystic fibrosis, all the neurological diseases – such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, dementia, motor-neurone, spinal and brain injuries. Genetic intervention could eliminate hereditary disasters such as haemophilia and Huntington's Corea which overshadow some families so tragically.</p>
<p class="contents">On the crop side, the potential is no less exciting, even if this suffers from a campaign of denial from certain shameless vested interests. Hundreds of thousands have died and continue to die from smoking and road accidents, but no one has ever died from genetically modified crops or foods.</p>
<p class="contents">So much potential good is available to us in reduced applications of herbicides and pesticides, in reduced energy consumption and CO2 releases, and in better quality and higher yields. This is before considering the potential in the developing world for feeding the starving, growing crops in drought-ridden and saline soils, rectifying vitamin deficiencies and so preventing disease for millions.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission and the Member State governments to brace their backbones and stand up robustly for what they know is for the good of mankind. Our scientific community, our researchers – not least in my Scottish constituency which leads in these vital areas – deserve our whole-hearted support, not only in passing Mr Caudron's report overwhelmingly, but in backing the simplified and legally certain procedure for approving biopharmaceutical products; for approving genetically modified crops and foods for trials and commercialisation; and for protecting intellectual property rights with an economical and effective community patent.</p>

I wish him great success in implementing this programme. It will not be easy to manage and implement such a large programme, with not only the fifteen Member States, but also other states taking part in it. We wish you good luck on the way ahead, in any case.</p>
<p class="contents">I note with great satisfaction that two issues which I have put forward again and again have been included, the first of these being research into improved methods of clearing away anti-personnel mines. I would ask the Commission to keep these efforts under one roof if at all possible. The second is the issue of disarmament, a contribution towards the abolition of nuclear, bacteriological and chemical weapons, a technical contribution to their destruction. Open today's newspapers and you read about how the two former superpowers are disposing of the heritage of the Cold War, that is, they want to disarm on a really massive scale. If the European Union were to join them in this, that would be a noble endeavour.</p>
<p class="contents">We have achieved a compromise on the ethics issue. The Commission has issued a statement which corresponds in essence to what Parliament resolved at first reading. I would ask that we bring forward discourse on the finality of science, and also on ethics in Europe. The actual problem is not with the Council, Parliament, or the Commission, but with different publicly-expressed opinions. Playing a part in bringing forward the broadest possible public debate on the purpose, content, and finality of science and technology in Europe would be important and should become fundamental as the Sixth Framework Programme progresses. In saying this, I would like to give you an assurance that Parliament is interested in this. Being myself a co-founder of STOA, I am aware of the importance of the task of technological assessment, and hope that we will work well with the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His work on this report is indeed remarkable and it opens up great horizons in many areas of research.</p>
<p class="contents">I continue to hold a resolute position with regard to bioethical issues, on which I have to say – to you, Commissioner, and to my fellow Members – that I have nothing but doubts. I have been working on these issues for two years and I have nothing but doubts and only one certainty, which is the sacrosanct value of human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">I suppose I believe in the institutions which are shaping the future, and the European Parliament is certainly a point of reference and not just for Europe. We must realise that something unforeseen is happening which radically changes the rules of the game. We must therefore assess the results of the increasingly rapid innovation, we must reflect on the way biotechnologies are advancing and what impact they could have on the very nature of the human race.</p>
<p class="contents">Biochemistry is only the beginning: in a future which is becoming increasingly imminent, we will have to adopt positions on the possibility of parents being able to alter the DNA of their embryos in order to provide their offspring with increasingly good genes. We will have to deal with the selection – for the purposes of genetic improvement – of dozens of embryos produced for that purpose. Cloning techniques will soon make it possible for individuals to produce copies of themselves, creating genetically identical twins which are capable of self-replicating, giving rise to a form of genetic immortality.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an inherent part of the nature of each of us to fight against death, pain and suffering, and science is interpreting this instinct perfectly. The possibility appears to be attractive at first sight, but do we really realise how radically our existence might change? Is the possibility of genetic improvement techniques being used by dominant classes to perpetuate their genetic superiority over weaker social classes really so far off?</p>
<p class="contents">I followed the long, anguished decision-making process on the Sixth Framework Programme closely; I witnessed a kind of resignation on the part of the Member States at their failure to come to an agreement on ethics. Aware of the difficulties of my colleagues themselves, I persisted with my amendment in order to send out a clear, consistent message. When I see companies springing up on the Internet offering to provide us with clones of ourselves at a high price, I realise that there is no limit to how bad things can get, but I also find in this a great incentive to persevere in the battle from which many – understandably disillusioned – people have already withdrawn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks to the efficient work of both, we have been able to reach a decisive stage today which proves that a democratic relationship between the European Parliament and the Commission is possible and which, I hope, will send a clear message to the scientific community as to the responsibilities that the European Parliament is able to shoulder.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this House often debate acts that are of fundamental importance to European integration. The Sixth Framework Programme for research and technological development activities will be one of the cornerstones of this integration. If science did not occupy its rightful place, what would become of society? If knowledge and research were not progressive, what would become of our nations? In affirming the European desire to create an area of research and innovation, we are rejecting tendencies to look to the past and attitudes that oppose change.</p>
<p class="contents">Philosophical considerations aside, the Sixth Framework Programme also underlines Europe’s clear and firm commitment to be at the forefront of technological developments, to be innovative, competitive, dynamic and to build our future. The proof of this is the numerous, practical aspects that the FP6 contains, such as human/social research, principles of integrating the issues of the environment, sustainable development, improved mobility, equal opportunities, the role of universities, education and openness to the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The coordination during both the Belgian and the Spanish Presidencies, between the various bodies of the European Union, has also been remarkable.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also emphasise the ongoing dialogue with the scientific community, the prospects of a network being set up and the increasing concern of the European Parliament and the Commission to keep in touch with the genuine needs, the genuine requirements of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europe that we want to see becoming a daily reality is a Europe of research serving its people and its researchers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has done some excellent work in a very difficult situation, as the programme has been tossed around among the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The ethics of research are an important and controversial issue and everyone’s opinion must be heard. Now at long last we must decide on the Sixth Framework Programme, an enormous funding framework providing finance for supranational and transnational European research projects. It is necessary to invest in European research, but after this Member States will be able to decide what sort of research they will be financing out of their own budgets in terms of ethical values.</p>
<p class="contents">The preparation of the Sixth Framework Programme is a prime example of inefficiency and bureaucracy, for which the framework programmes have been criticised for years now. It can take many man-years to find projects, prepare them and produce the various reports. All bureaucracy of this sort is depriving actual research of resources. The programme’s structure must be as light as possible so that we obtain the best forces possible for research and rapidly achieve results to serve industry, thereby increasing European competitiveness in accordance with the conclusions of Lisbon. The gap between the United States of America and us is growing all the time.</p>
<p class="contents">Controversial questions such as the use of cannabis for medical purposes can play no part in this programme. The Sixth Framework Programme must address and emphasise the importance of research developments in those areas in which real European added value can be achieved. Despite all the decisions and effects, it is important that we now take decisions on the Sixth Framework Programme and that it is allowed to commence on time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to stress that, during this procedure, cooperation between the three institutions was particularly productive. I would like to thank Parliament and the Council for their commitment. In particular, I would like to give sincere thanks not only to the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, but also to the shadow rapporteurs, Mr van Velzen, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, Mr Piétrasanta and Mr Alyssandrakis, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Mr Westendorp and all the members of this committee and those who contributed to this process. I would also like to pay tribute to the Spanish Presidency and to Minister Marimon Suñol for the extremely efficient way in which they handled this important and delicate stage of the adoption process. I would also like to reiterate the importance of the swift adoption of the framework programme and its launch in January 2003 for Europe’s researchers and its scientific community. On behalf of the Commission, I can approve all the compromise amendments adopted by the Committee on Industry. The rapporteur, Mr Caudron, explained to you the main areas where compromise amendments were proposed by the Committee on Industry and the way in which the Council indicated that it could take them into account, following a series of informal three-way meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I shall simply expand slightly on each of these points, and where necessary, give you some details which you do not yet have.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point is the technical amendments which were adopted en bloc by the Committee on Industry on 23 April, and which are to be incorporated in the specific programmes. The Commission undertakes to incorporate them in the specific programmes subject to the following statement being included in the Council’s Minutes: ‘The Commission considers that the content of the amendments voted ‘en bloc’ by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 23 April 2002 in relation to the second reading of the Sixth Framework Programme, is broadly acceptable and can, subject to the appropriate editorial changes, be incorporated into the specific programme decisions implementing the Sixth Framework Programme and, as appropriate, in the Rules for Participation of Undertakings, research centres and universities for the implementation of the Framework Programme’. The Council intends to make a statement along the same lines.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to the issue of instruments for the implementation and participation of SMEs. The formula agreed by the three institutions emphasises the need to ensure a smooth transition from the current framework programmes to the new one, taking into account Parliament’s concerns. It is also clearly stated that special measures will be taken to stimulate and facilitate the participation of small- and medium-sized businesses as well as that of research bodies of the candidate countries in the measures undertaken in the priority thematic areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The next point relates to health. In line with Parliament’s wishes, the aspects of research on health were both strengthened and better identified, particularly as far as the European dimension of research and the communication of the results of this research to patients. This is particularly the case for cancer research, which, as has been explained, is now the subject of a specific measure, which has been granted considerable resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Electronic networks for research is an additional point. Parliament expressed its concern to see activities carried out on this theme within the framework of infrastructure support activities, which would be implemented in conjunction with those carried out in the priority thematic areas concerned. In order to clear up any ambiguity on this point, it was agreed at the trialogue that the Commission would include the following statement in the Council’s Minutes: ‘The Commission states that the resources allocated to the activities on high speed electronic networks, notably GEANT and GRID – an amount of up to EUR 300 million, comprising up to EUR 100 million in Thematic Priority 2 “Information Society Technologies” and up to EUR 200 million in “Research infrastructures” – will be managed in an integrated way.’</p>
<p class="contents">Moving onto the budget, the sense of responsibility with which the three institutions treated this subject can also be seen by the swift agreement which was reached on the overall amount. However, significant concessions were made regarding budgetary allocation, in the direction that Parliament wanted. In addition to the increase of resources granted to health research, I feel that the increase for specific aspects of international cooperation, as well as the science/society theme, correctly reflect the attention that Parliament devotes to these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as international cooperation is concerned and in line with Parliament’s wishes, additional emphasis was placed on the specific measures to support international cooperation with the developing countries, the Mediterranean countries, Russia and the new independent states. The various methods of support for international cooperation in the framework programme have also been clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns ethical considerations. This is such an incredibly sensitive issue. As you know, it was very difficult to find a solution on this point which reconciles both the wishes and the limitations of the three institutions. I reiterate that, in no way, of course, do I wish to introduce harmonisation of rules for ethics at European level. The Commission simply wishes to push forward European research, whilst respecting the prerogatives of each Member State and their parliament. There is no surprise there, in an area which is highly characterised by cultural and philosophical diversity and where the approach has always been and will always be the respect for opinion, values and sensitivities, within the boundaries of universally acknowledged principles.</p>
<p class="contents">It is nonetheless necessary to clarify the conditions in which research undertaken in the fields of science and technologies of the living being might be carried out within the specific framework of Community programmes. In order to do this, and I think that this is an important step, the Commission has included the following statement in the Council’s Minutes: ‘In accordance with the opinion of the European Parliament concerning the proposal on the Sixth Framework Programme and taking into account the opinion of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies, the Commission believes that research in the following areas must not be financed by the framework programme: research activity aiming at human cloning for reproductive purposes, research activity resulting in the modification of the genetic heritage of human beings, which could make such changes hereditary, research activity to create embryos solely for research purposes or to supply stem cells, including somatic cell nuclear transfer.’ Of course, there is also the question of animal experiments, which must be replaced by alternative methods as far as possible, bearing in mind that the suffering of animals must be avoided or kept to an absolute minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, within a very short space of time, thanks to exemplary collaboration – and I once again extend my heartfelt thanks to all those who played a part in this – we have made considerable progress. Once the vote has been confirmed by the House, which I hope it will be, and once consensus has been achieved, we will still have some work to do. The decision on the framework programme is only the first component of a mechanism which also comprises the rules for participation, which were also adopted under the co-decision procedure, as well as the specific programmes. In order for Parliament and the Council to adopt the framework programme and its instruments for implementation in June, in accordance with the objectives that we have in mind, the three institutions must continue the close collaboration that was successfully engaged at the beginning of the procedure. We worked very closely and in a very productive manner with the rapporteur for the rules on participation, namely Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, as well as with the rapporteurs for the specific programmes, Mr van Velzen, Mr Alyssandrakis, Mr Piétrasanta, Mr Schwaiger and Mrs Zorba. We must continue with these efforts. The Commission certainly intends to continue to do everything in its power to encourage inter-institutional dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time in the history of Community research, we are in a position to adopt the framework programme in a timely fashion, rather than at the very last minute, so that it can be launched and implemented in the best possible conditions. We must seize this opportunity and we must give ourselves the means to take full advantage of this possibility. This is what both researchers and European citizens will thank us for.</p>

Parliament has played a very important role in this process, through the Caudron report at the first reading of the Framework Programme. We took many aspects from this first reading for our common position, because the issues and concerns that were aired in Parliament were the very issues and concerns that came to light in the Council and which also surfaced in other discussion groups.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, and the shadow rapporteurs Mr van Velzen, Mr Piétrasanta and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, whose cooperation has really enabled us to get to the heart of the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the programme that emerges from this process – and I am confident that tomorrow we will adopt a definitive programme – will be a significant improvement on the first programme we were presented with and a sign, therefore, of the mature and cooperative approach the various institutions have taken to the common position relating to the first reading, but even more with regard to the stimulating process that has taken place under our Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the positions of Parliament and the Council are now much closer, and this has been achieved through the desire to respond to scientists’ and companies’ request that we should implement this important instrument, and respond to the mandate we were given at the Barcelona Council that we pull out all the stops to approve the Sixth Framework Programme under our Presidency, and, also – as I said – because the concerns have been very much shared concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific aspects relating to content have been more fully developed, such as research issues in health sciences, the question of a greater contribution by the GEANT network, scientific and social issues, research and support on environmental issues, for example. For this reason I would say that, in terms of content, we are now offering a framework programme that is much better defined and will serve as the key element in another great initiative that goes much further than the framework programme, which is the development of the European Area of Research and Innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Barcelona Council, taking up the commitment made in Lisbon, made a very ambitious commitment which was that, in the year 2010, Europe should reach a level of spending on investment in research and development of 3% of Gross Domestic Product, with a substantial participation, of two thirds, from enterprises in the private sector and from the private sector as a whole. However, the figures are not the most important factor, but rather that we must recognise that Europe must change direction and take a qualitative and quantitative leap in order to achieve this objective of being highly competitive in the knowledge-based society. The Sixth Framework Programme is an essential component of this. However, with the satisfactory development of the Sixth Framework Programme we shall also develop other initiatives, such as better coordination of national programmes, a task we have promoted during our Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, particularly in this process, it appears crucial to us to respond effectively to the expectations of the scientific community and companies and reserve, as has been done, active participation for small- and medium-sized companies. For this reason, I thank you once again for your work and I am sure that the other aspects, such as participation rules for specific programmes – will be formalised once the framework programme has been defined.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, the Council has totally supported the Presidency’s initiatives – which we are very pleased about – in the series of discussions we have held. The Council takes particular note of the Commission’s vision and supports the Presidency in including all the amendments that have been tabled en masse, as far as possible, finding the appropriate formulae from within the specific programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council totally supports the entire fruitful discussion process we have held. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
