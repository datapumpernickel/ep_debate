The capture of an Israeli soldier and the ensuing Israeli operation has been followed keenly by us all. We have also been concerned about the continuing firing of Kassam rockets at Israel from Gaza. As the situation in the region is still very serious, I would like, in this first speech of mine in the European Parliament, to focus on expressing the views of the European Union on the prevailing crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Right at the start I want to say that yesterday in Helsinki the Finnish Foreign Affairs Minister, Erkki Tuomioja, discussed the situation in the region with Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister Livni. Mr Tuomioja was also in telephone contact with Palestinian President Abbas and the Egyptian Foreign Affairs Minister Aboul Gheit. The EU Special Representative, Marc Otte, has also been in the region this week and he has been in contact with various parties.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the Palestinians release the captured Israeli soldier immediately. The Palestinian administration must also bring to an end the continued onslaught of Kassam rockets on Israel from Gaza. Israel, for its part, must cease its military operation. The Union’s firm line on this is that any action that goes against international law must be stopped. We should also point out that we cannot accept disproportionate action or action that punishes the entire population.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Union are especially concerned about the suffering of civilians. It is important to say that it is the duty of both parties to protect civilians. We also know that the humanitarian situation in the region was already problematic earlier on, and that will suffer even more now with the destruction of the infrastructure, such as the power station in Gaza. This did not just result in problems of the supply of electric power but also water supply and sewerage. Hospitals, too, for example, are suffering the consequences of the bombing of the power station. We also condemn Israel’s attacks on the Palestinian administration’s infrastructure. In this connection it has to be made clear that the European Union will not automatically act as paymaster when the reconstruction starts.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither can we accept that Israel has detained numerous Palestinian ministers and members of parliament. They must be released, or at least guaranteed a fair trial.</p>
<p class="contents">What the Quartet formerly set out as its demands with regard to the Hamas-led Palestinian Government still holds good. The Palestinian Government must recognise the following principles: non-violence, the recognition of Israel’s right to exist, and compliance with existing agreements and obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection I would like to refer to the understanding reached between Hamas and Fatah based on the ‘Prisoners’ Document’. In a situation in which bad relations between Fatah and Hamas seemed to be reaching an acute stage, one that threatened peace, reaching an understanding in this way was a step in the right direction, although it does not as yet mean that the EU’s conditions and those of the Quartet are adequately met.</p>
<p class="contents">How are we to come through the present crisis? The European Union emphasises that the crisis can only be resolved through discussions. Regarding the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, it was a promising move that Prime Minister Olmert and Palestinian President Abbas met about two weeks ago. It was also promising that they decided to meet again soon. A speedy return to this path of maintaining contact and negotiations is very important. It is only the path of negotiation that can lead to a permanent and lasting peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the chances of initiating a peace process once again seem very slight in the prevailing circumstances, the idea of a two-state model must be kept alive. Weapons and unilateral action will not bring peace. The European Union and Finland, as the country to hold the Presidency, are committed to helping both sides to reach a peace settlement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Benita Ferrero-Waldner, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, we are all extremely concerned by the events unfolding in the Palestinian territories. These are very disturbing times: the insecurity, the inter-factional violence, the Qassam rockets, the shellings. The attack by militant Palestinian factions in Karem Shalom and the abduction of the Israeli soldier, followed by the Israeli military incursion into Gaza, signal a very worrying escalation.</p>
<p class="contents">In its statement last week, the European Union strongly condemned these acts, and we have just heard what the President-in-Office of the Council has said. Last week I called on both sides to take a step back, to exercise restraint. I now repeat that call. All sides need to consider their responsibility extremely carefully. All parties must abstain from any actions that are in violation of international law and we must insist that the Palestinian leadership do all in its power to end violence and terrorist activities. The European Union has called for the immediate and unconditional release of Corporal Gilad Shalit. This kind of act can only make things worse for the Palestinian people, as we are seeing.</p>
<p class="contents">But we must also look to the Israelis to act with prudence. We understand their outrage, but diplomacy offers the best chance to address the immediate priority, not the destruction of essential infrastructure, the detention of members of the Palestinian Legislative Council or the shelling of the Prime Minister’s office.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent events have considerably worsened the situation of the Palestinian population, and that is, I must say, a source of both sorrow and deep frustration for us. The damage to Gaza’s only power station has deprived hundreds of thousands of Palestinians of electricity and could have serious humanitarian consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything must be done to prevent the humanitarian situation from deteriorating further. Israel has to understand its responsibilities for the well-being of the Palestinian population and an immediate step has to be the restoration of electricity to the Palestinian territories. Both sides need to step back from the brink before this becomes a crisis that neither can control.</p>
<p class="contents">We must do all we can to avoid an unacceptable economic and humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories. Even before the latest events, we were looking at a 30% fall in income, unemployment at 40% and poverty levels of 67%. But responsible politicians cannot give in to frustration. I visited Israel and the Palestinian territories only two weeks ago. The principal aim of my visit then was to bring Israel and President Abbas up to speed with the European Council and the Quartet decisions on a temporary international mechanism. The mechanism is designed to provide immediate relief to the Palestinian people and to ensure that basic services are provided. Discussions were positive, but there is no doubt that events in Gaza and the West Bank have greatly complicated this effort. Now, more than ever, there is a need to press ahead with the mechanism to help meet at least the basic needs of ordinary Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of donors have indicated their willingness to make funds available through the mechanism. But the needs will be great and funds are limited. The Commission has therefore sought the budgetary authority’s approval to transfer funds from the emergency reserve. I am very grateful for the support of the European Parliament in this difficult endeavour and I am especially grateful for the many very valuable exchanges of views I was able to have with the committee chairmen and leaders in my discussions with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, at the forefront in setting up this mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our collective responsibility as Europeans to help the Palestinians and to give peace a chance. I look forward to your continued support on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear. The mechanism cannot be a panacea for all the difficulties faced in the Palestinian territories. Donors cannot be a substitute for the responsibilities of the Palestinian Government, which must take real steps to comply with the Quartet’s principles and end the violence that threatens the lives of Israelis and Palestinians alike. Nor can donors be a substitute for the responsibilities of Israel under international law, for freeing up movement and access, for releasing Palestinian customs and tax revenues, or for the recent damage caused to key civil infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">The events of recent days have undermined a fragile process that has just begun with the meeting of President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert in Amman. As my colleague has said, these events come at a time when progress was being made on a national consensus agreement between Hamas and Fatah, based on the prisoners’ initiative. It remains to be seen whether this tentative agreement for a government of national unity will produce a leadership better able to meet its responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I have commended President Abbas for taking this initiative, but at the same time I have been clear that it is not an end in itself, but only the start of a process. The Palestinian Government must ultimately commit itself to renouncing violence, to recognising Israel and to respecting previous agreements as set out by the Quartet.</p>
<p class="contents">We are faced with a very grave crisis situation in the Middle East. We have to work together to de-escalate the tension and to give diplomacy a chance. Because in all the chaos and confusion of the current situation, one thing is clear: a negotiated two-state solution is the only way to guarantee the security that ordinary people – Israelis and Palestinians as well as others – desire. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have had to seek new ways. The Commission is producing a wealth of ideas as to how to help the Palestinian people despite the fact that the new Palestinian Government fails to recognise Israel’s right to exist and has not renounced violence – in this the Commission has our full support. However, the other party must also make a move. It goes without saying that there are things, such as the Kassam rockets, that are unacceptable to Israel, but the question is whether it really had to react like that at a time when President Abbas had been on the way to making some progress with Hamas. This would at least have been worth putting to the credibility test. On the other hand, however, there have been occurrences that further detract from the credibility of President Abbas, and so it is increasingly difficult for us to find points of contact.</p>
<p class="contents">This whole situation is a vicious circle. It is hard to say who was originally right or wrong, because the circle keeps turning. We must make the position of the EU and of the Quartet crystal clear. Our conditions must be Israel’s right to exist as a state, and a viable Palestinian state. Both parties in the region must be aware that they are pursuing a policy that is not only causing their peoples serious harm, but increasingly also causing problems for the whole international community and endangering peace in general – as this is not just a localised conflict. Decisions are urgently needed in this matter. I should like to ask the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council to ensure that the Quartet makes a joint appearance on site and explains the dangers, rather than its members travelling there separately and thus achieving nothing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

UN, UNICEF and WFP reports talk of a desperate situation. Gaza has become a prison in which an entire population is being collectively punished.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community had finally come to an agreement to ensure that the Palestinians received the aid they needed to survive via the European Union, but all of that is now pointless since Gaza is practically isolated and nothing is getting through to an exhausted and humiliated population.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinian issue cannot, however, become a humanitarian issue, because it remains a major political issue. The indiscriminate decapitation of Hamas was, for its part, an act of madness, firstly because the members of parliament and the ministers now legitimately represent the majority of the Palestinian population, but mainly because Prime Minister Haniyeh had given the go-ahead to the so-called ‘prisoners’ document’ and had actually dissociated himself from the most intransigent of the positions adopted by the Hamas representatives in Syria, avoiding the referendum and paving the way for a coalition government in Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">With these actions, the Israeli authorities are in real danger of once again encouraging the most extreme and violent fringes of Palestinian society. Corporal Gilad Shalit must be released, just as an entire population must be released from the grip of an army that is infringing every aspect of the law.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, the European Parliament has pressed for aid to be allowed to get through to the Palestinian population; today, the same Parliament is calling on the European governments and the Presidency to demand respect for fundamental human rights, so that people can resume their lives in Gaza and so that political prospects can be re-established in place of violence and abuses of power.</p>

Observing the way things have developed in recent weeks is enough to make us, too, become despondent. Indeed, if we compare the current situation with the way things were, say, in January of this year, they have only taken a turn for the worse.</p>
<p class="contents">The arms truce, which Hamas observed, has come to an end; the number of prisoners on both sides is on the up; violence perpetrated against citizens has increased; Gaza has become a prison for its residents and the humanitarian situation is tragic.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, now is not the time to let our hands hang low. That is why I should like to start, on behalf of my group, by pledging our full support, both to the Finnish Presidency, you, Mrs Lehtomäki, your Prime Minister, your Minister for Foreign Affairs – whilst also congratulating you on the efforts that have already been made – and also to you, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner.</p>
<p class="contents">If I can venture drawing the political lesson from your words, what strikes me as paramount from what you have said – and you seem to be in agreement – is that negotiations and diplomacy are the only way-out. That appears to me as a clear message in the direction of those who at the moment say that they refuse all contact with the other party.</p>
<p class="contents">We support you in this, and needless to say, we remain faithful to the principles of the Quartet, the recognition of Israel’s right of existence, the renunciation of violence by Hamas, as well as respect for previous treaties. We also support your call for taking a step back and for restraint. You have our full support in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Clearly that declaration is not balanced: it gives great emphasis to the kidnapping of the Israeli soldier, which it condemns, but spends far fewer words on the completely disproportionate response of the Israeli authorities, which it only ‘regrets’. I am sorry that the representative of the Council has repeated that language and that lack of balance in her introduction this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only that, contrary to both international law and humanitarian principle, the Israeli Government has destroyed electricity plants and water distribution networks: it has kidnapped and arrested 64 elected representatives. That follows the terrible massacre on the beach in Gaza.</p>
<p class="contents">If that had happened anywhere else in the world we could have expected immediate condemnation by the international community. It is quite extraordinary that the Council has only finally spoken out now, and spoken in such muted terms. I believe it vital that we, the European Parliament, speak out and that we condemn in the strongest possible terms the arrest of democratically elected Palestinian representatives.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">At the same time we condemn the kidnapping of the captured Israeli soldier and we call for his swift and safe release. But let us not forget, either, the 9 600 Palestinian political prisoners, over half of whom are being detained without trial, nearly 400 of whom are under the age of 18. Let us have some consistency.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, politics is about responding to changing events, and there has been a historic event in recent days that has been tragically overshadowed by the events in Gaza. That event was the agreement of Hamas and Fatah over the so-called prisoners’ document.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent weeks the international community has called upon Hamas to change and now, as it gradually begins to do so, we should recognise that fact, give credit for that fact and alter our own political response accordingly. In agreeing that national conciliation document, Hamas has demonstrated that it supports the formation of a government of national coalition, that it supports an independent Palestinian state, within the 1967 borders, and that it is taking the first steps towards recognising Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be clear that the EU must immediately reopen dialogue with the legitimately and democratically elected representatives. The Council must reaffirm its conviction, as it has done, that the negotiated two-state solution is the only one that will bring peace and security, but that means that the EU itself must live up to its responsibilities. Together with the Quartet it must put forward concrete proposals about what it plans to do to help bring about that settled and peaceful resolution.</p>

The Israeli army’s offensive on Gaza and the unprecedented seizure of a third of the Palestinian Ministers, of the President of Parliament and of many Hamas Members of Parliament, have nothing really to do with the desire to free that soldier. These plans had been in place well before his capture. The Olmert Government took this opportunity to try to take a decisive step towards a well-established and now well-known strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the idea is to depose the Palestinian Government, even if it means all that remains of the Palestinian Authority of President Abbas being destroyed in the process. Then, as always, they will say that there is no Palestinian interlocutor to negotiate with. The way will then be open for Israel to impose its borders unilaterally. The regrouping of the settlements into three great blocs, which are easier to defend, the dividing up of the Palestinian territories and the annexation of almost half of the West Bank, of the Jordan Valley and of East Jerusalem and the continued construction of the wall: in short, a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span> destroying any hope of a Palestinian State deserving of the term.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the chaos thereby generated within Palestinian society will make it possible to justify continuing use of force, in the name of the essential need for security. This strategy is not just monstrous for the Palestinian people. It may well mean that the Israelis themselves have a nightmarish future in store. How can they expect docile Palestinian leaders and a consenting population to emerge, as if by a miracle, from such a collapse? He who sows despair, reaps violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Palestinian society is in danger of concluding that playing the game of democracy has brought them nothing but more misfortune. Faced with such a challenge, is the European Union going to let the Palestinian institutions that it has spent 12 years helping to create be destroyed? Is it going to abandon the Palestinian President in the middle of this turmoil, when, together with the head of the government, he has just achieved something that nobody dared hope for, that is the conclusion of an agreement recognising Israel and opening up the way to a government of national unity?</p>
<p class="contents">Or is it going to have the will and the courage, which I have not noticed on the part of the Council – something I regret – to make its mark by demanding the release of the Hamas leaders, by re-establishing appropriate aid and active cooperation with the Palestinian authority and government, and stating clearly the obligations of all States without exception according to international law and the Geneva Conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is in this area, and from this moment on, that Europe is going to be staking much of the credibility of the Euro-Mediterranean project and its credibility as a global player in general.</p>

It is a situation that is becoming more serious by the day and one that is in danger of turning into an international crisis and, even before that, into a humanitarian crisis. I think that it is only right to begin with the words of the Pope, who has launched an appeal for the release of all of the kidnap victims and for negotiations to be held between Israelis and Palestinians, with the decisive contribution of the international community, and especially of Europe, in favour of a restoration of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">At this tragic time, in fact, only dialogue and a cessation of the hostilities by both parties can stop the unacceptable escalation of violence. We welcomed the agreement between Fatah and Hamas on the prisoners’ document, which implicitly acknowledges Israel’s existence, but much more progress needs to be made, starting with the release of the Israeli soldier.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has done well to launch an immediate appeal, with one voice, for moderation and peace, but more courage and more determination are required. The international community must genuinely take the lead and assume full responsibility for becoming the guarantor of peace in the Middle East, by putting a stop to the violence and bringing Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like once again to cite the Pope, who has reaffirmed Israel's legitimate right to exist, in peace, but who has subsequently appealed for the international community to genuinely support the people of Palestine so that they can overcome the precarious conditions in which they are living and can build a future for themselves, with the ultimate aim of building an actual State.</p>

<p class="contents">A second question to the Council and Commission concerns the functioning of European monitoring on the border between Egypt and Gaza at Rafah.

We cannot sit idly by and watch.</p>

Each time there is a positive development towards peace, some extremist elements make sure they undermine it by an action such as the ambush in which two soldiers died and one was abducted. We condemn any terrorist acts and we demand the release of the Israeli soldier.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it must also be said that the Israeli side always falls into this trap. With their excessive and disproportionate use of force they are destroying all the positive developments toward the peace that they themselves are seeking. They say that their aim is to spare innocent civilians. However, by destroying power stations and preventing normal irrigation – thereby leaving several million people without electricity and water – they are punishing not only innocent civilians but also the European taxpayer whose money has contributed to the building of the infrastructure and who, most probably and quite rightly, will be asked to repair it again.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, our call is for both sides to respect the political, democratic process and to abandon violence as a means of imposing their political objectives on each other. The fight against terror should not be an excuse for Israel to overturn a democratic political decision taken by the Palestinian people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The further that operation progresses, the darker that cloud becomes! The summer rains that are flooding Gaza are not just pointless. They are above all entirely illegitimate. It is not legitimate to deprive 750 000 people of electricity, it is not legitimate to call upon 20 000 people to leave their homes in order to turn their town into a ghost town. It is not legitimate to penetrate Syrian airspace. It is not legitimate to kidnap a quarter of a government and a quarter of a parliament. A State acting in that way is no better than a terrorist organisation. These are not my words, they are those of a Jewish man, Mr Levy, this week on Haaretz.com. If the voices of reason are speaking out in Israel to condemn these crimes, why is the Council struck down dumb?</p>
<p class="contents">Its communiqué of 3 July does not go as far as that of Switzerland or Turkey! The European Union, which spent EUR 3 000 000 on observing the Palestinian elections, has been slow in reacting to the kidnapping of 64 members of the government and of the democratically-elected legislative Council, and is not calling for their immediate release.</p>
<p class="contents">The shelling of Gaza, the destruction of an electrical power station, the cutting off of water, are not causing any outcry. Despite the increasing numbers of deaths and the cycle of violence that is re-emerging, we are not hearing anybody say: enough, enough, enough! Stop this carnage, you have gone mad! Yes, I condemn the firing of Kassam rockets, yes, I want to see the release of the soldier Gilad, but I also want to see the release of the 339 Palestinian children held in Israeli prisons. If a soldier’s life is sacred, then so are the lives of children.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, however, I am amazed that the European Union has not yet welcomed – though I would thank the Commissioner for doing so today – the historic step of the agreement on the document of the prisoners. Six months after the elections, Hamas and Islamic Jihad committed themselves implicitly to recognising Israel and to stopping the violence outside the territories. Not a word was said here though, just a deafening silence! Our humanitarian aid – and I support the Commissioner – is just about going to keep Palestine going. Yet is it still our ambition to help the Palestinian State to build its democracy? I put that question to the Council. Stop this scandal and ensure that international law is adhered to!</p>

The Israeli Prime Minister says that the lives of Israelis are more important than those of Palestinians.

Apparently the whole world should know that he, as Chairman of the Delegation for Relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, ‘calls upon the international community to provide protection for civilian lives in Gaza’. Well how, precisely? What is he going to do – stand in the middle of the street with a tin hat on his head? Fortunately, a Google news search shows that there has been no response to the suggestion at all.</p>
<p class="contents">All I can suggest now – and there have been some very strong speeches made here – is that we take a check on reality. The tragic truth is this: if Hamas continues to bomb, to kill, to maim and now to kidnap, then Israel will respond. Those who are burying their heads in the sand had better recognise that, or more tragedy will ensue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot compare terrorism with Israel’s military decisions, or with the human rights violations that we do nonetheless condemn, but if Hamas' decision-making powers are in the hands of the media-dependent butchers from Syria and Iran, what can the MEPs’ feeble requests to the Hamas government accomplish?</p>

Coming on the back of the cold-blooded murder of a civilian settler and the continuing firing of Qassam rockets from Gaza on to Israeli civilian areas, Prime Minister Olmert had no choice but to launch the limited surgical intervention by the IDF. I too now call for Corporal Shalit’s immediate release.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I oppose any funding of a Hamas-led Palestinian Authority Government unless it renounces violence, disarms and recognises the right of the State of Israel to exist. Regrettably, the joint Hamas declaration with Fatah of 27 June, allegedly implicitly recognising Israel, reportedly remains an ambiguous document and Hamas does not clearly renounce violence.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, millions of euros of our taxpayers’ money have been donated in aid to the Palestinian Authority with little to show for it in terms of securing a lasting peace as envisaged in Oslo in 1993. Instead, there has been widespread corruption. I personally, although accepting the democratic victory of Hamas – after all, Hitler was also elected democratically – continue to regard it as a banned terrorist organisation, as does the European Union and the USA, and therefore would never countenance supporting any funds for it until it convincingly changes its charter and terrorist ideology.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent Passover suicide bombing in Tel Aviv was publicly supported by the Hamas PA Government, which is an outrage. Nevertheless, the European Union, through the Quartet, must remain committed to lasting peace in the Middle East with a two-state solution whereby a viable, democratic Palestinian State can live in peace and security side by side with Israel within internationally recognised borders. I join all parties in this House in urging that Israel – the IDF in particular – Hamas and all the people involved in these ghastly events respect international law and avoid further bloodshed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In what way does the present picture of terror and violence differ from the others? The fact that the violence and crimes of the abductors and murderers of an Israeli lad, and the many victims of the attacks have not been condemned by the democratically elected Palestinian Authority. In fact, Hamas took the side of those who spread violence and terror. It happened just after the new Israeli Government was sworn in, and to each action there is a reaction. The Israeli authorities responded to this criminal act by military action. Today’s scenarios have not been scripted by the Prime Minister of Israel and the President of the Palestinian Authority, who have attempted to keep the dialogue open, but by the Iranian President and Hamas extremists brought in from Damascus and terrorists of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to the Council and Commission to bring greater pressure to bear on both sides in this conflict, but particularly on the Palestinian Authority. It must be remembered that to renew the peace process, that government appointed by Hamas must recognise the state of Israel, renounce violence and abide by all agreements signed so far, which it has not yet done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yes, the Israeli army is back in Gaza, yes, the Palestinians are in a dramatic humanitarian situation, the victims of the murderous deadlock into which they have been led by Hamas. We certainly support the emergency aid announced by the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, the Israeli reaction which has deprived half of the inhabitants of Gaza of water and electricity is disproportionate. Nevertheless, Israel has no intention of reoccupying Gaza. This great crisis could end tomorrow if the terrorist movements were to release the young soldier captured and stop firing rockets into Israeli territory, like the one last night on a school in Sderot.</p>
<p class="contents">One constant concern is the possibility of the conflict in the region undergoing a sort of ‘iraqisation’: kidnappings and executions of hostages, such as that of 18-year-old Eliahou Asheri, which hardly anybody has mentioned, who was shot in the head because he was hitch-hiking in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="contents">Only a return to diplomacy will control this radicalisation and extremism, this policy of making things worse in order to achieve one’s ends. France and Egypt are currently in the best position to find a solution which I hope will be imminent for Gilad Shalit and for the Palestinian people. I would like to reassure Mr Davies by stressing here that, for each of us in this House, a Palestinian life is worth as much as an Israeli life. I believe that it is extremely unfair and inappropriate to put words into our mouths like that.</p>

I believe that the situation is much worse today than a year ago, because we no longer know whom to help and how. On the one hand we have a physical barrier, and then we have an armed barrier (soldiers, passport control), which led to the destruction of a power station and bridges. Another new political barrier has also appeared, in the form of the elected Hamas government, and all that it entails in political terms. Then there are also the people, the ordinary citizens, whom we do not know how to help. It is a fairly simple rule that hunger and frustration lead to aggression, and aggression is the food on which terrorism, and possibly even a potential war, thrives.</p>

<p class="contents">Since the suspension of that aid, has the Hamas Government made the slightest progress in terms of recognising the State of Israel? Has it finally decided to condemn the attacks?

<p class="contents">We are once again in a cycle of violence in which wrong is clearly being done by both sides; rockets fired into Israel, disproportionate reprisals by the Israeli army, the seizing of the soldier Shalit, who of course must be released, as everybody here has said.</p>

Moreover, as the Minister responsible for development cooperation, I think that the deteriorating humanitarian situation is especially serious, as I said in my opening speech, considering that the situation was not very good even before this latest phase of the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">This conflict is a huge challenge for the European Union, and the Council is firmly committed to supporting every means to find a solution to it. At the same time we have to bear in mind that the parties involved hold the keys to solving the crisis.

<p class="contents">The Council issued its latest statement on 30 June: it did not waste any time. As I see it, the position taken is a very balanced one, unlike what has been suggested in some of the speeches here. The Council wishes to stress that, to ease the crisis, both sides must take the necessary adequate action. We regard it as vital that the captured Israeli soldier is released, but also just as vital that Israel puts an end to this military operation and that both sides act in compliance with international law.

It is a vicious circle. I also understand the reactions in Israel to the kidnapping of Corporal Shalit. He must be released unharmed. It is true that the Syrian part of Hamas has a great responsibility here. The Qassam rocket attacks from northern Gaza into Israel must stop. However, the Israeli military incursion into the Gaza Strip and the destruction of the civilian infrastructure there punishes Palestinians collectively and puts civilian lives at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">That raises questions about respect for international law. Is it really in Israel’s long-term interest? Does it not threaten to reinforce this vicious circle of poverty and extremism? Electricity and water supplies must now be restored quickly and with Israeli assistance. The arrest of elected law-makers threatens the institutions of the Palestinian Authority that are needed for the creation of an independent, democratic and viable Palestinian State.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has expressed particular concerns about the detention of these elected members of the Palestinian Government and legislature and those detained must be accorded full legal rights. All sides must exercise restraint.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year I spoke of the need to hope for prospects in the peace process in the wake of Israel’s disengagement from Gaza and the G8 plan to revive the Palestinian economy. How different the situation looks today. Yet, I think it is possible to step back. Therefore we will remain committed to a negotiated two-state solution and we will not recognise any change to the pre-1967 borders other than those agreed by both sides. We welcome President Abbas’s efforts to create the widest possible Palestinian consensus in support of the objectives of the roadmap and we want to have continued support. We are ready to work with any Palestinian government that renounces violence, recognises Israel and respects previous agreements as set out by the Quartet.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to consider Mr Brok’s suggestion of going there as a Quartet and seeing what we can do. We have reiterated our commitment to a negotiated, comprehensive, just and lasting settlement in the Middle East. The common goal of the G8 remains the creation of a viable, democratic and sovereign Israel and Palestine living in peace and security. We want to achieve that and therefore we want to continue our efforts, even at the most difficult times.</p>

This criminal military action forms part of a long-planned Israeli strategy to destroy the Palestinian Authority, its institutions and its structures, including those that meet the people’s most basic needs. Israel’s strategy is to annexe occupied territories – as evidenced by the building of the wall – and to undermine the conditions required for building a sovereign, independent and viable Palestinian state.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why solidarity is needed towards the PLO and the Palestinian people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All humane individuals want to see the Israeli soldier who has been taken hostage released safe and well. However, his abduction should not be used by Israel as an excuse for extreme action in Gaza and the West Bank. I urge Israel to keep all its actions in line with international law. The humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories must be addressed urgently. Electricity should immediately be restored to all homes, medical supplies provided and food shortages addressed. Both parties should be encouraged to take measures to build mutual confidence and reduce tension. A clear statement from both sides that a negotiated two-state solution is the only viable future for the region would go a long way to improving the present situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
