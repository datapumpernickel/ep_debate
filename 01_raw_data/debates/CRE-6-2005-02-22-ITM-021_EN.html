<p class="contents">One of the arguments we hear put forward most frequently by those who challenge the need for a common fisheries policy relates to the volume of fish which the existing regulations encourage EU fishermen to discard, and which will not survive their capture anyway most of the time. As you are well aware, this problem has been a source of concern to our committee for many years, and has prompted your Commission, with our agreement, to arrange for several hundred studies to be carried out, with the aim of finding a solution if possible. It is also the reason behind my oral question to you, which I ask on behalf of the committee that I have the honour of chairing. As I stated in the question, by-catch is a global problem and remains one of the principal fisheries issues not to be addressed at present by an International Plan of Action by the FAO or by any other body.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an urgent need to adopt an International Plan of Action on by-catch reduction, which could play a pivotal role in reducing by-catch internationally. A great many leading marine scientists and NGOs advocate the adoption of such a plan, and several member nations of the FAO have already committed to supporting such a proposal at the next meeting of the FAO Committee on Fisheries in March 2005. As yet, no nation has pledged to take a lead in proposing this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the European Union is a major fishing power, is the European Commission therefore committed to taking a lead in proposing an International Plan of Action on by-catch reduction? Does the Commission recognise that if an International Plan of Action is not put on the FAO agenda in 2005, it will be necessary to wait for the next session in 2007? I should like to thank the Commissioner for having agreed to be present to answer both this question and the other questions my fellow Members will ask. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is fitting that we have an exchange of views in Plenary in advance of the opening of the FAO Committee on Fisheries, which is meeting on 7 March. I note that this issue has already been raised in the question submitted by Mrs Attwooll and Mr Davies on behalf of the ALDE Group, to which a written response has been provided, and that I have had the opportunity of replying to a recent letter from Mrs Attwooll in the same vein.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate that I share your concerns on the severity of the by-catch problem and on the need to take action, both at Community and international level, to address it. There is already a considerable <span class="italic">acquis</span> on specific by-catch issues dealt with in various international agreements and other instruments, including standing international action plans. The Community contributes actively to the development and implementation of this <span class="italic">acquis</span>, which particularly concerns species that are caught in the course of fishing operations, such as seabirds, sharks, marine mammals and sea turtles.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I agree with you that to reduce by-catch and discards of non-target species, there is considerable room for improved international co-operation, and the figures mentioned illustrate the magnitude of the problem and the urgency with which the matter should be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the scope of its powers, the Community is already taking action under the common fisheries policy on a number of fronts. Specific measures were reported in the Commission’s reply to the written question submitted by Mr Davies in November 2003 on the by-catch associated with shrimp fisheries. These include: the Action Plan on discards; financial incentives for the use of selective fishing gear under Council Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999; a specific three-year research project under the 6th Framework Programme to develop low-impact, species-selective fishing gears, and to formulate alternative fishing tactics; the setting of by-catch quotas in bilateral fisheries partnership agreements; the obligations to monitor discards for specific stocks set forth in the Data Collection Regulation. Regular efforts are also made to integrate by-catch reduction measures in Community regulations establishing fishing limits through TACs, effort limitations and technical measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is thus convinced of the need to promote a global, comprehensive strategy to deal with the problems posed by by-catch and discards, since such an analysis lies at the core of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. It is important that an internationally agreed set of principles is established that should not only build on the existing international <span class="italic">acquis</span>, but go on to integrate and further develop the ecosystem approach in worldwide fisheries management.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Commission is ready to support the development of an international action plan on by-catch and will seek Member States' agreement to convey this position to the FAO and its members during the forthcoming Committee on Fisheries (COFI) meeting, in particular at the time that COFI’s work programme in the short and medium term is discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would be prepared to take the lead in the formulation and development of such an initiative if the necessary extra resources required to tackle such a work-intensive task can be made available to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we see from this oral question, the situation is not unique to the EU. It is a worldwide problem and the Commission can offer leadership on the issue by proposing an international plan of action. I am delighted that this evening the Commissioner has said that he is willing to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we need to take action within the EU. It is estimated that fishermen discard up to 2 million tonnes of dead fish into the sea every year within EU waters as a result of high grading or simply because the fish are undersized or out of quota. We have forced fishermen into this destructive and unsustainable behaviour in the name of conservation, so one of the first policies we have to pursue is to insist on all fish being landed. There should be tough penalties for anyone caught discarding fish. This is the policy in Iceland, Norway and the Faroes.</p>
<p class="contents">By insisting on everything being landed, the scientists get a much more accurate picture of the size and nature of the catch, enabling more accurate stock recovery measures to be put in place and more rapid action to be taken to close areas where juveniles are being caught. I am well aware that to implement such a dramatic reversal of policy will require sticks and carrots: sticks to hit those who offend and continue to dump dead fish, but carrots by way of financial compensation to the fishermen who land fish they would otherwise have thrown over the side.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should not panic: it will not have to pay. The fishmeal and fish oil industry are desperate for more raw material. I hope that the unjustified ban on feeding fishmeal to ruminants will soon be lifted, thereby increasing demand. The expanding aquaculture industry is also a major user of fishmeal, so the fishmeal industry will be happy to pay for this material at prices of perhaps up to EUR 70 per tonne. I understand the Commission is keen on this idea and has already identified two trawlers to try out the policy. I applaud Commissioner Borg for this initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the context of declining fish stocks, the problem of by-catch is all the more regrettable. According to the most recent figures from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, 7.3 million tonnes of non-target marine species are discarded globally each year as a result of unselective fishing practices. This figure is truly shocking, and is not far below the EU 15's entire landed fish production in 2002-2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Discarding fish has various consequences: biological consequences because the majority are dead or moribund; and economic consequences because small fish produce less profit if sold, and no profit at all if they are discarded and therefore never grow because they are dead. In stock assessment and fisheries management, where discards are an unknown quantity, fishing mortality rates are also unknown quantities.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2003 the European Parliament adopted an own-initiative report, drafted by Nils Busk, on the Commission action plan to reduce fish discards. The report made many useful suggestions to improve on the Commission's strategy for dealing with the problem of discards. These included calling for adequate data collection to obtain a better, more precise picture of the extent of the problem; finding ways of rewarding those fleets employing more selective fishing gear, resulting in lower discards; and monitoring research findings on alternative fishing gear with a view to improving technical measures such as net mesh sizes and windows. It also asked the Commission to examine how regional advisory councils might be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the initiatives taken by the Commission on technical measures in recent years. Over the past 10 years the EU budget has contributed EUR 8 million annually to over 400 research projects aimed at increasing gear selectivity, reducing discards or quantifying the impact of fishing on the environment. It is vital that the focus now shifts to by-catch reduction measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the Commission recognises that by-catch is a global problem. The next meeting of the Food and Agriculture Organization's committee on fisheries in March 2005 offers a valuable opportunity to propose an FAO international plan of action. I welcome the Commissioner's desire to work on this issue and take a lead. Commissioner, I urge you to not allow the opportunity to slip away, because the next meeting is not until 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are particularly grateful that he is willing to raise the issue at the meeting of the FAO Committee in March. For, as has already been said, without agreement there in principle, the formulation of any international plan of action would have to wait for another two years.</p>
<p class="contents">By-catch is a global problem that requires a genuinely global solution, a genuinely global commitment to tackling it. As Mrs Stihler has said, the FAO data estimates the extent of the problem at 7.3 million tonnes a year.</p>
<p class="contents">An international plan of action would not, of course, be the first or only attempt to tackle the problem. Much valuable work is already being done both within and outside the EU. This tends to involve a piecemeal focus on specific fisheries or specific by-catch species. An integrated approach would help support and extend the success of such schemes and crucially prevent displacement of the problem from one area, or species, to another. It makes real sense for the EU to be at the forefront of promoting such an integrated approach. After all, our vessels fish far beyond EU waters. Our actions impact on others as, of course, do the actions of others on us.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, too, that our citizens, like so many citizens across the globe, feel a real sense of responsibility for the stewardship of natural resources. Putting the EU at the forefront of action to prevent this particular kind of wastage would be welcomed by them. I look forward to hearing of the progress made at the meeting and whilst I cannot make any promises as to the outcome, am ready to try to persuade my colleagues to give favourable consideration to any substantiated request from the Commission for a temporary transfer of budgetary resources to allow them to participate fully in the drawing up of such an international plan of action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No one gains anything from by-catches, and we are obliged to find methods of reducing them. When it is caught as by-catch, fishermen are forced to discard splendid cod caught in quantities over and above given quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">The rules must be laid down in such a way that no fish may be caught before it has had time to reproduce itself at least once. In the case of certain species, an increased minimum size can bring about a win-win situation in which, in the long term, we increase reproduction, the biomass and catches. We must therefore ensure that, where nets are concerned, mesh sizes are adjusted in accordance with these minimum sizes.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it is time to devote more attention to by-catch of non-commercial fish. Internationally, there is growing opposition to these catches, especially of cute marine mammals, but also of other species. The rules have been focused upon commercial species but, in the interests of the biosystems and of the commercial species’ health, we must conserve and protect the non-commercial species too. Greater selectivity and research into ways of reducing these by-catches are necessary. In this context, it is important to remember that trying to avoid a species should not lead to increased by-catch of another species. If we do not find solutions to these problems, our oceans will soon be as empty as this House is at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to say, however, that, to my mind, so-called by-catch is, more than anything, a problem of civilisation. I find it utterly barbaric that millions of tons of wild animals are fished for no reason whatsoever. This is death for death’s sake, death by bureaucratic rules and by the industrial mindset that finds it cheaper to kill more and use less, on the grounds that nature has no value whatsoever. The crux of the matter is that we must respect nature. Like every other living being, we naturally use nature and what we do is legitimate, but we must respect nature. There can be no sustainable fishing without respect for nature and this is perhaps the greatest demonstration of the negative side of our common fisheries policy. Furthermore, as has been mentioned in this House, all we have to do is to look at our neighbours in Norway and Iceland, where this practice is in fact banned, and I am appalled that we do not follow their lead.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the Commission is taking this position in the FAO, but, as has been said here, we must not forget the two million tonnes that are discarded every year. I should like to remind you, Commissioner, of the following: not long ago this House adopted a ban on bottom trawling, which is an extremely unselective method – the Commission itself acknowledges this – it is a highly predatory method and causes the highest by-catch rate. There has been such a ban in the Azores for a very long time, where the practice had never previously existed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission did not wish to know about this and imposed – or, was in favour of re-imposing – liberalisation of this kind of fishing in the waters off the Azores. This is a practical demonstration of an attitude that flies in the face of what was said earlier, because before we speak at the FAO, I believe it essential that we ensure good practice within the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will group the interventions into four points.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the by-catch problem being a worldwide problem and the question of the Commission taking leadership. As I said in my original response, we are willing to do so but we have to have the necessary resources made available to us because this will be a mammoth task. We will be taking the matter up with the Council in the very short term.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the forthcoming FAO meeting, the Commission, as I said before, is ready to support the development of an international plan of action on by-catch and again we will seek Member States' agreement to convey this position to FAO and its members during the forthcoming Committee on Fisheries meeting, in particular when the work programme for the short and medium-term will be discussed. With regard to discards, we are actively considering this problem and hopefully we will be coming up with specific proposals soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point concerned declining fish stocks and by-catch being all the more regrettable as a result. Here I would like to say that one way in which the Commission tries to reduce discards is by improving selectivity by technical measures such as enforcing minimum mesh sizes or closed areas which can limit the catches of juveniles. Other measures such as the use of separator trawls or separator grids can reduce the by-catch of non-target species.</p>
<p class="contents">Well-applied technical measures can be effective but they are not without problems. For example, it is difficult to find the appropriate mesh size in mixed fisheries. The minimum mesh size needed to protect juvenile cod, for example, would be too big to catch adult haddock and whiting. Nevertheless technical measures have a part to play.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to revise completely the technical measures regulation in 2005 to follow up its communication on environmentally-friendly fishing. To deal with mixed fisheries the Commission tries to propose TACs to take into account associations between species. This is difficult to do but steps in this direction have already been taken. The Commission has asked ISIS to give its advice on a fisheries basis rather than on a single stock basis. These are the first steps in adopting an ecosystem approach to fisheries management.</p>
<p class="contents">Another approach advocated by the Commission is to manage the fisheries through effort control rather than rely on individual TACs. In principle it could be used instead of TACs, with fishermen allowed to land all catches, but in practice effort control will usually complement rather than replace TACs.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of 2002 the Commission presented a discard action plan which discussed the problems of discards more fully and the ways in which the problem could be tackled. Following up this plan, the Commission will consult with Member States and the industry during 2005 with a view to initiating a number of pilot projects to eliminate or at least reduce discards in selected fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerning RACs is that they can be involved and certainly we find no problem in involving RACS in giving advice on the formulation of such plans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
