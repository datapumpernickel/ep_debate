<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gebhardt (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, part of the price of freedom is that the democratic state under the rule of law frequently chases wrongdoers from quite some distance when it wishes to prosecute them. This is especially true of serious, very serious and cross-border crimes. Organised crime is particularly difficult to bring under control because the odds are stacked unevenly. The perpetrators are ruthless and know nothing of borders, restrictions or rules. Their pursuers are, for good reason, bound by the procedures of the rule of law. I may paint a gloomy picture, but we do have reason for hope. The European Union is making progress in the fight against serious crime. It has a good chance of catching up with many wrongdoers and meting out to them the punishments which they deserve. The public can demand this; above all it expects it in an increasingly homogeneous area of law and freedom, which also offers them protection and security for their material property.</p>
<p class="contents">A step in the right direction, for which the European Parliament has been striving for a long time now, is the creation of a provisional unit for judicial cooperation. In my opinion, the adjective ‘provisional’ should disappear as soon as possible and make way for Eurojust as an effective European prosecution body. The German Justice Minister initiated this; it was at her suggestion that the Tampere Summit decided to establish Eurojust over a year ago. Since then, Portugal, France, Sweden and Belgium have driven the project forward with their initiative to establish a provisional unit for judicial cooperation. The Tampere mandate is to reinforce, through Eurojust, the Member States’ cooperation in the fight against organised crime. Prosecutors, magistrates and police officers seconded from the Member States should work in a cross-border capacity to coordinate the national public prosecution services and assist criminal investigations in cases of organised crime. The unit is expected to cooperate closely with Europol and the European Judicial Network.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I actually only had one additional request. Cooperation should not be limited only to organised crime. In the interests of the public it must cover the entire spectrum of serious and cross-border crime. That is why I have proposed to extend the legal base by adding Article 29 of the Treaty on European Union. The committee responsible has gone along with me on this and I am pleased to say that the signals coming from the Council are also positive.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be in agreement in one further respect too. The provisional unit, which we are now debating, can only be the first step on a road which leads via Eurojust to a genuine European public prosecution service. This is not only necessary from an organisational point of view so as to ensure that we are able to tackle serious crime together. It is also necessary to uphold the rule of law. Overall the task is so great and so important that it cannot be overseen by the Council alone. In addition to the Council’s decision in Tampere, we need the expertise and experience of the Commission and the political will of the European Parliament. If the Council, the Commission and Parliament act in unison, the end result will be considerable added value in terms of law and security for the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Tampere decision and the initiative of the four Member States constitute a good starting point. Let us continue to work together on this basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Palacio Vallelersundi (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party, I should like to warmly congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on the way in which she has drawn up this report and also to reiterate something she has said: we hope the word ‘provisional’ can soon be dropped from the name of this Eurojust unit.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, if I may link this debate to the previous one, we obviously have here another example of how this area of freedom, security and justice has grown lopsided. Area of freedom, but the freedoms, the guarantees for citizens are practically unheard of. The area of security is much more developed, with the growth of Europol over the years, to which we have today added the fight against organised crime; but this is the repressive function of the State. We have yet to develop the justice aspect – and this is now urgent – for it is the only way of counterbalancing this repressive function of the State with the function of administering justice or, as Mrs Gebhardt has so rightly said, of giving European citizens fundamental judicial security.</p>
<p class="contents">The Gebhardt report places special emphasis on these three points. It sets out greater guarantees, that is, it goes towards creating this area of freedoms, as shown by Amendment No 3 or Amendment No 5, which ensure that the personal details of citizens, of the accused, of defendants are protected with the greatest care; and Amendment No 10, which ensures that only where the legislation of a Member State so permits may a police officer form part of this initial unit. This is the sense of the guarantees: to push forward this aspect of freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">But Mrs Gebhardt’s amendments also go towards improving effectiveness: being more effective, more reasonably effective. One example is her Amendment No 9, which moves that, in future, this initiative should be taken into account in the final decisions made on the Eurojust unit.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I believe there is an intention that we should be more consistent with this call to create an area of freedom, security and justice. This idea comes across quite clearly in the Gebhardt report. Thus, there are changes that will seem to many to be simply a matter of appearance, but in which the words betray what lies behind them: instead of contributing within the framework of respect there is an insistence on close collaboration; instead of coordination, there is talk of joint action: the report goes that one step further.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we come back again to the previous debate. If we are to develop this area we have to establish or strengthen that mutual trust between the States which allowed us to lay down common rules in the internal market. This mutual trust now has to take a further leap, and I realise it is a qualitative leap from the viewpoint of national cultures. This mutual trust has to reach this area of justice and go on from there to mutual recognition. There cannot be mutual recognition if there is no mutual trust between States on which to found it. In the previous debate a moment ago, Commissioner Vitorino highlighted it very well by calling it by its name: reasons of State. Countries must not exclude cooperation within the European Union by invoking reasons of State; they will have to treat each other equally. Moreover, this is the purpose of extrapolating the principles that have served to construct the internal market: no discrimination on grounds of nationality. If, according to the state of which we are nationals we give certain information to a national judge, then clearly if we want to be consistent with the idea of developing this area of freedom, security and justice we must also give it to a judge in the European Union when we are asked for it, because this is the only way we are going to mould this mutual trust between the States in a manner that reaches the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in conclusion, I believe this is one step, a timid step, which we hope will soon be consolidated in the Eurojust network; we hope it will soon no longer be provisional but will become a permanent network. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, how can one possibly set up a European public prosecution service when there is not even a European civil code or, what is more, a European criminal code?</p>
<p class="contents">Even if this circumstance presents no direct obstacle to the initiative on the creation of Eurojust, there is in fact one institution over which the European Parliament exercises no control and over which judicial control by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, pursuant to Article 35 of the Treaty, is not applied. How could one possibly consider setting up Eurojust when Europol is already operating as a free agent?</p>
<p class="contents">Two things must be borne in mind: we cannot contemplate any tangible improvement in judicial cooperation between the Member States without this clearly being conditional on the protection of the rights of the defence in legal proceedings involving more than one State. This is the aim of our amendments. It follows that citizens’ rights must be reinforced by adopting an effective instrument and recognising the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice, not least with regard to its right of interpretation and its power to decide on a case or not.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the flaws in the new efforts to combat organised crime can be attributed to the division of competences between Europol and Eurojust, and these have not been clearly addressed in any case or at any point. Well, as you know, the issue of competence and the limits on this competence are central to this Community harmonisation aimed at improving the justice system.</p>
<p class="contents">The clear allocation of fields of intervention to either judicial cooperation or police cooperation is not only needed to prevent any conflict of responsibilities, but is also fundamental in terms of guaranteeing observance of the democratic rules that form the bedrock of the rule of law. The Member States of the European Community subscribe to these on the basis of their existing legislative, executive and legal systems, in accordance with the principle of fundamental rights and common values. Eurojust must therefore slot into the relationship between judicial cooperation and police cooperation. The European Parliament is the supranational Community body that can determine this relationship, and I therefore propose that you support its validity by showing support for our rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We in the European Union have been moving more and more towards closer cooperation and coordination, as Mrs Palacio has already stated, in areas such as the single market and environment. However, there have been difficulties in the whole area of police and judicial affairs, in particular because of fear or lack of trust with regard to the efficiency or the ability of individual police forces or individual judicial networks to deal with the volume of crime which is now being highlighted at a cross-border level. Therefore, one of the proposals coming forward from the Tampere Summit was the establishment of Eurojust.</p>
<p class="contents">While I have no difficulty whatsoever in allowing our judges and legal experts in Member States to exchange information, to cooperate, to meet and to understand each other’s practices, I have difficulty with the final conclusion of this whole debate which will be the appointment of a European public prosecutor.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though we are assured that a European public prosecutor’s remit will be limited, that does not mean that would be the end of the story, because we have differing legal systems within the European Union. For instance, in Ireland and the UK our criminal code is based on the common law system whereas it is the old Roman law or civil law code in most other European countries. There are huge differences there which are exemplified on a daily basis in Europol and Interpol where there is a lack of certainty and difficulties between the Member State police forces with regard to what can be done and what can be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also worries within Member States as I know from an Irish point of view: I have dealt with sixteen cases of people who have been detained in Spain. We could not get any action from Europol or from Interpol operators in that country and there was a lack of understanding of the necessity for somebody to be brought to trial as quickly as possible. Therefore, whilst I support more cooperation and coordination, I think making this a legislative system would be wrong and we would oppose it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I omit the word ‘freedom’ in consideration of the attitude of the Council and the Member States – I repeat, of the Council and the Member States – in strengthening Europe’s repressive framework, aided and abetted by Parliament which, lacking the due dignity of an institution elected by the citizens, is willing to endorse these proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the Members of the Bonino List do not wish to support the Council’s strategy which continues to be hidden behind proposals which appear to be minimalist but which lay the foundations for a genuine European legal, criminal and procedural system, but a system which is also a police system, a system of European repression: a system built on Eurojust and the European public prosecutor, the European legal network, Europol and the task force of the heads of police, the <span class="italic">corpus juris</span>, the European Anti-Fraud Office, the conventions of mutual legal assistance, Enfopol etc., in this infinite bureaucratic web which is in itself antidemocratic. Like Mrs Palacio, we hope that the provisional unit for judicial cooperation will soon cease to be provisional, but we Radical Members are not prepared to repeat our experience with Europol, when the establishment of the drugs unit led to the creation of a continually changing and expanding superbody which was out of the democratic control of national and European parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, are you sure that the European citizens, the national parliaments and you yourselves wish to pursue a functionalist strategy in the areas of justice and security, one of the pillars of democracy? Are you not afraid that, when all is said and done, Europe will trample upon the freedoms and rights of the citizens rather than guaranteeing and increasing them?</p>
<p class="contents">We have tabled a single amendment to this report, calling upon the Council to define more clearly the European area of justice which it intends to develop and, in particular, the level of harmonisation of the rules of criminal and procedural law which it intends to achieve, the institutions and bodies which it intends to create and their powers and responsibilities and the type of cooperation to be established between them, the democratic control to be provided for and, finally, the rights and freedoms which will be guaranteed to citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Only when the institutional model and the rules governing the European area of justice are clearly defined will it be possible for citizens and Parliament to express their opinions on the individual measures proposed by the Council. Unless a course is set towards a specific objective which is clear for all, in our opinion, the Union is destined to go adrift both institutionally and democratically.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of these considerations, we Members of the Emma Bonino List, in the name of European liberal and democratic federalist values, will vote against this proposal and the related report. We will also be voting against a number of other proposals and reports over the course of this part-session. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The explanatory statement is very precise in describing what is happening at the moment, namely that judicial cooperation is being institutionalised or, to put it more accurately, that there is a trend towards supranationalism in this area. It is, as the report says very precisely, “a forerunner of a future European public prosecution service designed to strengthen the European Union’s judicial dimension in relation to criminal law”, and reference is made to the drafting of EU criminal law with attendant institutions, police service, prosecution service, administration of justice, etc. which, for example, were adopted in connection with Mr Wiebenga’s report in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">In two areas, however, crucial mistakes are being made, first of all when it comes to the very process of making criminal law into a supranational affair. Systems of criminal law are, of course, among the clearest cultural expressions of a society. What we have here is a conflict of legal cultures, for there is not just one European criminal law and not just one European ideology relating to crime policy. There are fifteen of them. By incorporating – or institutionalising – these projects into the European Union’s various bureaucracies, an élite and non-transparent system arises which is, on many points, in conflict with elementary ideals relating to democracy and legal rights. The second point is also interesting, of course. A number of very crucial initiatives are undoubtedly being taken towards establishing a United States of Europe. Interestingly enough, the heading reads: “The establishment of Eurojust as a means of upholding the rule of law.” What rule of law is being talked about here? Has the EU become a State? Yes, it is on the way to becoming one, for the ambition, as expressed so clearly in the last paragraph of the first part of the explanatory statement, is precisely that the European Union must establish “independent legislative, executive and judiciary” bodies “with counterbalancing powers”, that is to say the hallmarks of a State. For both these reasons, my own group cannot be expected to cooperate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must be founded upon common values and have broad political support.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal to set up an initial provisional Eurojust unit is largely to be welcomed. In this way, the Council has taken a first step towards institutionalising the process of judicial cooperation, something which the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats has been demanding for a long time. It is essential, if the rule of law is to be upheld, for judicial cooperation in criminal matters to be developed in line with the competences of Europol. By strengthening the fight against serious organised crime, Eurojust is therefore a logical step in the efforts to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The provisional unit’s main tasks ought to be that of ensuring better coordination between the national prosecution authorities and that of supporting criminal investigations in cases involving organised crime. In view of the proposed unit’s remit, there must be close and clearly regulated cooperation with Europol in order to avoid duplication of effort and conflicts over the respective responsibilities of those involved. Setting up the provisional unit is only a first step. The rapporteur appreciates that setting up the second stage Eurojust ought to be that much easier in the light of the experience gained, which is a view I share.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving subsequently towards setting up a European public prosecution authority is another question to discuss. I see the role of a future European public prosecutor as being precisely and solely that of combating fraud affecting the EU’s financial interests. In view of the subsidiarity principle, I am therefore opposed to a common catalogue of criminal law and to the EU as a common judicial body in all criminal law – if anyone should happen to see any such development as being of topical relevance right now.</p>
<p class="contents">What Parliament has to adopt a position on today is vigorous judicial cooperation for the purpose of combating serious organised crime. This is a positive development, and it is therefore gratifying that there should be so much support for it in Parliament. I am particularly pleased about the initiative to strengthen the protection of personal data. I would congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on a good piece of work.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to conclude by pointing out something I think we ought not to forget. Without a certain degree of cooperation, it is simply not possible for us to uphold a law-governed society in an EU with freedom of movement. If we wish to see crime combated more efficiently, then we must also strengthen the protection of human rights, something which must be founded upon our common legal principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Her criticism that, considering the development of police cooperation, the issue of judicial cooperation should have been tackled earlier on is fair, particularly bearing in mind the enormous scale that organised and cross-border crime have reached and that this requires rapid, joint, concerted action. The creation of Eurojust is part of the European action for fighting organised crime which seeks to strengthen and guarantee the balanced development of police and judicial cooperation in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal that we have before us today, that a provisional unit for judicial cooperation should be established, must therefore be considered to be the first stage in the process of creating Eurojust. Its actions will have to improve positive and close cooperation between the competent national authorities for investigating and instituting legal proceedings when two or more Member States are involved and when the case requires joint action. The national legislation of each Member State will be respected throughout. The experience gained in running this provisional unit will serve as a basis for the drafting of the decision that will lead to the creation of Eurojust.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the increase in Europol’s powers that we all wish to see, Parliament has drawn attention to the need to ensure that democratic control is exercised. Eurojust must work, on this point too, with greater jurisdictional control. Commissioner Vitorino ended the previous debate by drawing attention to the initiative that is now underway for a measure seeking to communitise EUROPOL: we look forward most keenly to the presentation of this proposal so that we can state our opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will take the opportunity – since several Members have raised very delicate issues – to tell you quite frankly that, as Mr Coelho has just said, we primarily view this initiative as an opening initiative that demonstrates the political will of the Council to make up the ground lost in the field of judicial cooperation in comparison to police cooperation. I say to you quite candidly that I fail to understand how this initiative for judicial cooperation at the level of Eurojust can be seen as an attack on, or a threat to, the guaranteeing and protection of fundamental rights. It has to be said that either we subscribe to the democratic model with which we are familiar, one based on the division of powers, and one which recognises that the courts have supreme authority when it comes to guaranteeing individual rights, and we acknowledge that European judicial cooperation in criminal matters consists precisely of reinforcing coordination between European courts in their capacity of protectors of fundamental rights – and this is the model to which I personally subscribe – or we can choose not to subscribe to this model and, in that case, I fail to understand how one can see this initiative for developing a common judicial area as posing any threat to guarantees on fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be quite clear about this. We are not in the process of harmonising European criminal law with a sledgehammer. What the Tampere Summit required us to do was to adopt, with a view to combating cross-border crime, transnational rules in areas where it is recognised that the transnationality, or if you like the supranationality, of legal instruments constitutes added value in terms of combating illegal and criminal acts that are supranational by nature. Criminals must be left in no doubt as to this supranationality.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why when we were asked at Tampere for common rules in the field of indictment and penalties for crimes against the environment, drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, child pornography, terrorism or Internet crime, it was because it was recognised that these were types of supranational criminal activities which had to be dealt with using supranational instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">However, since with Eurojust we are talking about the coordination of national public prosecutors and judges in order to combat all forms of serious crime – and on this point I agree with the approach taken by the rapporteur – this concept is being enlarged: we are no longer talking solely about cooperation on purely transnational crimes, but also about cooperating to counteract criminal activities. Such would be the case, for example, with a criminal who commits a crime in one Member State and then seeks refuge in another Member State, as their crime has been a serious one. We are therefore entering the realms of the fight against legal<span class="bold"> </span>insecurity in global terms, but are doing so with respect not only for substantive laws, but also for national procedural laws. That implies the actions taken by every judge being in line with their national legal systems and jurisdiction for acting against and combating this type of crime falling within the national legal framework of each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that I fail to see in this the advent of a ‘Big Brother’-style European judicial system. I do not even see in it – unfortunately, I might add – the advent of a European public prosecutor, because as you know, the Commission has proposed creating the office of European public prosecutor, but not in this context or to deal with these matters. The Commission’s proposal was highly targeted and was submitted to the appropriate body: the Intergovernmental Conference. What was it that the Commission proposed? The creation of the office of European public prosecutor in order to guarantee protection of the European Community’s financial interests. In this area we can indeed talk of a European public prosecutor.</p>
<p class="contents">But as concerns Eurojust, this is a network for coordinating the actions of national judges and public prosecutors with the objective of enhancing capabilities for combating types of serious crime at European level. And this is why I also see in this an important tool for ensuring judicial control of Europol. It was, in fact, made quite clear at Tampere that Eurojust would be Europol’s judicial counterpart. That means that investigations and criminal proceedings that can count on the involvement of Europol must be flanked and followed up by Eurojust, acting as a network of judges and public prosecutors at European level. It is for this reason that the mutual relationships between Eurojust, Europol and OLAF, in its role as a specialist body for combating fraud, and the existing European judicial network must be clearly defined.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes your report, Mrs Gebhardt. I hope that Parliament will adopt it. We will have the opportunity to make our commitment to this provisional unit from 1 January 2001, but the Commission wants to sustain the debate on the form that the definitive Eurojust unit will take. That is why we will be presenting to the Council and European Parliament a proposal for a Communication on the definitive judicial cooperation unit, in order to have as swiftly as possible an outline, a foretaste, of what the definitive version of the Eurojust network will look like. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
