The committee agreed to this report with an overwhelming vote of 30 in favour, one against and one abstention.</p>
<p class="contents">Online gambling is an international phenomenon that is growing on a daily basis. Consumers find it easy to gamble online with providers who are either completely unregulated or who are registered in other countries where different rules apply.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, some individual Member States are no longer able to guarantee sufficient protection for their consumers. Children and young people or gambling addicts are particularly affected by this. In addition, frequently illegal foreign competition causes Member States to lose many millions of euro in tax revenue every year.</p>
<p class="contents">This comes at a cost to the promotion of charitable projects, combating addiction and support for amateur sport. Finally, legal uncertainties make it difficult to offer cross-border gambling services within the internal market. Given that there are no European licensing standards, it is necessary to decide on a case-by-case basis whether practices in the Member States comply with European law.</p>
<p class="contents">The existing level of legal uncertainty is made clear by the large number of contractual violation cases in recent years. That is why there is an urgent need to close the existing gap between legislation and reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has come to a clear conclusion. The Member States need to cooperate much more closely on this issue. This will not be enough to resolve the problems outlined, however. In addition, the European Union will also have to play a significant role in future. This has been demanded by our committee with an overwhelming majority. In addition to other measures, an EU directive is also to be considered that will set shared minimum standards for consumer and youth protection, combating crime in the area of online gambling.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the committee emphasises the principle of subsidiarity in its report on online gambling, the Member States need to regulate online betting for themselves insofar as possible within their own territory. However, this means that certain rules will need to be met in accordance with the judicial rulings of the European Court of Justice: restrictions in the legal range of gambling services, through state monopoly for example, are only permitted if they are coherent and proportionate. We cannot have a situation where a state explains away its monopoly by arguing that it wishes to protect consumers from the negative effects of gambling, while at the same time intensively advertising its range of state-backed gambling options. The best example of this can be found in Germany, where we have a state monopoly on gambling and lotteries, but with frequent advertising informing consumers of the current size of the jackpot, naturally encouraging players to invest their money in the lottery.</p>
<p class="contents">To avoid such situations in the future, the European Union should set down quality standards for state licensing models. If a Member State decides in favour of a state licensing model, this model must comply with the principles of transparency and fair competition. In other words, all providers of gambling services that comply with the relevant conditions should be able to apply for a licence. At the same time, trust between the national regulatory authorities needs to be strengthened so as to achieve greater cooperation. In addition, the Commission is called upon to examine ways to use legislation to prevent the flow of payments between illegal providers and their customers. This could be achieved, for example, if each Member State were to draw up a white list of licensed gambling operators in its territory. Banks and credit institutions would only then be permitted to authorise transactions with these approved operators. I believe that this is a sensible and realistic alternative to the blocking of Internet sites, something that we, as liberals, would not favour. This measure would also be an important step in securing tax income from legal gambling, combating organised crime, and protecting the consumer from unregulated gambling.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone, regulated providers, the public purse and consumers alike, would benefit from the measures called for in the report. Nonetheless, the European Commission needs the full backing of the European Parliament in order to present the necessary initiatives. It is for this reason I am hopeful that there will be a broad majority in favour at tomorrow’s vote, giving the Commission a clear mandate for action. Mr Barnier, it is over to you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On-line gambling does not only cross national borders but also those of the Union. Nevertheless, we need to seek joint methods to protect customers from fraud, to combat money laundering more effectively and to protect young people from gambling, and all this at a European level. Within the framework of this stage, I also believe that different national procedures should be respected but subsidiarity should not hinder close cooperation in the detection of criminal activity, nor should it serve as a pretext for protectionism. Therefore, it is important to delete Article 20. States which restrict licences should provide objective reasons for their failure to comply with national legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, we must take into account cultural traditions, as well as the important sustainable contribution that betting makes to society in some countries, such as mine, through education, culture and sport.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must also fight the criminality associated with gambling and protect consumers, especially the most vulnerable, in order to prevent excessive and pathological gambling. This is why I believe that the principle of active subsidiarity based on cooperation between national governments must take precedence in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we must be ambitious and focus on developing common regulations and working together in a coordinated fashion against unregulated online gambling operators, which operate without the necessary national licences. We must also ensure transparency and enable non-discriminatory competition that will promote public interest and consumer protection.</p>

The individual judgments of the Court of Justice in cases of infringement, however, cannot be the answer to the challenges of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As this report has stated, in no uncertain terms, Europe’s policy on gambling needs to be clarified by means, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, of better cooperation on the part of the authorities that oversee gambling. To ensure that this happens, it is important that the last clause in point 22 of the report is deleted, as it contradicts the reasoning elsewhere in the document.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, mutual acceptance does not apply to gambling, as gambling games are organised under the aegis of national legislation, which takes account of the special features of Member States. Point 15 in the report states that providers of online gambling should respect national laws, and that Member States should have the right to take the necessary action to prevent illegal gambling. In the future, too, it will be important for Member States to retain the right to decide on their own levels of consumer protection and measures to prevent criminality.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the basis for granting an exclusive right to provide gambling games is the prevention of social harm and combating crime in the gambling sector. That is why it is very important to ensure that gambling can be ethically sustainable. It is important that point 44 at the end of the report is kept and that the matter is addressed in greater depth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even if the Member States can, to a certain extent, determine the degree of regulation required in their own territory, it must be in accordance with the regulations of the European internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">However, operators of games of chance from other states, which have an open market and low tax rates, are also available in states where online gambling is forbidden. Besides that, a non-regulated black market is also operating on the Internet. Online gambling sites are also widely accessible to under-aged children or to people susceptible to pathological gambling.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we have to search for a proper framework for the responsible regulation of this environment. The European Court of Justice has already taken a decision that gambling does not belong to ordinary services and its regulation in accordance with the appropriately set goals is admissible. It would therefore be useful to define the minimum standards for the protection of consumers in the field of online gambling in order to enable more rigorous legal action to be taken against these types of activities in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is to say, not applying the principle of mutual recognition in a sector and market that are different from others, namely online gambling, and, at the same time, complying with the principle of active subsidiarity, thereby also increasing and strengthening cooperation between national regulators.</p>
<p class="contents">We recognise that a European approach is needed for a number of areas, notably for anti-fraud measures, the protection of minors and combating illegal operators and addiction.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is also important that the integrity of sport is addressed, in order to ensure the equitable distribution of revenues generated. In this regard, I asked for and obtained the mention of betting rights, a type of property rights for the organisers of sports events which can be enforced with regard to online betting operators. These rights would safeguard financial revenues for sports providers and thus avoid the increased risk of corruption or fraud in sport.</p>

Pathological gambling is extremely hazardous and its social costs are enormous, too. This addiction may affect as many as 5.5% of citizens of the European Union, which means we are talking about several million European citizens. I therefore regard the protection of consumers and the prevention of pathological gambling as a basic requirement. I think it is important to adopt common European regulations leading to the effective protection of vulnerable groups, in particular young people, who are the most exposed to this kind of danger. Member States should cooperate much more closely with each other in this area, in particular, while combating the negative aspects of gambling. As such, I am happy to see that the report contains, amongst other things, an appeal to the Commission and the Member States to focus on research on the prevalence, origin and treatment of addiction to these forms of gambling. A combination of the prevention of negative aspects and effective help to the victims of gambling is the only possible way to actively prevent Internet gambling. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that is a great word that has come out of this report, which does not undermine the ability of every Member State to regulate gambling in its tradition and in its history, but, at the same time, places an obligation on Member States to say that if you do not intensify your cooperation together, then consumers will not be properly looked after in every country. We are entitled to demand that safety and security for consumers and protection for under-age and addictive gambling; those two things absolutely must go together, and I hope we can make some serious progress on this as a result of the work that Parliament has done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Michel Barnier, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, 18 months ago, I promised you that I would open a wide-ranging consultation on the very important issue of online gambling. Today, we return to that subject, and I personally would like to come back to it by expressing my firm commitment to translating the main conclusions into action, beyond and after the consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">We received over 250 responses which, along with the five expert workshops we organised, and the lively debates you yourselves have had, ladies and gentlemen, on the own-initiative report by Mr Creutzmann, clearly show a desire to see concrete steps taken at European level towards establishing a basic regulatory framework that respects that which Mr Harbour called – and which I too would like to mention – active subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Mr Creutzmann for his commitment, and Ms Schaldemose, Ms Rühle, Mr Abad, Mr de Jong and Mr Fox for the contributions they have made to this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The report testifies to your broad consensus on the assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in the online environment, no Member State is in a position to guarantee the protection of consumers and citizens by itself. I am echoing what my fellow Commissioner and friend, Mr Dalli, said earlier on the more general issue of consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, all consumers and citizens – and particularly young people and minors, as Ms Roithová said earlier – should be able to enjoy a minimum level of equal and effective protection, no matter what kind of gambling platform they use.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, while every Member State is free to determine its own market’s level of deregulation, in accordance with the principle of coherence, it is clear that we are gradually moving towards a controlled deregulation of numerous markets, as Mr Abad very succinctly described earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, in the absence of legal offerings in Europe, Europeans gamble and will continue to gamble on illegal third-country websites, which are not protected and are open to all kinds of fraud and money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, we should be careful to offer attractive conditions for online gambling operators, taking account of the consequences of what I have just said, if we wish to both protect players and prevent fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, we need to act, because this sector is booming. In 2010, it generated EUR 8.5 billion in revenue, a figure that could reach EUR 13 billion in 2015. This may account for only 14% of the betting market in the EU, but Europe still makes up 45% of the world’s online gambling market. We need to support this sector as it expands while, at the same time, taking care to monitor it. What road map might we and should we use to respond to all your questions and all these challenges?</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, let us be clear. We are not talking about harmonisation; we are looking at joint action on certain key issues, which will no doubt lead us towards a basic common regulatory framework, as I have already said.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention six key areas in which we are going to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a dialogue between national regulators. We know that there is a lack of cooperation between national regulators, which probably stems from a lack of mutual trust.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from a few bilateral agreements and a recent attempt to create a common platform, there is no culture of cooperation between national regulators. On the contrary, I have noticed that there has often been, and I repeat, a lack of trust.</p>
<p class="contents">However, without a new, additional degree of mutual trust, no progress will be made at European level in strengthening controls and safeguarding players, particularly the young.</p>
<p class="contents">Our priority should therefore be to make European regulators work together.</p>
<p class="contents">The second key point: a minimum standard of protection. We have to guarantee a high level of protection for every European citizen and, I repeat, particularly for young people, in order to move forward in this area. We will have to make online gambling professionals, who are currently self-regulated, and regulators, who, I would point out, apply different standards, work together. There is, consequently, a general requirement for greater clarity and legal certainty, and you put that across in your report, Mr Creutzmann.</p>
<p class="contents">The third key issue: the fight against fraud. There has been a broad consensus, in this consultation and in what you have been saying here, in favour of extending the scope of the directive on the prevention of money laundering so that it covers the entire online gambling sector rather than just casinos, as is currently the case. That would represent a significant step forward in monitoring the sector at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth important point is addiction. Ms Irigoyen Pérez and Ms Sehnalová mentioned this earlier. We cannot talk seriously about consumer protection without recognising the need for further studies and research into the scientific data on gambling and addiction. We need to make full use of our research capacities on what can be considered at times a minor issue, although I do not see it as such.</p>
<p class="contents">The integrity of sport is the fifth key aspect. Mr Creutzmann, ladies and gentlemen, I have noted your interest in the matter of fraud in sport, and I share your desire to help find effective solutions, including the idea of defining sporting fraud at EU level and even of criminalising it. I believe it is an interesting idea but one that would be difficult to implement. We cannot address this issue by improvising. It requires a great deal of legal and technical work, and I am working on this with my fellow Commissioners who are directly involved, particularly Ms Reding, Ms Vassiliou and, of course, the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Policy, Mr Dalli.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also convinced that progress will have to be made if, as Mr Abad mentioned, sporting organisations are to cooperate more with operators and regulators in order to prevent match fixing.</p>
<p class="contents">The sixth area to work on is ensuring that national systems comply with the Treaties. I would like to answer Mr Takkula on this point, because he mentioned the European Court of Justice, which is quite clear on the restrictions that can be justified in the public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that in order to make progress in this area, Mr Takkula, we will need to clarify what distinguishes a legal gambling offering from an illegal one. This raises the question of compliance of national systems with the Treaties. The Commission will shoulder its responsibilities in this area as in others.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Creutzmann, based on these key issues, your comments, your proposals and your report, how are we going to tackle this?</p>
<p class="contents">My own initial inclination would be to promote cooperation between regulators, and in the coming weeks I intend to personally organise and hold a meeting with all the national regulators in order to establish a climate of trust, which does not really exist at the moment, and to lay the foundations of that cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as one might expect, that cooperation between regulators enables us to move forward on the key subjects we have talked about, but especially if it highlights the need for additional action, then we will work towards a second stage, which could, as Mr Paška requested, be based on regulatory initiatives, and create minimum standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, I want to be very clear on this issue. I am a Member of the College of European Commissioners, and I have to work with all my colleagues and encourage them to share that conviction. We will quickly embark on the first stage, which I already mentioned: regulators working together. Following that initial assessment and effort, I will have to share with my colleagues my belief in the need to go further, as I have just expressed, particularly in terms of drawing up basic regulatory initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">It will therefore be important to work through these stages one by one. Therefore, now that I have set out the main issues we are facing, I shall begin my work in the light of your report, Mr Creutzmann, and I intend to propose a plan of specific actions, which I shall submit to the European Commission in mid-2012, once the College has debated and reached a decision on it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am infinitely grateful to you, Mr Creutzmann, and to you, ladies and gentlemen, for this report, which is going to enlighten, guide and strengthen the Commission in its forthcoming work.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a collective responsibility: to help Member States to regulate online gambling; to safeguard consumers, particularly young people; to develop legal offerings; and to fight effectively and jointly against fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">You can be sure of my determination in all these areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nowadays, about 10% – a figure which is rising – of all gambling in Europe takes place online, with a market volume in excess of EUR 10 billion. As a result of ever increasing offerings and the increasing number of gamblers, the current market fragmentation in this area in Europe is also becoming ever more obvious. In a host of Member States, there are total bans or bans with the possibility of authorisation, while others have a completely liberalised market. Furthermore, in view of the cross-border nature of the Internet, Member States alone are not in a position to regulate all areas of online gambling. In my view, much-expanded cooperation between national regulatory bodies is therefore essential. In addition, I agree with the rapporteur that what is needed are institutionalised collaborative arrangements, also on the basis of the Internal Market Information System, in order to share information efficiently and quickly. As far as the battle against the growing black market on the Internet is concerned, I believe that national regulators must be given the necessary powers to penalise infringements and act against illegal providers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The disadvantages which emanate from an unregulated gambling market are greater than those encountered in a more regulated and uniform one. Therefore, any action plan must factor in extra precautions geared towards meeting the challenges and countering the elements of risk posed by the online environment in terms of the safeguard of minors, player protection, payment security and data protection of individuals engaged in Internet gambling, as well as ensuring that fair competition for operators duly licensed in other Member States is guaranteed in each Member State. I am unable to support the endorsement of national restrictions vis-à-vis the online gambling sector, which could have an adverse effect on gaming operators that are duly licensed as aforementioned and wish to operate cross-border. The term ‘illegal’, which remains undefined throughout the text, is unacceptable as it gives rise to legal ambiguity and encourages Member States to take protectionist measures in the online gambling sector, further increasing the fragmentation of the market. I therefore propose that a common definition based on the European Commission Green Paper is attributed to the concept of ‘illegal’ at EU level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
