<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lulling (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. This Parliament first raised the alarm about the threat to European beekeeping in 1985. The resolutions which we passed in 1992, 1995 and 1997 – mainly unanimously – contain specific, reasonable, affordable and legally tenable proposals for direct aid to save the European beekeeping industry which, the rosy Commission statistics notwithstanding, is in a state of real crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Our primary concern is not to increase the self-supply rate for quality honey from our beekeepers, which is currently just below 50%. No. What we are concerned with is guaranteeing that the 80 000 wild and cultivated plants across the European Union will be pollinated. This is currently under threat as a result of the worrying decline in the number of beekeepers, more than half of whom are over 60 years old, and really has reached crisis point in certain regions. It is truly amazing that, despite the patience and determination of the spokesmen of all the groups in this Chamber since 1985, we have not managed to bring the Commission to its senses and make it realise that its half-hearted policy based on the wishy-washy 1997 regulation urgently needs to be improved if we are to avert the threat to the balance of the European ecosystem from the beekeeping crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">It is incomprehensible, nay irritating in the extreme, that the Commission persists in doing nothing, despite its report on the unsatisfactory implementation of the inadequate measures based on the half-hearted 1997 regulation and despite its acknowledgement that European beekeeping has to contend with increasing difficulties. With all due respect, Commissioner, we can no longer accept this absurd obduracy. The Commission needs to come to its senses. <span class="italic">Errare humanum est, perseverare diabolicum. </span>You understand that, Mr Fischler.</p>
<p class="contents">The bases needed in order to introduce the direct aid now which we have lobbied for since 1992 are there for us in the Treaty. In my report we have again made specific, affordable short- and medium-term proposals, which there is too little time to go into, but the Commission can read. So what we want to hear today is that it is prepared to get moving on the basis of our proposals, which are supported by all beekeepers in the Community, from north to south, and we mean in the right direction. Mr Fischler saw for himself on Tuesday, when beekeepers from the majority of Member States visited the House with their produce, which attracted a great deal of interest, that some stands were cleaned out before the beekeepers had time to offer their products to the invited guests.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank the honourable Members who attended the meeting with over 60 beekeepers and who, like my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, fully support the demands contained in my report. We need more generous Community cofinancing than the current 50%, because many Member States are too mean to raise the 50% for programmes to improve the conditions under which honey is produced and marketed on the basis of the 1997 regulation, depriving their beekeepers of even the few hungry euros earmarked for their country.</p>
<p class="contents">We need both the immediate measures called for in the report and medium-term direct aid pending the mid-term view of Agenda 2000, especially premiums to compensate for loss of income because there is no Community preference in this sector. I am almost proud of having managed, together with my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgets, to get appropriations for programmes to improve the conditions under which honey is produced and marketed raised from EUR 14 to 16.5 million for 2002. That is the only compulsory expense in the agricultural budget to which this has happened. But that cannot distract us from the fact that the Commission's bee policy is still underdeveloped. All it needs is the political will on the part of the Commission and the Council to give us a sum which the EU takes less than five hours a year to spend, not to mention the EUR 2 billion embezzled from the budget. This political will is all that is needed to allow us, together with the beekeepers, to protect beekeeping in Europe and to prevent us from running blindly into the wall of an ecological catastrophe in the medium term.</p>

Several hundred Bavarian beekeepers came to the European Parliament, which just goes to show how committed these people are to their cause, which is also our cause.</p>
<p class="contents">Beekeepers are not a large group of voters, they are people who look after bees which, as Mrs Lulling has already said, ensure that a balance is constantly restored to our ecosystem, at least to a certain extent. A cold winter is just beginning, but when it is over we know that spring will arrive, that the bees will again fly off to provide their pollination services and we shall again enjoy a blooming landscape. But there is a danger that one day winter will come and no such spring will follow because there will be no bees or too few bees to provide this ecological function. Many people believe that the EU is a country which flows with milk and honey.</p>
<p class="contents">With milk we have tried to get the quotas into order. With bees, we have a self-supply rate of just below 50% in the European Union. Anyone who really wants to see a country which flows with milk and honey should fly to Argentina, as I did this summer. Argentina could supply the European Union with most or many of the products that we need, but in these times of global political crisis, we are aware of two new elements. First, we are aware of the need for quality following the BSE crisis and, secondly, we are aware of the need to be able to obtain healthy food from our own soil following the crisis on 11 September. I think that a functioning European farming industry and a functioning European ecosystem need suitable support for our beekeepers, which is why I ask the House to throw its full weight behind the Lulling report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the corrections which should be introduced, we must achieve a reasonable balance in the cost-benefit for each of the action lines and a profound modification which transforms the current degree of co-funding, so that funding is entirely covered by the EAGGF Guarantee.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to future needs, we should make two recommendations. Firstly, we must establish a direct aid system which compensates for the loss of income suffered by European professional beekeepers. Furthermore, we should create a COM for honey. Secondly, we must recognise the importance of the role played by professional beekeepers by maintaining their status in the face of large bee-keeping operations, since they thereby allow the existence of a fully sustainable stock-breeding activity, which favours rural development and which, furthermore, produces healthy and high-quality products, and which is socially very beneficial, given its important contribution to environmental quality and its active role in conserving bio-diversity by means of the pollination carried out by bees.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by saying, Mr President, that this task of pollination, which is safeguarded by beekeepers, must be compensated for through a line for specific aid which supplements the current Regulation. I congratulate Mrs Lulling on her magnificent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Souchet (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, today the future of bee-keeping in Europe is in the balance. This is about nothing less than saving a sector of production. This is a matter of urgency because, while we are consuming more honey, production is falling to dangerously low levels. Today we consume more than twice as much honey as we produce. And if we are producing less it is essentially because of the devastating effect – now scientifically proven – which a certain number of systemic insecticides used to treat arable seeds have had on bee populations, which have been really decimated. This situation is not unique or unusual; today nearly all European bee-keepers are affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with a situation of this nature, the Commission's proposal, which is extremely weak, confines itself, as part of its new regulatory framework, to statistical work and a handful of promotion measures. These proposals are obviously not sufficient to tackle the problems affecting the sector. No one is denying that there is a need to refine the statistics, but this work is no substitute for what is most urgent, which is rebuilding bee populations so that our bee-keepers can save honey production in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Product promotion is a good thing, provided that the product concerned is available. Furthermore, you have to be particularly careful with promotion when the products concerned are ones of which we have a considerable shortfall, which is the case with honey. It is necessary to promote the link between the product and the land. I do not believe that it is the European Union's job to fund the promotion of Chinese, Argentinean or Mexican honey: these are honeys which do not guarantee traceability in any shape or form, which are not subject to quality control, which do not comply with our standards and which are often nothing but flavoured glucose syrups. We cannot claim that we wish to encourage European agriculture to develop in a way which is more respectful of the environment while at the same time letting our bee-keepers sink into indifference, and it is true that they do not constitute a powerful lobby. They are all the more deserving of our attention. Any product, including honey, can, admittedly, be purchased from outside, but the pollination of our plants is not something that can be imported. We are dealing here with an area which is essential for preserving our environment and our bio-diversity. That is why I welcome the work done by our excellent rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, and by all of the Members of the Committee on Agriculture who unanimously adopted the amendments which we tabled together. These open the door to the possibility of Community funding being made available to help European bee-keepers to rebuild their hive populations in response to this urgent situation; we state this in Paragraph 10.</p>
<p class="contents">Veterinary costs related to bee-keeping should also be treated in the same way as for other animals; we state this in Paragraph 5. And to safeguard the future of this industry in the long term, it is essential that, in the future, procedures for the approval of plant protection products take account of their effects on bees in terms of death or alteration in behaviour; this is our Paragraph 17. It is essential that the precautionary principle be applied here. Commissioner, the Commission needs to wake up; the Council needs to wake up. This is a matter of great urgency. We Members must sound the alarm. The European Union would bear a huge responsibility if it hastened the disappearance of our bee-keepers. I hope that all Members will support the wise, necessary and urgent proposals which we adopted unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, may I congratulate you, Mrs Lulling, on being crowned queen bee of the European Parliament here today. I should also like to congratulate you on the report which you have submitted. However I hope, with reference to the sting which was also mentioned, that you do not share the fate of the bee which, as you know, can only sting once. That would be a real pity.</p>
<p class="contents">Programmes to improve the conditions under which honey is produced and marketed are regularly submitted by all Member States for approval and, with only 80% of available funds being taken up, the satisfactory application of Regulation 1221/97 would clearly appear to be guaranteed. For the rest, the Council has approved the European Parliament's motion for the funds earmarked for the application of the regulation to be increased by EUR 2.5 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would therefore be delighted if the Member States and the enterprises in question were to take up all these funds in order to implement as many measures as possible within the current legal framework, in order to help the sector and allow it to develop in line with the rapporteur's considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">When the report on the first three years' application of this regulation was submitted to the Council, the representatives of the Member States raised no objections whatsoever and approved the Commission's conclusions unanimously. In discussions with the Commission, the enterprises in the sector welcomed the fact that the aid regulation in favour of European beekeeping was to be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">The economy in the honey sector is stable, production and imports have remained steady and the self-supply rate has fluctuated between 48 and 50% for several years and is therefore nothing new. Bearing these facts in mind and bearing in mind the heterogeneity of the sector and the widely differing bee economies in the European Union, we feel that neither a new common organisation of the market in the honey sector nor a direct aid regulation in the form of direct income support for beekeepers is warranted at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">Other suggestions in the report, such as specific aid to improve the bee population through rearing apiaries, can already be implemented under the current regulation, without the need for any new legal provisions. We also have all the facilities of the structural policy and the policy to promote agricultural products at our disposal. They too need to be implemented accordingly, although the initiative here lies mainly with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said which, the Member States and the enterprises in question need to work more closely together in applying and implementing the programmes in order to ensure there is coherent political and financial support for this sector across the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You cannot say that these paltry funds of between EUR 10 and 14 million – granted, we shall get a bit more next year – are satisfactory because 80% are being taken up. I realise that we are making demands on the Member States and that a bit more will be done within the existing legal framework, but we also want a more flexible approach than is possible at present.</p>
<p class="contents">But I must say that I really am appalled to hear that not one representative in the Council – i.e. not one Member State – had any objection whatsoever; do they really think we need do nothing at all? I think it is quite something that the Member States apparently feel no need to react to what the European Parliament has to say about your report. But we and the beekeepers shall make sure that the Member States at least acknowledge what we have to say about the report, just in case they think there is no need to act. As you know, we have not called for any all-powerful order, but we still take the view that we need direct aid regulations in the medium term. You say they are not warranted at the present time. You have heard the beekeepers, they take quite a different view and you must be fully aware of what is happening in this sector. We shall also ensure that beekeepers are better informed about the facilities available under structural policy and measures to promote agricultural produce, but here too we have very limited funds for numerous quality products.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I just wanted to say this to Mr Fischler because I already know what he has told us. I had hoped for something more, rather than being hung out to dry! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
