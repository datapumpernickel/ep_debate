<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Färm (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, a successful budgetary policy for the EU requires not only decisions on figures and budget items, for the EU has serious problems when it comes to implementing the budget. An important part of Parliament’s budget policy must therefore be about follow-up and evaluation and keeping track of the implementation of the budget. It is therefore very important that we give due weight to the annual report, which we are debating today, on the implementation of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of matters of particular concern to us this year, for example, outstanding commitments. After four months of 2003, total outstanding commitments – known as RAL – had increased to EUR 126 billion, compared with EUR 110 billion at the same time last year. Even though we do not have all the facts concerning the causes of this and concerning what are in actual fact abnormal outstanding commitments, the trend is clearly worrying. We are also concerned about the 2002 surplus of EUR 7.4 billion, even though it is an advance, given that, last year, it was more than double this at EUR 15 billion. We nonetheless still have underutilisation to the tune of EUR 9 billion, which is an unacceptable figure.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the 2003 implementation, the beginning of the year even shows a lower level than during the same period of 2002; in particular, category 3 and 4 commitments entered into in April were lower than at the same time last year.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a whole lot of different problems. The recent visit of our delegation to Bosnia, like a host of other contacts, also makes us worry that a lack of information about the new budgetary arrangements may have caused problems, for example for the external delegations. It can have negative effects upon the benefits, in terms of efficiency, of the reform process and of decentralisation. We also saw a number of problems within the common foreign and security policy in connection, for example, with the EU’s police mission in Bosnia where tenders, contracts etc were concerned. On this subject, we believe that the Commission should investigate whether separate rules might not be needed to adapt our measures within the common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the separate expenditure categories, we are still critical of the way in which export subsidies for the transport of live animals are dealt with. We regret that the Council did not accept our proposal concerning the account plan, which would have made the system significantly more open to inspection. We must therefore make a new attempt this year. Because I do not just want to be critical, we can also observe that, for example, rural policy in actual fact exceeds our expectations when it comes to implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">What most concern us, however, are the structural measures. The proportion of implemented payments in this area has declined during the first months of the year in spite of the tough criticism in previous years. We are also anxious about the increase in outstanding commitments, which rose to almost EUR 94 billion as per 30 April 2003 – an incredible sum! Where this is concerned, something new needs to happen. Quite a few fellow MEPs have mentioned the N+2 rule, which we must arrange to be applied effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the structural funds, we are delighted about the simplification process begun by the Commission. We nonetheless believe that it needs to become significantly more vigorous within the current arrangements but, above all, the preparations for a more thorough review prior to the new arrangements must be set in motion quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">In category 3, we are a little concerned about research and development. We are, on the other hand, pleased that there is a positive trend, prior to enlargement, when it comes to the programmes for small and medium-sized businesses, as well as for the pilot project concerning small and medium-sized businesses. We also welcome the fact that pilot projects and preparatory measures are now part of the implementation plan for 2003, on which we agreed last autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">Where external measures were concerned, there was clearly less implementation in April of this year than for the same period of 2002, and this is something that concerns us. On the other hand, we are pleased about the prompt agreement to activate EUR 79 million from the disaster aid reserve for Iraq, as well as about the new proposals concerning southern Africa and Ethiopia. We only hope that the situation in Iraq and the Middle East does not give rise to such a degree of uncertainty in connection with the 2003 budget that it could entail problems for the other areas within external policy. That is not something we intend to accept.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one of the basic problems we have when it comes to implementing the budget is that, overall, we have a rigid budgetary system that really needs to be modernised and altered. This is, however, basically a task for the Convention, which will shortly have concluded its work, and for the future constitution. Where this is concerned, I hope that we shall see a radical reform in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that we are holding so timely a debate on budget implementation so early in the year. Parliament receives the figures on budget implementation on a weekly basis. These are direct figures from the accounts. No Parliament of the Member States is kept informed like this. I stress this because the Commission’s accounting has been and is a subject of public debate and a lot of things are said that are not always entirely correct. I am glad that we can debate the matter properly here and I thank the rapporteur for his detailed report.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from these weekly figures, you also receive a report three times a year commenting on the implementation of the budget and giving details in particular of so-called abnormal RALs, that is commitments the Commission entered into a very long time ago and commitments for which no payments have been made in the last three years. The level of commitments entered into and which will result in corresponding expenditure in the next few years amounts now – at the end of June – to a total of EUR 122 000 million. I agree with Mr Färm, the rapporteur, that this amount needs to be reduced quickly. But I also agree that we must be careful not to label the total amount of RALs as abnormal because this year that is not correct. The Commission has a budget for commitment appropriations showing their amount, something that is not the case in many Member States, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on a few points or questions from your report, Mr Färm. First the question of the directorates general or policy areas to which the total 717 posts approved by the Budgetary Authority in 2001 and 2002 were allocated. You will be getting a detailed listing of these. In the last few years we have strengthened the foreign policy area, among others, and also such implementing areas as, for example, regional policy or the growing area of justice and internal affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point: what is the staffing plan for the Enlargement DG in 2004, after the accession of the ten new Member States? The 2004 Budget assumes there will be an appreciable reduction in staffing, in the number of posts in this directorate general, a reduction of 105 posts in fact. You must bear in mind that the Enlargement Directorate-General’s activity next year will not be confined to the candidate countries Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, but that it will continue to administer pre-accession aid; also, a specific programme was agreed for 2004 and subsequent years in the accession negotiations to continue to give administrative assistance for the development of a good administration. The further trend for the Enlargement DG will then be reviewed in the course of the 2005 budget procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the state of budget execution this year, you also note that implementation is less than at the same time last year. This has in fact to do with the work involved in bringing in the new Financial Regulation. This new Financial Regulation brings far-reaching changes for financial management. It is a fundamental reform. The Directorate General for the Budget trained over 1 000 members of staff last year. But there is much that is new and requires familiarisation. Recipients of payments have to be asked for better security arrangements, for example. That also requires a degree of familiarisation on our side.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a few special comments about budget implementation in the external fields. Generally speaking, the rate of utilisation in the first few months of this year does not necessarily set the trend for the rest of the year. So far, commitments totalling EUR 1 800 million have been made, which is not at all bad. With regard to pre-accession aid, I would also like to point out that in this case implementation continues to be unsatisfactory. If, however, you compare this year’s budget implementation figures with those from last year, you can see that there has been some acceleration.</p>
<p class="contents">We had a special situation with humanitarian aid. You mentioned it yourself. Here, funding was cut in the course of the 2003 budget procedure, even remembering that there is the emergency reserve. The Budgetary Authority has approved EUR 79 million for humanitarian work in Iraq. We have asked for a further EUR 25 million for southern Africa and tomorrow we will be talking about a further EUR 15 million for Ethiopia. I hope we will find agreement on that, too, because it is essential that aid be provided really quickly here. I think everyone involved agrees with that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mr Färm, most sincerely for carefully reading the figures that he has kindly made available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">What he read was of course not so pleasing, and I would like to sum up in only very general terms by saying that, as a member of one part of the Budgetary Authority, I have to ask myself what force and what decisiveness we must bring to bear in order, together with the Council, to prepare a budget – which is, after all, policy in figures – when those who have to implement it are far from being in a position to implement that policy in the way the Budgetary Authority wanted. That is in fact a fundamental criticism that I have already voiced in this place on a number of occasions, and things get no better, they get worse. That cannot of course be the Commission’s long-term strategy. The budgets we present are always tight ones, and then we want to make ourselves more popular with the Member States by not spending the money we have just argued over so passionately.</p>
<p class="contents">I now have a large number of complaints on the table where individual groups that are supposed to be supported out of the Community budget, as is stipulated in the rules on the matter, are faced with massive administrative problems in negotiations with the Commission, especially this year because of the new Financial Regulation. All the rules must be followed, but my plea here would be that we also help to ensure that in the end resources actually can flow. Bureaucracy – or the proper control of the use of resources – is not there to make payments basically impossible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Virrankoski (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FI) </span>Mr President, this year’s general rapporteur for the budget, Mr Göran Färm, has produced an excellent report on the implementation of the budget and I wish to thank him sincerely for that. The report quite rightly examines two key points in detail, those being outstanding commitments and decommitment, that is, the N+2 rule. As I mentioned earlier on, outstanding commitments stood at EUR 126 billion in April, which was an increase of over EUR 15 billion in one year. These outstanding commitments were especially evident in the Structural Funds where they stood at EUR 94 billion, which is to say the amount for appropriations for almost three years.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is grave. At the start of the present programming period the N+2 rule was approved. It states that there is to be decommitment if no payments have been made for two years. The Commission seems to be interpreting the rule in such a way that advance payments, which are not even based on any invoices presented, should be regarded as payments. A project can be kept alive in this way from one year to the next by means of small advance payments, even though the project itself might not have even begun to be implemented. The Commission should improve the way the N+2 rule is monitored and restore its original purpose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
