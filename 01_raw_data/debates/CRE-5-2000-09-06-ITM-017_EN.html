<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Glase (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, the report before us is a position adopted by Parliament in response to a communication from the Commission on the problems associated with undeclared or illicit work. This problem is being dealt with at European level because it relates not just to one particular country but to all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the heart of the problem? Major economic and socio-political damage is being caused in the Member States through work not being declared. Health insurances, pensions systems and the Treasury together lose billions every year. Workers are in no way insured or otherwise safeguarded. Thoughts of a modern slave trade with fatal consequences for those involved spring clearly and inevitably to mind. Those who are rewarded in some way for undeclared work have no right to claim compensation at all and no other consumer rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The people concerned believe that they are at an advantage but are in fact harming only themselves and society. The fact is that, by definition and by its very nature, undeclared work is difficult to get to grips with in any country. On the basis of estimates and long-term investigations, it may be assumed that a total of 28 million people engage in undeclared work. The volume of undeclared work now corresponds to 15% of gross domestic product in the EU. The sector as a whole is growing three times as fast as the official economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the communication before this House, the Commission has problems with the analysis, as well as with the steps that need to be taken to stem the tide of undeclared work. Parliament has been working flat out on these problems for a long time and produced a list of causes which produce combined and many-sided effects. Almost all investigations list unduly high taxes and social security contributions as a cause. However, the Committee lists further causes such as poverty, frivolous bidding procedures, giveaway prices for subcontractors, inflexible employment legislation and poor administrative practice, as well as a clear decline in the perception of undeclared work as something illegal and illicit.</p>
<p class="contents">In drawing its conclusions, the Committee has, however, come up with a variety of positions derived from the very different evaluations of the various causes. I nonetheless believe that we are united as to our goal. It is only the path about which we disagree. The conclusions adopted by the Committee at its last sitting call for as precise as possible an assessment to be made of the sectors affected and of the most significant groups of people involved, as well as for the social partners to be involved in active measures to combat undeclared work and for the issue to be tackled in national employment programmes. They also call for surveillance and for sanctions to be imposed when undeclared work is detected.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a majority of the Committee considers a reduction in tax and social security contributions to be crucial as a preventive measure, as well as a reduction in value added tax in the case of labour-intensive services, as already provided for by the Council’s decision of 28 February of this year and as also already practised in new countries. It is also important to find solutions in hitherto unsatisfactory areas, for example in connection with the directive on the posting of workers and with the paid domestic work largely performed by women.</p>
<p class="contents">In the five minutes granted to me, I can present only a number of important points in the report. The problem is complex and needs to be tackled at a variety of levels. The Committee therefore calls upon the Commission and the individual Member States, each according to its powers but above all with firm determination, to take up Parliament’s proposals and to become active in this matter. I hope that we can demonstrate to you our substantial agreement with the report, together with Parliament’s active resolve. I would thank all my fellow MEPs for their splendid cooperation but, above all, the shadow rapporteur, Karin Jöns, for her constant readiness to engage in discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would draw your attention to a printing error. In Article 25 of the conclusions, the Committee has clearly formulated the right to a class action. This needs to be revised in the latest text we have before us. The words ‘appeals to the courts’ must therefore be deleted and replaced with the words ‘a class action’. The words then correctly correspond to the will of the Committee, as agreed. Many thanks for your attention.</p>

There are some parts I do not like, such as for instance paragraph 13 which promotes tax coordination. I am proposing to table an amendment on that because, as the rapporteur knows, this is a subject particularly dear to the heart of UK Conservatives. But the overall thrust of the report is very good.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another report out today which was an annual report from the Commission, referred to in today's <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> under the wonderful heading "Brussels demands labour reform". To quote briefly from the article, "In its assessment of countries, the Commission will tell France that, like Germany, it must reduce 'fiscal pressure' on labour and reduce the 'administrative burden on companies'." Certainly anything that promotes labour flexibility, liberates enterprise and reduces burdens on business must be good for the economies of those countries and for employment. But it also addresses this problem of undeclared work. The higher the tax, the more the red tape, the greater the incentive not to declare work.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make one further suggestion. Countries with the highest undeclared work may well be recording the highest official unemployment figures, thereby attracting the highest offsetting regional funds. This is perverse and it is in all our interests to address the problem. Reducing tax and red tape would be a splendid start. I urge Member States to follow the Commission advice and also to note the Glase report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jöns (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a clear need for action on the issue of undeclared work in all the Member States, for there have not so far been many successes in combating it.</p>
<p class="contents">All the more reason, then, for me to welcome the Commission’s communication on undeclared work because it gets the discussion going at European level. In this way, I now come to a core demand of this really excellent report by Mrs Glase. We must unreservedly include the fight against undeclared work in European employment strategy. With problems of this complexity, we need to exchange views, learn from each other and, in accordance with the tried and tested motto for our employment strategy, always seek best practice.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take a close look at the issue of undeclared work in order to be able to combat its various causes efficiently. I would warn against over-simplification, three forms of which I would also at this point immediately oppose on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists. The first point concerns the repeatedly made assertion according to which undeclared work is in the first place traceable to unduly high taxes and social security contributions. I would say to my fellow MEPs in the conservative camp that things are really not that simple. Let us take Austria and Italy, for example. In Austria, taxes are significantly higher than in Italy. In spite of that, there is very much more undeclared work in Italy. High taxes and social charges are therefore only one reason among many. Or look at Scandinavia. There, taxes and social charges are somewhat higher still. On the other hand, the amount of undeclared work is comparatively small. This no doubt also means that the quantity of undeclared work also has something to do with social acceptability, that is to say with a society’s social coherence. Undeclared work must no longer remain a mere peccadillo.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to reject the argument that making the labour market more flexible would reduce the amount of undeclared work. This would-be panacea does not in fact work. The Thatcher era in Britain taught us that. The amount of undeclared work rose then, despite the fact that the labour market was made more flexible and social charges were reduced. Making the labour market more flexible is something which no doubt only works if correspondingly high social standards can be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, undeclared work is not primarily the result of illegal immigration from third countries. On the contrary, the majority of those who engage in undeclared work are our own citizens. As Mrs Glase’s report shows, we need a sensible policy mix at national and European levels. As a part of this, public authorities throughout the EU must also be jointly liable for ensuring that no contracts at all are awarded to companies whose quotations can quite clearly be traced back to the existence of undeclared work. In the same way, companies need to be jointly and severally liable towards their sub-contractors.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we also want a right of class action which could help the trade unions, in particular, to take proceedings against those suspected of not declaring their employees or only partially declaring them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very complex report which I described in committee as cautious in parts: cautious for reasons of necessity, if we consider that employment policy concerns the Member States, and therefore does not afford the European Parliament, or, by extension, Europe, genuine, practical competence in this matter. So we are faced with a real, substantial difficulty to overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Jöns has just said, what we now need to do is develop a new strategy which looks at the entire question of work and employment from a global viewpoint, and calls upon the Member States first of all to make their situation public with regard to employment and undeclared work.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, we do not have detailed documentation for all the States; that is, we do not know the extent of the problem in all the Member States. We do not know the extent of the problem in the States which are hoping to join the European Union either.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a complex issue: the percentage is increasing every year in line with the gross domestic product; we have a remarkably high average of 15% across the countries of the European Union. This figure should make us think.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, for all of us, illegal and undeclared work constitutes, by definition, an abuse of those who need to work, not least in terms of the tax burden which should ensure solidarity. This is, therefore, a crime against society, which we as legislators must address, within the limits of our direct competence in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are specific recommendations in the report, for example specific procedures which could be implemented in order to fight the scourge of illegal or undeclared work.</p>
<p class="contents">I tabled some amendments, which have already been accepted by the rapporteur, and I will therefore not dwell on them. I would just like to use the rest of the time available to mention an amendment which is particularly important to me and which I believe people found difficult to assess objectively: the amendment on illegal child labour, which I will summarise now.</p>
<p class="contents">It is claimed that child labour does not exist in Europe, but that it might exist – as has been stated – in Italy and southern countries. This is not true! Child labour exists everywhere: among immigrants or third-country nationals, among all those young people who drop out of education before they reach the age of majority, who are exploited, underpaid and untrained, thereby constituting a serious problem of exploitation and undeclared work because they do not have a qualification which can be used to ensure that they are adequately paid.

<p class="contents">To these people we must also add workers in the new economy, whose working hours, time between shifts, and salaries are subject to the hazards of excessive insecurity and flexibility. In short, we are talking about a form of exploitation in the workplace, which admittedly is detrimental to public finances due to lost revenue from tax and social contributions, but we must never forget that we are talking about the exclusion to which, according to the Commission, between 10 and 28 million citizens of the European Union are reduced. Far from stigmatising these victims, we should be concerning ourselves with a specific type of employer criminality.</p>
<p class="contents">Lumping together those offering this type of work and those accepting it is inappropriate, even shocking. The report that has been submitted to us is not entirely free from reproach in this respect, and nor, what is more, is the Commission's communication. What should we do? Integrate undeclared work into the labour market or adapt the job market to the existence of these excessively flexible types of work?</p>
<p class="contents">I fear that proposals consisting of reducing taxes and contributions and increasing the flexibility of the job market will only lead to even greater deregulation of the labour market, at the risk of these precursors of excessive flexibility eventually becoming legitimate. As the report that has been submitted to us indicates, poverty fosters the prosperity of the black economy, obliging employees and the self-employed to accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">Staunchly fighting for the creation of quality activities and jobs, paying attention to working conditions and limiting insecurity are the surest methods of reducing the attractiveness of undeclared work in all sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures also need to be taken to prevent certain conditions for sub-contracting and the award of public contracts from leading small businesses or the self-employed to seek illegal ways of achieving the profit margins forbidden to them by contractors.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not need to regulate less, but rather to give greater resources to the authorities responsible for monitoring work. In some States, the Labour Code stipulates that every illegal contract must be re-classed as a full-time, permanent contract. That would certainly be a very active policy and a strong incentive for the employers concerned to regularise the situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It can be difficult drawing the line between undeclared and properly declared work. Sometimes, the blame has to be placed upon individuals who do undeclared work in order to dodge paying tax.</p>
<p class="contents">The serious cases of undeclared work are those that are organised as such. More often than not, many workers are involved, and the reason is that there are employers who organise, lead and distribute work that will go undeclared in order to keep wage costs down and reduce taxes for themselves. That is the heart of the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">In many quarters, organised undeclared work is well-known, both among the local population and the authorities. In those cases where no action is taken against such work, this may be because unemployment is high and poor people have no alternative to being exploited by employers who do not declare their employees.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a tax argument which plays a big part in Mrs Glase’s thinking. This subject has already been taken up in the debate. Mrs Jöns observed quite correctly that in those regions and countries where the level of tax is fairly – or even very – high, where the labour market is well organised and where workers have strong unions, there is almost no undeclared work at all, at least not in any organised form.</p>
<p class="contents">If Mrs Glase and her group want to reduce tax in order to make undeclared work less profitable, this is as good as saying that they want to legalise the economic calculations behind undeclared work and make them the general rule. It is like increasing the speed limit on the roads to reduce the number of drivers who break the law by driving too fast, or like legalising the drugs trade to reduce the amount of illegal drug dealing.</p>
<p class="contents">I was quite shocked to read the rapporteur’s original report in which she proposed that all employees in European workplaces should be forced to carry electronic cards so as constantly to be monitored by the authorities. I believe it is the employers who organise production and take on workers. If anyone is to be compelled to carry electronic cards, it is therefore these employers, who are responsible for the work that is done.</p>
<p class="contents">My group and I believe that fighting unemployment and poverty is the best, and in fact the only, way of properly combating organised undeclared work. Improved wages are a much better remedy than lower taxes and other concessions to irresponsible employers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are living in a Europe that is increasingly closer to its citizens and therefore we cannot omit to concern ourselves with employment, as employment, together with health, is one of the main concerns of the citizens and, I dare say, especially of those who are unemployed because they have lost their job or perhaps never had one.</p>
<p class="contents">We should ask the question whether those who are working in the hidden economy, working on the black market or, to use the most common term, carrying out undeclared work, really have an adequate job? I do not think this is the right time to detail the harm done by undeclared work to the public funds and those carrying it out, due to their own position of insecurity, and to other employers, competitors or otherwise, and society in general. The economic causes of undeclared work, increased income for workers, the opportunity to save on tax and social contributions or the reduction in costs for the company, are not unrelated to its existence and a significantly higher rate of growth than that of the legal or official economy.</p>
<p class="contents">To refer briefly to the sectors or groups in which undeclared work has the most scope for expansion, we need to include multi-job situations where the income obtained from this illegal work is supplementary; economically inactive people who have greater flexibility in terms of time and the case of the unemployed who want an additional income, often turning down offers of legal work. We must also consider the situation of illegal immigrants who cannot carry out other forms of work.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these easily visible situations, it is assumed that there are also many cases of production decentralisation, outsourcing or subcontracting which, in a less direct, less visible way, can lead to undeclared work. A situation which must be prevented and which I would like to consider is that of the new type of work via the Internet, teleworking, part-time work, which can be an easy breeding-ground for undeclared work.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we must anticipate this, as Europe must opt for secure, stable, quality work, and undeclared work is neither stable nor secure and nor, of course, does it demonstrate solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is precisely because this is such a crucial issue that I should like to make two comments.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that this is not just some sub-issue; it is a central issue which impacts on the efficiency of individual policies in the taxation, insurance and employment sectors. With the rapid spread of undeclared work in industrialised countries, this phenomenon has ceased to be a typical feature of third world countries, for which the International Labour Organisation several decades ago coined the term “informal sector”, which is not the same as “black” or illicit work. That is a mistake which I would ask the Commission to take into account. What we are witnessing, in fact, is the emergence of two productive systems and two social models. One in which producers operate by analysing the responsibilities and costs imposed by the system and another in which they operate to the detriment of the former and society as a whole. What we must understand is that the future success of European initiatives in the employment, insurance and tax sectors depends on the way in which this issue is resolved; in other words, this issue is of equal importance to employers, workers and the rest of society.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I think that the general reference to undeclared work or to certain general categories is the weak link in the approach to the problem: we all know that undeclared work cannot be dealt with as a single phenomenon and needs a policy which is differentiated by sector and sub-sector, depending on the people supplying it and the nature of the individual problem. The various categories of people which supply it, such as immigrants, minorities, children, women, moonlighters etc. cannot all be dealt with in the same way. There is a thriving undeclared sector and there are instances which only partially constitute undeclared work. Then there is the matter of bogus self-employment and certain new forms of employment. All these problems require innovative solutions; bans are not enough. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The bad news is that, more and more often, work goes undeclared. Failing to declare work is no mere peccadillo. The wide-boy in the local pub who brags about ripping off the State should no longer be indulged. In Germany, for example, work is being lost due to illegal employment and, for every ten thousand jobs, DM 240 million is lost in taxes and social security contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">In her splendid and balanced report, Anne Glase estimates the volume of undeclared work in the EU at between 10 and 20 per cent of GNP. People who engage in undeclared work are to be found not only among the unemployed and among those who have entered the country illegally and have to suffer at the hands of those who profiteer from unemployment. They are also to be found among part-time workers who, in addition, are working at night and in the evenings on their computers, as well as among the self-employed who do additional work they do not declare. Those affected by this are small and medium-sized businesses which, unlike competitors who operate illegally, obey the law. Jobs cannot be safeguarded in this way. Nor can new ones be created.</p>
<p class="contents">What is to be done? Firstly, abuse of the rules governing work must be punished, with fines for those who engage in undeclared work and for those who employ others to do such work. Those who hire workers who do not have work permits should be excluded from being awarded public contracts. Moreover, they should expect to receive custodial sentences.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, thorough checks, including cross-border checks, by the relevant authorities are necessary. Town clerks’ offices must cooperate with factory inspectorates, and tax offices with immigration authorities, preferably in task forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, incentives to abuse the system must be reduced. Taxes and social charges payable by companies must be significantly reduced, as must VAT on labour-intensive services.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, it is particularly important that there should be more awareness-raising campaigns in order to convince all relevant target groups that undeclared work needs to be combated. It is extremely damaging both socially and economically. Acting illegally is anti-social. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has opened the debate with its communication on undeclared work in the spring of 1998. We are pleased to say that it has stimulated debate both with the European institutions and within Member States. The time has come to bring together the fruits of this debate. Therefore I especially welcome Parliament's initiative in taking up this issue now.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's communication focused on the policy strategy to tackle this important problem. It has highlighted the need for an integrated approach to combating undeclared work, involving both preventive measures and sanctions. These deal with the two dimensions of undeclared work: it can be viewed as an issue of individuals taking advantage of the system and undermining solidarity in the process or as the outcome of greater flexibility in the labour market and slow adaptation of existing legislation. I am pleased to see that Parliament has agreed with the Commission's analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament also seems to share the view that the main action has to be taken at the level of Member States. Indeed it is the mix of the situation in the labour market, the tax and social security mix, as well as the social acceptance, that determine the level of undeclared work. For that reason, the action that can be taken at Community level can only be minimal and has to be clearly targeted in those fields where the Community can have an impact.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also convinced that undeclared work should be dealt with within the framework of the Luxembourg process. We believe that undeclared work should be actively taken into account in the national action plans for employment. We are working with the Member States to ensure that this is so. We welcome Parliament's support in this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission can have an impact in developing a standard methodology to describe and record the extent of undeclared work and to assess its impact on the economy and on social solidarity. This we have done with the Communication in 1998 and we will continue to do so. Indeed the Commission is now carrying out a study on different measures used to combat undeclared work in selected Member States in order to identify good policy mixes. Results of this study will be presented in a conference at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">However, to have annual monitoring and reporting on this problem would be heavy procedurally while not adding much new. We must not forget that undeclared work is a deeply rooted phenomenon. Changes take time. To keep this item on the agenda and to ensure that progress is reported we would suggest a triennial reporting exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with the analysis of Parliament that women, while not the majority of undeclared workers, often operate in situations of greater insecurity and exploitation. Within its possibilities the Commission will continue to monitor the situation and report on it within the framework of existing reports on the principle of equal treatment. That is very important to the need to maintain momentum in introducing and reinforcing equal opportunities for women and men. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
