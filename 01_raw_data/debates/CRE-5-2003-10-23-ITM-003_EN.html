<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Figueiredo (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Committee on Fisheries have studied and debated the Commission’s proposals for an action plan to be implemented from 2003 to 2005, aimed at ensuring that access to and exploitation of fish stocks are monitored at all stages of the fisheries chain on the basis of a regime combining clear rules with a single monitoring procedure, which should apply both at the catch stage and to the transport and marketing of fisheries products. Such a regime should yield results which are properly comparable, whatever the operator’s nationality and whichever national inspection service is responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a general consensus in the European Parliament and the fisheries sector on the need to improve coordination of inspection and surveillance activities at Community level, rationalising resources and setting priorities, especially in areas where greater cooperation between Member States is necessary, namely in international areas governed by regional organisations to which the EU is a contracting party.</p>
<p class="contents">Pressing ahead with those measures aimed at harmonising processes and objectives is also seen as desirable, based on the experience acquired over the years by the various Member States, notably in crossborder cooperation, always bearing in mind the role of national authorities in the monitoring and evaluation of inspection and surveillance activities in dialogue with the sector and the national authorities, while not losing sight of objective regional differences or undermining the specific role of individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As we emphasise several times in the report, effective implementation of the common fisheries policy depends, first and foremost, on fishermen’s acceptance of and compliance with the rules governing fisheries, which will increase if fishermen’s organisations are enabled to participate in the decision-making process at all levels. We believe this to be a particularly important point.</p>
<p class="contents">It is just as important, however, to take measures to achieve a more effective use of national inspection and surveillance resources in selected fisheries or population units. These measures need to be examined and debated by all the interested parties, including fishermen’s organisations, producers, vessel owners and national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We would draw attention, however, to the high costs of using new technology, which is important in this area and in improving inspection and vigilance measures. As such use of new technology may require very substantial investment, however, sufficient funding must be provided in the Community budget, and support must be given to Member States needing it.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Commission’s intention of tabling a proposal to create a Joint Inspection Structure, based principally on a Community Fisheries Control Agency, with a view to ensuring coordination of national inspection and surveillance resources, we insist that the Commission must, in coordination with the Member States, undertake a feasibility study, on as broad a basis as possible, with regard to establishing an organisational structure for Community inspection and surveillance. This study should, above all, include a comparative cost-benefit analysis and consideration of better use of national means and the practical implications in terms of material, financial and human resources.</p>
<p class="contents">We also call on the Commission to explore models for cooperation at Community level in the field of monitoring and implementation that could offer an alternative to the proposal to create the aforementioned joint agency or structure, and which might well cost less. We insist on the need for such a study, therefore, before any subsequent decisions are taken. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to conclude by thanking all those who worked together to produce this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Following the reform of the common fisheries policy, the Member States and the Commission must now make every effort to ensure that the rules in force are correctly applied. In order to achieve this common objective, I believe that we are all in complete agreement that we need to step up cooperation in the area of monitoring. From this point of view, the Commission communication defines a strategy for cooperation and coordination between the Member States and at EU level, focusing on both short-term and medium-term goals. What we have drawn up is an action plan that seeks to establish a coherent strategy to ensure that the inspection and monitoring activities of the Member States – which are first and foremost their responsibility – are more effective, and to this end we propose three major areas of action.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these is the definition of inspection priorities for the most threatened stocks. This approach will then have to be extended to other activities, such as those involving the fishing of highly migratory species in the Mediterranean or the landing of vessels engaged in illegal fishing activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major area of action is the adoption of specific and transparent monitoring programmes that are tailored to the characteristics of the fisheries activities in question. We recommend that all the national authorities concerned should help to draw up programmes to cover inspection and monitoring at sea and, of course, the control of landings and marketing.</p>
<p class="contents">The third area is the improvement of cooperation to ensure that the monitoring and application of the rules are uniform and more effective. Experience shows that selective or voluntary cooperation is insufficient, particularly as regards access to information, operational cooperation and follow-up of irregularities and infringements. We agree with the industry that the inspection procedures should be harmonised.</p>
<p class="contents">Voluntary cooperation is therefore no longer enough, and in our view an organisational structure at Community level is now necessary. That is the reason for this feasibility study in which we hope to involve the Member States and interested parties – beginning, of course, with fishermen and their various communities, as mentioned by Mrs Figueiredo – the aim being to establish a joint inspection structure through a Community Fisheries Control Agency. This feasibility study will have in mind an agency responsible for the organisation and deployment of all of the means of inspection and monitoring according to the priorities to be established at Community level. In conclusion, the dialogue on this communication does not pose any problems and we thank Mrs Figueiredo again for her comments and her support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The uniform application of the CFP in all the Member States is an important challenge, undoubtedly, and we must therefore also congratulate the European Commission on its proposal. There can be no sound fisheries policy without real and effective control in which the fisheries sector itself also participates.</p>
<p class="contents">New technologies allow for better and greater control, and they must be used to improve compliance with the common fisheries policy. This control must not relate exclusively to fishing itself, but it must also, and this is very important, be extended to the other phases of the process, in other words, to the chain of marketing, transport, sales and so forth, also including controls in catering establishments. We therefore all agree that more homogeneity, more rationality, more resources and more budget are required.</p>
<p class="contents">I will dedicate the rest of the time available to me to a few brief comments on the report by Mrs McKenna since, although our group had requested a joint debate on these reports, this has not been the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the rapporteur and I am pleased that, both in the annual report by the Commission and in the report by Parliament, it is stressed that just four Member States have complied 100% with the requirements for the corresponding boxes in all segments of the fleet. These States are: Finland, Denmark, Spain and Portugal. In other words, there are 11 States which are not complying with them, and that is the most important thing in my view, together with the clear fact – and allow me to point this out as a Spanish person – that Spain is one of them. In this way I hope to counter, and I would like to make this clear, certain attempts to slander and discredit the Spanish fisheries sector. Spain, however, is one of only four States, I repeat, which comply with the fleet-reduction plans, and I believe it is necessary to stress this here, in the presence of other States and therefore of other representatives of other Member States which are non-compliant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The objective pursued – the coherent application of the common fisheries policy – should be extended to all Community policies and, furthermore, to European Union policies and Member States’ policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We call for coherence, not contradiction, between the various Community policies and also between the various aspects of the CFP. We must direct all actions of the common fisheries policy towards a common objective, that of sustainable fishing, which is the only way to make fishing a lasting activity. But the Union’s other policies, such as industrial policy or environmental policy, must also contribute to the preservation of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community institutions have become, as a result of the principle of subsidiarity, a form of legislative machinery which depends for its execution on the Member States, which means that this uniform and effective implementation depends on the goodwill of those States. By the same token, infringements and compliance or non-compliance also depend on them.</p>
<p class="contents">Violations of Community legislation are increasing, and this is undermining it and making it less and less effective. At the same time, calls for the renationalisation or regionalisation of Community policies such as the CFP are also increasing. Nevertheless, I would like to remind you that the draft European Constitution lays down four exclusive competences for the Union and that one of them is precisely the management of fisheries sources.</p>
<p class="contents">The parliamentary Group of the Party of European Socialists is therefore pleased that the Commission is proposing the creation of a common inspection structure. We have called for this common structure in numerous resolutions, such as the one adopted in relation to the Green Paper on the reform of the CFP. The Commission, therefore, has the support of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In Spain, the Count of Romanones, who was a minister during the era of the Restoration, at the beginning of the twentieth century, said: ‘laws are for Parliament, but leave the regulations to me’. Well, the objective of sustainable fishing will not be achieved on the basis of laws or on the basis of regulations, which are necessary but insufficient. It is essential to involve, on the one hand, the Member States and, on the other, all the agents who participate in the sector, in the broadest sense, including marketing, so that we can achieve this objective. Moreover, action cannot be restricted to the Community framework – as we see in every meeting of the Committee on Fisheries – since the causes of many of the problems facing our fishing arise at international level, and it is at that level that solutions can be found. Cooperation between the various administrations is therefore essential if we want the CFP to be successful. Furthermore, the regional and local administrations, which often, as in the case of marketing, are responsible for applying Community rules, must also feel that they are participating in decision-making. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is extremely important that we have uniform rules and uniform monitoring procedures. That is very important if we are to have fair competition in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that it is important that the monitoring be organised at international level as far as possible, so that north, south, east and west all have the same feeling about the completion of the monitoring. I should like to emphasise that there are a great many plans, that we all want structural change, but I should like to add that the financing of this must be temporary. We must not give a permanent allowance for the implementation of these structural changes.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say another thing about the practical implementation in the future. I think that changes are necessary, and they can only be achieved if the fishermen’s organisations are willing to cooperate. There are sufficient individual examples of this in the European Union, but there is too little structure.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to make another plea for something that the North Sea Commission Fisheries Partnership has already introduced, namely letting biologists sail on fishing vessels. This means that they no longer miss the boat, since they are following in their own little boat. We must ensure that ecology and economy want to share the same future; changes can also be made much more effectively if that desire is there. I should like to draw attention to this system, therefore, and also make a renewed call for new, improved methods: that is to say, research into acoustic methods for distinguishing species of fish, and a review of the situation regarding by-catches – as it is incredibly important that we form a picture of not only the main catch, but also the by-catch. It is important, therefore, that we are also able to record that picture by landing the catch and, at landing, recording everything that comes out. This is how to make a real contribution to the future of the fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, by way of conclusion, I should like to make one more small remark: it would also be useful if the rights were transferable in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We therefore congratulate the rapporteur on the clarity and courage of her report.</p>
<p class="contents">Secret and illegal activities, poaching and clandestine trade jeopardise the entire activity of professional fishermen. This activity will only be politically and socially objective and economically profitable if the controls are effective, fair, clear, transparent and identical in all of the EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, today they are notoriously inadequate. To strengthen them, they must be streamlined and modernised. We need to develop controls on satellite positioning and improve logbooks, and each state must establish substantial and adequate human and material resources. States are responsible for controls, as you pointed out; they must continue to be responsible for them, but they must improve and strengthen them. The European Union must coordinate them and the Commission’s specialised fisheries departments must assess the impact of this improvement. If the impact of these controls continues to be insufficient, and only if this is the case, perhaps we will have to consider the possibility of a joint inspection structure, which would be supported in particular by a Community Fisheries Control Agency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our common fisheries policy is only as strong as its weakest link. This means that monitoring is particularly important, because it is only by means of effective quota management that we shall be able to conduct a successful common fisheries policy in the future, too. For that reason, I have tabled a number of amendments, also on behalf of my group, which the Committee on Fisheries and the rapporteur have taken over; for this I thank them.</p>
<p class="contents">Differences in the Member States’ monitoring methods must be eliminated. For that reason, we strongly advocate a Community office to monitor the enforcement of the CFP. That policy would also benefit from being firmly rooted in society and from confidence on the part of the sector itself. Consequently, we have campaigned for the possibility of setting up transnational producer organisations. Enabling cross-border coordination gives a system of sustainable fishing a broader basis. The efforts of fishermen are indispensable in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">On that point, I should also like to call once more for particular attention to the shrimp sector. For years, this sector had a system of sustainable fishing, which earned the praise of many. However, a national competition authority<span class="bold"> </span>in the Netherlands intervened, and this was brought to an abrupt end. On behalf of my group, I should like to make an emphatic plea, including to the Commission, that Commissioner Fischler make a commitment to permitting these producer organisations. This is incorporated into an amendment which I have tabled, and the Committee on Fisheries has approved.</p>
<p class="contents">Too much and too often, the efforts of other Commissioners seem to frustrate Commissioner Fischler in that regard. I am referring in particular to Commissioners Monti and Bolkestein, whose portfolios include competition policy. An excessively liberal approach on the part of one section of the Commission must not frustrate the social position of fishermen and the environmental situation in the North Sea. In that sense, too, I am very happy with this report. The Commission would do well to realise that the efforts of fisheries’ producer organisations, in particular – including across borders – will be indispensable to a genuinely rigorous approach to the fisheries issue in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proper control and monitoring of the common fisheries policy and the even-handed implementation of the rules is, of course, the only way to return a semblance of credit to this much discredited common policy. However, I have to say that any new control system will require the cooperation of the sector, of the fishermen themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The fishermen are rapidly losing any respect they ever may have had for this discredited policy. For example, take what happened last week. The same week as the ICES published its most recent report, calling for the complete closure of the cod fishery around Britain and Ireland, the Council of Ministers tore open the Irish Box and tore open the economic exclusion zone around the Azores and Madeira, allowing a virtual free-for-all in some of the most sensitive spawning and nursery grounds in European waters.</p>
<p class="contents">This was a decision based on political pressure; it owed nothing to conservation and everything to politics. It is decisions like this that have brought the whole CFP into disrepute. How can our fishermen believe that their endless hardship is in the name of conservation, when they see decisions like this being taken which fly in the face of common sense?</p>
<p class="contents">It is also time that the Commission tackled the disgrace of the two million tonnes of good healthy fish that are discarded dead back into the sea every year in the name of conservation. The public will no longer tolerate this needless waste which has become emblematic of the failed CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to Mrs Figueiredo for trying to breathe life back into the corpse of this discredited policy, but I fear it may be too late for resuscitation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
