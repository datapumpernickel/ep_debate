Three mayors of towns in S.E. Turkey, who are supporters of the same party, were also arrested on charges of collaborating with the PKK. Other Turkish parties besides HADEP have voiced their opposition to the arrests and sentences, arguing that they are a flagrant breach of democracy, freedom of expression and the basic principles of the rule of law.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Human rights violations by Turkey</span></p>
<p class="contents">In December 1999 Turkey became a candidate country for accession to the European Union. Article 10 of the conclusions of the Helsinki Council Presidency states that Turkey must fulfil the general accession criteria, and in particular the Copenhagen criteria, if it is to become a Member of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In February of this year three Kurdish mayors (of the towns of Diyarbakir, Siirt and Bingöl) were arrested on their return to Turkey after they had signed the Aalborg Charter in Hanover in Germany together with 4 colleagues making their towns members of the ‘European Sustainable Cities and Towns Campaign’; they are still being held in prison.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Turkey is guilty of continuous and repeated human rights violations, what does the Council intend to do prevail upon Turkey to meet the EU accession criteria?</p>

Three mayors of towns in south-eastern Turkey who are close to this party have also been arrested on charges of collaborating with the PKK. Other Turkish parties apart from HADEP have expressed their opposition to these arrests and sentences, arguing that this move is totally incompatible with democracy, freedom of expression and the basic principles of the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Council say whether it intends to raise with the Turkish government the issue of the arrest and sentencing of democrats merely for making statements and to demand, as part of the pre-accession procedure, that Turkey give guarantees regarding unrestricted freedom of expression and allow all political parties to be founded and function without hindrance?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will continue to monitor this situation in Turkey as it develops and to act accordingly. An Association Council meeting was held yesterday between the European Union and Turkey in which this issue was mentioned again. The Turkish authorities were told of the EU’s concern about this type of issue and of its hope that the Turkish authorities will end what is currently interpreted as a non-compliance with certain basic criteria of respect for human and democratic rights and the protection of minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey was named by the Helsinki European Council as a candidate country for accession to the European Union. This status places Turkey in absolutely the same position as any other candidate country in terms of both obligations and benefits. Therefore, Turkey is subject to the same requirements as those imposed on any other candidate country but also naturally has the same rights. The European Union cannot make a special case of Turkey which must be treated exactly the same as any other candidate country.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is therefore currently involved in a process in which its situation must be assessed in light of the criteria of the Copenhagen European Council. These criteria are clear enough with regard to respect for the rule of law, democratic guarantees, fundamental freedoms and the protection of minorities. These are a prerequisite for the opening of any negotiating process. On the road towards this, a pre-accession strategy must be established between the Commission, on the EU’s behalf, and Turkey. The preparation of this strategy involves non-governmental organisations, the Member States and the Turkish Government. This accession partnership will define the priority areas for reform on which the European Union considers that Turkey must concentrate its efforts in order to comply, hopefully in a progressive, capable and complete manner, with the Copenhagen criteria. Clearly it is in this context that the issues mentioned in the questions will be considered.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet, both yesterday and today they underlined the supposed progress made by the Turkish regime in that area. And we heard the representative of the Council telling us the same thing today. The truth, however, is that contrary to what some people are claiming even in Greece, the Helsinki decisions on Turkey have emboldened the Turkish regime. It is no mere chance that on the next day Turkey’s leaders declared that Turkey has become a candidate for accession without attached conditions. It is not by chance that, while they have not complied with any of their commitments, they protest that they have not been given the appropriations provided for under customs union. They also told us that Turkey intends to take steps. But we have been hearing that in the Council of Europe for very many years, perhaps more than ten, without anything happening. If anything, things are worse. The campaigner for democracy and human rights who was shot was sent to prison again instead of his attackers being punished. </p>
<p class="contents">My question, then, is: specifically when does the Turkish regime intend to progress with democratising that country’s constitution and criminal code, to set free the leaders of HADEP and the Members of Parliament as well as all the political prisoners? Will the Kurdish issue ever be resolved, will all the political parties be allowed freedom of formation and operation and finally, will Turkey ever withdraw its troops from Cyprus? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the Turkish authorities are well aware of this. With regard to defining the pre-accession strategy and the accession partnership, Turkey’s problems will certainly be paid close attention, particularly in terms of respect for the basic criteria of acting in accordance with European standards. In the past Turkey was a country in which we regularly and systematically undertook certain ad hoc initiatives according to the development of its internal situation.</p>
<p class="contents">But no more! The internal situation is now becoming a strategic element in the progress made by Turkey towards approximation with the European Union. In the specific case of Mr Birdal, I was able to meet him in Turkey in January of this year and I told him during this meeting of the EU’s solidarity with his situation. It is clear in this respect that the EU has already indicated its concern to the Turkish authorities, through the appropriate channels, about his status and in particular his return to prison. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us therefore acknowledge the obvious and return to tried and tested prescriptions. In other words, let us speak of interests, the balance of powers and policy as the art of the possible.

In fact, quite the contrary is true. The ongoing process of Turkey’s approximation towards the European Union, which was started with its designation as a candidate in Helsinki, is one of progressive approximation. The Member should realise that this process of progressive approximation is resulting in greater attention being paid than in the past by the European Union to Turkey’s internal situation and to the way in which this country acts with regard to the requirements imposed by the international community. It is this point which really must be borne in mind. Turkey is currently, on its own initiative and therefore as a result of its own political decision, the subject of close scrutiny in terms of compliance with the basic criteria. This is not to be assessed over the next ten years but rather on a daily basis, usually within the pre-accession strategy process. If there were a lack of progress on the fundamental issues under observation, the pre-accession process would suffer the respective consequences. This is very clear to me.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Helsinki conclusions, regardless of how they may be read, place the issue of Turkey and its relationship with Cyprus in a new perspective, which was in fact welcomed by the Cypriot authorities. We must draw from this the appropriate conclusions about how the development in the Turkish position on the Cypriot issue may also affect the development of the Turkish position in its approximation towards the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reinforcement of the political dialogue agreed in Helsinki requires progress to be made towards compliance with these political criteria, particularly on issues of human rights. All the situations which have been brought to the Council’s attention during the pre-accession process will be tackled.</p>
<p class="contents">This particular question involves the problem of non-recognition by the Turkish authorities of the Assyrian-Chaldean community under the terms of the Lausanne Treaty of 1923. Under this Treaty, the Turkish Government undertook to ensure full protection for the churches, synagogues, cemeteries and other places of worship of non-Muslim minorities. At this point in time, the claims of the Assyrian-Chaldean community basically relate to the problem of restoring monasteries and the official teaching of Aramaic and the problem connected with the free movement of citizens from this ethnic group who live outside Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">These are clearly administrative issues. They do have a human rights dimension which obviously must be tackled – and we will be vigilant in this respect – but they are essentially administrative. The Council will be vigilant and the Commission will also raise these issues during the pre-accession negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the Council were truly concerned about human rights one would have expected a more specific answer. We are talking here about two very ancient peoples who have been subjected to systematic genocide by the Turkish regime, a genocide perhaps not so impressive as in Armenia, but just as effective. Several thousand people have become refugees or immigrants to the European Union and only a few tens of thousands remain in the area where they have lived since ancient times. I would like to ask whether you can be more specific. Of course, your reference to the Treaty of Lausanne is apt, but beyond that, the European Union also has a responsibility to stress certain things to the Turkish regime concerning the need to respect human rights, whether they stem from the Treaty of Lausanne or in a broader sense.

The Council accepts the urgent need to find a solution to the continued outbreaks of ethnic violence, particularly against the Serbs, gypsies and other non-Albanian communities in Kosovo. The Council has been consistently supporting the efforts made by UNMIK and KFOR to prevent further expulsions and to allow the safe return of all those who abandoned their homes. In response to an urgent appeal from the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative, Doctor Bernard Kouchner, and from the High Representative, Mr Solana, the Member States have significantly increased their contributions to the UN’s international police forces with both financial and technical support and human resources. Several Member States have also reinforced their own contingents in KFOR. In the past in this House, we have deeply regretted the failure to meet these commitments, which has clearly hindered the action of the international authorities in Kosovo. There are now new elements involved and some of these commitments are now being met. This is allowing this issue to be handled differently and more effectively, although we are clearly still a long way from achieving a minimally acceptable solution. The Council has urged all the political leaders in Kosovo to adopt urgent measures to combat the escalation of violence, to reject expressions of extremism and to support UNMIK and KFOR. It is very important that the Council manages to further develop the progress already made in the reconciliation between the ethnic groups and that Resolution 1244 can be put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">We are committed to the process of democratisation and coexistence in Kosovo. Only responsibility-sharing by representatives of the minorities can lead to the construction of a multi-ethnic Kosovo. We should all ask ourselves whether everyone, particularly within Kosovo itself, is interested in the existence of a multi-ethnic Kosovo. In this context, the Council repeats its appeal to the Serbian leaders to participate in the joint interim administrative structures. The Council places great importance on the careful preparation by UNMIK and the OSCE of local elections to be held this year, including the provisions on voting by absentees and the participation of minorities. We believe it is important to start creating legitimate structures with local authority in Kosovo. This is the only way we can guarantee that the political forces which are currently working in an unorganised manner, outside any institutions, will return to normal political life and end up working in Kosovo within a democratic society.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of supporting this process of democratisation and coexistence, the European Union has been working together with other international partners to re-establish daily life for the whole of Kosovo’s population, whatever their ethnic background. In addition to the important bilateral assistance given by the Member States, the European Community has allocated humanitarian aid for 1999 to 2000 to the amount of EUR 429 million for the Kosovar refugees, displaced persons within the country and those returning home. The aid for reconstruction and the special financial assistance, including the support for UNMIK, will total EUR 437 million between 1999 and 2000. This set of actions and the commitment shown by the EU in this respect have been recognised by the international community. Unfortunately, at times the practical efficiency of these actions is not sufficient to end an unstable situation beset by tensions which we hope will decrease in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not ignoring the major difficulties present on the ground in applying these decisions. There is no point on this issue using euphemisms or diplomatic language. The mass return of the Albanians expelled from Kosovo and the tension which has arisen in the meantime, particularly involving Serbian, gypsy and other minorities, have ended up creating a new and different situation. However, we should not only look at the present. We must consider what happened in the past which was the cause of all this. Perhaps by looking at the causes of this situation, rather than fixing on the present, we will have a fairer and more objective view of the partial responsibility of the Belgrade Government, particularly with regard to what happened to it subsequently due to its actions in Kosovo. However, it is true that, for the Serbian minorities who have had to leave the country since the return of the Kosovo Albanians, the conditions have not yet been established to allow them to return. Those still living in Kosovo are having problems coexisting with the Albanian majority. However, the Member must recognise the clear efforts being made by the international community to protect these minorities and to achieve a safe situation allowing them to coexist with the Albanians. We cannot ignore the fact that this joint effort also needs the Serbian authorities to be involved in the consultative structures. This would be one way of making its own actions in Kosovo credible. Our only objective is to guarantee the continuation of multi-ethnic integration. We realise that there is a long way to go and probably the situation of the Serbs living outside Kosovo, and who cannot return because it is unsafe, is unfair. There is no point beating about the bush on this. This situation is unfair. However, we must realise that the international community is doing its best. Furthermore, we should always remember what happened before, in order to justify what is happening now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have some great friends in Greece where I have spent several holidays. As for the situation you describe, Mr Purvis, I do not believe that the policy is disastrous. This is the only possible policy, as you know, and it is a result of everything that has happened in the region in the last few years and even in the last few decades. We must realise that the international community’s position, which is not brilliant in terms of the practical application of these measures, is the only one which can resolve a conflict on which the international community was only called to act due to the total inability to find a solution within the Former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">It was precisely the situation created in the Former Yugoslavia which caused this reaction. You refer to the KLA. Remember that the KLA only exists because the Albanian community in Kosovo was systematically persecuted and totally besieged. Clearly the need to organise themselves militarily to respond to this threat led to the KLA’s action. The problem now facing us is to try and ensure that the structures created outside the democratic process, simply because this did not exist in the Former Yugoslavia, allow an approach of solely political action to be adopted in a democratic Kosovo. We are still a long way off from finding such an approach, but I believe that the international community’s action is very positive in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We agree, however, that this is the result of a policy which has been pursued up until now, that is to say a result of what has happened. My question is this: is the Council giving any consideration to how this policy can be changed in the future, or is the intention to go on using the same tools, that is to say military action and initiatives against troublesome areas in the region?

If I did I would ask them what other solution they propose. As a specific example of what military forces can do, I would refer you to the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Just think what the situation was like there for several years. Just think about the international community’s failure to act faced with this problem and then just look at the situation today. This is clearly unstable but it is one of peace due to the presence of the military forces. It is clear that there are certain situations in which attempts to deflect ethnic tensions can only be successful by using mechanisms which involve the protection and separation of the waters. This is very probably what is needed in Kosovo, who knows for how long, but hopefully for the shortest time possible. We should also bear in mind that the international community and particularly the Member States have no specific interest in intervening in Kosovo and in mobilising human and physical resources for an action of this kind. In fact quite the contrary. The international community and the European Union in particular were aware that it was their duty and responsibility to react to a totally disgraceful situation in terms of international standards of behaviour. It was the genocide and siege behaviour of Mr Milosevic with regard to the Albanian community in Kosovo which led to our intervention. You say that the practical result of this action is not what was wanted. I would point out, however, that the practical result is that today, with a few exceptions and despite everything, this situation is under control in terms of security. We have made and are making efforts to achieve greater integration of the minority communities. A more effective result has not been possible. We will try to continue exerting pressure in this respect and we believe that renewing in some way the institutional organisation of civil society through independent elections may contribute significantly to this stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given that UNMIK and its head, Bernard Kouchner, do not act of their own accord, but under international supervision in which the Council is also involved, the latter should scrutinise their actions more closely where they affect the interests of European undertakings, if it wishes to avoid raising doubts about its intentions though the answers it gives. Furthermore, the proper management of the fourth Pillar entails a number of additional obligations for the EU institutions. Since the Commission, which is unfortunately taking an unconscionable amount of time to reply, is well aware of the actions of the undertakings concerned, and in order to avoid any doubts about whether the Council is responsible for failing to act, will the latter say to what extent it is prepared to act in accordance with the obligations imposed on it by the Treaties and to support the interests of the undertakings in question?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, neither the European Union as such nor the Council has any competence or direct responsibility with regard to the administration of the territory and the protection of the individual interests of undertakings in the region.

Either the services are not doing their job properly and are giving you wrong information, or there is something rotten in the Kingdom of Denmark and there are many who say that there is something peculiar about Mr Kouchner’s administration. My question is this: if the services are not doing their job properly, what are you going to do when they leave you high and dry? If Mr Kouchner is not doing his job properly, what are you going to do about it? And the third question: how can it be that the citizens of the European Union are being called upon to pay for the Stability Pact even though European undertakings established there cannot be protected by the European Union? That does not happen anywhere, it is unreasonable. We should therefore see things as they are, because my impression is that Mr Kouchner is not playing his part properly there.

We have already discussed in this House the Special Meeting, which was held in Lisbon on 23, and 24 March. At this it was clear that improving the Information Society policy is central to achieving the objectives which this meeting set and which involve the issues of employment, social cohesion and reinforcement of Europe’s competitiveness at world level.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular the Special Meeting invited the Council and Commission to prepare an action plan on e-Europe, which will be presented, to the European Council in June. The idea of launching an agency devoted to information technology was presented at the Lisbon European Council in the document provided by the Swedish Government. This idea was not followed up but it responds to our concerns and will definitely be considered and developed in the future. It was discussed, however, particularly in terms of possibly being added to the existing Community mechanisms, which include the Information Society Project Office. This has been producing a range of initiatives during the Portuguese presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of a possible European telecommunications regulation agency, I would remind you that a study carried out for the Commission in October 1999 concluded that there was no immediate need for such a body. At the same time the Council concluded that regulation should be applied at the closest possible level to that at which the activities to be regulated are carried out. This too involves the principle of subsidiarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was pleased to see that the issue of information technology and its link to growth and employment were so high on the agenda in Lisbon. What happens in the future is important. The political task is not, of course, to set up IT companies but to build an infrastructure which stimulates development in this area. We do, of course, have shortcomings within the EU. Moreover, there are major differences between the EU’s Member States and also between different regions within the EU. Different population groups have varying opportunities and knowledge when it comes to exploiting this technology, and this may lead to great inequality in the future. </p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask the question: how are we successfully to devise a form of coordination which enables information technology also to be used out in the peripheral areas so that we create greater equality between different regions and between different population groups? Is there not a need for a joint authority to coordinate this work? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first concerns the substantive issue of democratising the Information Society itself, which was at the root of the concerns of the Lisbon European Council. This involves the need to spread throughout European society, precisely in the area where it is less competitive and in order to give added value to the usual elements of its economy, all these new dimensions of the society of innovation and knowledge. This effort is scheduled to use specific measures contained in the conclusions of the Lisbon European Council, particularly with regard to the Internet and methods of apprenticeship and vocational training. In our opinion, these may be able to form a future action plan, which will be assessed every year at special meetings of the European Council, which will always take place in the spring. This is the answer to your first question.</p>
<p class="contents">Your other question concerns the need to have an organisational structure and an institution to supervise this process and to pay specific attention to the similarity between these types of question within the European Union. You rightly make the point that on many occasions specifying these measures may create and worsen inequalities. This is a danger and risk to which we are alert. In the meantime, the governments have decided that the creation of a new structure and bureaucratic mechanism with high costs is not necessary. They in fact consider that the structures which currently exist for monitoring this process are sufficient for this purpose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are objective commitments which the governments assumed in signing these conclusions and which involve the reorientation of the mechanisms and structures and action plans and programmes which exist within the European Union. With the exception of the possibility of recourse to the European Investment Bank, there are no new elements in this respect for mobilising financial resources. This was one of the objective concerns raised during discussions of this issue in Lisbon. It was decided to try and achieve greater coherence between the current instruments for the simple reason that we believe that, rather than creating new instruments, we should reorganise the current ones. Having said this, it is necessary, as we have done in the employment and macroeconomic policies, to try and achieve greater coherence between the national actions on the society of innovation and knowledge and to ensure that these actions are subject to a specific plan which each Member State undertakes to implement internally. This will occur in accordance with a set timetable of objectives and using benchmarking processes which allow us to see which are the best practices and to try, based on these, to encourage similar practices in the other Member States. This process has this national dimension of a commitment on objectives and it is therefore obvious that there are no financial resources for this other than those available in the budget of each country. In the other dimension, in which recourse to the European Investment Bank is possible, there is a set of actions within the competence of the EU itself, which not only complements previous actions but also ensures greater coherence between the EU’s programmes and actions in this area. The Commission has been extremely active in this field and the e-Europe programme presented by the Commission and whose action plan will be approved at the Feira European Council in June provides new guidelines for this area and a new reorientation of Community policies on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It concerns the involvement of women in the common foreign and security policy and the new crisis management structures, such as the security and conflict-prevention political committee. The Member has asked whether the Council will be taking due account of women’s particular skills in working for peace. It is quite clear that the contribution of women in working for peace and in other similar respects, particularly in mobilising civil society, is well-known and unquestionable. We all know, without bothering to be diplomatic about this, that the role and representation of women in the decision-making process, either within the CFSP or generally within other structures, is inadequate. We all know the efforts made by the international community in this area and we remember the conclusions of the Beijing Declaration of 1995 on this issue. Next June there will be a Special Session of the UN General Assembly to draw international attention to the need for women to be involved in actions implemented within the Beijing Declaration. In particular, specific measures will be taken to encourage this involvement.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be realised that pro-active policies do not work in some areas of the decision-making process. Greater involvement is needed in political actions, in the training process and in the administrative process in general. We believe it is impossible to implement just one specific action, for example introducing quotas in the common foreign and security policy structures. In our opinion, this is not appropriate and the Council has made no proposal in this respect. However, it is the responsibility of each national government to carry out the necessary reforms of its own system of representation in order to guarantee adequate participation by women. These issues are now being regulated at European level and recommendations are being made as a result of the Treaty of Amsterdam. We believe that, as all representation within the European Union is carried out by people from the Member States, it is the latter which are mainly responsible for mobilising as many women as possible who can rise within the decision-making process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have said that you are against quotas but in favour of references. I would like to ask the Portuguese Presidency: do you not think it would be highly appropriate to include a reference, in the form of a recommendation, in this respect? I believe that the role of the European Union should not be to remain behind the United Nations or to be content merely with a reference to what Beijing was about. The European Union must be progressive.

However, I am sure you are aware of the limits of what we can do, particularly in an area such as this. I have no hesitation in saying this because in my own departments 80% of the officials are women, even in managerial posts. It is therefore clear that hope must always be the last resort of political action and that equal opportunities and equal representation of the sexes must be the practical and specific goal in our daily life and actions. To be totally frank and at the risk of being considered behind the times, I do believe that there are limits to what can be achieved by pro-active political action in this area. Bearing in mind these limits, it will be rather difficult, when we set out to assess the new common foreign and security policy structures in terms of defence, to say to the Military Committee or the Military Staff that half of their soldiers should be female. This is because it is up to the Member States whether or not they have female generals or brigadiers. Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I cannot raise an issue like this just to appear politically correct.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Participation of research partners from the developing countries in environmental research programmes funded by the EU</span></p>
<p class="contents">The key to the development of the developing countries is their ability to participate in development work themselves both as definers of problems and as seekers for solutions. On the other hand, at EU level this approach is being poorly applied in relation to science and technology projects affecting developing countries. The EU’s framework programmes do not extend to the developing countries. This means that North African partners, for example, are not able to be involved in science and technology projects relating to the environment. In fact no-one is preventing them from carrying out the research, but there are no funding opportunities, and thus the developing countries have no access to consortia as partners entitled to apply for funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is this not the case, given that opportunities have been devised for even Russia, for example, to be involved? Has the matter been considered from the point of view of the extent to which, for example, desertification in North Africa or the problems of the Mediterranean affect the EU? Is the EU prepared to provide greater responsibility in the form of funding to local researchers, so that research activities can combine even after the funding bodies have left, and to ensure that projects can be carried out without the investment of local researchers?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One aspect of this Framework Programme is its four thematic programmes, which define priority areas for research, and its three horizontal programmes. One of the latter is entitled ‘Confirming the international role of Community research’ and is intended to promote scientific and technological cooperation at international level and to help implement Community foreign policy in this area. The general objectives of this international scientific cooperation are also set out in this Framework Programme and include support for the development of a Euro-Mediterranean partnership and a contribution to the economic, social and scientific development of developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In December 1998, the Council also adopted rules on participation by undertakings, research centres and universities and on disseminating research results in order to implement the Fifth Framework Programme. With regard to the participation of legal entities of third countries and international organisations, all the indirect research activities under the thematic programmes are open to research bodies in Mediterranean non-Community countries and developing countries, in principle without Community financing. The only exception to this involves situations in which Community financing is regarded as absolutely vital to achieve the aims of the activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 6 of the Framework Programme authorises the participation by entities of third countries in specific research and technological development activities under the horizontal programme on the international role of Community research. In January last year, the Council adopted the specific programmes for the Fifth Framework Programme which set out the objectives and activities for the various categories of third countries. With regard to Mediterranean non-Community countries, an indicative allocation of EUR 55 million was established for research and development activities such as integrated coastal management in the Mediterranean, including environmental aspects, water management, natural resource management, conservation and restoration of the cultural heritage, socio-economic modernisation and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to developing countries, an indicative allocation of EUR 210 million was made available for specific activities such as those involving the adoption of innovations, the promotion of a sustainable relationship between population pressure, food safety and the use and management of ecosystems, the improvement of productivity and the prevention of damage to natural resources.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, a grant system was created under a specific programme which allows graduates and doctoral students from developing countries and Mediterranean non-Community countries to work on European projects. Funds were also allocated for coordination with Community technical assistance programmes, including the MEDA and EDF programmes, and also for Latin America and Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">The application of these three decisions is clearly the Commission’s responsibility, supported by the committees for the relevant programmes. So far calls for specific proposals aimed at developing and Mediterranean countries have been made with a total budget of EUR 85.5 million. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These structures were established on this date. Their activities are currently being developed so that they can assume a more specific and practical form and in particular so that the definitive model which we believe could start to operate next year can be agreed. In parallel with the work on these practical aspects, a discussion is ongoing within the European Union on determining the mechanisms for participation both by EU Member States which are not members of NATO and by NATO countries which are not EU Member States. This discussion is occurring within the overall context of action on the Petersberg tasks specified in the Treaty of Amsterdam. The question which has arisen and which has also been raised by the Member – for which I thank you as it is my responsibility to chair the preparatory group of the Intergovernmental Conference – concerns the extent to which this issue may or may not fall within the scope of the IGC. It will only be placed on the IGC’s agenda if and when it is confirmed that amendments need to be made to the Treaty on European Union in order to bring these structures into practical operation. It is still not clear at this stage of our debate within the European Union whether or not amendments to the Treaty will be necessary. As soon as this becomes clear, we will announce this. The Portuguese Presidency will present a report to the Feira European Council in June giving an assessment of the state of progress and an opinion on whether or not these issues should be included within the IGC. If these are to be included, this would only be confirmed during the French Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are not talking about defence policy but about crisis management for which powers are now included within the Treaties. The issue in question is not therefore a European defence policy or the creation of a European army. The issue is crisis management and humanitarian actions which are commonly referred to in Community parlance as the ‘Petersberg tasks’. All the EU countries, including yours, can make a valuable contribution to this area. We are trying at the moment not to create a European defence policy but rather a common culture of security allowing us to participate in crisis management. In this respect, I can see no major problems. We hope to ensure that all the various cultures which exist within the Union are compatible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, our intention is to guarantee that these actions are totally compatible with what currently exists in the relations between certain EU Member States and the NATO countries. The reason for this is that the mechanisms and means which exist for managing these crises are not extensive. In fact, most of the time, these means belong to NATO. As it is the means for military and security action which currently exist within the EU and NATO which will be mobilised, it is therefore essential to guarantee effective cooperation with all the NATO countries, including non-Community countries and particularly the candidate countries such as Turkey, Norway and Iceland. It is clear that at a much wider level and bearing in mind the dimension of the operations, these actions will also require the involvement of the United States of America and Canada. We therefore need broad cooperation which aims to guarantee the sharing of responsibility among all those countries which currently have a similar security and defence culture and objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is also asking whether the Council intends to intercede with the Greek authorities. I should like to explain that, under Article 6(1) of the Treaty on European Union, as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union respects a set of basic principles by reference to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The underlying aim of this article is to establish a kind of political supervision over the actions of Member States and to ensure that democratic principles and values are respected. It is intended to guarantee the sharing of common values. However, Article 6 cannot be invoked for the purpose of any type of interference in the administration of the internal affairs of Member States, particularly at judicial level. The Union has no competence to intercede in the exercise of legal power by the Member States. Therefore, the Council cannot interfere in the decision-making of the authorities. The judgement delivered by the Court of First Instance of Thessaloniki, which is a judgement of a legal body of a Member State on a specific case, may be subject within the Greek legal system to an appeal to the higher national courts. Having exhausted this recourse to the Greek courts, there would always be recourse to the Court of Human Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A case like this, in a democratic country like Greece, meets all the conditions to be judged and handled within the Greek legal system until the capacities for recourse within this system are exhausted.
