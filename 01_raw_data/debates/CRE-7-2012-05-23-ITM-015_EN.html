We will have 9 billion people on the planet in 2050, that in 15 years’ time, we will see a doubling to 3 billion of the number of people with a median income, that we need a planet and a half to meet the needs of our consumers and soon enough we will need three planets – and we simply do not have them. Commodity prices have risen by 150% in the past 10 years, in an economy that is addicted to cheap raw materials. This is costing our economy billions, no, hundreds of billions a year extra.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, what we need in Europe is an action plan, a concrete action plan to address this. The Commission’s road map, for which I would like to warmly congratulate Commissioner Potočnik, is an excellent start. The Commission’s analysis and approach are very good. However, what I find still to be missing is a greater degree of urgency and robustness, and that is precisely what we, as Parliament, are now making clear. You can see that not only in the content of the report, but in its structure too, where we have set six key priorities in the Committee on the Environment. I would now like to run through all the six priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it is very important that we agree with industry a joint action plan on business to enable Europe to use raw materials more efficiently. We need to do that together, because infrastructure needs to be adapted, regulations must be simplified and adapted, but businesses, too, need to realise that they have a lot to do to produce more efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">The second key priority is that we really need to move towards a single recycling and reuse market. It must be made easier to export waste containing valuable raw materials across borders. That is linked to tax incentives for the use of secondary raw materials. Secondary raw materials should ultimately be cheaper than their primary counterparts and we need tax incentives for that, too.</p>
<p class="contents">The third key priority is the promotion of research and development. We need to develop alternatives and we need to help the recycling industry to professionalise even further.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, we need to extend the Ecodesign Directive. It is currently only focused on energy, but we must also ensure easier recovery of raw materials in products and that begins as early as the design stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth, we need to integrate the term, the idea of ‘resource efficiency’, into other policy areas; in the field of agriculture, where we need to deal more efficiently with water, in fisheries, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The sixth key priority is that Europe should develop clear environmental indicators and, as far as this Parliament is concerned, this should be based on the concept of footprints. Measurement is knowledge and that is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the more I have worked on this issue, the more I have realised that this is not primarily an environmental agenda. This is an economic agenda. We need to deal more efficiently with raw materials in order to keep our economy afloat in the future. I have already mentioned the extra hundreds of billions of euro that the increase in the price of raw materials is going to cost industry every year.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the real agenda and I am, therefore, surprised that the Council – which is unfortunately not attending this debate – is not playing ball. In other words, I am surprised that the Council is not showing enough ambition to rally Europe-wide support for this action plan so that we can progress towards much more efficient management of raw materials. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It reaffirms the political importance of the resource efficiency agenda and the urgency of the need to take action in order to respond to the economic and environmental challenges we face.</p>
<p class="contents">Resource constraints are a real global trend that we must certainly address. The economic crisis has demonstrated the need for urgent changes in the economy and the need to consider our growth model. Without new policies, we will put even more pressure on the environment, we will not deliver on our climate change targets, and we will expose our economy and well-being to systemic risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainable resource use is the condition for the long-term resilience and competitiveness of our economies. Resource efficiency is also a promising source of growth and jobs, which offers multiple benefits and opportunities for business and policy making in the short, medium and also long term.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has laid out its vision for the path to sustainable growth and competitiveness in the long-term strategies under the Europe 2020 resource efficiency flagship initiative, ranging from energy to transport to climate, water and biodiversity. We have integrated resource efficiency into our proposals for cohesion, for research, for development, and for agricultural and fisheries policies. I hope that the outcomes of the legislative process will match the ambition you show today so that we can address the scale of the resource challenges we really face.</p>
<p class="contents">With the road map to a resource efficient Europe, we have put on the table a coherent framework to achieve the 2050 vision of sustainability. The Commission has proposed a set of 2020 milestones and concrete actions to start the process of transformation. Resource efficiency policies are approached from three angles, and I am glad to see from your report that you share this view of the priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we highlight the need to provide the horizontal conditions for transformation of the economy. We address consumption and production, emphasise the importance of measures such as ecodesign, and highlight the importance of research and innovation, and the crucial need to phase out inefficient subsidies and shift to environmental taxation. Turning waste into a valuable resource is key to boosting the resource productivity of the EU economy and also enhancing growth. Full implementation of EU waste legislation alone would save EUR 72 billion a year, increase the annual turnover of the EU waste management and recycling sector by EUR 42 billion, and create over 400 000 jobs by 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the nature target. We should try to ensure that our natural capital and the ecosystem services this provides are used efficiently in the short and long term, as they are the foundation of our economy and our quality of life. This reflects the broad definition of resources that the Commission seeks to promote.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we target the economic sectors that are responsible for the greatest share of environmental impacts – namely food, buildings and mobility. I am glad to see that you also put these as a first priority in your report.</p>
<p class="contents">Governance is the key element of the strategy because resource efficiency is an integration agenda and EU Member States have a key role to play in bringing about the necessary changes. Integration of resource efficiency into the European Semester will ensure that Member States are moving along a sustainable path. We will also launch a process to define the appropriate targets with solid, effective and science-based indicators with a view to agreeing on a lead indicator, a dashboard and thematic indicators by 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, we also need the full implementation of European Union environmental legislation, coupled with actions at international level to ensure a level global playing field. As always, the commitment of all stakeholders is fundamental to the success of any programme. We need to mobilise actors at all levels, and in all relevant sectors, to do their part. I count, of course, on your support for this. I will be following today’s debate with very keen interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, I can only welcome the inclusion in the text adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety of many of the suggestions made in our report from the Committee on International Trade.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that, in the context of the EU’s external dimension, trade in environmental goods and services is an instrument of particular significance for economic and social development. In particular, the opening up of the markets to highly energy-efficient goods and services plays a role in Europe’s conscientious growth in terms of exports, the creation of new jobs related to the spread of new green technologies, and innovation and competitiveness for businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, we have reaffirmed the importance of some essential elements in future European bilateral, multilateral and regional agreements: the reduction or removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade in environmental goods and services; the inclusion of a section on sustainability; the inclusion of tariff preferences for environmental goods and services produced within the Generalised System of Preferences; not to mention the simplification of procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must maintain its global leadership in protecting the environment and promoting, through trade, the use of green goods, services and technologies in third countries for truly sustainable global growth.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, Commissioner, particularly in relation to third countries, encourage the conclusion of trade agreements consistent with the proposed energy efficiency measures, thus ensuring deliberate, smart growth within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I want to emphasise that promoting the sustainable use of resources does not run counter to moves to strengthen the EU’s industrial competitiveness, but, in fact, is a requirement for this to happen. We need innovative business models, research and innovation, a market for the reuse of resources, an extended Ecodesign Directive and faster implementation of the Waste Framework Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In the statement from the industry committee, we also discussed the fact that we need to develop and strengthen the different types of interaction between the Member States and the EU. In our opinion, this can only be achieved by means of clear, measurable and verifiable goals, indicators and measures, including specific objectives and concrete legislative initiatives, supported by the necessary financing mechanisms. This is also an important issue in this context. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Regional Development also called for greater investment in infrastructure for renewable energy projects and I am pleased to say that the new regulations for cohesion policy do indeed take this into account.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee also called for the contribution of the European Structural Funds towards sustainable growth to be reinforced. Again, the new cohesion policies take this into account. We also called for increased coordination between various EU funds to achieve resource efficiency and again, our proposal is that Structural Funds should be harmonised in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee also called for greater coordination between local authorities and regions because, at the end of the day, it is often local authorities and regions that have to deliver these projects.</p>

It is not easy to table a report on resources that covers all areas of our economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Resource efficiency is not a green dream, but rather a basic requirement for our future economic policy. That is why it is only right that we also look at it from the perspective of the competitiveness of our society and our industry. That is why I believe that it is necessary for us to conduct this broad debate without, at the same time, calling for legislation. I am even sure that we can settle a great deal by making agreements, in that we will be drawing industry’s attention to how much more efficient we need to be.</p>
<p class="contents">Moderation was tried by Ludwig Erhard in Germany, my father tried it with me, I have tried it with my children, but it does not work. We have to find another way, and that way is efficiency. Once upon a time, I had a car that had fuel consumption of 12 litres per 100 kilometres; then I had one with fuel consumption of seven litres; now our fuel consumption is three litres. That is precisely the road that we must go down.</p>
<p class="contents">Was there actually anything wrong with our fathers’ metaphor for efficiency, about how it meant managing the forest well? You only take as much wood from the forest as will grow again each year. If we can take this even half to heart, then we will have made progress.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am very grateful to Mr Gerbrandy, who is an excellent and pleasant person to work with. We have laid a good foundation. Now and again, my friends on the other side of the House go a bit far. Do we really want to ban people from eating meat? Do you really expect us to write an eco-audit on every bill? What are people to do if they split the bill? Let us take a deep breath, then, and delete a few things.</p>
<p class="contents">The indicator approach is absolutely right, but that, too, is a process that cannot be done overnight. Mr Gerbrandy, we will try to work together to remove what is nonsense and to highlight the good aspects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Merkies, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. </span>– <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur Gerbrandy, I once had a beautiful orange kettle, made in the Netherlands. At one point, a part got broken and I was not able to get it repaired. The part was not available but, apart from that, the kettle was actually still quite good. However, because we live in a throwaway society, it was ultimately cheaper to buy a new kettle – a less beautiful one, mind you. It does not have to be that way. We need to change that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good that we are once again discussing the fact that the Earth is finite and so are its resources, because nothing has changed, as the Club of Rome said in its famous 1972 report ‘Limits to growth’. It is now 2012, forty years down the line, and the situation is still the same, as indeed it will be in forty years’ time. To put it simply, it really is time that we started doing something about this, something concrete.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past two years, we have presented at least two strategies on this issue: the commodity strategy and, now, the efficient use of resources. Therefore, it is vital that we start to integrate this into our society, but not in a way that says people have to put on another jumper in winter or that they should consume less. We need to do it in a way that will appeal to everyone and that will ultimately lead to the efficiency that we are all talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">Highly specific proposals include new business models which are aimed, among other things, at repair and not replacement every time, and which are aimed at the use of secondary raw materials. Besides, it is often new models that seem to set the trend, not new technology. And so we really have to focus on that. We need better and clearer labelling, and not with five different labels: one for fair trade and the other for energy efficiency. What I want is to be able to see in a single glance what kind of a product this is. We also need better handling of recyclable materials, so that they do not end up in landfill or incinerators.</p>
<p class="contents">From the abstract to the concrete: Europe’s environmental footprint now covers ten football pitches and, before long, with all the people who will be in the world in 2050, we will have only one football pitch for everything we need – our energy, our food and our resources. As a result, we need to move very fast. Allow me to give you just one example: in 2006, fertiliser cost USD 200 and now it costs USD 600. That is three times as much in six years. The urgency seems to be very clear to me. We have to do something. Now. Not only for the environment, but also for the economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the same time, there are also other issues which are not noticeable at first glance, but which need to be resolved just as quickly, such as the efficient use of resources in our society.</p>
<p class="contents">In the coming years, the world’s middle-class population will reach 3 billion. It is encouraging for us to see that developing countries, too, are reaping the benefits of their labour during the globalisation process, but at the same time, we should not forget about our planet’s limited resources.</p>
<p class="contents">We must start living within this planet’s means by rethinking our habits, our current production system and the excessive consumption of resources. This will be the only way to guarantee us sustainable growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainable growth can only be achieved by devising an alternative programme of innovation to focus on using the resources that we already have in the most efficient way possible. This is of paramount importance if we want to resolve the problem of resource supply security for Europe, as well as the problem of the shortage of resources globally, which will grow steadily worse in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Global problems need global solutions and the European Union’s efforts in this area must not remain in isolation. The Rio +20 conference is approaching and Europe needs to take responsibility as a global leader by promoting its efficiency programme.</p>

I have examined a number of annual reports of various multinationals. AkzoNobel, a large multinational, states in its annual report that the higher price of commodities has cost them EUR 1 billion in profits. Thus, EUR 1 billion less profit due to higher commodity prices. In DSM’s annual report, the company states explicitly that one of the big problems it is facing is the rising cost of raw materials and the higher prices, which they have been able to pass on to consumers so far, is also a major problem for DSM. Unilever’s annual report is the same: higher commodity prices last year cost them EUR 2.5 billion in profits. This is another multinational indicating that the challenge of the future is: how are we going to deal with the increasing scarcity of our natural resources?</p>
<p class="contents">That is the agenda. It is not only a green agenda, it is also an economic agenda. Does this then mean that companies are very busy working on it at the moment? Research shows that in the Netherlands, only one in five companies are working on a strategy on how to deal with higher raw material prices. Only one in five! To put it simply, companies are still too unaware of the need to really start looking properly at how we deal with our natural resources. That is the bottom line.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, we welcome the Commission’s programme, which addresses the appropriate issues: but how do we tackle this challenge? By shifting the burden from labour to raw materials, by looking at the question of whether we are able to set tax levels properly, by implementing existing regulations, for example, the Waste Directive, by integrating this agenda into other policy areas, such as the agricultural policy that we have in Europe, and by working on good targets and indicators. We have good policies and a good agenda, but this is now coming down to really taking action. Action is going to be of crucial importance right now.</p>
<p class="contents">This green, more efficient economy could be the way out of the current economic crisis, but then we really need to take it seriously. How are we going to look at the waste sector, for example? That will be crucial. How are we going to look at our agricultural policy? The efficient handling of nutrients such as phosphate is not included in agricultural reform at the moment. This is a great disadvantage in the current situation. We are now going to have to look at this issue because ultimately, what matters is that we make efficient use of our resources, because that is our future green economy. And that is the only economy we, as Europe, should head towards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all share the aim, surely, of conserving resources and using them effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The report includes several points, however, that are very hard for me to accept, or which are totally unacceptable. These ‘red rags’ in the report include the calls to introduce further taxation at European level and dual taxation, and there is even talk of an environmental tax and a tax on natural resources. During a time of protracted economic crisis, I consider this disastrous for Europe, to say the very least. Extending the Ecodesign Directive, I am afraid, will also lead to more bureaucracy rather than actual benefits for Europe and her citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the other details I would like to mention, I consider the sections on recycling and composting to be highly praiseworthy. We are all, surely, in favour of Europe moving away from dumping waste in landfills. I agree very much with this, and I support the proposal. I would like to ask everyone to agree on striking out the comments on halting waste incineration, as this would be rather counterproductive in the current situation.

The main topics addressed by Parliament relate almost exclusively to environmental issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Acting always and only at EU level can only impoverish our enterprises and our citizens, to the sole and exclusive benefit of third countries. Overly strict and burdensome regulations lead to the relocation of enterprises to third countries with easier tax burdens, costs, rules and controls. The relocation of these enterprises also entails a worsening of emissions into the atmosphere as they are no longer subject to the strict limits imposed in Europe. Our citizens thus lose out twice: they lose jobs and emissions into the atmosphere increase. For Europe, losing further competitiveness means postponing our exit from the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, we voted against the report in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. If some major amendments are adopted during the vote in plenary, thereby improving some of the most controversial points, and given that there are some positive aspects to this measure, we may change our vote to an abstention. Otherwise, we shall vote against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Gerbrandy has used well-turned words and phrases but, as usual, he has said nothing at all. He is talking about a paradigm shift, a recycling economy and, from a lifecycle perspective, he wants to push resource efficiency towards a more ambitious agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have no idea in which direction Mr Gerbrandy wants to push this agenda, but one thing is clear: this is going to make money for his environment friends. A lot of money, and we call that political clientelism, pure and simple. Plus, he is talking about a landfill tax, a waste hierarchy and a European external policy on waste, including waste <span class="italic">acquis</span>. Does that mean Baroness Ashton will soon personally start monitoring how Member States manage their waste? It cannot get more crazy than this.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make it clear that the Dutch Party for Freedom (PPV) is in favour of rational use of raw materials, but every right-thinking person has long been in favour of that. That is why we do not need Mr Gerbrandy’s idiotic proposals. What should we do with this nonsensical report? Suddenly, it came to me. Mr Gerbrandy is talking about a strict end-of-waste criterion. Well, this report by him will surely meet that criterion. I am now going to push it in the direction of waste recycling and add it to this cylindrical archive. Duly noted.</p>

Nonetheless, allow me to take you on a little trip back into history, to show you the factors that led to the great rise of Europe in recent centuries – because we do, after all, want to remain highly successful. What are the core elements, so to speak? I believe it was precisely this famous increase in efficiency, and that includes resource efficiency. In around 1400, China needed to farm an area of around half a hectare to feed one person; in Europe, the area required was nearly ten times this. Nonetheless, we succeeded in far outstripping these Asian countries. What were the driving factors?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there was the competition that prevailed between the various countries and between the various systems here in Europe; inherent in this is a certain small scale structure and a battle of one against another.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the knowledge that we developed here in Europe, which we did by taking a rational approach to things and attempting to master nature, by investigating the laws of nature and using them accordingly in our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in Europe, we created ownership structures, a political institution of ownership, which also encouraged personal responsibility – personal responsibility in the sense that people feel responsible and, so to speak, also use what they have to contribute to the public good.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, incentives – and in this case it has mainly been prices that have provided the necessary incentives. The proposal that is currently on the table, however, mainly targets this price gap, this price system, and attempts to achieve an internalisation of external costs through various measures. That makes sense, but that is also what is difficult about it, because naturally, we need an overall political and socio-political consensus here if we want to artificially influence prices that form the market. That, I believe, is the great challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, of course, there are regulations, and in this regard, I have to say that creating regulations makes sense. It is just that I feel that at European level, we should concentrate primarily on implementation and to a lesser extent on new regulations, so that we do not overshoot the target as a result of too much red tape. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, sources of energy and raw materials have been depleted. Our societies’ consumption and prosperity have increased significantly. However, the continued growth of the world’s population with the current consumption model will give rise to a number of challenges. This involves not only the now widely-advertised problems of climate change, but also problems which need to be resolved rationally on the basis of efficient resource use and a different consumption model in order to allow the world’s inhabitants to develop harmoniously.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a global trend in countries with economies based on raw materials to expand processing of raw materials and to shift to higher value added production. Hence, China prefers to process lanthanide elements at home, and the current Russian slogan ‘raw materials for modernisation’ is now out of date.</p>
<p class="contents">The relocation of energy-intensive industries will impoverish Europe yet further. So what should we do to use available mineral resources, water, the forest, soil and even air more efficiently? Firstly, we must use raw materials more efficiently and support innovation in the fields of substitute materials and technologies and recycling, as already mentioned. Secondly, own resources should be used and managed effectively in the interest of local communities, who should benefit from their natural resources. Thirdly, economic and fiscal instruments and a protective tariff policy should be established in the European Union in order to increase the competitiveness of its Member States. Finally, and fourthly, the Commission should pay attention to the harmful effects of multinational corporations and the economic protectionism practised by some members of the WTO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can also support much of what is in the report. I consider it a good thing that we are making the effort to say that we have to overcome the obstacles in the internal market when it comes to removing barriers to the exploitation of resources and the exchange of resources. I also feel, however, that a lot of things that have been said here are not quite correct. I feel I must briefly mention these.</p>
<p class="contents">Jan, the price of copper is not going up because copper is becoming more scarce, neither are the costs of raw materials at AkzoNobel and Unilever going up because the raw materials are becoming scarcer. Instead, it is because we are printing so much money, and because a lot of money is looking for safe investments and increasingly it does not find these in government bonds – which is why much of it is ending up in the commodity markets. That is one reason why prices of raw materials are rising; not so much because we are about to completely run out of some raw materials and they will no longer be available. I think we need to look more carefully at the causes here. It generally has little to do with a scarcity of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two things in the report that I find hard to stomach and that I consider to be sending out completely the wrong signals. The first is the call to extend the scope of the Ecodesign Directive. We should stick with the principle that we will find the best solutions through competition and not by political edict – we have already heard the term ‘eco-diktat’ used in this context. The second point is that we in Europe, which is no longer growing and is facing catastrophic developments, should call for new taxes in order to manage our resources.</p>

Improving resource efficiency – in other words, creating well-being by using natural resources less – is simply vital if we want industrial societies to be able to continue to exist.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a welcome move by Mr Potočnik, European Commissioner for the Environment, that he has made the issue a special area of his work, and the Commission’s road map is also a welcome development. Rather less appealing is the fact that, for more than two years, no concrete proposal on the issue has been forthcoming from the Commission. For example, no progress whatsoever has been made in extending to the EU as a whole the practice of charging a deposit to improve the recycling of metal beverage packaging. This works very well, at least in my country.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety deals with the call for clear and measurable indicators and sectoral targets. We all now know that these are needed if something is actually going to happen. If targets are only very general, they will remain mere words. It is important to be able to reduce the use of natural resources, especially virgin natural resources, in absolute terms. It is not enough to cut the consumption of natural resources in proportion to the volume of production if, at the same time, overall consumption of natural resources still increases.</p>
<p class="contents">Many measures are required, and one of these is improved recycling. It is contradictory and irrational to make a lot of political speeches in which people express their concern about the availability of rare earths, even though, at the same time, we recycle less than 1% of them. For example, one tonne of recycled electronic equipment may contain 15 times more gold than a tonne of standard gold ore. A tonne of recycled mobile phones might therefore save 15 tonnes of gold ore, and many other ores besides.</p>
<p class="contents">The other side of the coin of the wasteful use of natural resources is the mining boom, something that is also evident in my country, and which will soon make the landscape look like Swiss cheese, especially in the north. Unfortunately, some mines have become notorious for causing emissions in the environment that are many times, or even many hundreds of times, greater than their authorised values. Everything that we can do to improve resource efficiency and step up recycling will also reduce all the environmental harm associated with mining. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are sensible initiatives that will enhance cooperation in Europe as we move towards more sustainable development, including better utilisation of our shared resources. However, why should the EU decide how the Member States become more resource-efficient? This report contains requirements concerning common transition to tax and waste systems as well as requirements concerning the use of public funding. In my view, tax and waste systems fall within the competence of the Member States and should not be dictated in an EU report; instead, they should be tailored to local, regional and national circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The report calls for subsidies in the EU to be phased out. That is a good idea. At the same time, however, it calls for additional spending and sets a number of requirements, which is why I cannot vote in favour of the report. Yet the report also contains good proposals, including the call for best practice as regards available scientific data in order to speed up the transition to a resource-efficient economy. I am therefore also unable to vote against it, and in the end I am going to abstain. I share the vision of a resource-efficient Europe, but it needs to happen with fewer state subsidies and by tidying up existing regulations. I would also like to see the report comment on exports of EU waste to third countries, including plastic waste that should stay in the EU for reprocessing so as to create local jobs and reduce imports of raw materials. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree that we must radically improve the use of secondary materials and create the right incentives for reducing and recycling waste. We must make resource efficiency and sustainability a top priority in innovation programmes, both at European and at national level. Only by consuming in a more sustainable manner, reducing waste and improving the collection and sorting of waste can we contribute to our own well-being and that of our planet. A more efficient use of waste is an integral part of the green economy. The EU should use its political and economic strength to pull other parts of the world in the same direction.

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, our economy and our industry in Europe depend on resources and raw materials, the prices of which are become increasingly unstable and access to which is becoming uncertain in a context of fierce international competition.</p>
<p class="contents">These include, for example, rare earths, which are necessary for many new technologies, and of which China holds almost all the mining potential. In order to protect not only our industrial competitiveness but also our environment, it is imperative that we learn how to be less dependent on these resources by developing innovation and recycling.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must move towards a real circular economy, in which extending the life cycle of materials would be a priority, from the product design stage right through to the re-use and recycling of waste. With a view to efficiency, recovering energy from waste must also be promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also turn to the sustainable exploitation of resources, the potential of which is still too often underestimated. I should like to emphasise the importance of the natural capital represented by forest resources. Timber is a renewable energy source and an ideal, healthy and natural building material.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with the dynamism of emerging powers, we must adopt a more proactive and more imaginative attitude in the use of resources so that we can return to growth. The European Union must encourage its enterprises to create more innovative and more sustainable products. It must also exert an influence on the behaviour of consumers by empowering them. I therefore support the experiments in progress on the environmental impact labelling of products, the aim of which is to give Europeans credible information on the environmental impact of their consumption choices.</p>

During the second half of 2010, 44 million people were forced into poverty due to the rise in food prices. These events are not only caused by the shortage of resources, but also by their inefficient distribution or by speculation on the commodities markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, the European Union must work on devising a global system for using and distributing global resources. This is why I call on the European executive to pursue the inclusion of environmental standards and the fair trade principle on the agenda of the World Trade Organisation. Continuing the efforts to reduce and eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers preventing the trade in green goods and services also marks an important step towards greater resource efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I would like to remind you that speculation on raw materials has a direct impact on the lives of millions of people, causing poverty and hunger. This is why I think that an urgent ban on this practice is an absolute must. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The message that this debate and our resolution should send out to the public, to the economy and to the Member States is that there is great cooperation between the Commission, particularly Mr Potočnik, and this Parliament on the matter of resource efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we have all known the key facts for a long time. We know that – in relative terms – Europe is more dependent on imported resources than other regions. We know that we could become much more economically dynamic if we could forge ahead with resource efficiency. We know – the Commission has repeatedly told us all – that we could create up to 3 million jobs by taking resource efficiency seriously. The crucial point is whether this knowledge will result in action. That depends on governance, and it depends on the Commission and Parliament, but also, in particular, on the Member States and the economy and other players working together sensibly. If we are honest, that is where we get stuck.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know if my list is too incomplete, but so far I have found four Member States that have resource efficiency plans that can be taken even half seriously: the Netherlands since 2010, Austria in January, Germany and, most recently, in March, the United Kingdom. Only one Member State, and that is Germany, has so far discussed it at cabinet level at all. That is not exactly a strong showing. The Member States have hardly covered themselves in glory in the Environment Council, where, in part, they blocked the Commission’s proposals.</p>

I believe our resources should be managed in an environmentally sound manner. However, we need to set realistic targets with a gradual transition away from landfill.

It is entirely right to propose rational consumption and restrained use of the earth’s resources, including energy, but these proposals cannot be made in isolation from economic and social realities. My country, Poland, has made enormous sacrifices and borne enormous costs as a result of cutting carbon dioxide emissions. I believe that our work and the measures we take should take this into account, since the economic crisis which we are experiencing calls for growth, but growth cannot be achieved in opposition to rational grounds and arguments. This also leads to social problems which could prevent any growth in the future.

More efficient use of resources is essential. It is absolutely our duty to ensure a form of development that meets the needs of present generations, but without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am firmly convinced that what is needed is to promote a culture. For that reason, I am concerned about some rather too <span class="italic">dirigiste</span> aspects that already stood out in the Commission proposal and are overly accentuated by the work of the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Many points have already been mentioned; I am worried, for example, about shifting the burden of taxation away from labour to the environment. I believe that, in the absence of a comprehensive impact assessment, not least at a macro-economic level, such a measure could merely aggravate the already heavy tax burden on European taxpayers. The rapporteur, Mr Florenz, has already talked about eating habits. I do not believe it is our duty to tell our citizens whether or not to eat animal protein, but I find it significant that the European Parliament has come out against food wastage, given that some 20% of food is disposed of as refuse. It is therefore my hope that a truly more constructive and realistic approach will be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is our duty, first and foremost, to support proposals aiming to facilitate access by small and medium-sized enterprises to innovative technologies, with an emphasis on research and innovation. However, we must also work with the help of the productive sector: clear and reliable indicators on resource efficiency are absolutely essential, and they should be based not only on economic assessments but also on precise scientific knowledge.</p>

That is what you could say about resource conservation. Everyone wants to move in the right direction, but how do we get there? Voluntary measures – as we have seen time and time again, in the automotive industry, in other areas – have been a resounding failure. Resource efficiency and the conservation of resources are an element of foreign policy, security policy, health policy, environmental policy, economic policy, agricultural policy – they affect all areas. Looking at the empty Council benches, I can only say that I am astonished that the Council is not here today, but perhaps things will take a bit longer, because they are missing something today – namely, the presentation and debate on a very, very good report by Mr Gerbrandy. This topic is by no means dealt with yet, and this matter will decide whether Europe lives in prosperity in future and what our environment in Europe will look like. It is now a matter of finding the instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">The internalisation of external costs – there is no way around it: this principle must be introduced. Anyone who pollutes water or air must pay for it. At the moment, we pay for it via our health insurance or through other areas – we are paying for it with our taxes, Ms Gardini. This has to be internalised, and here we need to be courageous for once, because only then will we deal with the future challenges that we face.</p>
<p class="contents">A growing world population – not in Europe, we will get smaller in the future – is a huge challenge, and therefore this report that Mr Gerbrandy has produced is a good starting point for considering new political strategies, and that applies to the Commission, too. We have to think in terms of life cycles – instead of simply regulating what comes out of the exhaust, we also need to look at the factory where the car is manufactured. Is that sustainable, does it conserve resources? We must think in terms of complete cycles and be courageous about this and not stick with the <span class="italic">status quo</span> – because if we do, we will pay very, very dearly for it.</p>

The transition to a resource-efficient economy is inevitable and necessary. In 2050, the global population will reach 9 billion people and each of them will strive for a better life. As indicated by the Commission, at the current rate of resource use, in 2050, the equivalent of two Earths will be needed to sustain the world’s population.</p>
<p class="contents">The case for ensuring each and every European policy is resource-efficient is therefore also economic. Member States must remove all obstacles to the market in waste recycling and reuse and provide economic incentives to promote innovative technologies for the collection and separation of waste. It is right to get to zero waste by banning landfill and phasing out the incineration of recyclables.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to agree on indicators for resource use in economic activity, in other words, our footprint on the planet, our water footprint, our materials footprint and our carbon footprint.

Unfortunately, the report presented to us does not respect this balance, and is tilted in one direction. It is strongly biased in favour of efficiency. Even worse, it wants to use taxation instruments to shape the European Union’s raw materials policy. Not only special taxes on raw materials are being proposed, but also special changes to the VAT system.</p>
<p class="contents">These instruments will obviously affect the competitiveness of our industry. We cannot agree to the European Commission being encouraged to work on solutions involving the taxation of raw materials. The proposed total ban on landfilling waste is similarly ideological and divorced from technological and industrial reality. This report is inconsistent with the findings of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, with the opinions of the European Commission and industry recommendations, and therefore will not be supported by our group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel obliged to highlight several new provisions which have compelled me to propose certain necessary amendments. We all agree on the need to use our resources sparingly and rationally. However, all measures must be focused on strengthening Europe’s industry and its economic growth. The development of green public procurement is necessary and requires further work, but in times of crisis, it cannot involve additional administrative costs. It is acceptable to introduce a legal ban on landfills, but there must be an indication of the maximum recyclable share of waste which may be used as raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">It is bad timing to introduce additional financial burdens in the form of an environmental tax during a crisis. Accordingly, we should postpone its introduction until better times. The proposal to reduce animal protein intake and the resulting transformation of our agriculture into a fruit and vegetable paradise gives rise to similar concerns. The introduction of new legal provisions must also be based on the technical and technological solutions available, and the proposal to bring residual waste close to zero is, in my view, an idealistic approach which does not translate into real life.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to add a few words about the call for environmental information relating to mass consumer goods. I say yes to consumer information, but information which is clear and necessary, and does not create chaos. In my view, the report contains a range of very important observations, but it fails to cover a number of important issues relating to the current crisis in Europe. We must wait and see how work progresses and what possibilities there will be for creating new working conditions for current generations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also opens up opportunities for new jobs and new growth, in other words, long-term sustainable growth which is climate-friendly and environmentally sound and which, for this very reason, is in the process of becoming an important competitive factor.</p>
<p class="contents">This report deals primarily with investments in innovation and research. For example, the report states that subsidies for businesses which harm the environment must come to an end. This is a very good proposal and it does not come a day too soon. It forms a sound basis for a change in course, new investments and new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The work on the European Parliament’s raw materials strategy also made it clear that resource efficiency has a direct link to security of supply. European industry is dependent on metals, minerals and other raw materials. Developing ideas such as urban mining also involves establishing new industries. Most importantly, however, we are helping existing industries to access the raw materials they need. This is all about making careful use of resources. We need to use the assets that we have in an intelligent way. Therefore, this report makes an important contribution to the ongoing discussion and to future action. At the same time, it is clear that we need a more in-depth debate on the consequences of the tax shift or, in other words, the redistribution of tax from work to the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why long-term measures and planning are important, and the Commission has rightly made the efficient use of natural resources a key component of the Europe 2020 strategy. The worldwide increase in the population, the fact that the number of middle-class consumers has almost doubled, and the growing need for food production are bringing about a situation that has to be resolved in a sustainable way and as soon as possible. Europe is no exception, and the resolution we have to vote on tomorrow is a timely one for us.</p>
<p class="contents">Using natural resources as efficiently as possible will increase the EU’s competitiveness and help preserve the environment and biodiversity, and it will have an important role in the transition to a low carbon industry. We must, however, be prudent when we decide on the measures that will ensure that our natural resources are used as sustainably, and also as efficiently, as possible. For this reason, I do not support the need for new legislative initiatives, as proposed in the report. On the contrary, we should now be effectively implementing the laws and legislative acts that exist.</p>
<p class="contents">The danger is, and this has already happened in our policy on climate change, that we will create a legislative jungle, where overlap will make the achievement of the goal itself not just impossible, but also expensive. The resolution also goes too far in proposing practical measures on the ‘one size fits all’ principle. For example, local circumstances need to be taken into account in matters of waste. Incineration may, in some situations, be necessary, and even useful, from the perspective of energy supply. Similarly, the proposals to raise environmental taxation or to introduce new taxes do not apply everywhere, and those countries that are rich in natural resources will not be keen on them.</p>

That has annoyed me ever since I joined the European Parliament. However, I will use my time for the subject in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Potočnik, you quite rightly described the 2050 energy road map as a great transformation for our economy and society, for production and consumption. For this great transformation, you need all the players, and at all levels. I think it is good that you are establishing a platform for resource efficiency in Brussels. We ought to have the same thing at the level of the Member States and the regions, right down to municipalities. My question is this: do you have a plan for this?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bütikofer rightly asked about resource efficiency plans. That is the same subject. For climate protection, we have the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) and the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs). Naturally, we also need resource efficiency plans here. Do you intend to present this to the Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">Then, of course, you will need all the other portfolios. I will simply mention the finance ministers – this has already been mentioned: the phasing out of environmentally harmful subsidies, the incorporation of external costs into our tax system. How can we win over the finance ministers and, not least, the ministers for economic affairs? We need new business models that reward sustainability and not the consumption of resources. For that, we need to think about something new with the ministers for economic affairs.</p>

In fact, the traditional business model is built upon the consumption, and even the wasting, of resources. The manufacturer produces something, does not deal with the waste, the product goes to the consumer and perhaps also ends up being thrown away. That is no longer acceptable. We need a new business model in which the manufacturer is responsible – from production through to recovery, to recycling. Then, I believe, there will be new designs for products. There are new responsibilities for recirculation. That is the direction we must move in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to manage our scarce resources taking into account the entire life cycle, from the extraction of the raw materials, through transport, assembly and consumption, to recycling or then disposal. It has to become more sustainable and more efficient, and resource efficiency is an important part of our strategy for economic growth and for the creation of jobs in the years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">The individual political aims of the strategy must, however, also be coherent in themselves. The often heard call for valuable agricultural land to be set aside is not compatible with resource conservation and sustainable usage, and neither is the sealing of surfaces. Already today, farmers are talking of areas being eaten away.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is irresponsible to stop the production of food in our climatically favoured regions. Sustainable agriculture in Europe is making an important contribution to resolving the great challenges of the 21st century. It serves to secure the world’s food supply and provides renewable raw materials, while at the same time maintaining our cultural landscape that has been created by generations, as well as biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy itself must meet efficiency requirements. This includes, above all, not constantly seeking out more calculations, more requirements, but instead using and implementing the existing laws and regulations better and more effectively. Labour, as a resource, must also be used efficiently and prudently. Drawing up ever new statistics based on ever new indicators results in more bureaucracy, ties up labour and, in the end, costs energy and money – and that is not efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, let us not imagine that we can define efficient food. A good steak is part of our quality of life. It is energy, and it is also a pleasure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, I do not understand why they cannot come on board in this area, because I feel that our main task here is to take on a dual responsibility: responsibility for the generation that is alive here and now, but also for future generations. We can only do that if we are careful with these types of energy, these recyclables, these resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the present energy road map indicates a great many opportunities where we cannot just increase economic performance in Europe, as indicated in the heading, but also ensure a sustainable quality of life. What I cannot understand at all is the panic and fear that is the constant response when such taxes are mentioned. As far as I am concerned, taxes contribute to quality of life. In German, at least, the word for taxes incorporates the word for steering. In other words, taxes allow me to quite deliberately steer things in such a way as to fulfil our political mandate – namely, to create quality of life for the people throughout Europe, in all regions. Taxes are instruments that I can use to help funds to be used where they are needed. As we have already heard today: according to the polluter pays principle. However, taxes must also be fair. That is a crucial factor for me, and I believe we need to thank Mr Gerbrandy today for his report. It points the way, and I hope that as far as possible, all its points will be carried with a broad majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of these, as many as 5.5 million are young people, so the question arises as to whether this is the right topic for us to be debating.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, in my opinion, because it is very much tied up with the health of the economy. The economy must have raw materials at a time when it needs them and at a price that will allow it to be competitive. At the present moment, because our continent is not exactly rich in raw materials, we need to be all the more rational about managing them.</p>
<p class="contents">But what does rational use of raw materials mean? In my opinion, no proposal in this report which would result in us eating less, driving less, making less or increasing taxes is acceptable. The only solution is efficient use of raw materials and we need to view such efficient use as an opportunity, as an opportunity for developing new industries, starting up new businesses and creating new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals were made years ago and, tomorrow, the European Parliament will adopt its opinion after several months’ deliberation on this initiative. I am flagging this up because we have recently heard voices suggesting that we have only been talking about saving the economy and that we have forgotten about recovery. No, we have not; it has just been pushed to the margins of the media.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, we do not need another new treaty in order to provide an impetus to the economy. People do not need it. To give an impetus to the economy, we need to start implementing the promises we have made as soon as possible. We also need to draw up a multiannual European budget in proportion to our needs and our substantive policies and priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, sending out a message to people that a low budget is a good budget is not a good idea. It should be high enough to enable us to implement development policies. Some good measures have already been included in this report, such as implementation of legislation, the setting up of robust, clear and measurable indicators and incentives designed to promote research and technological innovation.</p>

This is why I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteur and all those who helped finalise this report. What is important now is that we know specifically what we have to do and know where we want to be, but we still have to galvanise ourselves into achieving our proposed targets within a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still a great deal to do at national and local level. If we simply take the management of urban waste in Member States, the situation varies greatly. There are Member States which have completely stopped dumping urban waste in landfills, such as Germany and the Netherlands, countries which have a very high rate for recycling municipal waste, such as Belgium or Sweden, or countries which have a fairly low recycling rate, as is the case with Romania. On this point, I would like to add that the new Romanian Government has also included among its priorities the adoption of a strategy and national plan for waste management.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear to see what an important role national and local administrators play in accepting the new guidelines from the European agenda, as well as in devising methods and procedures for implementing the necessary changes in the shortest time possible. It is vital for us to have the general public on our side and that more and more people are proactive. I believe in sustainable consumption and in the importance of recycling and reducing waste to a minimum.

Together with the road map, these may be the two best examples that show us the path we should and want to take in Parliament, and in the Commission as well, it seems.</p>
<p class="contents">That path, however, is full of obstacles that are sometimes referred to as ‘crises’, or ‘austerity’, and at other times even as ‘subsidiarity’ – which is also being used as an obstacle – or ‘impossible taxation’.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be clear on this. With this report, we are saying ‘enough is enough’; we have to learn from our mistakes, and there should be no more talk of obstacles. The best way to achieve what we want – sustainable development – is to be more efficient, to make better use of resources and not plunder them as we have done so far.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, if we really do want an EU based on sustainable development, we call on the Presidency and the Commissioner to do the following: apply the taxes that are being suggested here; establish corrective measures to prevent the impact of austerity from bringing higher prices and food crises which, as always, hit the poor hardest; consider reduced VAT rates for secondary materials, because every little helps when it comes to reaching our goal of 100% recycling; help change the model by shifting the tax burden from the income derived from work to the income from speculative capital and to those activities that are less sustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, we are calling for them to be proactive, committed and demanding. Some Member States are cutting back on research, renewable energies and health care, as Spain is doing, which is slowing down the Europe 2020 agenda.</p>

That will improve the quality of life for our citizens and make us more powerful and more influential on the world stage. As of now, we are too dependent on imports of resources and we need to look at what we have ourselves and develop it.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we should try to eliminate the huge amount of waste that takes place from households right across the spectrum. I think the conditions are there now to really work on this. I know that from my own country, coming through the primary school into the secondary school, they have things such as the green flag. Students are coming through now who have an appreciation of the environment and climate change and are willing to play their part in recycling. I think now is the time to really home in on this and make ourselves more efficient in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Agriculture obviously is a huge area. Particularly, we need to develop a very strongly resourced CAP to ensure that we have security of food supply and also that everything is done in as environmentally friendly a way as possible. Energy, of course, is essential. While people will have reservations about certain types of energy, particularly coal because it is highly polluting, nevertheless we need to keep an open mind, particularly on shale gas, and also develop bio-energy – wave, wind and tidal, which all have potential that we can develop hugely.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the importance of research. Horizon 2020 gives us the opportunity to do research into these areas and become world leaders in them, utilising the natural resources we have in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I just want to mention the blue economy. A few weeks ago, we had a demonstration in Brussels outlining the vast potential offered by the sea in creating all sorts of energy resources in terms already mentioned – wave, tidal and wind – but also in terms of foodstuffs and other areas as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To avoid this, I think this Commission proposal for a resource-efficient Europe is a good start, but we definitely need to move forward. We need broad definitions of resources so that all ecosystem services are included. We need better integration of resource efficiency into our growth strategies. We need indicators in our budgets both at EU and national levels. We also need to include, as proposed, a compulsory element as a growth strategy in the European Semester and in macro-economic indicators. We need to abolish environmentally harmful subsidies and, yes, we need an effective ecodesign directive that has rules on the resource-use footprint, recyclability and a resource-efficiency index. It is crucial to have all products included. I would like to encourage the Commission to act boldly on this and to have this growth discussion included also. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the context of resource efficiency, I would primarily like to point out the matter of water and waste management.</p>
<p class="contents">2012 is also the year of water policy review. The EU has an enormous deficit in the field of water management and water recycling compared, for example, to Israel, and I therefore find it very important that we take steps to settle the water-related problems of the Mediterranean region or Central Europe and the area between the Rivers Danube and Tisza, for that matter.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as waste management is concerned, I agree with those who argue that depositing recyclable waste should be banned altogether. It is unfortunate that my home country, Hungary, is going against European efforts in the field of waste management. Our right-wing government has entirely abolished the country’s previous waste management system, and unfortunately, the Commission has therefore launched an infringement procedure against Hungary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This individual has to change his or her way of life completely.

It is time to rethink our habits, because a more sensible use of resources not only helps to protect the environment, but also helps to save money and to reduce costs in industry. The idea is to do more with less. It is impossible to continue to use our current resource management model.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of these changes, increasing the efficiency of resource use is a key issue for ensuring economic growth and more jobs in Europe. It will create broad economic opportunities as well as improving productivity, reducing costs and contributing to competitiveness. I am pleased that the report focuses on stimulating the development of technological innovation, boosting employment in the quickly developing green energy sector, and supporting trade in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe that an ambitious plan is not sufficient, and I welcome and support Mr Gerbrandy’s opinion that bureaucracy should be reduced. I believe that no new legislation should be created, but instead that the existing legislation should be used effectively. It is equally important to set goals which are realistic for all Member States. Standards which are too high and which would be impossible for certain Member States to fulfil would mean the strategy no longer had the advantage of being feasible, which would be to the detriment of its guiding purpose. Our future depends on how we use resources now, and we thus need a balanced and well-conceived strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, there are strategies for many of these resources, whereby their management should be guided by an overriding wish to safeguard the public interest, taking into account the needs of present and future populations.</p>
<p class="contents">There is indeed an urgent need to reduce consumption, reuse products, recycle and ensure that resources are used efficiently, but processes for doing so cannot be left at the mercy of the markets and their expectations of profitability, as some seem to think. The sustainable and efficient use of resources requires a fundamental change in the current models of production and consumption. For example, we should call into question free trade and the unsustainable flow of energy and materials with which it is associated. There needs to be a focus on local production and consumption, with short supply chains and public transport. It is not worth trying to paint a system green when it has already been shown to be unsustainable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Gerbrandy, in the 1700s, your report might perhaps have been summarised in four words as: ‘waste not, want not’. Perhaps, when we try to appeal to citizens, as the Commissioner suggested, when we try to mobilise them, we need to use less words and make it a little bit friendlier for people. When one reads some of this report, it would paralyse rather than mobilise but I accept your very good intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, around the issues of dietary change and land use, I agree absolutely with paragraph 56 about reducing imported land use. To do that, we need to produce more using less resources within the European Union. I think paragraph 57 is very reasonable on improving consumer awareness, but I am afraid that paragraph 52 is less so. I think perhaps we would be better off using fewer words as they did in the 1700s and encouraging all of us – as our parents used to – to ‘waste not, want not’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Janez Potočnik, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, first of all, I should say that this has been the first real plenary debate at which I have been present. I very much appreciated it and found it encouraging.</p>
<p class="contents">While I would like to respond on many of the matters you have discussed – innovation, waterways, agriculture, fisheries, public awareness, indicators, targets, trade integration, ecodesign, food, and so on – I would need too much time. Obviously, the things we are discussing are complex. However, although I am Commissioner for the Environment, allow me to focus briefly on concerns which were raised by some of your colleagues in connection with the economy and the current situation, and why it is so important that the ideas in the Gerbrandy report are supported.</p>
<p class="contents">To start with the 20th century, that century actually represents the resource-intensive model. The population increased fourfold, economic output increased many, many more times, and the use of any resource you could pick up increased by approximately the same factor. So, in fact, resource prices at that time, if measured by the composite index and with the exception of world wars and the oil crisis, were constantly falling. The recognition that resources are finite was absolutely not present in that model, in which, to some extent, we are still living.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation is, in many ways, changing. The population is growing. Not only will we reach nine billion in 2050 but, more importantly, as the McKinsey report says, in 2030, we can expect three billion more citizens to be raised from poverty to middle-class consumption. They will have every right to that, but they will not be able to get there if we continue with the model developed in the 20th century.</p>
<p class="contents">What does that mean for Europe? Europe is extremely import-dependent. Over the past decade and more, the prices of many resources have been going up. That trend is expected by a majority of companies to continue in the next five years – at 85% – and the volatility of those prices is huge. So today, the European business sector is refocusing from labour productivity to resource productivity because that is the area in which businesses see the real opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">In many cases, it is already recognised that energy and raw materials are critical. As for other resources – apart from water and land perhaps – it is not yet recognised in many cases that they are finite. These resources will be the focus of attention for our societies and businesses in the future. Nature is not yet so much in the picture, but it will come. That is the change which we are facing.</p>
<p class="contents">How is this connected to the story which we are all living through – the story of crisis and of the absolute need for growth and new jobs? As Olli Rehn said in his speech a day ago, if we had a silver bullet, we would already have fired it, but we do not have it so we have to work consistently and patiently. There are some areas in which Europe is strong and in which it could become even stronger. One such area is talent: the knowledge economy, research and innovation. The other major area is resource efficiency. Why? Because using less water, less energy and less raw materials, and producing products which can be reused and recycled makes economic sense. That is the trend which is currently very much present in the economy and in business. So ultimately, we are talking about economic resilience and environmental resilience at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">I also really appreciate your highlighting the question of urgency and the need for implementation. These are matters to which we also try to draw attention when we talk about economic governance – the so-called semester story. Here too, we emphasise those issues that point in the direction of resource efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">As was rightly mentioned by one of your colleagues, taxes are not to be feared. We are proposing no more and no less than the shift of taxation away from labour – and in Europe we have high labour costs – in the direction of, for example, landfill taxation, which makes more sense. The removal of environmentally harmful taxes makes all the more sense at a time when we are trying to tap all the reserves in our public finances. This is not something which we can afford to ignore today. In our discussions with Member States, we know that we bear a responsibility and we are advising them. And, by the way, in the Council conclusions of March 2011, they supported our ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, we are working hard on the implementation of the road map. This year, we will focus heavily on water. We will launch the resource efficiency transition platform within a few days – some of you will be participating in this – and it will bring real political impetus and direction. It will rightly be an important part of the Seventh Environmental Action Programme and, of course, the urgency of implementation is the core consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be discussing these issues at the Rio+20 conference in just a few days’ time. The conference will not, of course, be about resource efficiency, but rather about the green economy. However, it is the same story. It will not be about Europe, but about global commitments and the world as a whole, because we all understand that these things are necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, if everything was all right with brown growth, we would not be discussing green growth today, but brown growth has inherent limits which are recognised today by the business sector. We, as politicians, should recognise them too. When we talk about green growth, we are actually talking about how to design future growth capable of bringing greater well-being and more benefits to society than brown growth is bringing today. I am not trying to paint a catastrophe scenario because that will not happen: we are intelligent societies and an intelligent species. But a sustainable future, my friends, is simply not a choice. It is inevitable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to thank all of you – the many of you – who have stayed to the end of the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is enormously pleasing to hear. I have listened very carefully and have noticed a very broad consensus around the ultimate goal: more efficient use of resources. However, we do not always agree about the way forward, particularly when it comes to the pace at which we need to go about it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to say the following on that subject: the speed at which we can afford to move is not determined by us. It is not us in Europe who determine it, but the pace of the world around us. And let us be honest: that pace is so fast that we simply cannot afford not to be very ambitious with this agenda from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been some criticism on ecodesign. On that score, I have the following to say: the text we are debating today and on which we will be voting tomorrow is not a legislative one. This is a political text, a political text about the main direction of our future policy. It does not therefore go into detail about how an Ecodesign Directive should be applied, but it does talk about the fact that, when designing our products, we need to take into account that we are able to recover the raw materials contained in them. That is the point. So, this is not a legislative text.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I think the most important thing about this report is that we as Parliament have sent out a very strong political message by which we also support the Commission to continue down the path it has chosen.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the Commission in not just continuing down that path, but also in doing so with an agenda that is much more ambitious than the one put forward by Mr Potočnik. An agenda that is about implementation and legislation. It appears from today’s debate that this is a matter of either/or; but it is not, it is about both of those things. We have to get better at implementation, but we also need to move towards new legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will dedicate my very last comments to the Council. Let this be a very strong signal from the European Parliament and the Commission to Member States that we have an ambitious agenda and that we want to move forward, not simply because we think that it is a good idea, but because it is desperately needed for the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as financial markets will not wait for our leaders to get ready to save the euro, the world will not wait for us to decide to manage our raw materials more efficiently. We have to do that now, today, not tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, this will result in greater cost savings due to more efficient management of resources, commercialisation and innovative processes over their life cycle. We should follow this path in order to support a Europe that is increasingly efficient and competitive at global level. The EU must make better use of its resources in order to benefit the environment and future economic growth. We have set out ambitious plans to tackle this issue, and it is now up to the Member States to take up the challenge and fight for resource efficiency. The implementation of these plans will mean significant economic growth, job creation and protection of the environment. The Member States should adopt the ‘polluter pays’ principle for taxation, thereby providing an incentive for the protection of the environment and technological innovation. This would also allow cuts to other taxes, including labour taxes. The inefficient and wasteful use of resources should be subject to higher penalties in order to help boost competitiveness, while preserving the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to point out a few important factors which should be considered in the debate on raw materials in the European Union. I believe that our primary consideration should be to change the current model of production. We should therefore develop three selected areas under this model where raw materials should be reused; namely, food, housing and mobility. The European Commission should set up special working groups in these areas. It is also important for the European recycling system to have resource utilisation rates based on four basic indices, namely land, water, materials and carbon footprint. This would allow a more harmonised and efficient use of resources. Another important issue is to maintain prices for emissions trading, environmental resources and ecosystem services at the level required by states with a lower level of economic development because prices which are too high can mean that low-income social groups are deprived of raw materials. SMEs are a further key issue, since as part of their research and innovation programmes, they can raise funds for the rational use of resources, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, by means of research into new substitute materials. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Key natural resources such as raw materials, metals, energy, biodiversity and water are being used to support economic growth as if they were inexhaustible. This is unsustainable in the long term, and the EU will probably face serious challenges in securing access to, and the uninterrupted supply of, key resources. More fuels are imported into the EU than into China, and more minerals than into the US. Targets in the areas of biodiversity or energy efficiency are not being met. Reducing dependency on imported resources and making effective use of domestic resources must therefore be a clear political priority, not only from the perspective of the environment, but also with regard to competitiveness and the creation of growth and employment. The current economic, financial and environmental situation only confirms that Europe urgently needs new sources of economic growth. I would therefore like to call again on the EU Member States not to reject binding targets in the area of energy efficiency. The mandatory savings are a big opportunity for restarting the EU economy. I am also in favour of extending the scope of the Ecodesign Directive to products that are not related to energy consumption, to measures for reducing food waste and to the abolition of all subsidies that have a harmful effect on the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One aspect which is particularly important and which deserves special attention is the relationship between water use, food production and food waste. Up to 80% of the water we take from the ground is for agriculture, yet we throw away up to one third of our food. The amount of water and energy which fuels this level of waste is shocking. We know that food waste is produced throughout the supply chain, at producer and retail level, as well as at consumer level. We need urgent action to tackle food waste at all levels. We can invest in all the irrigation technology and green energy we want, but there seems little point if it just produces food which rots on the supermarket shelf or ends up in the kitchen bin. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I do not believe that a move towards environmental taxes, particularly an EU tax, is the answer as suggested in the report on a resource-efficient Europe. Similarly, the proposal to strengthen the EU’s waste <span class="italic">acquis</span> is not logical as this will merely put more unnecessary pressure on national governments, causing them to shift their focus away from the growth that the EU needs right now. We ought to have a greater focus on research, development and innovation if we are to be true competitors against the rising economic powers of Brazil, Russia, India and China. We need to compete by encouraging our SMEs and removing the obstacles they face, such as accessing credit, and helping them to increase their trade both in Europe and globally. We need to recognise that if we are to achieve the goals of the EU 2020 strategy of a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy, we need to take a global perspective when formulating all policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a long list of rare resources and materials which our countries do not have. This makes us extremely dependent on imports, which threatens not only the development but also the very existence of high-tech sectors that are vitally important to the economy’s competitiveness and to maintaining the high social standard enjoyed by European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution is for us to use efficiently the resources we have. This is why I welcome the texts promoting the recycling of waste as an untapped resource of our own, which, in many countries, is simply dumped in landfills, while money is poured into foreign economies for the delivery of the same materials. The need for imports will obviously remain. This is why long-term, mutually beneficial cooperation is needed with resource-rich countries, which requires the EU to draft and adhere to priority policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Resource efficiency is a fundamental issue for sustainable growth in the EU. It is a pity that only four countries in the EU currently have national resource-efficiency plans. This situation needs to change quickly. However, I do not accept that the issue should be resolved through new taxes and endless new laws and red tape. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am therefore very pleased with Mr Gerbrandy’s report, which focuses really sharply on the problems and which maps the routes forward to fight this crisis tooth and nail. In particular, I support wholeheartedly the proposals that call for a better functioning single market with a view to encouraging reuse and recycling, dismantling environmentally damaging subsidies and setting up price instruments so that, in the manufacture of new products, we can make the use of recycled materials more advantageous, for the making of firm agreements, for setting up measurable parameters for resource efficiency and for an ambitious revision of the Ecodesign Directive.</p>
