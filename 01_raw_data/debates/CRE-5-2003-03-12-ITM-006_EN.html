The final status of Kosovo is an issue which will need to be dealt with when the time is right and in accordance with the terms of Security Council Resolution 1244, with the involvement of the Belgrade government and the elected leaders and representatives of local political institutions in Pristina.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has also repeatedly expressed its full support for the UN Secretary-General’s special envoy and the policy being applied by the United Nations mission in Kosovo, the purpose of which, as Mr Steiner pointed out, is standards before status, because that is the only way to turn Kosovo into a stable, prosperous society that wants to embrace the values and commonly accepted standards of the European Union. The details of the integration of Kosovo into the Stability and Association Process will likewise need to be dealt with in full compliance with Resolution 1244 and within the context of the standards before status policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is determined to help Kosovo become a democratic, prosperous society, in which all communities learn to live together in peace and security. Consequently, it is extremely important for the European Union to keep calling on the temporary local institutions in Kosovo to do everything they can to implement the specific evaluation criteria of the standards before status policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have two short supplementary questions. The first is to ask what you think of the idea of simply setting up a working group to consider the options for the future of Kosovo. That would give us a preventive role and stop us from once again reacting only when it was too late. The second question is this: as far as I am aware, the preamble of the new constitution of Serbia and Montenegro includes a claim by Serbia that Kosovo should in future be a part of the Yugoslavian sub-state of Serbia. I would like to ask whether the European Union or the United Nations have protested against this. I ask because this would prejudice the chances of keeping open the future status of Kosovo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you yourself pointed out, there are problems with relations between the ethnic groups in Kosovo, there are problems with the return of refugees, there are problems with keeping Kosovo on an even keel on a day-to-day basis, there are problems with a whole series of issues which have a great deal to do with what we call European values, European rules, which is precisely why Mr Steiner pointed out, on behalf of the UN – and we agree and support this position – that standards need to be improved. That is why we talk of standards before status. I should like to point out, if I may, that if all sides act to establish these standards, trust between the various ethnic groups will improve, which is vital to a substantive debate about the future status of Kosovo. If it does not, the situation may become explosive.

<p class="contents">Just two days ago a federal appeals court rejected attempts to clarify the legal situation of some Guantanamo Bay detainees, including two Britons. The court, in a decision that could leave the detainees in legal limbo indefinitely, said that foreigners had no rights under the US Constitution and could not invoke the jurisdiction of US courts to test the legality of restraints on their liberty. This shocking situation, which contrasts with what will be the case when the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights becomes binding – under which foreigners as well as EU citizens will have their basic rights guaranteed – comes hot on the heels of other miscarriages of justice such as the case of a Briton who was executed when a Texas judge refused to look at DNA evidence and another Briton held for three weeks in prison in South Africa because of FBI incompetence.</p>

It is very important that we ensure, for example, that double hulls are used with shipments of oil, but that is not enough in all situations. When it is a matter of the icy conditions to be found in the north still more is needed, and this has been made very apparent this year because it has been a very cold winter and there has been thick ice in the Baltic Sea and particularly in the Gulf of Finland, which is very vulnerable. It is approximately 30 metres deep on average and conditions are very difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to ask you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if you agree with the Finnish initiative proposing the amendment of the Regulation on double hulls so that in the future a Member State could insist that vessels coming into dock should be adequately strengthened to withstand the pressure of ice.

As I said, it makes sense from our point of view to look at this overall issue not just as a European Union issue, but as an issue which also concerns candidate countries and neighbouring countries, including Russia. What I would say is that all these changes we are pushing forward are pointless if they only apply to the European Union and are not adopted by international organisations, especially the IMO, which could certainly help to ensure that the obligation to introduce double-hulled ships applies to every country, not just Europe. So we are making a dual effort; we are endeavouring to improve our own legislation to prevent these accidents and, at the same time, to push the necessary measures through at international level; in our own backyard to start with and at international level, in order to show that we mean business when it comes to the safety of these tankers and the prevention of similar disasters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council takes account of Parliament’s resolutions and endorses most of the principles contained in them. To be precise, the Council endorsed the objective of banning substandard ships from European Union waters.</p>
<p class="contents">In one of the measures contained in the conclusions which it issued on 6 December on maritime security and the prevention of pollution, the Council expressed its support for the ongoing work in the IMO to develop a flag state code and a compulsory model audit scheme aimed at ensuring that flag states carry out their duties under the international conventions. Generally speaking, the Council stressed the necessity to re-examine international rules concerning the law of the seas and maritime transport that lead to irresponsibilities and negligence tolerated by certain open registers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission may take the initiative and propose special measures for ships sailing under so-called flags of convenience. However, the Council is convinced that the objective set can be achieved by making a better choice of measures applied against ships which are substandard, for example by stepping up port state controls. Current legislation allows port state controls to be stepped up on the basis of the criteria for classifying substandard ships. These criteria are laid down in the Paris Memorandum of Understanding and include the ship’s flag.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, under the port state directive, which must enter into force by 22 July 2003 and which forms part of the Erika I package, Member States may refuse port access to various categories of ships flying the flag of a country on the black list published in the annual report of the Memorandum of Understanding which have already been detained in the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You referred to the fresh measures taken regarding the IMO, but the reason why Parliament has proposed that flags of convenience be banned is that we are all well aware, in the debates that we have had following maritime disasters, that the nature of flags of convenience is that in the event of problems, it is incredibly difficult to locate those responsible. We are well aware that, throughout the chain that links the flag, the State, the captain of the boat and the various crews, it is no longer possible to determine in the end who we are going to ask to be held criminally and financially responsible, which is the reason for Parliament’s proposal.</p>

The best strategy for amending, for changing international legislation is to pass a specific European law. The rest will follow as an inevitable consequence. Why not give this a try? Could it perhaps be because some Member States such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Greece are opposed, as happened at the Copenhagen Council?

As I said earlier, we need to evaluate any important ideas, innovations or legislation in other countries in the light of our own experience. I should also like to say that the summit Council took a very important decision in Copenhagen, the Council of transport ministers took a decision dealing with these aspects and I am sure that no Member State has any desire to block measures which will help to protect the environment. The Member States which you mentioned have every reason to want to protect their coastline. The United Kingdom has an extensive coastline. Greece has an extensive coastline. It would be incongruous if a country such as the United Kingdom did not want to protect its coastline. I think that the European Union, and the Council in particular, has every intention of passing the necessary legislation, as does the Commission, which has the initiative for any new regulations. So we are waiting for initiatives from the Commission and we are prepared to shoulder our responsibility in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must reiterate that we cannot assume that our legislation alone is protection enough. It would be an easy way out and we would adopt it immediately if that was the only way of ensuring our countries and coastlines were protected; but neighbouring countries need to do likewise. We have mentioned the new members, we have mentioned Russia and the Mediterranean countries, but what I would say is that at an international level – and we mentioned this aspect also – these requirements, these standards which help to protect not just European countries and coastlines but, as one Member said, the other countries and the other coastlines on the planet, also need to be adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Poisoning of stray dogs and cats in Greece</span></p>
<p class="contents">Just a few days before Greece took over the Council Presidency, most recently on 30 December 2002, large numbers of stray dogs and cats were poisoned in Athens. A similar incident occurred shortly before the start of the last Greek Presidency. These systematic poisonings give rise to the suspicion that the sight of stray animals is to be erased from Athens' image when Greece holds the Council Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">On 30 January 2003 the Greek NGO umbrella organisation CIDAG (Coalition in Defence of Animals in Greece) handed the Greek Embassy in Brussels a petition bearing 47 000 signatures calling for these deplorable events to be investigated and brought to an end as soon as possible.</p>

I admit that is asking a lot of you. I believe that this is relevant to the Council – I did in fact also put this question to the Commission but it did not reach it yesterday – because the umbrella organisation for all Greece's animal protection organisations has told us that the Council wanted Athens ‘cleansed’ so that the EU would not have to put up with seeing stray dogs there. Please accept that I love Athens, which I regard as the cradle of our culture and the birthplace of everything that we think and feel. But I always sleep very badly in Athens because it simply upsets me so much to hear these stray dogs barking.</p>
<p class="contents">The point I wish to make is this, and neither the dogs nor I will mind if you address this as a member of the public or as a member of a government. There are animal protection organisations in Greece, and I know that they catch dogs and that they put down the old and sick dogs that are beyond help, and that they seek good homes for the healthy ones, and that the remainder are neutered and then released again. I believe that these organisations need money and the support of members of the public. If a particular member of the public also happened to be a minister, that would do no harm at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of these programmes is the Ulysses programme, the purpose of which is to contain illegal immigration by sea to the northern shores of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. A progress report on the application of the plan for the management of the external borders was submitted to the Council on 19 December 2002. The report stated that the Ulysses programme would start at the beginning of 2003. The first stage of the operation was implemented in the Mediterranean between the 25 January and 10 February 2003. Spain, which is heading the operation, informed the Council that the second part of the operation would take place in April 2003. However, the Council does not have specific information at this precise moment about the exact date of the operation or its geographical scope. These operational aspects will be decided by the head of the operation and the participating countries. A final report on the application of the various programmes, operations and cooperation centres will be presented to the Justice and Home Affairs Council to be held on 5 and 6 June this year. The aim is to submit this report to the European Council in Thessalonika, which will of course discuss the broader issues of immigration, illegal immigration, border protection and other important matters, such as the social integration of legal immigrants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To date, some information on the programme’s efficiency has been published. It appears that, despite the existence of the programme, 300 immigrants have been found in the straits zone since its entry into force, which means that it is not being particularly effective. The real problem, however, is that, at the same time, there has been an increase in illegal immigration to the Atlantic islands, which are in a similar position: they are like a receptacle full of liquid from which, if one hole is stopped up, the liquid leaks out of another, with greater force.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to ask the Presidency whether it is aware that if the Ulysses programme is effective in stopping illegal immigration in the Mediterranean, it will increase illegal immigration via the Atlantic islands and, therefore, whether the Council is aware of the urgent need to implement the Ulysses programme in the Atlantic territory, as soon as possible, if it wishes its actions to be at all effective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I said, this is a pilot programme because, basically, this is the first time there has been such extensive collaboration between the Member States on this sort of operation. What we are trying to do is to see where we can improve our border protection against illegal immigration. The problem of illegal immigration is, of course, a complicated problem because there is not just the question of protecting our borders; other factors come into play, such as hotbeds of war, hotbeds of poverty, environmental, political and other crises. All these are factors which affect the rise and fall in immigration and the choice of crossing point and encourage illegal immigration. I agree that the results of this operation are by no means guaranteed. This is a pilot programme and it will need to be evaluated, as will numerous other measures we need to take in connection with other Union policies, such as justice and home affairs, development cooperation and bilateral relations with numerous countries, measures that we trust will also have positive results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I personally think these are worthwhile proposals. The Council has not yet reached a decision on these issues. As I said, they are on the agenda for the summit in Thessalonika. Until then, immigration and illegal immigration will be the subject of serious debate in the Council. Of course, the initial basic debate on these issues was held in Tampere in Finland and it was this that set the ball rolling in the right direction. We all discussed the top priority of addressing the question of illegal immigration during the Spanish Presidency and the Greek Presidency’s priorities include both the question of illegal immigration and the integration of legal immigrants. A directive was issued recently which is successfully reuniting families. This directive was agreed at the informal meeting of the 15 ministers for justice and home affairs.</p>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 9 by Olivier Dupuis (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2003-0087_EN.html">H-0087/03</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Enlargement</span></p>
<p class="contents">One of the priorities of the Greek Presidency is the strengthening of relations between the EU and those European countries which are still not on the list of applicant states. This is clear from the recent visit (13-15 January 2003) of the Greek minister Mr Papandreou to the western Balkans, during which he met the region's national leaders. For obvious reasons, relating both to clearly understood mutual interests and to the EU's political and historical obligations towards those countries, it is now incumbent on the Union to recognise, formally and without delay, the legitimate aspirations to full membership of the European family of Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia (FYROM), Moldova and Serbia-Montenegro.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, does the Greek Presidency intend to use the occasion of the Thessaloniki European Council, in June 2003, to add those ten countries to the list of applicant states, while making it clear that the opening of accession negotiations will depend on the political, institutional and economic progress made by each of those countries vis-à-vis the Copenhagen criteria, as well as on their degree of incorporation of the acquis communautaire, and that the accession negotiations will only be concluded following the closure of the various negotiation chapters in the light of the real reforms made by the candidate states concerned? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Copenhagen European Council in December last year recalled the candidacy criteria set by the Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 and reaffirmed the European perspective of the countries of the western Balkans. The Council also underlined its determination to support their efforts to move closer to the European Union and welcomed the decision and the priority set by the Greek Presidency to organise a summit on 21 June in Thessalonika. This summit will be attended by the Member States of the European Union and the countries of the western Balkans. The Greek Presidency’s programme of work on enlargement expressly states that the presidency will continue and step up cooperation with the countries in the region in order to promote their maximum possible integration into European political and economic life. Naturally our aim is to ensure this process helps countries actually acquire the status of candidates for accession to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council would also remind you that, of these countries, Croatia submitted an accession request on 21 February 2003. The Council is due to evaluate this request shortly so that it can pass it on to the Commission, which will evaluate it in detail and give its opinion before the Council reaches a decision on its candidacy.</p>
<p class="contents">This request is, I think, indicative of the region’s interest in moving towards Europe and of the importance which the European Union has acquired. It is, if you like, a magnet for the region, giving us reason to believe that the European Union is an important incentive for the region to carry out the necessary reforms, reforms which are vital to stability in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying, therefore, that the summit in Thessalonika will be another milestone in special relations between the European Union and the western Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the countries of the southern Caucasus are concerned, the European Union and its Member States and Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldavia have signed partnership and cooperation agreements. The European Union has promised to help establish the rule of law, economic reform, peace, security and stability in these countries, none of which has as yet submitted an application to join the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One question: you yourself say that Croatia has already made an application for accession and that Macedonia has also announced that it will do the same in the autumn. With these accessions being announced, would it not be politically better for the European Union to propose that these countries be put on the list of candidate countries, which is legally and politically different from formally opening up negotiations?</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the countries of the Caucasus, which I have had many opportunities to visit, each time I have noticed that the Greek ambassadors were more mindful of the need to ensure a clear possibility for integrating those countries into the European Union. You know as well as I do that the destabilisation brought about by a major neighbouring country has had absolutely devastating effects and that it is a vicious circle, that without a clear option of accession these countries will not be able to get out of the spiral. So do you not think that it is urgent that the Union should propose the same to those countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, you said that we should consider registering these countries. If you mean the official prospects of these countries becoming candidates, and perhaps that is precisely what you meant, this has already been decided and is, I think, an important message. We have the ten new countries which will join at the signing ceremony in Athens on 16 April, we have the three candidate countries, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, and we hope to give the countries in the western Balkans the prospect of becoming candidates. So there is a clear commitment here, subject of course to compliance with requirements, by which I mean the Copenhagen criteria, important reform, good neighbourly relations and regional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Caucasus is concerned, thank you for your kind words about the Greek ambassadors; it is true that they are well tuned to the needs of these specific countries. Of course, I represent the Fifteen here and I should like at this point to tell you that the Council has repeatedly discussed the question of candidate countries such as Turkey. We took a very important decision in Copenhagen about what you might call its new prospects and evaluation for 2004, so that negotiations can open once it meets the criteria. Of course, a serious debate is still under way and has not reached a conclusion about the borders of the European Union, about how far the Union should extend and which countries should, in fact, be allowed to join. The Council has not yet answered this question, so I am unable to give you an answer. But you have raised an important issue which will no doubt engage both the Council and the European Parliament for a long time to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yesterday the Commission adopted a strategy for a good neighbourly relations policy which also lists those countries covered by the policy. Is any significance to be attached to this strategic proposal by the Commission given that we are discussing the possible decision at the Thessaloniki Summit to open negotiations with the new candidate countries? In other words I am asking what the relation is between this strategy for a good neighbourly relations policy and the new, possibly to be called candidate, countries? Is the purpose of the neighbourly relations policy to specify which regions and states can never join the Union, or, in other words, is this in fact a matter of defining the Union’s borders? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By definition, enlargement changes the borders of the European Union, and what we want to emphasise is that these borders will operate not as new Berlin walls, but as bridges for cooperation. Bridges for cooperation, of course, based on our common values, our objectives for democracy, freedom, respect for human rights, economic and cultural relations, security, our approach to organised crime and joint cooperation with this region as a whole, our common region which extends from Russia to the Mediterranean. The Commission, therefore, has a role to play and we have asked the Commission in repeated debates in the Council to come forward with a proposal for this new common region and how these bridges for cooperation with our neighbours can be strengthened; however, this has not been linked with candidates’ prospects. As I said to the previous speaker, this is a serious problem and a broad dialogue has been opened on the issue; I think you also mentioned it and it has been discussed at the Convention, but we have not taken any decisions. So yes, the Commission has prepared a text and it will be discussed at the European Conference in Athens the day after the signing ceremony with the ten new countries. This conference will be attended by some 40 countries, but not as prospective candidates. That is a separate issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, as I said earlier, we have condemned this incident and expressed our sorrow.

This is the message which the presidency is sending Serbia and the Serbian nation and the region as a whole today, and we shall do everything we can to help in this direction. We are due to hold a Council of Ministers very shortly, within the next few days, so I see no reason to convene an extraordinary Council; it might even generate certain fears. We do not think that this incident should cause any internal disruption, over and above sorrow and shock. It is on our agenda and we shall take measures over the next few days if any special support is needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
