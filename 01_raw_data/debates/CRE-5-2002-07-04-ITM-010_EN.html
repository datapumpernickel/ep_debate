<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Medina Ortega (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, we should in fact have addressed the Argentina crisis last January, when it was at its crucial point, but the changeover of duties prevented this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Argentine situation has improved since December, but we are still faced with tremendous difficulties. A few days ago some incidents took place, in which two people were killed and dozens wounded. Yesterday, the President of the Argentine Republic, Mr Duhalde, announced that the elections would be brought forward to May instead of October.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, when we address the problem of Argentina in these institutions, we should refrain from lecturing. Naturally, I do not think either Parliament or the institutions of the European Union as a whole are in a position to lecture. In particular, it is difficult to do so in the case of a country like Argentina, which has been the prize pupil of the International Monetary Fund and which we have often praised for following this type of policy. The pupil, however, was not as good as it appeared: there has been an excessive accumulation of public debt, uncontrolled public spending and now, as a result, the financial system has collapsed.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is difficult to recommend doctrinaire solutions. On the one hand, I do not think that going back to old recipes of replacing imports, or old recipes of dependency theories, solves anything. They might satisfy us intellectually, but they do not solve anything. Of course, it is equally untrue that the solutions devised at Davos, the solutions of the gospel of neoliberalism, have led the country towards a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we need to look for a far more pragmatic solution. There are countries in Latin America which, albeit with difficulty, are overcoming these problems. The best example of this is Chile, but Brazil, under Fernando Enrique Cardoso, also seems to be coping under difficult circumstances. The most important thing is for the European institutions to instigate aid to Argentina, which is a democratic country, with freedom of the press, a high level of culture and excellent economic, commercial, political etc. relations with our Union. We should consider similar aid to that given to Turkey. In Turkey’s case it is possible that this aid may have influenced its role as a strategic country in the Middle East. Argentina may not be in a strategic area, but if we do not help Argentina, there is a danger that the rest of Latin America might follow in its footsteps.</p>
<p class="contents">From my point of view and that of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, therefore, the important thing now is not to provide solutions or recommendations, but to ensure that the European institutions and our Governments take action to support this economy and this country which, given the close relationship it has with us, deserves our backing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With reference not to January, when the crisis started, but to the fact that I have been trying to get this resolution debated for over two months with little success, I feel that the very nature of urgent debates must be reviewed. Indeed, whether we achieve much or little depends on the speed with which decisions are taken and recommendations laid down.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Argentina is certainly awkward and sensitive. It is awkward in that all economic or financial mechanisms are effectively frozen. In particular, it is absolutely impossible to withdraw money from a bank deposit except by means of credit card transactions, and these transactions carry the obligation to replenish the reserve. A deposited sum can therefore not be used in any way. Extremely dubious options have, moreover, been provided for the purchase of three- or ten-year bonds but the yield or redeemability of these is uncertain. In any case, it is worth pointing out that it would be absolutely impossible to survive on the yield from these bonds.</p>
<p class="contents">There is something else I would point out to Mr Medina Ortega, and that is that, rightly or wrongly, where Argentina leads other countries follow: it is seen as an example. There is therefore a possibility that Uruguay, which is already in a similar situation – not to mention Chile and Brazil – might follow Argentina’s bad example.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to stress that it is extremely difficult to draw up proposals. Indeed, the resolution seeks purely to stress the fact that there is a crisis. It is up to the International Monetary Fund to make a quick decision as to whether to provide aid to the Argentinean crisis and the Argentinean State. One initial step towards resolving the crisis could be to propose once again the creation of an export circuit, specifically a credit card circuit, which must not just be virtual but provide the possibility for people to use their own funds within the bank circuit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The best example is recital H, which states: "whereas the violent incidents in Argentina that have claimed victims stem from the serious economic and social plight of the country [...], and from the fact that over 40% of the population is out of work". This is true, but it is not the whole truth, because the victims were caused by military suppression and two real people, with first names and surnames, have died, while more than 90 have been injured, and, moreover, the police shot their way into the headquarters of the United Left Party. In other words, poverty, unemployment and the serious crisis situation are not the whole story.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution calls on the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to provide aid to help Argentina weather the crisis, but says nothing about the conditions required for this to happen. Our amendments point out that Joseph E Stiglitz, former Vice-President of the World Bank, states that market deregulation, financial speculation and flight of capital are contributing factors to this crisis, in addition to any errors that might have been made by the Argentineans.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, a country as wealthy as Argentina has no right to leave the majority of its population in poverty. We must therefore help it to overcome its crisis, but only insofar as this is necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not just because Argentina is a favoured partner of the large trade bloc that goes by the name of Mercosur, but also because of its strong social and cultural links with old Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am afraid we are discovering, through some worrying facts, that the political and economic populism of this wealthy republic does not have a happy ending. The winds sown by certain governments are now being felt by Argentinean citizens, with the disastrous results of the economic whirlwinds we are currently seeing. That is why the European Parliament is calling for international solidarity to try to help these citizens of the southern cone of South America to come up with an appropriate economic policy. We must help a people which, in desperation, lives with and bears the consequences of damaging former government policies, on a daily basis.</p>

We need a proper debate on this and not just an urgency. This is a crisis that risks spreading to the rest of the economies of Latin America. The crisis is to a large extent the co-responsibility of the IMF's and the World Bank's irresponsible and crazy lending policies. Argentina was for a decade their favourite pupil, opening up the markets, putting money into financial speculation instead of productive investments and increasing the debt enormously. The dollar/peso parity, provided for through a change in the constitution, made exports far too expensive and therefore killed off the exports sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to see a huge aid package for social and productive investment, debt cancellation and a tribunal for those who were accomplices in buying out the country. This is a country that used to be the richest nation in Latin America and No 6 in the world! We should also be concerned about the actions of some Europeans. The Spanish are reclaiming the money they put in through their investments by buying up the electricity, water, banking, telecom and airline sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">A thorough investigation of the crimes is essential, with those responsible being brought to justice. In the last week alone there has been excessive and violent repression by police, including the use of firearms. Two demonstrators have died, 90 people have been injured and 150 people have been arrested. There was also a raid on the headquarters of the United Left Party without even a court order. These issues need to be addressed and those responsible brought to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs to distance itself from the neo-liberal economic programmes that are being provided. We must reject the IMF's and World Bank's recipes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Visiting Buenos Aires today, what you experience is a fascinating mini-Europe. The peoples of Europe are united there in all their cultural richness and live peacefully together. The position is reversed today, a century and, in some cases, fifty years later, with long queues of Argentineans of European origin forming in front of the European embassies in their desire to emigrate to Europe. This is symbolic of the success of Europe and of European unification, but is also, alas, an indication of Argentina's failure. I have to say, as someone who loves and values that country beyond all measure, that this is something that we as Europeans must regret, and something that requires that we offer our help in a spirit of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I do believe, though, that Mrs McKenna is oversimplifying matters with her references to international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. It must be clear to us that Argentina is a country which really is flowing with milk and honey. It has meat, honey, milk and wine – all of it of the highest quality and available in abundance. Argentina's agriculture could feed Europe as well as its own people. Argentina has oil and natural gas, exports energy and, with its ideal conditions, is one of the richest countries in the world. That such extreme social tensions should have come about in this country – I really have seen urban areas ablaze, burning tyres on the motorways, blockades and riots – simply has to be primarily attributed to the lamentable fact that Argentina has a political system that does not work, that is inefficient and corrupt and gives rise to enormous costs. For example, in poor provinces such as Misiones, the members of the provincial legislature earn more than an MEP. I do not begrudge anyone their salary – that is not the point at issue – but Argentina has an enormously inefficient system, and if it does not sort out its home-grown problems itself, as its neighbour Brazil has made a start on doing, then we Europeans can do nothing either. We must help others to help themselves.</p>

The only response that Argentina’s leaders have found is to shoot on unemployed Argentineans who were taking part in demonstrations, killing two youths and injuring hundreds of people.</p>
<p class="contents">What is happening in Argentina is appalling, all the more so because this country, which was not even one of the world’s poorest, was plundered for years by large American – and European – corporations, which enjoyed a booming trade whilst running this country into the ground. Although the majority of the population is bankrupt, a rich minority, be it Argentinean or foreign, continues to grow richer.</p>
<p class="contents">The only thing that the joint resolution finds to say, apart from some vague turns of phrase condemning the economic, political and social crisis as if it were a natural disaster, is to protest against the attack on the right to property and to call for action from the Argentine Government to enforce respect for the fundamental right to property of local savers and foreign investors. In our view, this amounts to saying that those who do not have property or investments therefore only have the right to die, and Parliament will not even utter a word of protest.</p>
<p class="contents">We would have voted for a motion for a resolution by the Confederal Group of the European United Left, which at least condemns the police’s brutal repression. We utterly reject the joint resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission agrees that the deep root of these acts lies in a monetary crisis, which transformed itself into a commercial and economic crisis (sharp fall in trade, investment and GDP), deteriorated into a social crisis (unemployment, poverty and social exclusion) and is ending in a crisis of confidence in the national institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very complicated to analyse the reasons for the crisis in a resolution or discussion in Parliament, but on the other hand it is very easy to blame the international organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures linked to the so-called "coralito", the peso/dollar parity introduced by law, and the resulting lack of any room for manoeuvre on monetary policy, among other examples, do not correspond to the IMF recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">Now there is a need for reforms. The reforms that Argentina has to carry out are necessary not only to obtain help from the IMF, but more importantly to get the country moving again. What is needed is to win back citizens’ confidence in the democratic institutions, to win back the confidence of economic actors in the stability and credibility of law and order, and, in particular, to restore the credibility of the financial system.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and its Member States have already tried to help Argentina in the different international organisations, including the IMF and the last G8 Summit. The Commission, in particular, has a very firm idea of what to do. Something that would undoubtedly help Argentina is deeper integration of the Mercosur countries and the European Union is making an effort to accelerate its negotiations with Mercosur. To this end, Commissioners Lamy and Patten will hold a meeting with the Mercosur ministers on 23 July in Brasilia. The negotiations between Mercosur and the European Union will undoubtedly help promote internal cohesion in Mercosur that will in turn help Argentina.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of traditional cooperation, the financial resources that we have at our disposal are disproportionately low compared to the problem we are debating. However, our country strategy paper has identified the fight against poverty and institutional support as the two main priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
