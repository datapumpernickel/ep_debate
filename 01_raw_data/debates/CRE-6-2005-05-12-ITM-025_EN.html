Russia is not a member of our Community. One can say that it has more than enough problems without my criticism. The situation of the Russian minority in some European countries is also worrying - perhaps, sometime, we can discuss that as well. However, this afternoon we are talking about a small Finno-Ugric nation somewhere in the huge Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Around 750 000 Maris live in the Republic of Mari El inside the Russian Federation. The autonomous Republic is named after them, but they happened to become a minority in their own land. In a country with fair minority rights it is not a problem, but that is not the case in the small Republic of Mari El. The Russian-speaking majority elected a Russian president against a Mari candidate, which can be understood. However, the re-elected president seems to lead an undemocratic and brutal fight against his opposition and, through them, the whole Mari community.</p>
<p class="contents">Mari opposition newspapers can be printed only outside of the Republic. Opposition journalists and intellectuals have been attacked frequently; some of them have been killed. Minority language education is threatened by the local authorities. We have to condemn those kinds of anti-democratic atrocities always, but in the case of a small nation, the attacks against the basic national institutions, such as schools and media, threaten the very existence of the nation. That is why we condemn the violence against the Mari minority in Russia, and that is why we ask the Russian Government to show the same kind of attitude toward its minorities that the Russian Government would like to be provided for the Russian minorities elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this is the first time that the name of the Mari people has been mentioned in the European Parliament. I welcome them here, both as a European and a Finno-Ugric brother from Hungary. I wish them all the best. They should know that a nation, small or big, inside or outside of Europe, deserves the same respect and the same rights. I hope our Russian partners also understand that every minority – Russians out of Russia and non-Russians inside Russia – deserve the same rights to save their identity, culture and linguistic heritage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Connected with that is a respect for one’s native language. Moreover, using one’s own language creates a sense of security. A person’s language is the basis of his or her culture. Culture is language-bound and language is culture-bound.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain events in the region of Mari El, in Russia, have caused us, as Finno-Ugric linguistic relatives of the Mari people, to focus our attention on the status of minorities and minority languages in Russia. This is also a matter of democracy. Democracy is not just about voting. Democracy also means working on issues with others and being able to use one’s own language. The events that have taken place in Mari El, which are clearly associated with violence and human rights violations, need to be made the subject of a local criminal investigation. This will increase Russia’s credibility as a state subject to the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three Finno-Ugric nation states in the European Union, and in addition there are three million people representing the Finno-Ugric nations in Russia. There are seven countries in Europe with populations smaller than that of the Finno-Ugric peoples in Russia. These representatives of the Finno-Ugric nations in Russia are, however, spread over many regions in a large country.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, we could talk far more generally about safeguarding the position of minorities and languages in Russia. We hope that the state authorities in Russia will give more support than they do now to school attendance and studying in one’s own language. Cultural and linguistic diversity is a source of immense wealth in Russia, and we hope that it will be exploited better than it is now, and more than it is now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad to see all parties making clear their unanimous and unequivocal position on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">When fundamental democratic rights and issues of civil and minority rights are at stake, any appeal to reasons of state or economic interest is false and inadmissible. I am from the South Tyrol, a region with ethnic minorities, and, in comparison with many others, it is now in a privileged position. Particularly now, 60 years after our liberation from fascism and National Socialism, we still remember well how the state used the traditional forms of oppression to discriminate against minorities, including the banning of political opposition, attacks on the media through the intimidation of journalists, putting at a disadvantage all who did not speak the official language, outlawing mother-tongue education, the courts’ unwillingness to act against such injustices, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">State power uses always the same means of oppression against minorities, for whom solidarity from outside is very important, and so I very much welcome this House’s outcry today against the Russification of the Republic of Mari El. The Mari speakers are a small linguistic group, and need a great deal of solidarity from the international community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the collapse of Communism did not bring about freedom, nor did it grant rights to the small nations of Russia. At a conference at the end of last week, Vladimir Kozlov, one of the leaders of today’s opposition, said that real ethnic cleansing is being carried out in the Republic of Mari, especially in administration, the overt goal of which is the elimination of the autonomous Mari Republic. His statement is of no surprise, since the current president of the Republic of Mari is a Russian citizen, the Moscow-born Mr Leonid Markelov, who does not even speak the local language. During his presidency, attacks against free press have become regular, opposition leaders and journalists have been assaulted, including the opposition candidate, Mihail Dolgov, a Mari national, who was brutally assaulted. By the way, no judicial verdict has been reached in any of these cases yet. Mari language schools are being closed down, and education in the Mari language is only allowed in the primary levels of elementary education. Only Russian can be used in administration, all of this pointing to the fact that this minority’s rights are seriously restricted.</p>
<p class="contents">An agreement, called the action plan, was ceremoniously concluded between the EU and Russia the day before yesterday. At last, we have an opportunity to provide direct assistance to those who live there, instead of just condemning Russia’s practice. This plan allows us to cooperate in the field of minority rights, that is, to promote the use of minority languages, preservation of cultures, the publication of textbooks, to encourage exchange programmes, scientific and scholarship schemes, and to foster an independent media and education in the mother tongue. This action plan also promotes strengthening an independent and unbiased judicial system. We must, therefore, help Russia in order for the offenders to be brought to justice, so that order and safety may finally prevail in the Republic of Mari as well. For this reason, I would like to ask the Commission and the Council to act firmly and provide specific programmes to protect the maltreated Mari minority based on the new agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are being called upon to consider the life and tragedy of a small nation that has, quite frankly, been conquered by Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Ever since the 16th century, Russia has adopted a different approach to national expansion from that of the colonial powers. Although the latter gained power over various countries throughout the world, they did not generally believe that these countries should be fully integrated with the colonial homeland and robbed of their cultural, national and linguistic identities. Russia approached the matter differently, by immediately deciding to Russify every country it conquered, and to deprive the country of its identity and the inhabitants of their religion and language.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia took this approach towards Poland in the 19th century, and the Poles suffered a great deal as a result. As a rule, Russia’s attempts to Russify the country were extremely cruel, as they consisted in exiling tens and hundreds of thousands of people. Although some of them were simply encouraged to leave, many were brutally forced to do so, with Russians then arriving to take their place. There was a sharp rise in such practices when the Communists came to power following the October Revolution, as it was then that Russia decided to intensify efforts to Russify all of the countries under its rule. The small Finno-Ugric nation we are discussing today, namely the Republic of Mari El, also fell victim to Russia. This small republic is now entirely under the control of the Russians who went to live there, and its original inhabitants, the Finno-Ugric people, are now nothing more than a persecuted minority.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind the House that the same is in fact true in those countries that have freed themselves from Russian rule. The majority of the people in these countries still belong to the original population, rather than being Russian, but there is a powerful Russian minority that does not view itself as being in any way integrated. This kind of situation can be seen in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, where the Russian minorities are determined to make their presence felt, regardless of the interests of the countries in which they live. One need only pick up a newspaper in any of these countries to see that the Russian populations are antagonistic or downright hostile to their countries of residence. These populations frequently claim rights that in any other circumstances we would acknowledge, yet a prerequisite for the acknowledgement of such rights is that the people concerned demonstrate at least minumum loyalty towards the countries in which they live.</p>
<p class="contents">Matters are even worse in the Republic of Mari El, as Russians now form the majority, and the original population has become a persecuted minority. Journalists are murdered, there are not enough schools, it is impossible to receive an education and anyone who speaks out in favour of the Finno-Ugric population is persecuted.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that a balance is achieved between the rights of the original owners of the country and those of the democratic majority. The latter is in fact simply an occupying force, and it must not be allowed to tyrannise and persecute the minority of original inhabitants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the Russian Federation there are 19 different nations of the Finno-Ugric family, totalling 2.7 million persons. All are minorities in their respective autonomous republics. There are serious obstacles to the practical implementation of the cultural and educational rights of these minorities. For example, education in the Mari language is provided only in some elementary schools, so that only about 20% of children can enjoy lessons in their mother tongue. The publication of textbooks in Mari is practically non-existent. So the linguistic identity of the Mari is slowly fading.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also concerned about political developments in Mari El Republic. Last December, the local president, Leonid Markelov, considered to be a strong pro-Moscow politician to the detriment of native cultural autonomy, was re-elected. When the Mari ethnic opposition, led by Mr Vladimir Kozlov, questioned the fairness of the election results, Mr Kozlov was brutally beaten up. There has still been no satisfactory investigation into that act of violence. Alarmingly, independent journalists have been harassed for a considerable period of time; three of them were murdered in 2001, many others have been intimidated and their papers forced to close down.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, as a result of the recent elections, several Mari school directors and civil servants of Mari background have lost their jobs. School directors were forced to give explanations as to why people in their areas voted for the opposition candidate.</p>
<p class="contents">A considerable number of MEPs have signed an appeal in support of the cultural rights of Mari people. This appeal has collected almost 10 000 signatures. The point of our resolution is to call on the Russian authorities to respect their obligations under international law and 'to provide quality education in one's native language on all levels, thus securing that the Mari language and Russian are placed on the same footing throughout the Republic.'</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During its course of history, the Mari nation, for the most part, has successfully withstood assimilation, and has effectively fought to preserve its own language and identity. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the situation of Mari El, the Republic of Mari, was promising. However, it did not last long, eight to nine years, perhaps, when a new anti-diversity policy was launched by Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mari nation’s hope for enjoying equal rights with Russians was shattered. The Mari language is excluded from the public sphere, education and the media and Mari activists are harassed, assaulted and forced to leave Mari El. Although it would be absolutely necessary for the central authority to intervene, there is no sign of it at all. Either ignorance or the tacit acceptance of anti-Mari campaigning prevails. Pressure on Maris has considerably increased this past year. This proposal’s goal is to send a multi-dimensional signal towards, firstly, Moscow as a reminder of its commitment to preserve the cultural diversity of its minorities instead of eliminating them. Secondly, this signal would also be directed to the Russian elite living in Mari El to remind them that it is not possible to launch minority oppression unnoticed in the 21st century. Thirdly, toward the Mari people to reassure them that the European public is attentively monitoring their hardships, and is ready to support their cause. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">at today’s discussion, it would be appropriate to quote Vladimir Lenin. Lenin referred to Tsarist Russia as a prison of nations, though the Soviet Union was no different from Tsarist Russia in that respect. Lenin’s words are still timely today, since the Kremlin, which is strengthening central authority and inciting nationalism, shows no respect for minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Xenophobia in Russia has taken the form of fascist strike forces. This is especially dangerous in a country where one fifth of the population is not of Slavic descent. The persecution and killing of non-Russian journalists is very worrying. This combines Vladimir Putin’s wish to suppress the independent media and ethnic discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">Evidence that the authorities support attacks on Maris is provided by the fact that fascist attacks have gone unpunished for years. When cooperating with Moscow, one should not turn a blind eye to the situation of the ethnic minorities in Russia. In his speeches, the Russian President Vladimir Putin often speaks of his commitment to European politics. Russia’s policy towards ethnic minorities, however, once again confirms that President Putin’s deeds do not match his words.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Second World War, ethnic strife has decreased in Europe. We respect cultural diversity, and seek to protect and support varied cultural traditions. Europe-leaning Russia should, like Europe, understand that cultural diversity is Russia’s strength, and not a danger. Unfortunately, however, we can see the opposite happening. For this reason, when taking part in political discussions with Russia, representatives of the European Union must seriously raise the issue of the protection of ethnic minorities in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">A total of 28 million members of ethnic minorities live in Russia. Of those, four million speak Finno-Ugric languages. Only around twenty books a year are published in the Mordvin language, which has about a million speakers; there is no daily newspaper, and the language is not taught in a single school. The situation of the Maris is somewhat better, but the number of publications is decreasing rapidly, and the absence of secondary and higher education in the Mari language also has an effect.</p>
<p class="contents">A European approach does not merely require Russia to end attacks against the ethnic opposition. It also means that the Russian Government must support the preservation of the languages and culture of ethnic minorities through legislation and other actions. At the moment, this is a dream, but it is the responsibility of European countries to support that dream, and if necessary fight for it.</p>

Unfortunately, this Republic belongs to the Mari only in name, as it is one of the numerous countries and nations that have been subordinated and annexed by Russia. Like the Armenians, the Chechens and many others, the Mari people have fought for years to retain their identity and independence. Even though the Mari ASSR declared its sovereignty in 1990, the situation of this nation is unfortunately becoming ever more difficult. Its inhabitants, known to us all from Russian and Polish literature as the Cheremis, speak a Finno-Ugric language. They have repeatedly been the victims of repressive measures, particularly during the Stalin era, when Komsomol groups chopped down their holy groves and the Mari were exiled to Siberia. It is for this reason that only half of the Mari people currently lives in the Republic of Mari El, with the rest scattered around Russia and forced to integrate with the Russian population.</p>
<p class="contents">President Markelov, who rules over the Republic of Mari El, came to power following a controversial election. He was born in Moscow and does not identify himself in any way with the nation, and in fact cannot even speak Mari. He systematically curtails the rights of the population, in particular with regard to freedom of speech. The Mari people find it difficult to receive education in their own language, as Mari schools have been closed and there are not enough schools or universities. Ethnic Mari civil servants have lost their jobs, and opposition journalists suffer persecution, as do the independent, private media. This has prompted them to seek help, both from the Finno-Ugric nations of Finland and Estonia, with which they share many cultural similarities, and from the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mari people have a right to sovereignty, independence and their own identity, as do all those fighting for the independence of countries and nations in the former USSR and elsewhere in the world. We are therefore opposed to the persecution they are suffering, as well as to the attempts at denationalisation and human rights violations that are taking place in the country. Although history provides us with many examples of the spirit and staying power of occupied nations, and even though their efforts have often been crowned with success, the price of such success is frequently the suffering and death of a large number of people. As the late Holy Father John Paul II once said, one nation must never expand at the expense of another, that is at the expense of another nation’s subordination, conquest, coercion, exploitation and death.</p>
<p class="contents">If different countries and nations are forced to live together under one government, sooner or later this will always result in a threat to peace and a struggle for independence and sovereignty. An emerging superpower like the European Union would do well to heed this warning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The right of all peoples to use their own language, to preserve their cultural identity and to promote their own culture, even if the language and culture involved are those of a very small nation, is one of these standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia signed the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages exactly four years and two days ago. It is therefore by no means unreasonable to call on Russia to respect the Mari language, which has been officially recognised as the language of the Republic of Mari El. This is especially important with regard to secondary schools and universities, where respect for the Mari language is currently lacking. The repressive measures taken against head teachers and journalists who have defended the sovereignty of this small nation are also a particular cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">We have no desire to chastise Russia, as it is a country with which we wish to cooperate closely. Yet we cannot shut our eyes and ears to human rights violations, wherever in Europe they occur. We cannot sacrifice human rights and the rights of minorities for the sake of cooperation with Moscow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also know about the problems raised by certain Members of the European Parliament in connection with the treatment of Maris – the problems aired again here today – and, specifically, as regards the Mari language in schools, the obstruction of the media and the recent presidential elections in December 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that common values, including respect for human rights, are the cornerstone of its relations with Russia. During the EU/Russia summit in The Hague in November 2004, Presidents Putin and Barroso agreed to hold regular consultations between the European Union and Russia on human and minority rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's objective is to use these consultations to strengthen the open and constructive dialogue with Russia on all related matters.</p>
<p class="contents">A first round of these consultations was held on 1 May 2005 in Luxembourg. During this meeting, certain matters were examined, including the human rights situation, the rights of people who belong to minorities and fundamental freedoms in the Russian Federation and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also engaging in a constructive exchange of information about matters relating to cooperation on human rights in international fora, especially in the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that these consultations with Russia provide an appropriate framework for more detailed talks with the Russian authorities about the situation of the Maris.</p>
<p class="contents">For this, however, more information will be needed and, consequently, information and analyses by Members of Parliament are welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to inform you that the next round of consultations with Russia on human rights, the rights of people who belong to minorities and fundamental freedoms will probably be held in the second half of 2005 under the United Kingdom Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
