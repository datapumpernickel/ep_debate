<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, as Commissioner Fischler and I will be attending the fifth World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference at Cancún, in Mexico, next week, in order to negotiate on the EU’s behalf, the Commission had a discussion this afternoon on the current state of preparations for this conference. I would like to say a few words to you about this, and then reply to any comments you may have to make.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the success of the round of trade negotiations launched at Doha, eighteen months ago now, is still the European Union’s primary concern as regards trade. It is our expectation that greater openness to trade in goods and services and to investments will consolidate growth in Europe on the basis of the ground rules, which are to be strengthened in order to provide a framework for this greater openness. What is also important, though, is that we are seeking to better involve developing countries in the world trade system, in order that they may benefit from the opening up of commerce and enjoy more of the benefits of globalisation, the harmful effects of which – and these do, emphatically, exist – will at the same time be alleviated.</p>
<p class="contents">As we will be able to finally judge at the end of this programme of negotiations, the hurdles have been set fairly high. What sort of results do we need from Cancún to ensure the success of this negotiating round, which, at Doha, we called the ‘development programme’? That is what we, members of the World Trade Organisation, are going to consider together at Cancún next week, when we proceed with a sort of mid-term review in which what really matters is that we will at last know whether or not we will manage to wind up the negotiations between now and the end of next year, as we decided 18 months ago now. That, basically, is the question that we are going to try to answer in Cancún, and if we are to answer in the affirmative, we first confirm that these negotiations are subject to a deadline of the end of 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">If our answer is to be in the affirmative, we will, in Cancún, have to be able to point to the completion of 50% of the negotiations across the board. The fact is that these are not negotiations in which subjects are dealt with one after the other, with one being agreed on before moving on to the next; rather, these are wide-ranging negotiations on some twenty subjects which can be said to represent a balance between points that opposing sides wish either to defend or to attack.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue at Cancún is, then, whether, as regards these negotiations as a whole, we have covered about half the road, and whether we are sufficiently convinced of that to leave the final deadline of the end of next year unchanged. Our concern, the European concern, is that this mid-term review will see the confirmation of this balance, as envisaged in the original programme, between the opening up of markets on the one hand and the strengthening of trade ground rules on the other. We are very attached to this balance, and, in political terms, we see it as essential, corresponding as it does to our own economic system, by which I mean one that is open to trade, but bounded by a framework of rules reflecting social, health and environmental concerns. This characterises the European Union in these negotiations, and it must be retained. For that purpose, it is important that we make progress at a tempo comparable to that of the subjects raised in the course of negotiations as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Looked at from this angle, where do we stand? It has been clear over the past weeks that things have been speeding up in Geneva. It is apparent that the prospect of the meeting next week has already given a boost to negotiations that were occasionally tending to slow down. The President of the General Council of the World Trade Organisation, the ambassador who chairs what is termed the WTO’s General Council in Geneva, has put on the table a draft final statement which will serve as the basis on which the negotiators at ministerial level meeting in Cancún will work.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Fischler and I have already said on many occasions that we are not enthusiastic about this draft. We see various points in the draft statement as being seriously problematic, but it is a good thing that it actually exists and is clearly set out. Some things in it, I repeat, are not acceptable. Whether on agriculture, on industrial tariffs, whether on the environment or on geographical descriptions, we see this text as unbalanced, and so, I might add, do the other members of the WTO, but, as the WTO spokesman so humorously said, the ministers need something to do at Cancún. As negotiators on behalf of the Fifteen, we will continue to fight for a result that strikes a balance between the opening up of markets and the laying down of rules making it possible to give the developmental dimension a more prominent place in all subject areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We are often asked whether we are optimistic or pessimistic about Cancún’s chances of success. You have not yet asked this, but I would like to say to you that Commissioner Fischler and I are neither the one nor the other. We are negotiating on behalf of the EU, which has mandated us to do so. Its mandate sets limits to what we can accept, and, as is customary, we will give you an account of the progress of the debates, as things happen and on the spot. We will be accompanied by those who actually have political authority over us, namely the EU’s Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, as well as by representatives of other parties involved. We will therefore have the chance, on the spot, to evaluate precisely where we have got to, but let us be clear in our own minds about the fact that we have been formally mandated following debates held over recent months, both in the Council of Ministers and in Parliament. Commissioner Fischler and I will therefore take this mandate as the basis for what we do.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by emphasising that we will be taking with us good news when we set off for Cancún at the end of the week, and by that I mean the agreement reached last weekend on access to medicines. It may be said that this agreement derogates for the first time from current patent regulations in order to allow countries in need of them to import generic medicines. This agreement shows that the World Trade Organisation is capable of responding to the needs of developing countries. This is no longer merely a project, a speech, or a vision, but tangible confirmation that globalisation can, and must, go hand in hand with development. To sum up, although this agreement is only a small part of the enormous problem of poorer countries’ access to medicines, it nonetheless marks a forward step, and, with you as my witnesses, I welcome it on behalf of the EU. Apart from that, we know where we stand on the various subjects and, as I have just said, we will act on the basis of the mandate you have given us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What this is about is the successes that we are meant to be chalking up for Europe, and Commissioner Lamy was right to make the point that this is about opening up the market to trade, and I would like to emphasise that this is to be on a reciprocal basis. Our problem is, however, that there are still many technical barriers to trade, particularly for our European structure of small and medium-sized enterprises, in which two thirds of Europe’s workers are employed. This means that it is also important to set out positive effects of the Cancún round, showing what our chances are of growth in Europe and what kinds of new jobs might be created here.</p>

<p class="contents">According to your rhetoric, Commissioner, these negotiations were supposed to be heralding a development round which prioritises the concerns of developing countries. You like to portray the EU as a supporter and advocate of developing countries and yet the EU is now perceived as bullying these countries into a new set of issues on investment and competition, in spite of the fact that the vast majority of them have already categorically said that they do not want negotiations in these areas. Even the ACP Group – a group with which this Parliament is supposed to have a special relationship – has issued a statement stating it does not want them. The least-developed countries do not want them.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group, I would like to issue a challenge to you today. If you are serious about this new round genuinely being a development round and if you genuinely want the EU to be seen as a supporter of developing countries, will you ask the Council to withdraw the demands on these issues? If not, can you tell us how you square your so-called support for developing countries with your agenda, which is running precisely counter to their interests and wishes? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The President of the WTO has now come up, of course, with a proposal to cancel the peace agreement in the agricultural sphere. I know that this is not part of the mandate, but I nonetheless think it worth reflecting upon now that we are interested in obtaining equal trading conditions in this area too. We do in fact use the United States’s protectionists in the agricultural sphere to excuse our own protectionism. Why not instead do away with both forms of protectionism and enter into proper trading arrangements with the developing countries?</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is workers’ rights. How do we ensure that countries entering into agreements at the WTO observe, as a minimum, their own laws and rules governing workers’ rights, wages etc. I am thinking, for example, of Thailand where refugees from Burma work in prison-like conditions for virtually no money and where the trade goes directly to Europe. It is on our shelves that products from these prison camps are found. How are we to get this issue into the WTO negotiations? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Rübig is, I think, right to say that what is at stake in these negotiations is a matter of importance to small and medium-sized enterprises. To say that is to make in an elegant way the point that it is not just the big multinationals that have an interest in the multilateral trade system making balanced progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Geographical descriptions are a complicated subject, and I will briefly reiterate the EU’s negotiating objectives in this area. As regards wines and spirits first of all, we would welcome the WTO’s drawing up of a register, which would be binding in character. We would also welcome the extension of a number of arrangements protecting geographical descriptions for wines and spirits to cover also other agricultural and food products. Finally, we would welcome, as is only natural, the recovery of a number of geographical descriptions, a list of which we have drawn up under the auspices of Commissioner Fischler, which are of importance to our farmers, but still usurped in other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs McNally reiterated the Group of the Party of European Socialists’ position on investment. I will say something about that in responding to Mrs Lucas. How do we reconcile our desire for the WTO to focus on a multilateral accord on a number of principles governing investment, and our aspirations in terms of development? For a start, we see investment as an important factor in development, believing that a number of simple basic rules on such things as transparency and the predictability of investment schemes, would make an important contribution to investment; secondly, we are prepared to take on board in these negotiations certain of the developing countries’ concerns, which have been expressed from time to time and which boil down to the view that such rules would diminish their political sovereignty. We are willing to respond to this by putting forward a draft comprising a number of general rules that developing countries might adopt, should they wish to do so, without those not wishing to do so being obliged to be bound by them. In this way, a number of objections can be taken on board.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, by the way, remind Mrs McNally and Mrs Lucas that the developing countries are divided on this issue, with some being in favour and others not, and that this is true, moreover, of a number of other subjects. Within the WTO, there is no Northern front on the issues as a whole, nor is there a Southern front on other matters.</p>
<p class="contents">On this point, I would simply remind Mrs Lucas that these four subjects – investment, business facilitation, transparency in public purchasing and competition – form part of the negotiating programme drawn up at Doha, it being understood that we have to come to an agreement on how negotiations are to be conducted. This is also true of the other subjects, such as agricultural issues or industrial tariffs.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Olsson is right to say that agriculture is not, either, an issue on which, within the WTO, an uncompetitive and protectionist North is at loggerheads with a competitive and liberalising South. It is enough to consider the position of Brazil in comparison with that of India, that of Africa alongside that of Indonesia or Thailand, to be made immediately aware that things are not like that. In response to Mrs Frahm, I would say that our thinking is, in this discussion, pretty clear. For a start, we cannot treat agricultural production as a unity, as we tend to do with tyres, socks, shirts or cars. The specific characteristics of agricultural production mean that we Europeans have a number of reasons for not being in favour of the complete deregulation of agricultural markets, and so we seek to retain state intervention in favour of agriculture. That having been said, the manner in which the state intervenes has to be adapted in such a way as to do away with some of the obstacles they presented to the agricultural policies of the countries in the developing world. That is what we did in 1992, 1999, and 2003, and it is right to give Commissioner Fischler, who is sitting beside me this evening, the credit for the efforts made on these various occasions, when we adapted our common agricultural policy to international trade, for the particular benefit of developing countries. We will carry on down this road. We have committed ourselves to negotiating towards further reductions in our national subsidies in so far as they hamper trade, to improve our access to the market, to reduce our export subsidies. We will do this primarily for the benefit of the developing countries. Such is the basis on which the EU will be negotiating.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is in response to Mrs Frahm. There is in fact a problem with the relationship between respect for fundamental rights and the rules of international trade, just as there is with the rules of international trade and international accords on the environment, or in the case of how the rules of trade and public health concerns relate to one another. As regards public health, the World Trade Organisation has just decided in favour of access to generic medicines. Among the negotiations, the programme for which was adopted at Doha, there are talks on the relationship between the rules on the environment and those on trade. In contrast, there are no negotiations on the relationship between workers’ basic rights, in particular the International Labour Organisation’s five basic conventions, and the rules of international trade, as we have not managed to get our point of view accepted. This was among our negotiating objectives in Doha. On this point, we came up against the stonewalling of the United States and the developing countries. They did not want it, they still do not, and up to now, the EU’s position, valuable though it is – and I have always energetically defended it because I think it the right one – has gained no ground against the position of the developing countries and the United States. We are dealing here with a balance of power, one which, for the present, we have not managed to turn around in our favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union has pursued the right policy, which is to attempt to distinguish between the poorest countries, the so-called ‘least developed’ countries and the developing countries because there are enormous differences between these nations. India, Indonesia and Malaysia, for example, have nothing in common with the problems facing Mozambique or Burkina Faso.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue that we are now addressing, in other words, special and differentiated treatment, must be studied very carefully, because we cannot treat all these countries in the same way, since they are in fact different countries, with very different levels of development. This is why I would ask our Commissioner: what support does the approach adopted on this matter by the Commission offer the poorest countries, an approach that attempts to make a distinction between the poorest countries and the less poor ones?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the things we could probably do now in the European Union, which possesses the capacity to produce its own generic medicines, is to declare that we are prepared to issue such a declaration of compulsory licensing<span class="italic"> </span>in cases where developing countries ask for those medicines. This would, as it were, be a gesture on our part which demonstrates that those medicines will actually be supplied in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The other practical question concerns the blue box<span class="italic">.</span> Many fear that in agriculture, we will be using this blue box in order to again indirectly subsidise exports on a massive scale. Brazil has asked whether we are able to promise at this stage that we will be supporting this blue box – in other words the switch from product subsidy to blue-box subsidy – but that we will not be making improper use of it for the purpose of export subsidies. With this, we would really contribute to abolishing this export subsidy. I am interested to know whether this line of thinking is currently on the agenda or plays a part in our negotiators’ thinking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From what I have heard, I fear Members might be strengthening the position of those who maintain that agriculture is the only subject on the table at Cancún. This is not the case: there are in fact about nineteen others. As far as politics are concerned, I do not think it is really in the interests of the European Union to act as if agriculture were the only subject on the table at Cancún. We certainly do have a number of interests in agriculture. I referred earlier to the geographical factors for example. Nonetheless, our main interests lie elsewhere. I hope, therefore, that those of you who are concerned about the interests of the European Union in these negotiations will not contribute to this opinion that agriculture will be the only item on the agenda at Cancún.</p>
<p class="contents">I will, nevertheless, respond to the questions posed. Mr Cunha is right. Given that the situation of individual developing countries varies greatly, we must adopt a different approach for each of the countries we are concerned with. This process must operate within the multilateral system. It might not, however, always be easy to persuade Brazil to recognise that India’s position is different and vice versa. Even when Brazil maintains that it supports complete liberalisation, we know full well that this is not the Indian position. Arrangements of this sort will have to be established within the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also ensure that there is a role for the rest of our commercial agriculture policy, if I may term it thus. As you know, this policy rests on asymmetrical bilateral accords: we open up our markets more than we require developing countries to do. I am thinking here of the system of generalised preferences and the ‘Everything but arms’ system. In a sense, in establishing these systems, we have taken unilateral action to support developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a clear response to the questions of Mr O'Neachtain, Mr Bernié and Mrs Maes on the relationships between the common agricultural policy, its development and the international World Trade Organisation negotiations. My position on this point is also the position of Commissioner Fischler, the position of the Commission and that of the European Union. It is a simple one. First, we agree on which reforms of the CAP we consider necessary. Once these decisions have been taken, and taking account of proposals by other parties, we agree to measures in line with those we agreed amongst ourselves being set in stone at the World Trade Organisation. In short, the chicken is the CAP and the egg is international trade negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Compared with the United States, we tend to adopt a bottom up approach, if I may put it like that. The United States negotiates at an international level, gives undertakings and then deals with the consequences for their own system of support for agriculture. By its very nature, our agriculture mandate is limited by the present state of CAP reforms. This has always been perfectly clear, everyone knows the situation. Take the example of sugar. The sugar market has yet to be reformed. The Commission is working on it and we are expecting a proposal in the coming weeks. The same goes for cotton, tobacco and olive oil. At this stage, however, the European Union cannot enter into any commitments in the negotiations, as this would entail a change in the common market organisation on which no decision has yet been taken. In short, on this point, the situation is perfectly clear. Experience bears out that, when necessary and generally for our own reasons, we know how to decide on reforms that give us a certain margin of manoeuvre in negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to the agreement between the United States and the European Union, or, to be more precise, the interim framework agreement we negotiated this summer. I would respond to Mr De Clercq by saying that we have acted at the request of other members of the World Trade Organisation. The others urged us to reach an agreement. We are perceived as the two giants, spending around 1% of our national wealth on supporting the agricultural sector. They consider that it would be difficult to move forward with the negotiations as long as the United States and Europe hold different positions. We have responded to their request. It amounts to an interim position that would allow us to take the negotiations forward to the halfway stage. In that case, it would still need to complete the rest of the process. We are aware that certain countries, Japan on the one hand, and Brazil and Australia on the other, feel that the compromise reached is not exactly what they would like. There is nothing surprising in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to respond to Mr van den Berg and Mrs Maes, who referred to the agreement providing access to generic medicines for the poorest countries. As to the agreement itself, it is the result of discussions and received the unanimous approval of the World Trade Organisation, including the two-thirds of its members who are developing countries. I am sufficiently familiar with how international negotiations are conducted to know that the countries sitting around the table of the World Trade Organisation do actually take the decisions. Decisions are not taken for them. At the WTO negotiation table, the interests of developing countries are expressed by government representatives from these countries. The procedure is the same at the WHO, the FAO and the ILO. As soon as these government representatives state that they are satisfied with a decision that they had been pressing for for years, I consider that the negotiations have been concluded. I can be fairly sure though that some NGO or other will then maintain that the developing countries should have negotiated more forcefully. It is equally likely, however, that some pharmaceutical company or other will consider that we are the ones who should have negotiated more forcefully. This is what compromise is all about. I cannot put myself in the place of developing countries and say what is, or is not, in their interests. A political decision has been taken, and, consequently, this compromise will underpin our action in the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">This being that case, as I said a few moments ago, only part of the problem of access to generic medicines for the poorest countries has been resolved through this agreement. We have dealt with the problem of international patent law. This represents 10 % of the problem. We still need to deal with the difficulties that are not linked to the patent problem, namely the problems of finance, production and availability. To put it another way, 90% of the work remains to be done. We must work together, and join forces with other international organisations, especially those established to finance the work to combat some of the relevant diseases. This is about supporting development. It is about national governance. I do not overestimate the 10% of the work we have completed. It had to be done to show others the way forward. You must be aware of this, as we have been discussing matters with you on a very regular basis for three years. The way ahead is open. We can now dare to hope, something we have, unfortunately, not been in a position to do for far too long, as far as this issue is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I apologise deeply to all the Members who had asked to take the floor, but we have already overrun and we have to stop now in order to move on to Question Time. I know there were legitimate requests to speak. I did not use the d’Hondt system because I wanted to give at least one representative of each group the chance to speak. On this occasion, using the d’Hondt system would have penalised the smaller groups and I wanted to avoid that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
