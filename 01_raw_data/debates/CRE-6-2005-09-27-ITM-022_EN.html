<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jacques Barrot, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the adoption of the first two railway packages in 2001 and 2004, the Commission proposed a further set of legislative measures on 3 March 2004, collectively known as the third railway package.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of this third package is to supplement the regulatory framework for the railways at European level, so as to make progress on interoperability and to achieve greater integration of the market in passenger services, while at the same time safeguarding passenger rights. The measures also seek to improve the often poor standards of freight services.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals are in line with the objectives set in the 2001 White Paper on transport policy. At that time, we had clearly stated that there was a need to modernise the way in which rail services were organised so as to stop them becoming any more unpopular and declining further, and to generate momentum for quality rail transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislative texts that we are examining today are also justified by the fact that transport services play a key role in the economic growth of our continent. The strategy launched in Lisbon recognised their significance in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn, Mr President, to the measures that we are recommending in more detail: firstly, a proposal for a directive on the certification of train crews operating locomotives and trains. Mr Savary is the rapporteur. With your permission, I would recall simply that the Commission undertook to table this text during the negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council on the second railway package. Drafted in consultation with the sector and the social partners, this new text provides for a mechanism enabling competences and responsibilities to be better defined with regard to the training, assessment and recognition of the qualifications of train drivers and train crews with responsibility for safety. A driver will have to hold an individual licence attesting to his general abilities, which will be valid throughout the Community. This licence will have to be supplemented by a certificate issued by the railway undertaking employing him. This undertaking will give details of the training that he has received relating specifically to the line travelled, the rolling stock used and the operational and safety procedures followed. That is the first proposal for a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The second proposal seeks to amend the current directive on opening up the market in rail transport. Mr Jarzembowski is the rapporteur. I would remind you that it concerns opening up the market in international passenger services to competition. This proposal is a direct response to a request made by Parliament to the Commission at the conciliation on the second railway package, when it expressed a desire to be consulted on specific proposals on opening up the market in passenger rail transport services.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, the Commission is proposing that, from 1 January 2010, those railway undertakings possessing a licence and the necessary safety certificate may operate international services throughout the Community. Facilitating new commercial initiatives will help to breathe new life into this sector. In order to create realistic economic conditions for the development of these services, the Commission believes that cabotage should also be permitted. The proposal therefore provides for the possibility of passengers being picked up and set down all along an international route, including between two stations in the same Member State, while at the same time safeguarding the balance of public-service contracts. I am particularly anxious that it should dovetail properly with the revised proposal for a regulation on public transport services that the Commission adopted in June 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the third part of the package: the proposal on passengers’ rights and obligations, which supplements the proposal to open up the market in passenger transport services. Before going into the details of this proposal, I would recall that hitherto the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> on passenger protection has been limited to air transport. When it set out its objectives in the White Paper, the Commission wanted to put the user at the heart of all modes of transport. It therefore considered it necessary to extend the rights of rail passengers as a way of counterbalancing its policy of market opening.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection of rail passengers is a not insignificant instrument in our bid to relaunch and revitalise the rail sector. The report concerned is by Mr Sterckx. I will confine myself to mentioning a number of the proposal’s key points, starting with free and non-discriminatory assistance to passengers with reduced mobility, which will guarantee that trains are accessible. Passengers with reduced mobility have said that they would like transport services to be more easily accessible, so that they could use them without assistance. In cases when services are not sufficiently accessible, the railway undertaking and the station manager will be obliged to provide appropriate assistance if requested to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The second component of our third proposal is the possibility for international passengers to obtain information about the main destinations in Europe and to buy direct tickets. Thus, passengers can request one direct ticket when they have to cross the borders of several Member States. In particular, the Commission is asking for it to be made possible to purchase integrated tickets for destinations outside the network of the railway undertaking issuing the ticket. It should, for example, be possible to purchase a ticket to travel from Lyon, in France, to Graz, in Austria. In a letter recently sent to the Commission, a passenger complains of a local operator refusing to issue him with a ticket of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">The third component of the proposal is a modern system of civil liability, comparable to that in other transport sectors and based on a system of compulsory insurance. The Commission believes that civil liability in the case of accidents should cover as many accidents as possible and that it should be accompanied by obligatory insurance, the only way to guarantee that proper compensation will be provided for all of the damages suffered by the passenger.</p>
<p class="contents">The final component is immediate assistance in the case of delays, including a compensation and indemnification system. Passengers holding tickets that are sometimes very expensive should not have to suffer prolonged delays or service cancellations without any information from the service provider or any support from the railway undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">A final objective of the third railway package is to regulate freight services and to improve the quality of freight transport. Mr Zīle is the rapporteur for this fourth proposal. It seeks to have minimal clauses inserted into contracts between railway companies and their customers, something which is already deemed to be good practice in the sector. The precise content of the undertakings on quality is left to the contracting parties to determine. The proposed text seeks to have quality considerations taken into account systematically, as improving the quality of rail freight transport is essential if the sector is to maintain the momentum that it seems to be gathering.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to address a key issue about the reading of the third railway package. As for previous legislative proposals in the railway sector, the notion of ‘package’ is very important for the Commission. It would be regrettable to endanger the success of the third package by unravelling it and separating its component parts. I would therefore like to stress our support for the position of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which is recommending preserving the logic of the package. The Commission can also endorse the proposal made by your Transport Committee to coordinate the reading of the railway package with that of the new proposal for a regulation on public-service obligations. It is obviously desirable to ensure that the two proposals are mutually complementary, which pleads in favour of such a coordinated reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank your rapporteurs, who have examined our proposals so thoroughly. It goes without saying that I will be listening very carefully to what they, and all of the speakers, have to say during the course of this debate. I am convinced that this third railway package will enable us to achieve a genuinely better balanced use of the various modes of transport in Europe. We all know – and the explosion in oil prices is a reminder if we needed one – that we need to be able to identify alternatives, in particular for long-distance traffic: alternatives such as transport by rail, river and sea. The fact remains that rail transport needs to achieve its full potential in a Europe where it has the capacity, because it is changing, to become an extremely valuable trading and transport tool for all of the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I attach a great deal of importance to this debate, Mr President, and I should like to thank Parliament in advance for its active participation, which I value so highly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Georg Jarzembowski (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, fellow sufferers, it is once again our good fortune to be taking part in such an important debate at 9 p.m., alone in our cosy circle of rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not let this annoy us too much, however, but rather address ourselves to the issue. I believe that the Vice-President has allies among us in favour of the package remaining a package, apart from a lone French voice. We do know, of course, that French voices are sometimes particularly important.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I believe that the majority wishes to, and will, keep the package intact. That is what we shall do tomorrow, and not just as an end in itself. Even I, as a lawyer, shall not put forward the argument that, almost 13 years after completion of the internal market, we really should set about completing the internal market in passenger transport. This argument is a good one for lawyers, but we shall refrain from making it.</p>
<p class="contents">The intention with the third package is to make long-distance and regional transport more reliable and customer-friendly. That is our goal. We want there to be competition, we want better services for the benefit of passengers. Those are our objectives. That is why the issues of opening up national railway networks on a non-discriminatory basis for use by all railway undertakings, uniform passengers’ rights throughout the EU and the use of the same train drivers belong together. We do not want a situation in which, despite now having locomotives that can cross borders, the train still has to stop at the border to change drivers – only to find that the new driver is on holiday or off sick, and the train remains at a standstill.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is not only for people to be able to buy a ticket to anywhere in Europe, but also for them to arrive there quickly. This is why we need the third railway package. Admittedly there were discussions in my group at first, but then we, too, fell in with the line of thought of dispensing with regulations on quality requirements or freight traffic. Since we are opening up the networks for cross-border transport as of 1 January 2006 and for domestic freight traffic as of 1 January 2007, we hope that competition will have indeed developed in two or three years’ time, and that we shall not then need legislation on quality requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Competition can already be seen in traffic in the Alpine region, and customers have the choice between the services of two different alliances of railway undertakings. This is why I do not believe that we need any legislation on quality requirements; the market will regulate this.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to introduce several aspects of my report. I do not believe that it is always necessary to break new ground; instead, when it comes to the development of railway undertakings, we should go back to what Parliament decided at second reading of the second railway package.</p>
<p class="contents">At that time, we decided, by an overwhelming majority, to open up the networks not only for cross-border, but also for domestic rail transport as of 1 January 2008. That was what we called for two years ago; why should we now turn back, I ask myself. To give all the parties involved more time, however, the Committee is proposing that the opening-up be staggered: 1 January 2008 for cross-border rail transport, but 1 January 2012 for domestic rail transport. We all know that, when it comes to negotiations with the Council, 2012 can become 2013 or something else entirely.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, Parliament called for all rail networks to be opened up as of 2008 two years ago, it must stay on this course. I hope that the Vice-President comes round to Parliament’s way of thinking and decides to regulate not only cross-border transport, but also transport throughout the internal market. After all, we have to make headway sooner or later. To be frank, I do not wish to see a fourth, fifth or sixth railway package. We should draw a line under it and decide on liberalisation, the opening-up of the networks, customer orientation and competition with this package.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit me to draw the House’s attention to just two more things. We already have a brake for the opening-up of the networks, and in particular for opening them up for domestic rail transport. The reason is that we share the Commission’s view that it should not be compulsory to open up the networks if this would create difficulties for a regional passenger service, by which we mean not just possible difficulties, but an actual threat to its economic viability. Naturally, it is not our intention for this opening-up of networks to endanger regional transport.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to my Dutch fellow-Members that there is no need to worry. I do believe that the brake, which you yourselves proposed for cross-border transport, but which is even more important for domestic transport, will enable us to prevent the collapse of domestic regional transport, because there is no obligation to open up the networks in this case. Our fellow-Members from smaller countries can put aside their reservations in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to go into detail on our desire to amend Directive 2001/14/EC in order to give high-speed railway lines a better chance of planning for the longer term. By way of conclusion, there is something else to which I should just like to draw your attention. Parliament – with the exception of individual Members right at the back – has always said that the package should remain intact, as the Commission proposed it. That is why we also put back the date for the introduction of this package in plenary. Once we have made our decision, the Council is free to take its own.</p>
<p class="contents">The least positive experience has been with the Meijer report. Our first reading of this – following a Commission proposal on public transport in 2000 – was in November 2001. The Council has done nothing to date except to deliberately shelve this proposal. The Council is falling short in the performance of its duties; it lacks the courage to address this difficult issue. We have said, however, that these four parts belong together, and they also belong with the proposal on public transport. We have said that we are prepared to bring this issue to a definitive conclusion with a legislative resolution in plenary, as soon as the Council gives us a signal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism informed us this afternoon that the British Transport Secretary, Mr Darling, has assured us that this package will be kept intact. For this reason, we, too, should take the leap tomorrow and not just vote on the amendments, but also on the legislative resolutions, so that tomorrow afternoon we are able to state our position on the third railway package, to state our opinion. I would appeal to the Council to keep its word, to leave the package intact, to make sound proposals, then we shall be able to make good progress. I hope that, at the Council meeting on 6 October, the British Presidency will actively represent the signal that we are going to give tomorrow, and speed up the work.</p>
<p class="contents">Amid all the details, let us not forget that we are doing this not for the sake of liberalisation, or because we are self-opinionated; we are doing it in the interests of passengers, because we can see the increasing trend towards passengers taking their cars or using low-cost airlines for long-distance journeys rather than taking the train. In line with our general thinking regarding freight, however – that it must be taken off the roads and put onto the rails – our line of thinking must be to make passengers an offer that tempts them out of cars and aeroplanes and back onto trains. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gilles Savary (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to thank the chairman of our committee, Paolo Costa, and all of our colleagues, be they rapporteurs – one of whom has just spoken – shadow rapporteurs or coordinators, for the very intensive and quite remarkable work that they have done on behalf of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened carefully to Mr Jarzembowski, who mentioned a Frenchman who was, he said, hostile to the package. I do not know whom he meant. No doubt he knows this man. In any case I do not. That is why I have argued strongly that we should vote on all of the texts today and forward them to the Council. Parliament has done its work and the package is ready. We will forward it to the UK Presidency tomorrow and I hope moreover that the UK Presidency will make a decision, so that if possible – although we should perhaps not be too idealistic – this complicated dossier can be completed under Mr Blair’s Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The package is moving forward: I simply wanted us to put it to the vote today and not defer the work that has been done by the European Parliament. There is no reason to do so, because there is at least one text that is rather urgent and that is the text on the licence for train drivers. This is not because it was the subject of fairly broad agreement in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, but quite simply because liberalisation is underway. The international rail freight market has been open since 15 March 2003 and we need this text today to ensure that drivers operating international rail transport services are properly trained.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add in respect of my own report that it is quite exemplary and I hope that the message that we in Parliament send out tomorrow will be equally so.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it exemplary? Firstly, because it sends out a social signal, when until now we have essentially sent out economic or liberalisation signals. I have always argued here that rail transport should be a matter for everyone, including railway workers, and I do not think that this initiative will be successful if those who work on the railways feel that the European rail system is no concern of theirs. We have set up a Railway Agency, in which we are going to involve the social partners; we need to ensure that the social partners feel that they have a stake in the investment that we are all making in the future of rail transport.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we need to take this text, which has been agreed by both sides of industry, by the employers and the unions – which is very rare at European level – and today enshrine it in legislation. It is an exercise – a fairly straightforward one at the end of the day, because the work has been done – that consists of transposing a historic, social agreement into substantive European law, an agreement that calls for others, perhaps one day collective agreements enabling railway workers to feel that they all have a stake in opening up rail networks.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I will take the liberty of asking for as broad an agreement as possible on my report tomorrow, a report to which the committee has made many improvements, which may appear trivial, but which are actually important. Firstly, we have extended it. We think that in the long term all workers on all of the networks should, if they so wish, have an international driver’s licence. Every national driver has a right to become an international driver if he so wishes.</p>
<p class="contents">We also wanted to clarify the text. We have clearly stated the definitions of drivers and train crews, in the case of the latter referring to a forthcoming proposal from the Commission, to be based on work done by the Agency, which will be carried out openly and in consultation with stakeholders. We have also made the text more precise in terms of training, in terms of the benefits that each worker gains from his experience and in terms of how the training is financed, given that some drivers that have been trained by one railway undertaking may subsequently move to another. Finally, we have made the dates more consistent and have brought forward the date of transposition. That is the basic substance of the report that our committee is proposing to you.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to make a few final comments on the other texts. I think that Mr Sterckx’s report on passenger rights is absolutely essential. There is no reason to establish passenger rights in air transport and not in rail transport. Moreover, given that there are significant disparities between the Member States and also problems with the system, in particular in my own country, I am pleased that Mr Sterckx is tabling a report along these lines and I hope that the opposition in the Council will be overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to Mr Zīle’s report, without wishing to offend the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job, I am of course more cautious, quite simply because the railway undertakings value the contractual relationship and goods are a great deal more heterogeneous than passengers. Transporting one kind of merchandise can be very different from transporting another.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I turn to Mr Jarzembowski’s report, and here I am personally more cautious. I voted in favour of liberalising the freight market because freight was not working. When it comes to passenger transport, it seems to me that this is all about a few large companies coveting the national networks. It is cabotage that troubles me more than anything else. We all know full well that in reality there is no market for services from Paris to Rome. However, there is a market between Paris and Lyon and between Lyon and Marseilles, and that is what the large companies are eyeing up. I am concerned about the small countries, countries of limited size, whose national lines are actually on international lines that might disappear tomorrow or be absorbed by large operators like SNCF or Deutsche Bahn. Moreover, that is precisely why these large companies are so interested.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, in conclusion, to say that, as I see it, if we think in terms of transport markets – and no one has denied this for the last ten years – it is road that wins. We have to think in terms of transport policy and the essential factor is not simply competition within the rail sector, which is the objective that we have been pursuing obsessively for years, but providing the conditions to enable there to be competition between road and the other modes of transport. Until we have settled this point rail will decline, as it is declining today for open freight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dirk Sterckx (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I think that I too have been given an extra minute and a half by a fellow Member who cannot be here this evening, so I think that my speaking time has been extended to six and a half minutes, which I intend to use now if you would deduct these past ten seconds from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I should like to thank the Commission for its proposal, for I regard all those railway packages, like the passengers’ rights proposal, as being an important element of the EU’s transport policy. If we want to establish an open European railway market, it is vital that the passengers should have minimum rights within that market if people are to gain, or retain, confidence in rail.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to tell you, though, Commissioner, that Parliament, or at least the Committee on Transport and Tourism, has made some amendments to your proposal. While I am on the subject, I would like to thank all Members who have taken part in the debate, either as individuals or as groups, for all the amendments they have tabled –of which there were quite a few, with perhaps more to come as well – but it is thanks to those efforts, Commissioner, that we are now presenting a proposal that, to my mind, is even-handed and well-structured.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a link between the area of application and the level of requirements. The Commission has opted for a small area of application, namely international rail traffic, and a strict package of requirements, while Parliament has slightly altered this balance, in that it opted for a large area of application, that is to say rights for all rail passengers, as is the case in aviation in fact, and has adapted the strict basic requirements to allow more room for manoeuvre for railway undertakings, regional authorities or local authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first like to say a few words about the requirements package. We remained faithful to the international agreements of the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF) as much as we could and made, with regard to information to travellers, some changes to the Commission proposal accordingly. I take the view that it is not necessary to provide all information to all travellers both prior to, and during, the journey. That would, in fact, lead to an unworkable level of red tape, involving, for example, A4-size tickets. There is no point in doing this, I do not think. I think that railway undertakings need to be encouraged to give the necessary information to the right passengers. I do not think it is right to force companies to provide information about the competition or other companies if that is against their wishes. If they can be prompted to join forces, so much the better, but I think that a company that wants to win over a customer cannot be forced to include possible competitors in its information policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to tickets, except that in this case, a distinction needs to be drawn – and we make this quite clear – between a public service, where tickets have to be made available to a wide public, and commercial, specialist services, where, to my mind, far fewer resources can be used, such as the Internet only, which has happened in some cases, and which could bring the cost down. I also think that you cannot force competing companies to sell each other’s tickets. That is not done in aviation, so why should it be done in rail traffic? I do think, though – and we have tabled amendments to that effect – that we must give railway undertakings that wish to join forces every encouragement we can, and we must ensure that, for example, they set up a joint reservation system, such as is already in place for a number of airline companies.</p>
<p class="contents">In the event of accidents, death or injury of passengers, we believe that with regard to no-fault liability, in other words, in those cases where the railway undertaking are required to pay in any event, the same amounts must be used as those in the aviation regulation. As for luggage, we have adopted COTIF, because it contains a broader definition of luggage and also lists other amounts, but we felt that this was the best way of addressing this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to the subject of compensation for delays and cancellations, in respect of which we proposed a simpler system. The Commission has made things rather complicated, but if we are to extend the scope to include all passengers, we think we should have a simpler system for compensation, and at the same time a system not only for compensation pertaining to delays that exceed one hour, but also for people who face delays on a regular basis, so that they too could obtain compensation. People with season tickets would otherwise not qualify, and we do not regard that as acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">One difficult chapter that attracted amendments by a very large number of Members was the chapter on people with reduced mobility. For people with impaired vision, hearing or a disability, we think that railway undertakings have a duty to pull out all the stops and observe a number of obligations. We have defined those in considerable detail, and we have more or less followed the Commission’s lead in this. In the event of prior warning, a commitment has been entered into and the railway undertaking has no choice but to help the passenger. If the passenger has not given prior warning and turns up without notice, then I think that the railway undertaking must do everything in its power to help those people. In fact, I think that most railway undertakings, most railway staff, see it as a matter of honour to help those people out. This is a case of us laying something down in law which is, in my view, a minimum requirement. I think that whilst we should encourage the railway undertakings to do everything they can for the people who have more difficulty in finding their way round in a railway station, and whilst we should expect much of them, we cannot expect everything. You cannot ask railway undertakings to do the impossible; what you can do is urge them, whenever there is a renovation, a structural alteration, or a new purchase, to ensure that the new materials and the new buildings satisfy today’s needs.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an enormous legacy from the past, shall I say, resting on the shoulders of the railway undertakings, but they must slowly but surely be encouraged to make improvements. A complaints service must be set up, but we should not go overboard with regard to the <span class="italic">lingua franca</span> used. I have simplified the proposal in terms of consequential damage, which I deleted. I believe that annual quality reports are unnecessary. We must achieve a more flexible system that allows room for initiative, for a broader application, for commercial initiatives of railway undertakings that are prepared to submit those, and for regional initiatives. Undertakings can therefore go beyond what we require, but – and that is, to my mind, essential in our position as Parliament – we think that those rights should apply to all passengers; not just to the elite of 5% that travels internationally, but to anyone using the train. That is the case in aviation, and there is no reason why that could not be the case in train travel. We are about to discuss this with the Council, but as far as I know, if my sources are reliable, this very issue, namely making the rights apply to all passengers, is a sticking point in the Council. I would like to say to the representative of the Council that this is one of the points that I as rapporteur will fight tooth and nail and I hope that I can count on the combined support of my fellow Members of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, I would like to say to the Council, as did the two previous speakers, that this is a package. I urge you not to take it apart. I invite you to treat it as you wish, but return it as a package and accompany it with common positions that we will be able to hammer out together at second reading. This is a cohesive whole; I would press you to keep it that way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Roberts Zīle (UEN), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(LV) </span>Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, in submitting to Parliament a draft regulation on compensation in cases of non-compliance with contractual quality requirements for rail services, the aim of the European Commission was to improve the quality of rail freight transport in the European Union’s internal market and thus to promote a shift of freight transport from road to rail. The intention was to increase, by this means, the proportion of freight transported by rail, which is currently very low.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, the draft regulation contains administrative measures and rules which are to be worked into contracts between rail companies and their customers. I should say right away that in competitive situations such a measure would not be conceivable, hence to a great extent the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on whether to support this regulation was based on either optimism or scepticism concerning increased competition in rail freight transport in the near future. In addition, as a representative of a new Member State, I was unpleasantly surprised by the fact that the draft regulation submitted in the spring of 2004 was based on research relating only to the 15 older Member States, and that a whole series of special features of the new Member States was not taken into account in the draft; these can be mentioned only by way of example. For instance, in the Baltic States over 50% of freight transport is by rail, as compared with almost 90% by road in other states. Secondly, in the three Baltic States almost all transportation of rail freight crosses European Union external borders connecting the sea ports of the Baltic States with the markets of Russia, Belarus and other CIS states. This, in turn, would mean that if this regulation were to be adopted, Latvia’s railways would constantly be paying compensation for delays occurring on Russian territory without any practical hope of obtaining any compensation from Russian railways.</p>
<p class="contents">Leaving aside the above, as rapporteur I hoped to balance the draft text and to find a compromise between extremely diverse interest groups. At least to date, however, there has been no basis for such a compromise, and even after many debates at the Commission the majority of my colleagues on the committee believed that an administrative regulation was not the way to improve the quality of rail transport. I myself have come to various conclusions over this period of time, having become acquainted with the larger rail companies and also with infrastructure managers. I am concerned by the fact that if we do not adopt any measures in the sphere of freight transport shortly, then access to infrastructure will of course become even more of a priority for passengers, which in itself is not a bad thing, but the quality of freight transport will probably fall even further. For me, the most important conclusion from this study was that, clearly, we cannot draw up regulations on the basis of the problems of individual transport corridors without studying the particular features of European Union Member States, and using administrative methods only in places where competition is weak. Such a ‘one size fits all’ approach would clearly create a lack of trust among European Union citizens concerning the legislative plans of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that I am very satisfied with the joint work by all the rapporteurs on this package, as well as by the shadow rapporteurs, and I do not understand the attempts to break up this third rail package, which might give practically nothing to customers. I will mention again an example from the Baltic States. If, for example, the idea contained in the report by Mr Sterckx, that passengers should also be given rights in respect of domestic transport, is removed and replaced with international transport only, then I can say that in the countries in my region — in the Baltic States — the entire third package will have no effect at all. The effect of all the three or four legislative acts will be of zero value. I do not want to set out these details, but unfortunately this is the case. I have made a detailed analysis of the possible effect on the Baltic States. Taking into account everything that has been said already, I call on my fellow Members to reject my report, as the Committee on Transport and Tourism has done, and at the same time I call on my fellow Members to support the package approach for the other three pieces of legislation and to support them in the wording approved by the Committee on Transport and Tourism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This could be accomplished by means of the standardisation of competence mentioned in our proposal. We would thus achieve better interoperability of train crews in addition to improved rail-transport safety. This model would only be a real success, however, if, in the final reckoning, it were to mean less tape.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very much obliged to the rapporteur, Mr Savary, for his constructive cooperation and also the compromises that have been reached. Firstly, we have managed to achieve a consensus in Committee even on critical points such as the extension that had been called for in the scope of the directive from train drivers to other train crew. We have agreed on a two-stage process, whereby the Railway Agency shall decide on the necessity of certification for other on-board staff at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have managed to reduce the original subdivision into three categories of driving licence to two, which will lead to administrative simplification and streamlining.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as regards regular monitoring of train drivers, we should like this to apply to only those aspects that concern the driving ability of the train driver.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we wish the date on which the directive is introduced to coincide with the opening-up of the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, on the issue of whether certification should relate only to train drivers on cross-border services or also include those on domestic services, we propose a gradual process of certification of all train drivers.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, these are pragmatic, unbureaucratic solutions that will have a simplifying and streamlining effect. This has been, and continues to be, the aim of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in this House. For this reason, and also because of the compromises that have been reached, the PPE-DE Group rejects Amendments 46 and 50.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I should like to say a few words about the report on passengers’ rights: more particularly Amendment 138. This aims to put in place an entitlement under EU law to transport bicycles on all trains, and such an obsession with regulation, down to the last detail, is a further example of why much of the public is sceptical towards Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, let us give out the right signals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee has borne this in mind, and it is likely, therefore, that we shall join together in plenary tomorrow to adopt, by a large majority, all the reports relating to the rail sector. I am obliged to all the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, therefore, for their work, which evidently did produce a consensus in the end.</p>
<p class="contents">No sooner had I had a discussion in my group than the railway package reappeared, in very abridged form, as the Jarzembowski report. I had to take issue with that, because there is of course a bit more to this railway package. In my opinion, the Savary report is very important. We need to have well-trained train drivers for cross-border transport in Europe, so that freight is transported well and safely by train drivers with well-qualified staff on board, who should also have proper social security cover. For this reason, I believe that the Savary report regarding freight transport is an important step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Sterckx report is also important, in that passengers’ rights, too, are being properly regulated in Europe at last, and in that the customers – the passengers – are to be entitled to reasonable compensation, as is the case with other modes of transport, in the event of delays for which the operator is to blame.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Zīle report, I must say that the Commission sometimes goes too far. As Mr Zīle has pointed out, he has done a very good job; yet the majority of the Committee – myself included – had reservations. On the subject of the quality requirements for freight transport, I must say that we have to start depending on the market before the market is capable of regulating anything.</p>
<p class="contents">What is critical, in my view, is that we boost the rail sector. It was one of the Commissioner’s predecessors, Commissioner Kinnock, who coined the slogan about the revitalisation of Europe’s railways. Mr Kinnock (‘Old’ Labour rather than ‘New Labour’) was right with his ‘roadmap’, because our problem is that the volume of both freight and passenger transport by rail has been decreasing progressively since the 1970s.</p>
<p class="contents">As the energy situation is now extremely critical, and we know that the transport sector is the greatest energy consumer of all, we have to take the opportunity to encourage a shift away from the roads and, increasingly, from flying – we keep coming back to the kerosene tax – in favour of the railways. Therefore, the railways must have a cross-border structure for both freight and passenger transport. This must not fall at the hurdle of former public officials with – sometimes sacrosanct – government property; instead, the way must be cleared for a rational new policy.</p>
<p class="contents">This is our first reading. We all know that, sooner or later, a common position will be forthcoming, and there will be a second reading. We shall all meet again then. That being the case, we do not need to get so worked up. I do think, however, that we shall, together, be adopting a sensible measure tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paolo Costa, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my view the third railway package – which I hope is the last – represents something of a final opportunity for European railways; the last chance to reverse a negative trend which is seeing rail as a mode of transport losing market share at a rate which, if it were to continue, would virtually wipe it out in the space of a few years.</p>
<p class="contents">Time is not on the side of the railways, although European policy continues to claim that shifting the transport balance in favour of rail is strategic, because of the negative impact of increasing road traffic in terms of fatal accidents, damage to public health and the environment and the increasing cost of congestion; and yet this trend is occurring despite the fact that priority projects to develop the trans-European network are primarily focused on investment in the railways.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have one last chance to take radical and urgent measures which will allow the objectives of the European treaties to be met – objectives which go back to Rome and 1956 – in which Europe, the Union, set itself the goal of achieving integration of national transport networks at European level, making them interoperable technically and economically and liberalising access to them; an objective devised as a physical prerequisite for the development of Europe, either as a market or a political entity.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we have this last chance, which requires great vision on the part of this Parliament and its co-legislator the European Council, because it requires the European institutions, the political institutions, to take responsibility for something which the national rail undertakings lack the courage, skill or ability to do, namely to stop defending shrinking monopolistic market segments, which are increasingly unable to generate traffic revenue to cover their costs, and instead seek to expand the total market, with potential benefits for all.</p>
<p class="contents">This can only be achieved if conditions are created for competition among railways, which would also give them the ability to compete with other modes of transport and enable market share to be recaptured, leading in turn to further competition among railway companies within a virtuous circle. To achieve this we need to accelerate both technical interoperability, the lack of which today creates an artificial barrier separating the individual domestic rail markets, and economic interoperability, by liberalising access to the networks.</p>
<p class="contents">The third package is a vital component of that strategy. The way ahead in terms of technical interoperability is clear, but we must acknowledge the contribution of the third package in its proposal for a directive on the certification of train crews, contained in the Savary report; only by training the staff can we make the system interoperable, even before it becomes technically interoperable.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the third package requires Parliament and the Council to assume their respective responsibilities in terms of the ‘if’ and ‘how’ of liberalisation. The issue of market liberalisation has been left to the proposed directive on the development of the Community's railways, which it is planned to apply to passenger transport from 2008 on international routes and from 2012 on domestic ones. This is the crucial point for Parliament to add value to the proposal: these facts and deadlines, particularly the second of 2012, do not match the urgency of the situation, even if the compromise may be a reasonable one, taking account of the concerns of national railway companies less able to face up to market challenges in what will, in any event, continue to be their natural monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">These concerns should not be accorded such importance that the type of authorisation is overlooked, with the possibility of awarding domestic public rail transport contracts and services directly and without a competitive process, which is what the revised version of the proposed regulation on public service transport obligations implies. Parliament views that proposal favourably, as it offers the possibility to move ahead on the Meijer report, which has been awaiting the Council’s common position for years.</p>
<p class="contents">If Parliament today, and the Council tomorrow, reject on other fronts those proposed regulations on the rights and obligations of passengers, a similar compromise may eliminate the artificial distinction between international passengers and domestic passengers. Will the latter, perhaps, continue to be treated as second class citizens, with fewer rights than international passengers? There is no justification for this distinction, except to continue protecting markets, while passengers are not receiving due protection – to the short-term benefit of the national companies.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one final point: the Commission has insisted on the need to keep the measures of the third railway package unified. On this point, adequate assurances have been sought and obtained by the UK Presidency, which will work to ensure that the Council completes its examination of the Sterckx report and continues to work on the Jarzembowski and Meyer reports.</p>
<p class="contents">However, apart from the formal aspect, the unity of the package has a deeper logic: liberalisation, as we can infer from various earlier experiments, requires various checks and balances, one of which is undoubtedly consumer protection. If consumers are protected, liberalisation can be effective and efficient; if it does not work, or if there is any risk of it becoming dangerous, consumers will not be protected. In my view, the Zīle report should have been considered in these terms, but the decisions have already been taken, and I will abide by them.</p>
<p class="contents">In the belief that there is a functional reason to keep the package together, I hope that, on the basis of these considerations, we can achieve the result we are all seeking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Until now, unrestricted travel through Europe, from Lisbon to Tallinn, from London to Athens, has been possible only by road or air. The rail network, on the other hand, resembles a patchwork quilt with 25 patches, and so the railways are being left behind.</p>
<p class="contents">The national networks should be opened up. At the same time, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wants to be sure that social and environmental interests are also safeguarded. In addition, we must learn from the mistakes in the United Kingdom and Estonia, for example. Europe cannot be content with the situation on the railways, and the customers certainly cannot. Excessively high prices, frequent delays and poor service tend to be the norm. Moreover, schedules are not passenger-friendly. I shall give three examples. In Germany, the rail operator Deutsche Bahn AG is planning to stop mainline trains from calling at Berlin Zoo station. Passengers are up in arms, with the unanimous support of Parliament and politicians in general. Yet Deutsche Bahn AG is not yielding: politicians have had to capitulate.</p>
<p class="contents">In Italy, there are plans to upgrade the railway line between Milan and Verona for high-speed trains but this will involve bypassing Brescia, the second-largest city in Lombardy, whose 200 000 residents will now see their journeys extended by 30 minutes. Here, too, politicians seem to be powerless.</p>
<p class="contents">Then the national parliaments, and Parliament in its report on tourism, have decided that passengers should be permitted to take their bicycles on board high-speed trains. It is possible to do this on French TGV trains, but not on the German ICE. Yet Deutsche Bahn AG will not budge; politicians are helpless. That is why the Verts/ALE Group, too, wants the parliaments and the elected politicians to regain their influence over railway policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European driving licence for train drivers will render driver changes at the border between Member States unnecessary. Passengers’ rights are to be strengthened in the passenger-rail services of all EU Member States, with the possibility of legally enforceable claims for compensation in the event of delays. It should be possible to take bicycles on board all trains, and comprehensive information and the option of buying tickets to anywhere in Europe should be the norm. Access is to be guaranteed for the mobility-impaired. No compensation mechanism is necessary for freight transport.</p>
<p class="contents">National railway networks should be opened up gradually in the case of passenger transport, too. We shall be making our consent to this conditional upon the following, however: there must be no social dumping, and consideration must be given to the interests of the environment, as Parliament demanded in the Meijer report. In this connection, we welcome the fact that, several years on, the Commission has finally drawn up the new proposal for public services and sent it to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">There must be no destructive competition. For this reason, invitations to tender can be dispensed with if the existence of domestic railway undertakings is threatened. We need a report on competition experience to date: we want to emulate the good and learn from the mistakes. The experiences in Britain and Estonia have shown that the infrastructure must remain fully in the public sector. We see this as an essential requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we, too, are in favour of the package remaining a package, and we hope that the Council also comes to the sensible decision and treats it as one. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For my part, I will confine my contribution to explaining the thinking behind our amendment rejecting the proposal for a directive inappropriately entitled, ‘the development of the Community’s railways’.</p>
<p class="contents">We wholeheartedly believe that it is high time to overhaul the organisation of the transport sector on our continent. This should be done in accordance with the criteria that our fellow citizens value: safety, the environment, social and territorial cohesion, the public service, and their corollary, high standards of harmonised social regulation for the workers concerned. The sector’s unions have some very carefully worked out proposals on all of these aspects. They should be our natural partners when planning and implementing this kind of project. In this context, the aspiration to achieve a more balanced use of rail – and, moreover, inland waterways – is in every respect legitimate and Europe is of course a relevant arena in which to address these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is as follows: what is there to say that achieving such objectives should at all costs require all-out liberalisation of the rail transport sector? This would at the very least merit a serious evaluation of the various different experiences with this model so far and the initial impact of opening up to competition before any new measures are taken. That is moreover what Parliament explicitly demanded when the first railway package was adopted. This express request has never been met. Why not?</p>
<p class="contents">For example, not a word has been said about the disastrous consequences of rail privatisation in the United Kingdom. You pass very swiftly, Mr Barrot, over the fact that the first private train in France, owned by Connex, is not carrying any additional traffic, but is happy to occupy a place held until now by the public company SNCF. Neither is any mention made of the decline in the diversity of services offered in the freight transport sector, or of the fact that passenger routes that are deemed to be unprofitable have been abandoned with a view to the opening up to competition. What is more, there is barely a murmur about projects which have a real chance of improving European transport, such as the Lyon-Turin link, being blocked. No! We liberalise and that is all there is to it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is this dogmatism of ‘markets everywhere’ that our group is protesting against. We do so in a bid to reiterate the demand for a public and pluralist assessment of the experiences so far and to express our preferred choice of cooperation and not competition in the rail transport sector in Europe. Our group calls on all of our Members to vote in favour of Amendment 14, which rejects the proposal for a directive on the liberalisation of rail transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patrick Louis, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the IND/DEM Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, rail issues are by their very nature of interest to all of those living in the European Union and all of its Member States. For a long time, geography determined the transport services on offer and nations’ policies. Today, technology and the construction of major infrastructures are enriching the sector and in their turn determining the future of economic and cultural exchanges. We have a role to play in this sector: building bridges between nations and promoting exchange. But not just any old exchange! We need an exchange that enriches national specificities, because the exchange has to be of a complementary nature to be justified and worthwhile. We are delighted to have texts promoting such genuinely free exchanges between sovereign peoples. Nevertheless, reading the three reports that have been tabled today, it seems to us that three simple principles, governing how nations are ordered, have been disregarded.</p>
<p class="contents">The first principle that does not seem to us to have been respected in every case is that of subsidiarity. In the transport sector, as elsewhere, we think that everything that can be done at the level closest to the action should be done at that level, and only what is absolutely necessary will be left to the higher level. We therefore do not understand why the Sterckx report, which rightly cites the international convention COTIF, hastens to encumber the text with a surfeit of details that ought to be dealt with under this convention, a convention which we ought by the way to be relaunching. In this particular case, extending the rights of those with reduced mobility is the exception, as it is vital to do so. But this imperative could be the subject of a simple injunction of principle to COTIF. Furthermore, why, by the same token, in Mr Savary’s excellent report on staff training, is a clearer distinction not drawn between the training of drivers on the one hand and that of train crews on the other? Why not simply certify different competences, since the professions are radically different?</p>
<p class="contents">The second principle that we feel has been abused is the respect for sovereignty. We cannot allow the fact that transport services need to be organised at international level to become a Trojan Horse to invade national law. The amended Sterckx report systematically substitutes the expression ‘all rail passengers’ for the notion of ‘international rail passengers’. We cannot agree to national law being made subordinate to international law in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">The third principle that is disregarded is that of prudence. There is a lack of prudence when, in Mr Jarzembowski’s report, Amendment 8 proposes a period of only three years to implement significant changes. We have to give these things time: too hasty and you are doomed to failure. There is also a lack of prudence in the Sterckx report in that it tries to deal with everything in one single dossier: with disability, ticketing, compensation in the case of accidents and penalties in the case of substandard services. Dealing with everything means losing relevance. A lack of prudence is also displayed in the failure to state clearly that the railways should serve the needs above all of freight and in particular long-distance freight. Similarly there is a lack of prudence in the failure to first include these proposals in the report on very competitive modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we acknowledge the painstaking and commendable work done by the Commissioner, but once again we remain doubtful about such an avalanche of legal provisions and the effectiveness of this Parliament’s methods. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We view it as a duty not only for environmental protection, but also for the safety of the transport system, in the widest sense of the term, in the hope that revitalising rail transport will help to cut death rates and road accidents in general, which, we should remember, have an extremely high social cost for Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the group of non-attached Members whom I coordinate in the committee has, with that traditional discrimination typical of parliamentary rules, had very little opportunity to intervene, I agree with much of the work of my colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sterckx has issued a report which finally acknowledges consumers' right to reimbursement for rail delays – at least substantial ones. That is a right we in the Committee wished to establish also for passengers on domestic lines (as well as international ones, obviously) which, in my view, is intrinsically equitable. I should also like to emphasise the shared sensitivity that exists in relation to the provisions introduced for passengers with mobility problems. I also approve the Savary report in relation to the need for a common certification system for train crews, the necessary standardisation of their professional skills and the monitoring of their state of health. I hope that greater guarantees can also be demanded in terms of the number of drivers, which in my view should never be less than two.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank our colleague Mr Jarzembowski, whose report aims to foster an improvement of rail services through greater competition, thereby benefiting the consumer, although I have some doubts on this, because improvements will only occur if liberalisation does not result in yet another rush to cut labour costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I approve the Zīle report, which has attempted to respond to the concerns of our committee for compulsory compensation in the event of failure to meet the deadlines for freight delivery. I therefore urge Members to support the reports already approved by the Committee on Transport and Tourism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been a Member of this House for ten years now, and still do not know exactly who is really responsible for work programming with regard to our plenary sittings. Whoever they are, they are no friends of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This week and this evening’s discussion are quite typical examples that prove this point. Wherever Parliament does not really have anything to say – at least, nothing binding – this is scheduled for and discussed during prime time, whilst the few legislative acts scheduled for this twelfth plenary sitting in Strasbourg – which is otherwise completely superfluous – are tucked away in the evening sitting.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We should not be surprised, in such situations, if people in Europe are less and less inclined to take us seriously. The turnout at the recent European elections springs to mind.</p>
<p class="contents">After that digression, let me pass on to the main issue, which is the Sterckx report and passengers’ rights. This text makes a constructive contribution to creating the much-discussed level playing field for the various modes of transport in Europe. To enter into direct competition with direct competitors, the railways need comparable framework conditions, and so it was right and necessary for us to now give priority to establishing the railway counterpart of the ‘night-boarding’ legislation for air transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The text presented by the Commission on this subject was – shall we say – capable of improvement, and, sensibly, we have made a few changes to it: some of them quite fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly – probably the most fundamental of the changes – we have subsumed all transport services, not only international services, under this new regulation, although special arrangements, which we are sure to need, will have to be made within the framework of the regulation on public local passenger transport services.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have attached particular importance to providing and demanding proper information on passengers’ rights. What is the use to consumers if they do not know to which rights they are actually entitled?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this text provides for a rational coordination and – only on certain points, of course – supplementation of the CODIF regulations: unlike one previous speaker, I consider this not only very important, but also a resounding success. This has been a specific instance of subsidiarity in practice and, in this sense, has also been a kind of complementary action to the Commission’s ‘better regulation’ initiative, for which we are grateful and which, in plain English, means tidying up European legislation, which is frequently verbose.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I am very much obliged to the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, for his pleasant, constructive cooperation.</p>

In our view, although there is much discussion about liberalisation, the latter is not an end in itself but a means to an end. Many questions arose concerning how to attain that end, namely increasing rail transport. It is important to bear in mind that the European Union is a Union of 25 Member States, and that the rail networks in the new Member States are relatively weak and being restructured. In addition, changes cannot be introduced too suddenly, they should be brought in progressively.</p>
<p class="contents">We warned against a situation where the more powerful railway undertakings absorbed the weaker ones. Taking over the market brings with it the duty to provide a public service. It is worth considering whether the final outcome might be that a large railway company’s monopoly in one of the Union’s Member States might not be replaced or extended to become a monopoly by that same company but covering the territory of several Member States? Are we considering any restrictions? It does not seem to us that we are doing so at present.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the road and air transport sectors are enjoying market success in Europe. In their case, however, deregulation was brought in along with liberalisation. A solution that would reconcile market roles with the provision of a public service should therefore be found for the railways also.</p>
<p class="contents">I cooperated with Mr Jarzembowski concerning the changes to Council Directive 91/440/EEC. This compromise is more radical than the Commission’s proposal, so I would like to enquire whether you feel that perhaps our compromise goes too far, Commissioner? Might it not be preferable to confine ourselves to the Commission’s proposal, so only international transport was affected? Our concern is mainly for the quality of transport services provided.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to refer to the journey between Warsaw and Brussels by way of example. If you fly with LOT or SNBrussels Airlines you pay EUR 300 and it takes two hours to get to Brussels National airport. If you fly with a low-cost airline you pay EUR 120 and arrive at Charleroi airport. A first class train ticket costs EUR 150 and the journey takes 18 hours. If you chose to travel by private car, the journey takes 13 hours if you keep to the speed limits and the fuel costs EUR 150, but four people can travel together. Is that not an important consideration? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Anne E. Jensen (ALDE). – </span></span>  <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, my main remarks are on the reports by Mr Savary and Mr Zīle, for which I was my group’s shadow rapporteur, and I wish to thank both rapporteurs, who have each been working under very different conditions, for their efforts. Mr Savary’s report concerns a proposal that almost everyone supports, while Mr Zīle had the job of getting backing for a proposal by the Commission that only very few people are interested in. My group is satisfied with the outcome of the vote in the committee, where the proposal for compensation in connection with freight transport was rejected. That is not the same as saying that we see no problems with the quality of freight transport by train. Unfortunately, there is a lot to suggest that the quality is not improving and that, in certain areas, it is perhaps even on the decline. Lack of punctuality and flexibility mean that, directly contrary to all political intentions, freight transport by train is falling behind. The question, then, is: how are we to solve this problem? The Commission’s proposal was too clumsy and out of step with the conditions in a free market. However, Mr Zīle deserves recognition for his attempt to find a solution other than a flat rejection, even if – as I assume it will be when we vote tomorrow – the result is just such a rejection.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in no doubt that, as liberalisation and free competition progressively take root, train services will become more efficient and we shall see better value for money and a greater focus on passengers. We shall see better quality than that delivered by the national monopolies, and I find it thought-provoking that the number of passenger miles travelled by train in Great Britain, which has of course done a lot of liberalising over the last ten years, has increased by as much as 40%. I also find it thought-provoking that those countries that invest single-mindedly in modern railway services using high-speed trains also see those services making progress at a time when trains are otherwise losing ground in many countries. Liberalisation is therefore important as well as investment if, regarding not only freight transport but also passenger transport, we are to guarantee railway services an increased market share. It is also important that we speed up the process.</p>
<p class="contents">The common framework for the training of train crews is, of course, a logical consequence of the liberalisation that has already been agreed. Mr Savary’s report is therefore the least controversial of those relating to the third railway package. The big debate has of course been about who is to be covered by the Directive on the certification of train crews. Shall it be train drivers only, or other staff too? Shall it be exclusively those involved in international rail services or also those involved in purely national services? My group is generally satisfied with the result we now have. A suitable balance has been found whereby train drivers and other staff directly involved in safety are included. It was a wise decision to have the rules initially cover international train services. Once we have used a cost-benefit analysis in order carefully to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages, we can then, in time, look at whether staff involved in purely national services should be included. Where drivers are concerned, this is, of course, expensive training we are faced with, so it is important that we do not impose unnecessary costs on the train companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I want, for my own part, to say how very pleased I am that Parliament’s proposed third railway package welcomes the liberalisation of passenger transport and introduces common rules for passengers’ rights which apply to all passengers and which, in addition, are much simpler and much less bureaucratic than the Commission’s proposal. Mr Savary also asks what is to be done about the small countries. I myself come from a small country in which free competition for railway services has progressively been introduced and in which the national railway company, DSB, is in competition at home and, at the same time, now operates in Sweden and has been given permission to offer routes in Great Britain. DSB has equipped itself for free competition through modernisation and through the reorganisation of its activities so that the old monopolistic and statist culture has been replaced by a modern business culture that places more focus on the passenger. That is the way forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to Mr Jarzembowski’s proposal, on the other hand, the discussions have been more closely argued and doubtful, because we are not in favour of the status quo. To make matters clear: we really want to strengthen European rail transport because we want to encourage means of transport that are safer and more economical in terms of energy and space and therefore more sustainable. That seems to me perfectly clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The question we are asking ourselves is this: will this objective be achieved through the liberalisation of international rail passenger transport under the conditions outlined in this report? That is where questions start to arise. Will we actually achieve a transfer from road and air to rail? Will we guarantee a safer and more accessible service for people and better social and territorial cohesion? To find out, surely we could conduct a serious evaluation. We have experience, within the Member States, of passenger transport being opened up to competition; we have the first and second packages. Let us take a closer look at what happens in terms of quality, of real transfer from road to rail, of prices and of safety.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, there are many questions. We wonder about the compatibility between the opening up to competition of national corridors through cabotage and respect for the obligations of public service as set out in the July regulation. We ask ourselves, as indeed do other Members, whether we are not going to move, in some countries, from a monopoly situation to an oligopoly situation or whether we are not going to see the emergence, as in air transport, of low cost companies, to the detriment of working conditions and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, for the majority of my group it is inconceivable for us to support Mr Jarzembowski’s proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The close cooperation of national railway companies with their neighbours is much older than the European Union. That results in fast, cross-border, long-distance trains with matching ticket sales. This European success is now being undermined by increasing competitive rivalry, as a result of which railway companies will seek to reject the least profitable and least subsidised tasks first.</p>
<p class="contents">While everyone thinks we are drawing Europe closer together, railway companies are confining themselves to mass transport in the large urban areas and to a few fast mainline connections within Member States. Many cross-border stretches are served only by slow trains; through night trains are being thinned out or disappearing altogether. Only in Germany are European ticket sales and the provision of information top-notch, and only the cross-border high-speed line between Brussels and Paris is busy.</p>
<p class="contents">Elsewhere, it is becoming more and more difficult to buy tickets for foreign destinations further afield. Passengers have to change trains en route more often, which also increases waiting times. Passengers on delayed trains from neighbouring countries, which mainly get into difficulty at night, are increasingly given a rough deal, and land up in an exasperating web of confusion. That is what drives those passengers to use aircraft and cars, while the Commission’s White Paper on transport took for granted that there would be more medium-distance transport of passengers by rail by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past six years, I have demonstrated on many occasions, on the basis of practical experience, how our rail transport is deteriorating. I am therefore delighted with the Commission proposal that at long last offers some counter weight to the adverse effects of liberalisation and commercialisation. It is unfortunate that Mr Sterckx, the rapporteur, has not taken the crisis in international passenger transport by rail as his point of departure, but rather the irritation of railway companies that would prefer self-regulation to a requirement imposed from the European level that they should achieve the German quality standard.</p>
<p class="contents">His proposals detract from the improvements for cross-border transport and unnecessarily increase European interference in domestic rail transport. This proposal is a missed opportunity for improving conditions for international passengers and for putting a stop to worsening trends. My group fears that the regulation as set out by Mr Sterckx does not adequately address the problems, the consequence being that it will need to be reviewed within a few years’ time. My group has tabled a number of amendments in order to prevent that from happening, as well as to ensure that European railways show a united front to the public and that shortcomings can be more speedily remedied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such legislation faces the opposition of national railway companies who know they will suffer increased administrative burdens, the cost of which will be passed on to passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sterckx says that we should not tinker with international agreements which are already satisfactory. He says that we must not take over the role of railway company marketing managers. Above all, he says that the system must benefit passengers. Only an EU politician could say all that and then propose extending the scope of legislation. There is already a perfectly good international agreement in place between 42 nations, including many non-EU countries, to facilitate cross-border railway travel. In 2002 international railway companies signed a voluntary Charter containing quality standards for rail passenger services – the COTIF Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot legislate, for example, for French, German and British railways. They all operate under very different conditions. National governments, in conjunction with railway operators, should decide what regulation is appropriate, not the European Union. To be fair, the Commission only wanted regulation to cover cross-border rail travel, but Mr Sterckx goes further by proposing regulation for in-country domestic rail travel.</p>
<p class="contents">In another report from the Committee on Transport and Tourism concerning the certification of train crews, the rapporteur, Mr Savary, calls for the psychological testing of train crews. May I suggest that psychological testing be extended to the rapporteurs of this Parliament? Perhaps a simple word association test would be useful. If in response rapporteurs used the words 'integration', 'harmonisation' or 'regulation', they should be immediately disqualified from holding office. This might possibly cut down the amount of this kind of nonsense, but not, I suspect, until we have first legislated for harmonised and integrated psychology tests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The environmental emergency, the high cost of oil and congestion on the roads require a firm decision on rail transport, which is cleaner and safer and has good domestic infrastructures which can be integrated at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">To revitalise and modernise rail transport is a matter of priority for the future of the Union. The Commission has made considerable efforts towards increased harmonisation and liberalisation of the markets, but it is the European Parliament which has had – and still has – a central role to play in this area by overcoming national self-interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The courageous proposal to open up even domestic passenger transport to full liberalisation is vital to complete the single market, relaunch community rail services and provide a better service to the population. In this context, the amendment on reciprocity, which I proposed and with which the Commission concurred, ensures that countries which opt to open up their markets prior to the set deadlines should be protected against unfair competition from rail companies operating in protected domestic markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the regulations on passengers’ rights and their extension to domestic traffic are particularly important. Payment of compensation for delays, damage and accidents, and the rights of disabled passengers provide an excellent basis to encourage our companies to adopt high quality standards and to be competitive with other modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">A shift to rail transport, ladies and gentlemen, is one of those challenges where the credibility and future of Europe are at stake. For this reason, it is vital that Parliament takes a strong and clear stance on this package and does not hesitate to opt for a strategy of innovation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to thank him for the excellent cooperation, which, I think, enabled us to thrash out sound compromise proposals in the key areas. The practice run we had for airline passengers turned out useful for train passengers too, all train passengers in fact, so also including those using national rail transport. Our group considers it important that we did not only work out a general compensation scheme for delays exceeding one hour, but also for repeated short delays, so that undertakings are encouraged to work more efficiently and be more punctual, and can in that way also attract new customers, which is, after all, what we set out to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a few words about assistance for people with reduced mobility, on which we have tabled two additional amendments. First of all, notification of such assistance should not be made 48 hours, but 24 hours, in advance. I think that that is very reasonable, and would ask you to endorse it. Secondly, the training of rail staff should also give attention to that aspect of the job.</p>
<p class="contents">It remains important to us that rail passengers can readily purchase their train tickets at all times, whether from ticket offices at train stations, from ticket machines, or, in the absence of ticket machines, on the trains themselves. The rapporteur would now like to make exceptions for cases where seat reservations are compulsory, which I can understand, but also for the purpose of combating fraud. I too am against fraud, but I fear that if we follow your line, then we will end up with an empty box, and that is something we cannot endorse.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to Mr Jarzembowski’s report. I am a little surprised at the ease with which a majority of my fellow Members in the Committee on Transport and Tourism want to rush the Commission and intend to liberalise the whole railway system by 2012, without too much research, or without carrying out a thorough analysis of the impact this would have on national rail networks, which, as you know, differ greatly from each other, not least in terms of structure, or without asking whether that is the universal remedy that will enable us to attract more rail passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we should acknowledge that liberalising the market was undoubtedly a good thing in certain sectors. In the public transport sector, however, this is not, in my view, the case, as it is not a commercial sector and we also want to achieve objectives other than cost-effectiveness or profit, such as environmental objectives or people’s mobility. Measures other than liberalising the market have a far greater impact on the number of rail passengers than is often appreciated. I would give you the example of Belgium, where the number of passengers in 2003 rose by 7% and in 2004 by 6%, and the latest figures are also promising. This was not achieved by liberalising, but by modernising, by offering a better service, better facilities and by adopting an innovative price policy.</p>
<p class="contents">For the record, I have no problems with liberalising international passenger transport as such. In the case of the Thalys, I would not object to competition hotting up, as long as there were sound guarantees in place that all Member States, both now and in future, would be able to develop good public services. Therefore, it would have been preferable had we had a package on liberalisation on the one hand and the provision of public services on the other, rather than the package that is before us now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For our part, and with regard to the development of Community railways, we are fully in favour of supporting the opening up of transport services in general and, in particular, of passenger transport by rail, to private competition, though we are working on the basis that the road infrastructure is in the hands of independent managers, so that all possible users of the networks may have equal opportunities to access them.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, we are calling for the opening up of international rail passenger services to be brought forward to 2008 and we accept that the different Member States should be able to delay the liberalisation of the other national, regional and local passenger services until 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that this opening up should be carried out in a regulated fashion and without jeopardising the economic viability and survival of pre-existing services of public interest. We do not want to prejudice either the citizens or the urban, metropolitan or regional transport services which currently exist under the aegis of the public institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have advocated that, if the relevant objective economic analyses carried out by the regulatory bodies of each Member State show it to be advisable, the States should be able limit the right of access of an international service to a particular infrastructure on a regional route or restrict the right to pick up or drop off passengers at stations on that route.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we shall advocate reciprocal treatment, in such a way that those States which bring forward their opening up to private rail services may temporarily restrict that right to companies belonging to rail groups based in those other States in which similar conditions of freedom of access to the rail infrastructure do not exist. In other words, if a State does not open up its networks to competition, its companies will not be able to operate in other States which have done so.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we believe that contracts for the provision of private rail services must have a duration of five years, which may be extended to 10 years in the event that they use a specialised infrastructure and require significant investments. A longer period could only be authorised in very special cases of very large long-term investments, which would require, for this purpose, the inclusion of a multi-annual repayment plan which would deal with time periods, investments, disinvestments, repayments and how to deal with such a significant initial economic outlay.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the opening up and liberalisation of passenger services with every guarantee of quality, safety and certification of drivers, as well as appropriate regulation of the rights of passengers, will provide the Union’s citizens with the mobility necessary for the sustainable development and progress that we see as our future objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the second railway package was adopted, it was clearly and unambiguously stated that the package would be evaluated as soon as possible, and only then would further measures be taken, which is why our minority view of liberalisation is negative. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the time has come to adopt a directive dealing with a harmonised locomotive operator’s licence, which is something we all agree on. The other matters are far from being as pressing as they are presented here. If, ladies and gentlemen, you want to open the railway market to competition today, it will be a harmful step. What is more, it is necessary to start to implement the CER agreement, the international association of railway infrastructure companies and the transport commissioner, as soon as possible. </p>
<p class="contents">Does your desire to liberalise at all costs really take priority over harmonised safety and security standards for infrastructure and rolling stock? This is something I cannot agree with, and so in this matter, with all due respect to the rapporteur, Georg Jarzembowski, I must ask you for an unambiguous ‘no’ vote. We abide by the agreements reached when adopting the second railway package, and we will strive to return to the subject by the deadline set, or in other words by 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the railway unions of the Czech Republic and the Czech Government have asked me to lend explicit support to the Savary report, and to reject the Jarzembowski report. </p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to point out that rejecting the draft Zïle report and disagreeing with the Jarzembowski report is not a good omen for the attempt to rush the packages through. The excellent proposals in the Savary report have our support. I should like to inform the Commissioner that the Sterckx and Jarzembowski reports are in no way interdependent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In particular, I should like to refer to the drafting of the report on the proposal for a directive on the development of the Community’s railways. In the course of our work in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, many negative opinions were expressed concerning the dates and programme proposed by the rapporteur for opening up passenger services for competition. I made my views known on those occasions, as I am familiar with the condition of the railways in the new Member States and am aware that they are inadequately prepared to compete with large and powerful Western European countries in the open market.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not opposed to liberalisation of the transport market, but I would argue for fair competition. Allow me to reiterate that I am not against the liberalisation of services so long as it is fairly done. Provisions must be put in place to protect small undertakings and also to ensure monopolies do not arise in the future and that the major players in this field are exposed to healthy and fair competition. For all these reasons I believe that Parliament should not support Mr Jarzembowski’s proposal to bring liberalisation of the market forward to 2008. I have in mind the opening up of international transport, including cabotage. We should not back this proposal if we genuinely wish to implement the Union’s policy of equal rights and fair competition, which would allow the new Member States time to come up to the standards of experienced undertakings in Germany, England and France.</p>
<p class="contents">As Vice-Chairman of the European Parliament’s Committee on Transport and Tourism, I appeal to the House to support the original European Commission proposal regarding dates and programmes for liberalisation namely opening up international transport without cabotage from 2010. I also call on the House to reject Mr Jarzembowski’s report, because the proposal voted through in the Committee on Transport and Tourism concerning opening up this market did not take account of the situation in the new Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is high time rail transport in Europe became more efficient and more customer-friendly.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I should like to start with a question to Mr Barrot, Vice-President of the Commission. How do you assess the implementation of the first and second railway packages by the Member States and what steps will you take in order to accelerate this? After all, and that is my belief, the effective introduction of those two railway packages in practice is far more important for the improvement of train services than decisions on new rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The certification of train drivers is desperately needed and the abandonment of the quality requirements for freight transport will not create any problems, since that sector is quite capable of organising these things for itself. Whilst Mr Sterckx has done a sterling job of simplifying the proposal for passengers’ rights, under the leadership of Mr Jarzembowski, this House will be voting in favour of the liberalisation of passenger transport. This is to be welcomed where international transport is concerned, but the proposal for liberalising domestic transport is taking matters too far in my book, because forced competition on domestic rail sections by competing railway companies is not a guarantee for a better provision of services and is, indeed, compromising the train services’ punctuality and reliability, especially on dense, wide networks. We must take seriously the developments that have ensued in practice since the vote on the second railway package – by which I mean both the problems and the arrival of the new Member States. Member States must retain the freedom to organise necessary competition differently, like in the Netherlands, for example, with concessions for a core network to one railway company. We, the Dutch delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will therefore be voting against Amendments 2 and 9.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Council is unenthusiastic about Parliament’s far-reaching position, the necessary discussions will undoubtedly follow in due course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Inés Ayala Sender (PSE). – </span></span>  <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, I am from a country and a region which, as a result of their history and geography, are particularly sensitive to the need to achieve the greatest possible diversification and rebalancing of the different modes of transport, with particular recognition of the railway.</p>
<p class="contents">Realities such as the Madrid-Paris Talgo or the high-speed lines, which are extremely popular with the Spanish citizens, are testimony to this enthusiasm for modernising the railways. But we have not forgotten what it has cost us, and is still costing us, to put an end to the isolation resulting from the single track, from our different gauge of track, to overcome our complex and difficult mountain situation and the challenge of creating a central route through the Pyrenees, which is becoming increasingly urgent in order to reduce the congestion at either extreme, and is therefore crucial to goods transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence our interest in an effective improvement to the railways, which is more global and integrated and not restricted to proposing total and definitive liberalisation as a magic potion for resolving every kind of problem forever.</p>
<p class="contents">We know – and the chairman of our committee, Mr Costa, has referred to this authoritatively – that the competitiveness of railways does not just depend on other rebalancing measures, but, to a large extent, on infrastructures, on the interoperability of systems and on specialised personnel; in short, on investments and on support. That is why we are lending our support to the trans-European networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither do I believe that it is sensible to indulge in a kind of ‘yo-yo’ system: first we liberalise and deregulate and then we intervene once again. And that has happened in the case of the Commission’s proposal for quality standards in goods transport. We must acknowledge the courage and skill of Mr Zīle, who has worked in the best possible way, given the circumstances, which make this proposal a good candidate for the ‘Better regulation’ that President Barroso and Commissioner Verheugen are offering us so secretively.</p>
<p class="contents">As shadow rapporteur, I must confess that I was totally astounded to discover that neither customers nor companies wanted this type of legislation. Perhaps, Commissioner, we should – and I believe that you are sufficiently creative to do this – try to invent other instruments that are genuinely useful in terms of making goods transport by rail more attractive, not just for advocates of conflicts, but, in particular, for its users. In short, no, we cannot legislate in relation to goods by rail as we do with other products, as if we were talking about socks.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Sterckx and Savary reports, I would like warmly to acknowledge their timeliness and sense of urgency and the excellent message they send to the citizens. On the one hand, we are creating good European professionals, able to drive trains throughout the whole of the Union’s territory and, on the other, we wish to establish, clearly and courageously, the rights and obligations of passengers, with particular attention to passengers with mobility problems, something which will eventually affect all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the report by Mr Jarzembowski, who is always so impulsive and sure of his objectives, which all too often coincide with those of Europe, I must say that I do not believe it to be realistic to seek to overwhelm the Commission’s proposal, and also to involve it in an interinstitutional battle which, as a result of seeking the best, could jeopardise any success. We would have preferred to have accompanied the Commission’s realistic and detailed proposal with a healthy majority which sent a clear signal to all of the interlocutors. Instead, he has chosen to present his over-the-top proposal, which has provoked opposition from a significant proportion of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I still believe that the Commission’s proposal for opening up is the most pragmatic and realistic, provided that it is part of a general framework of creating a European area of transport, in which the railway competes with other modes of transport under equal conditions. And that will be achieved through modernisation and investment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would also be appropriate to review existing legal instruments and assess the consequences of their implementation, including the financial consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission proposed liberalising international passenger transport services from 2010. In his document, Mr Jarzembowski suggests bringing the date forward by two years, so that liberalisation would begin in 2008. This would result in undertakings currently active in Poland or in other new Member States losing a significant part of the market. These countries are suffering from under-investment in railway infrastructure and they lack modern rail equipment. Regional rail transport has been under-financed too. A further reduction of the transitional period for international transport will aggravate the negative effect of the new provisions on transport companies in the new Member States. This is because current arrangements for European funding to purchase modern rolling stock for passenger transport are inadequate, and the countries that joined the Union on 1 May 2004 are not in a position to disburse the large sums required themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Union citizens will benefit from the liberalisation of services in the long term. At present, however, it is important to get the technical quality right and the appropriate infrastructure in place. This requires the new Member States to undertake some unusually expensive action involving restructuring and investment. It is therefore necessary to retain the five-year period proposed by the Commission, so as to allow the conditions for competition on the European transport market to even out. We should grant the railway sector sufficient time to revitalise itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, liberalisation of the market in rail transport services should go hand in hand with a great European venture linking west of Europe to the east, and north to the south by means of a high speed train similar to the TGV. That would be the ideal project through which to demonstrate the unity of our continent and the relevance of European institutions, including the European Commission and the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The railways are needed in Europe. We must offer both freight and passengers the opportunity of rail transport as an alternative to the roads. Rail transport conserves the environment and is good for our productivity. In that case, freight and passengers must be able to travel quickly and smoothly on the railways. That is not the case today. It is not always so easy to put together a journey from A to B, and freight is often left at the borders.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second railway package, we are opening up the market to freight transport nationally and internationally. It was a good decision, but it still has to be put fully into practice. As everyone agrees, things are still moving slowly and coming up against a host of problems. Should we, however, do as Mr Jarzembowski proposes and open up the railway markets to passenger transport, when the market for freight transport has not yet been successfully opened up? A number of people fear that it will in practice be impossible to get the two things operating together.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from a country in which we have opened up passenger traffic in our own way. We have done so not through outright deregulation but in, so to speak, a peculiarly Swedish way. We really have seen the opportunities, but we have also seen the difficulties when certain lines are profitable and others are not. That is a difficulty if the ambition is to have passenger traffic throughout the country. It is important to open up the markets for passengers as well, and I am convinced that we shall in time have a national opening-up of passenger traffic too. What, now, I want, however, to recommend is that we begin with <span class="italic">international</span> passenger traffic. What we also have here are proposed protective clauses for local and regional passenger rail services. The fact is that to decide at this stage about opening up <span class="italic">national</span> passenger traffic would merely be a case of the European Parliament adopting an idealistic position without its being aware of the consequences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With respect to the third rail package, we have to take note of the fact that the railway networks and their development greatly differ in the various member countries. Whereas in Western Europe the length of high speed tracks reaches 6 000 km, the railway networks in Eastern areas are mostly neglected and run-down. This makes the issue of liberalisation, the opening up of national railway networks to the railway companies of other Member States a complicated one for the East-Central European observer. On the one hand, competition inevitably brings about better services and a more satisfying customer experience. This makes the railway a more attractive option and reduces road congestion, which is a desirable outcome, to be supported for its positive environmental effects. On the other hand, however, Eastern railway companies have been underfinanced for decades. Correcting development policy errors and concepts would take a long time and an enormous amount of money; not a task to be reasonably concluded by 2008 or 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">This creates the dangerous possibility that the railway companies of several Member States, including my own, may go bankrupt due to the unfair competition, which would put a severe social, financial and political burden on the respective governments. As a representative of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I naturally stand for competition in this area. I stand for competition that serves the interest of citizens and the environment at the same time. However, in this case we would not be talking about fair competition but the prevalence of dominant companies. For this reason I cannot support the proposal of the Committee in its present form and I ask that it be reconsidered.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the context of this so-called – and I do mean ‘so-called’ – third package, I should like to focus on two dossiers: firstly, the directive on the certification of train crews and, secondly, the directive on liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to the report by my colleague and friend Mr Savary, I must say that it is particularly important to adopt this proposal for a directive. I actually see this dossier as belonging to the second railway package and, since rail-freight services have already been liberalised, it is imperative to create harmonised European conditions for train drivers and the whole on-board train crew. This directive could also contribute significantly towards making a lasting improvement in safety, and it is desirable that it be implemented as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Jarzembowski is probably aware, I have considerable reservations about the content of his report, and my view is still that we are on the wrong track here. I am not opposed to it in principle, but it should be noted that liberalisation is not, as yet, known to have had any positive impact, whether on safety, on quality, or on the social situation of crews. No suitable framework has been created for conditions of competition throughout the network, and there is no guarantee that quality and efficiency will increase. The bad experiences of those countries that have already done this do have to be taken into account, too.</p>
<p class="contents">If Parliament really takes this path tomorrow, it will find itself on the path already described by a late Austrian cabaret artist, who said ‘I don’t know where I’m going, but the main thing is I get there soon’. I certainly agree with Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Rack that this time scheduling of legislative resolutions is not exactly the most sensible thing for Parliament to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is what we are once again trying to do carefully, resolutely and, of course, in line with the rules. We are seeking to grant Member States the right to restrict the opening up of the network in certain cases, whilst respecting the rights of the workers, thus ensuring the safety and quality of the service provided.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that blocking the passenger rail transport market to various operators from the Member States cannot be justified by simple protectionism, often on the part of state monopolies. This does not benefit users in any way, shape or form. Yet in this rail package there are other issues that merit more detailed analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we feel that cabotage services should fall under future legislation. We welcome the fact that the process of opening up the networks is to be staggered in order to make it easier for those involved to adjust, and this could be extended for the reasons explained by a number of speakers. Secondly, without prejudice to the Member States’ responsibilities, powers to issue certification for international train drivers and other on-board staff should also be defined in order to promote the safety and the free movement of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I turn to the issue of the differences between the rights and obligations of national and international passengers. In our view, the directive should apply to both in order to make the system simpler and more coherent.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we are, broadly speaking, in favour of this legislative package. For this reason, I should also like to thank the rapporteurs and to express my hope that the package will be adopted in Parliament and in the Council. As has been said before, this is an opportunity that must not go to waste. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent reports and the Members of this House who helped to enrich the proposals aimed at revitalising rail transport by creating an internal rail transport market, thereby increasing competitiveness and economic, social and territorial cohesion in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this is a package, each of its parts will be judged on its own merits. I welcome the position taken by the Committee on Transport and Tourism as regards the Zīle report and, as a whole, I endorse the reports, in particular the Savary report, for its social and safety elements, and the Sterckx report.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Jarzembowski report, I should like to say that I welcome the idea of opening up the market for international passenger transport services in principle, but I have reservations and indeed objections with regard to his intention to bring forward the liberalisation of international transport, including cabotage and, worse, the liberalisation of national transport services from 1 January 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberalising international transport may indeed help to revitalise rail transport in the Union, by boosting growth and creating a better balance in relation to air and road transport. It is also true, however, that a somewhat hasty and scarcely harmonious liberalisation could have a terrible impact on some countries such as Portugal, in which specialised infrastructures such as high-speed links have yet to set out and implement their management model and in which the provision of public services in the area of transport will continue to play a key role in terms of employment, economic growth and responsiveness to users.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, no review of Regulation 1191/69, on action by Member States concerning the obligations inherent in the concept of a public service, has taken place. Accordingly, there is neither the necessary legal certainty, nor safeguards of provision in public service obligations in the area of liberalised transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if we are able to overcome these doubts regarding national transport and cabotage, we feel that establishing 1 January 2012 as the date for the liberalisation of national transport services is unacceptable, which is why we are seeking a rethink whereby the final say on the matter is left to the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is also significant for passenger services, to encourage passengers to leave the roads and travel by rail. Naturally, the expansion of economies of scale is also necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">That is all well. What I see as a problem, and I would like to commend it to the attention of Mr Jarzembowski, is the specific macroeconomic challenge the new Member States are faced with. Namely, there is huge pressure on these states to introduce the euro, and a constant pressure from cofinancing sources to start our first three-year programme. We have to participate in agricultural financing, as our own budgetary contribution is a prerequisite to receiving direct support. This enormous pressure to enter the euro zone as soon as possible forces these governments to tackle the issue of budgetary consolidation. That in turn makes them ignore the large national companies outside the national budget, such as the national railway companies. </p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, I think that at this time it is impossible for us to accept the liberalisation schedule he proposes for new Member States, and especially cabotage. I suggest that we establish a transition period that allows us time to prepare, to give a chance to our national railway company, especially considering the fact that the new Member States are very large ‘transit chunks’ and huge transit markets. We must grant them equal opportunities! This is the reason the accession contract contains transition periods up to 2007 for goods traffic. The public services sector is also underdeveloped. I fear that we would be left with secondary railway lines operating at a loss, with all the main lines taken over by the large railway corporations. This is another reason why I ask that we consider the introduction of some kind of a transition period.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The third railway package now concludes our legislative efforts. The current proposal decided, and decides, on the necessary harmonisation in the technical, administrative and, partly, the social field, along with the gradual liberalisation of all railway services by 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">This puts in place the preconditions for a European railway culture, with which the railways can regain their significance and competitiveness within the pan-European transport system. The liberalisation efforts in rail transport are not prompted by ideological convictions, but by necessity in terms of transport policy. They owe their existence to the fact that the internal market, the European Economic Area and also the European cultural area need the railways as a mode of transport that does not operate only in separate part-markets. Particularly on the long, cross-border sections, the railways have inherent systemic advantages. This comprehensive reorientation is the only way of countering the heavy losses in terms of transport volume suffered by the railways: in favour of the roads in the case of freight transport, and in favour of the low-cost airlines as well as the roads in the case of passenger transport. It is understandable that some employees should feel anxious about such a radical change. Yet the 18 years that have elapsed between 1994 and 2012 serve to guarantee that it has been, and continues to be, possible to carry through all these changes in a socially viable way.</p>
<p class="contents">In anticipation of the passenger-rail market organisation, the ICE 3 was approved for France last week, and the TGV will probably follow in the coming year. There will then be direct high-speed trains from Paris to South Germany. Those responsible have read the signs of the times. Adopting the third railway package would mean that we, too, had read the signs of the times. In order to proceed with further revitalisation of the railways, we must put on our agenda the full harmonisation of the conditions of competition between the various modes of transport, finding new sources of finance for the rail infrastructure, and particularly a strategy for improving integration of modes of transport as intermodal passenger transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report is particularly important for the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Polish Member of the House, I should briefly like to share two reactions with you. To start with, I would remind the House that the first two railway packages have not yet been fully implemented in certain Member States. In addition, there has been no detailed assessment of these packages. All this significantly hinders discussion on the Third Railway Package.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as regards the Third Railway Package, I am convinced that it is largely based on the experiences of the old Member States, and that it does not take account of the situation in the new countries. In particular, I have in mind Mr Jarzembowski’s report, in which the date for liberalisation of passenger transport services is set at 2008, two years earlier than had been advocated in the Commission’s proposal. In addition, in Mr Jarzembowski’s report the scope of liberalisation is broadened to include cabotage. Anyone who is acquainted with the current situation of passenger transport in the new Member States will realise that such measures would be very detrimental. It should be borne in mind that the new Member States are far less competitive that the old ones, and that in general they lack modern rolling stock and suffer from under-investment in rail infrastructure and from under-funding of regional transport services. Consequently, broadening the scope of liberalisation and speeding it up is bound to destabilise the already perilous position of the new Member States, particularly as the Commission has failed to provide adequate funding from Union resources for the purchase of new rolling stock for passenger transport. Railway undertakings in the new Member States are not in a position to disburse such large sums themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows from what I have just said that it is likely that the strong will end up dominating the weak, and I do not believe that the Union should be built on such a basis. Ladies and gentlemen, the Union is not about domination. Indeed, the opposite is the case, the Union is all about acting together in solidarity for the benefit of a single strong Europe whose Member States are not categorised in terms of their strength or weakness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my view, it is clear that rail services must leave room for public services, with well-defined obligations set out in public service contracts, while the remainder of the market operates on the basis of regulated competition with uniform standards for all.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this is the problem, Commissioner, because we need a rapid approval of the regulation on public service obligations. It is an age-old question. As you know, the Commission has presented a new draft that Parliament has not yet discussed and in which, unless I am mistaken, there is no reference to uniform quality standards. Such standards are only mentioned in connection with public service, not for all the rest.</p>
<p class="contents">I should not like to think that the Commission’s political viewpoint had shifted from the direction indicated in 2002, or from that confirmed in the debate here in Parliament and in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. We must therefore ensure that liberalisation can be viewed for what I believe it really is, namely a useful means of improving the quality of services, and also of stimulating development, with respect for territory and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">This aspect is fundamental and Parliament must again take responsibility for it. I therefore invite the Commission to take account of our work in Parliament and of the amendments approved. I also urge the UK Presidency to promote a high-level political agreement on this issue in the December Transport Council, making it clear that a truly European transport model is viable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is worth pointing out that in this House we devote the hours of daylight to making fine-sounding statements, and then late at night we get down to changing legislation which impacts on everyday life in Europe. I would like to reverse this order so we debate legal provisions in the full light of day with a good attendance.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be delightful to debate and delight in Mr Jarzembowski’s excellent report if it were not for the fact that it cannot be debated in a vacuum. The context is crucial, and it involves more than French animosity towards Polish plumbers, butchers or bakers. There is also the matter of resistance to the Services Directive or delocalisation within the Union. Small undertakings in local European markets are being driven out to make way for a cavalcade of European locomotives transporting thousands of passengers who will pay for their tickets in euro, not in zlotys. We are supposed to be delighted about this, because after all we are supposed to be in favour of opening the market, are we not?</p>
<p class="contents">There is another context to bear in mind too, namely the technical state of Polish railways. We have not had the time or the money to make up for years of neglect. It is a foregone conclusion that we shall lose out in the liberalisation of transport. It is a battle in which we are bound to have to beat retreat. Once again, we are supposed to do so with a smile on our faces, because after all we are supposed to be in favour of opening the market, are we not? Solidarity or at the very least, a reasonable balance, figure hardly at all in all this.

<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we have certain reservations about Mr Jarzembowski's report. We are in favour of a more gradual liberalisation of international passenger transport.

<p class="contents">As regards the rights of railway companies to carry passengers between stations within the same Member State on an international passenger route, we believe that it is preferable for this to be applied from 2010 onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have particular reservations as regards the liberalisation of national transport, which is why I believe that the amendments making provision for the liberalisation of national transport by 2012 should not be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">We also consider it very important for the Member States to have the facility to restrict access to a route which is governed by a public service contract, where this is necessary in order to maintain the economic equilibrium of the route.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite any differences we may have, we shall vote in favour of the proposal, because we believe that liberalisation may help upgrade passenger rail transport.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the report by Mr Savary on the certification of train crews, we consider that it is very important that this report be adopted as quickly as possible, given that there must be safety in rail transport, especially in the run-up to the full liberalisation of freight transport.</p>

I agree with the principles set forth in the directives of the third package. I support that the overall principles required to open up the European market of passenger services be implemented in national law by 2006. Hungary, a new Member State, has already done that. I support that Member States should be able to decide, even on a reciprocal basis, to give earlier access to their railway infrastructure. This is definitely a case for a multi-speed Europe. However, if some Member States wish to decide to open their markets a few years later, they must be allowed this option. This is currently missing from the regulation, while at the same time the proposal is going deeper, opening up the market for national passenger services. That, however, will raise challenges for a number of Member States, including certain new Member States, that will take time to tackle: public services contracts, solutions for under-serviced areas, logistical tasks and the restructuring of railway companies with all the personnel consequences involved. These tasks are not merely a question of a simple national parliamentary decision – they require time.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to realise that, while new Member States show a faster rate of economic development than most traditional Member States, there are some areas where we progress at a slower pace. Rail services hold values in new Member States, values that may fall victim to an overly swift transformation. These values are not only national in nature but, with the implementation of the third rail package, which I support, will also become common European values. I am asking Parliament to consider this during the voting procedure tomorrow.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I noted also, from Mr Sterckx, the idea that passenger rights are likely to promote confidence in the railways among users. I thank Mr Zīle for having sought an acceptable compromise and I would like to say to Mr. Jarzembowski that I appreciated his insistence on the fact that opening up to competition should facilitate transfer from road to rail, since that is indeed what we also wish to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall try to reply, Mr President, without going into all the details. First, since I have been asked the question, I should like to remind you that the first railway package has been transposed by all the Member States except two for certain directives. Moreover, the Commission has started infringement proceedings in respect of the two Member States concerned. For the second package, the Commission is following very closely the process of transposition into national law. I would remind you that May 2006 has been set as the date for transposition, except for the opening up of the domestic freight transport market where the date fixed is the end of December 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Having made these points, I am going to try, without going into all the details, to give you an idea of the Commission’s opinion on the work of Parliament and of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. I thank the Chairman, Mr Costa, and the members of the Committee on Transport for the thorough work they have done. The purpose of a package is to make it possible to place the different texts in relation to each other in order to achieve a balanced, global reform that allows both an opening up of markets, which is beneficial for consumers, and the establishment of a regulatory framework that ensures the safety and rights of citizens. I believe that it is all of this, both the opening up to competition and the regulatory framework, that will allow us to reverse the trend so that it favours railways, as Mr Costa has stressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the proposed amendments improve the quality of the legislative proposals. Certain amendments pose a few problems. I am nonetheless convinced that we shall find practical solutions to those questions in the course of the legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I shall begin with the proposal for a regulation on the quality of freight. Obviously the Commission will examine carefully the final position of Parliament and of the Council in order to determine the implications. I must stress, however, the importance of this text because one has to admit that the situation in the rail freight transport sector has scarcely progressed since the Commission’s proposal in March 2004. Thus it is that the punctuality of international combined rail and road transport remains unsatisfactory: 35% of trains are late in 2005. Furthermore, according to the European rail sector, in conventional rail transport, less than one contract in three contains a quality clause that provides for compensation in the event of delays.</p>
<p class="contents">From many quarters we have heard the question: why has the Commission proposed this piece of legislation on the quality of freight? The mere fact of having posed the problem has already had a positive effect on the sector. Over the last few months, we have witnessed the negotiation of framework agreements between user groups and certain rail undertakings. These negotiations have focussed on commitments to quality. Of course, I shall take note of what Parliament and the Council decide and, if they confirm their opposition to the choice of legislative instrument, it will be necessary to ask the people involved to find other ways and means of achieving the objective shared by the three institutions: that is, the improvement of the quality of international rail freight transport services by rail. This is the way in which we shall achieve a transfer from road to rail. That is the first point and, again, I thank Mr Zīle.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the other proposals, here, in broad outline, is the position of the Commission and, Mr President, I am communicating the detailed positions on each amendment to the Presidency.<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p class="contents">I shall now come to Mr Savary’s report on the directive on the certification of train crews operating locomotives and trains. Most of the amendments seem to us to be moving in the right direction. They are evidence, I say quite simply, of high quality work. This directive sends a social signal enabling all rail transport personnel to feel involved in the regeneration of this means of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, some amendments that pose certain difficulties, such as in the case of finance for training or the obligation to offer refunds in certain instances. These give rise to certain reservations on our part because they impinge on labour law, the flexibility of the market and the right to mobility. This also applies to the possibility of a temporary dispensation for domestic drivers. Your committee proposes that Member States should be able to temporarily disregard the rules applicable to domestic drivers. In the eyes of the Commission, allowing such dispensations for whole countries poses some real questions and that is why it is not in favour of it. In social terms, we shall have two classes of driver, when, in practice, the categories are not distinct. That runs the risk of creating career problems. Moreover, in economic terms, States will be obliged to maintain two different sets of legislation, two systems for accreditation and for recognition of trainers. In short, one wonders whether this duality will not give rise to additional costs. All that, Mr Savary, does not in any way detract from the quality of the work accomplished.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also provisions that apply to other staff, which seems to me legitimate. These concern train staff who are not drivers but who are involved in tasks relating to railway transport. In spirit your proposal is in line with that of the Commission. It is necessary only to make sure that the ‘comitology’ annex is well defined in order to avoid any legal problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Next there is the problem of drivers failing to respect certain conditions once the basic licence and the harmonised complementary certificate have been obtained. There are, no doubt, certain rewordings that would be desirable in order to take proper account of the rights and duties of drivers, of employers and of the competent authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the problem of periodic checks. The Commission proposes referring to the safety management systems that each railway undertaking has to put in place. In this matter it is necessary to find a balance between the requirements that need to be included in the main body of the legislation and those that need to be in an annex. I am sorry, Mr President, at this late hour, to bring into the debate a number of very technical points, but that is due to the quality of the work of the Committee on Transport. That is what I have to say, then, about this text on drivers’ licences, which, I have noticed this evening, has received Parliament’s very broad agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I come now to the third report which concerns the proposal to open up the market for international rail passenger services. The Commission appreciates Mr Jarzembowski’s report and supports the idea, which several Members have mentioned, of linking this proposal to our amended proposal on public services in land transport. Nonetheless, Mr Jarzembowski, we have reservations about the amendments that involve bringing forward the date for opening up international passenger services from 2010 to 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is of the opinion that 2010 is a more appropriate date because it is only on that date that most of the required institutional and procedural framework will be in place and properly operational. There are the national safety authorities and the rail regulators and there is the work of the European Railway Agency. In addition, most of the planned international high-speed lines will not be completed until 2010 and it is on these infrastructures that international passenger traffic will be concentrated in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission cannot support opening up the domestic passenger market in 2012. This proposal seems to us premature and difficult to realise given its great sensitivity. The Commission also has difficulty in accepting the amendment that introduces the potential for Member States to anticipate the opening of their market on condition of a reciprocity clause, because such clauses run the risk of being discriminatory on grounds of nationality.</p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, the Commission is pleased with Mr Jarzembowski’s report. We can accept the amendments it contains subject to certain alterations to the wording. I am thinking more precisely of the extension of the standard term for framework agreements for the use of the railway infrastructure or the clarification of the conditions under which the rights of an open access operator might be limited if they come into conflict with rights resulting from a public service contract. This is a balanced approach and it respects different national situations. That is what I wanted to say about this proposal for a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to Mr Sterckx’s report on the regulation on international rail passengers’ rights and obligations. Since March 2004, the debate on passengers’ rights has made much progress within our institutions. Within the Council, an in-depth discussion is about to come to a conclusion. The regulation on the civil responsibility of rail companies, incorporated into the new COTIF-CIV agreement of 1999, should finally come into force before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sterckx, I should like once again to express to you my gratitude for the work you have accomplished. Your concern has been to seek to widen the scope of the regulation and you have proposed extending it to cover national services also. I fear, however, that it is not possible to achieve this extension immediately. I should like to commit myself to a more in-depth study of this question. We could then return to it at a later stage in the light of the experience acquired by virtue of the application of the regulation on international travel.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point of your report is the application of the COTIF-CIV international framework in relation to civil responsibility. The Commission is inclined to respond favourably to your requests. Nonetheless, the regulation of responsibility as defined by COTIF-CIV does not appear to strengthen the position of passengers in the event of an accident, or, at least, not as much as the Commission would have wished.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I shall confine myself to two key points for which the Commission would like your support. First of all, the obligation to provide passengers with the information they need. Mr President, you have illustrated it with the example of integrated tickets over the whole European network. The impact analysis on the consequences of opening up the international passenger service market shows that its success depends very much on efficient access to information and tickets. European rail passengers must have the right and the possibility of travelling with a ticket that allows them to cross several borders within the European Union. For this right to be truly effective, rail companies, including those that are in competition with each other, must cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as regards the regulations for civil responsibility in the event of accident, there is no doubt that there must be compulsory insurance. Making a requirement for minimal cover will ensure fair compensation for passengers in the event of an accident while at the same time keeping a level playing field for rail companies who are facing financial difficulties. Anyway, Mr Sterckx, thank you for what you have done for passengers with reduced mobility. It is of great importance to me personally. What I can tell you is that if, as I hope, Parliament and the Council accept this proposal, I shall make it my personal responsibility to see to its effective application, because I believe that it is an essential point in terms of giving railways the image of quality that they must acquire.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Mr President, I hope very much that, improved and enriched in this way by Parliament, these texts will also meet the approval of the Council. I should like, once more, to thank Parliament. We are at a double turning point. We are well aware that, for the sake of the environment, but also for the sake of saving energy and because of the risk of congestion on our motorways and roads in Europe, we must encourage this modal transfer, more precisely, this combination between different modes of transport, given that travel by rail, by river and by sea are, without doubt, good options for long distance traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I have heard several Members of Parliament speak about subsidiarity and we are in agreement. There are things that should remain within the field of competence of national governments. Indeed, it is for this reason that we are going to carry out this subsidiarity test. As regards railways, however, ladies and gentlemen, we have come a long way. It used to be very much a national, not to say nationalist, area and that prevented the railway from taking its proper place in a Europe that now needs mobility across all our different Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, progress had to be made and I am very grateful to Parliament for having allowed us, together, not to reduce the competence of the Union’s Member States, but to show that, in this domain and in the domain of rail transport, the European Union and the drafting of a policy at a European level truly brings added value. That is why I warmly thank Parliament and the Committee on Transport for having carried out this in-depth work which will be particularly useful for us in the days to come.</p>

Yet again, Parliament is presented with a report intended to speed up the liberalisation of public services – in this case, passenger rail transport – and goes way beyond the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal, which forms part of what is termed the ‘third rail package’, has been euphemistically dubbed ‘the development of the railways’ and seeks to liberalise international passenger transport by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The report goes even further, advocating the liberalisation of international passenger transport (2008), and national transport (2012). What is more, the Member States can bring those dates forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and Parliament are seeking to press ahead with the process of liberalising and privatising rail transport even before the ‘first’ and ‘second’ packages have been fully implemented and before a progress report has been drawn up of the actual impact of the – let us be clear on this – detrimental measures laid down therein in terms of both the services provided and the working conditions of railway workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of liberalising the railways is to hand this sector over on a plate to the private sector, leaving the railways subject to the profit imperative, and yet massively subsidised by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to defend public rail transport services and the working conditions of those who work on them, we have tabled a motion to reject this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
