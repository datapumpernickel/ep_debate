I would move to a different seat in front of her so that I could see her while I am speaking if I had more time, for I do not like to see her having to perform contortions.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I would like to inform you that this report places on the table the issues and the importance of elderly people in Europe. Without a doubt, there will soon be as many as 100 or 120 million people in Europe and, in the near future, in the enlarged Europe, and so this report concerns a very large number of European Union citizens. I am stressing this because, when pensioners and elderly people stop working, I regret to say that they are considered by governments, particularly the Ministers for the Budget, no longer to exist, to be citizens of which there should be as few as possible in a country, to be people who are a burden on the public purse, whereas, clearly, we are all agreed that being old means having worked for a lifetime, having suffered for a lifetime and having built up everything around us. It would therefore be appropriate for elderly people to be able to enjoy their lives more than young people.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that, in the meetings and discussions held within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs with all the group representatives, there was complete consensus on the objectives: we all want Europe to do something, if possible, to improve the lot of pensioners. It is extremely important that we do this first. There may be some disagreement as to how we go about this, but that is democracy and it is the right way to address such important matters.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I want to focus, in particular, on the bone of contention. It is better to get the bad news over with first, if possible, and I will therefore start by making it quite clear that I personally do not support the statement of the Barcelona European Council, which, in the space of a day, without warning – nobody expected it – called for the average working age of citizens throughout Europe, of workers throughout Europe, to be increased by five years by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with the opposition groups and, in particular, the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Party of European Socialists, Mr Cercas, among others, we have drawn up an amendment opposing this decision, on which the European Parliament was not consulted. I must also say, moreover, that I am totally against this decision; two amendments have been tabled by a group on the other side of the House, opposing this decision, and I personally cannot do anything but vote for these amendments, for I feel that citizens should be able to continue working on two conditions. What I mean is, after they have paid enough contributions for a pension and have worked for a sufficient number of years of their lives, people must only continue to work on two conditions: the first being that the decision to work is voluntary, in other words that they are not forced to work for 45, 50 or 60 years of their lives – and the Commission states this in its report – and the second, I would add, being that there are no young people out of work. As long as there is a young person who is unemployed, I feel that the elderly who have been able to work and can now draw a pension should leave their jobs for the young people.</p>
<p class="contents">I have now run out of time but I reserve the right to continue in my explanation of vote on this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This topic is far too important to be permitted to be left exclusively to a closed circle in which far-reaching options are decided on.</p>
<p class="contents">We MEPs must therefore be involved in this issue as representatives of the public interest. I will take this opportunity to reiterate the demand that we should have an interinstitutional agreement on the method of open coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, addressing the Commission and the Member States, I will repeat that we must achieve definite progress on the problems that bear down on Europe's people. Pensions are one example of these. We need a speedy revision of Regulation 1408/71 on the coordination of social security schemes. We need simple rules on the transferability of occupational pensions. We need solutions to the taxation of occupational pensions, which cannot be founded on open coordination alone, so Parliament must be brought in to represent the interests of Europe's people.</p>

It is very important that, when citizens reach pensionable age, they can count on a reasonable and fair pension scheme, whether they live in Finland or in Portugal. That applies to men and women alike. I should like to home in on this latter group and present three points which affect women, in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the pension schemes must be designed effectively to prevent poverty and social exclusion. In many of the current schemes, it is still too often the case that mainly older, single women live far below the poverty line. Often, through their choice to devote themselves to their families and not to develop a professional career, they hardly have individual pension rights. I would therefore expressly call on the Member States to review their schemes in such a way as to ensure that women, but also men who, through family circumstances, are not active in the labour market, are nevertheless able to build up individual pension rights. Part-time work, mainly done by women, makes it difficult to accrue pension rights and, in this area too, there should be scope for building up additional rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in its communication, the Commission notes that, in order to keep pension schemes affordable, it is essential for total participation in the labour market to increase, as Mr Fatuzzo pointed out a moment ago. In Laeken, a target figure of 60% was mentioned for women by 2010. An impressive target, but I would cast doubt on whether women, as is the case in some countries, would be prepared to increase their premium contributions for their pensions thanks to the so-called actuarial factors. The fact that, statistically, they have a longer life expectancy should not lead to discrimination. This is precisely where the principle of gender solidarity should come into play. I call on the Member States to give due consideration to this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Commission suggests using the open co-ordination method to back the national strategies, and this requires gender-specific data and indicators. This too must be borne in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, for the future of an ageing Europe, it is of the utmost importance for safe, adequate and affordable pension schemes to be set up which guarantee that retired men and women can lead dignified and independent lives and can take a full part in social and cultural life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karas (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we are all aware that retirement provision with a secure future has become one of the greatest challenges to budgetary policy, social security provision, our policies in the social sphere, and hence to humanity, in our time. This is due to demographic developments, that is, the fact that the coming years will see around one-third of the population past pensionable age, and by reason of the fortunate increase in life expectancy.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, are right behind the Commission in its three main proposals for doing everything possible in order to achieve an appropriate level of pension, to ensure the financial sustainability of public and private means of retirement provision and to modernise pension systems, so that, in future, they too will be able to offer security despite changed overall conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are always talking about a great deal of mobility and flexibility, and about the internal market. Today, it must also be said loud and clear that mobility, flexibility and a functioning internal market presuppose social security – security for people when they are required to be mobile. As a group, too, we are very clearly in favour of extending the three-pillar model, meaning public systems, occupational systems involving both employers and employees, and private or individual schemes. What we are dealing with is the way in which all three pillars of the retirement provision system relate to each other. The load cannot be left to rest on one pillar alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference should also be made in this context to the differing competences that we have at present. Responsibility for the systems, for the way the pillars relate to each other, for tax law, for labour and social security law, falls on the nation states. Responsibility for the internal market, for mobility, for cross-border activities, lies at the European level. We therefore favour greater coordination, but not to the exclusion of politics and Parliament, bypassing us, as it were. Yes to coordination, but with codecision for those with political responsibility and for the citizens' representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">We are responsible for occupational retirement provision, and on a cross-border basis. This is an important aspect of the Action Plan for Financial Services. Again, in the Barcelona Final Document, there is the call for the second pillar to be regulated also on a European level. In July 2001, Parliament set out our position with over 460 votes. To this day, we are waiting for the Council's Common Position. Things have come to such a pass that the Commissioner responsible said yesterday, in an interview with the ‘Financial Times’, that he was withdrawing the Commission proposal, despite our calling on him for there to be a regulation in Europe, and even though Barcelona puts us under pressure of time. Of those who are competent and bear responsibility, we demand that they do what they have undertaken to do and set themselves a time limit. Let them at last act, or else new reports and resolutions will not help us, for action will be dragging its feet on the way to the political objectives.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Lancker (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. My first request is addressed to you, Mr President. I should first of all like to say that this report comes at least one month, maybe many months, too late. This report should have been ready to take to the Barcelona Summit, where pensions were on the agenda. Parliament has, as it is, such a modest role in the open method of co-ordination that we must urgently find ways in this Presidency of improving our response time as Parliament. If not, we will lose any credibility in this debate. I hope, Mr President, that you will be able to inform the Presidency of this and that you will also find a solution to the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Fatuzzo, for the fact that, in this report, he has consistently adopted Parliament's line and the views we expressed in the report by Mr Cercas Alonso, for that is very important for my group. After years, the silence has at long last been broken in an important debate such as that on pensions. Silence is a very relative concept. For, since forever and a day, the ECOFIN Council has been working on pensions, but viewed from the angle of the Stability Pact and the broad economic guidelines and, thus, only from the point of view of the fundability of pensions. It is therefore a huge achievement on the part of the Commission, the Social Protection Committee and my own Minister, Mr Frank Vandenbroucke, under the Belgian Presidency, to have placed this issue on the agenda whilst adding the social dimension. For let us be quite honest: if we want to safeguard our European social model, if we want to preserve the solidarity between, and within, the generations in pensions, if we want pensions also to form part of a strategy against poverty and in favour of guaranteed income, then this debate should clearly be placed on a social footing. Although this issue mainly falls within the remit of the Member States, that does not mean that we cannot reach agreement at European level about the social objectives of the pension system. And this is why this report is so important, in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is also of the view that the objectives are currently still vague and general, but this is exactly why we need reports of this kind in order to ensure that this open method of co-ordination becomes more concrete in years to come. And I am therefore particularly anxious about, and particularly surprised at, the attitude of the GUE/NGL Group on the one hand, and that of the PPE-DE on the other which now – at this of all times – wants to back-track and scale down a number of our positions, not only on the open method of co-ordination, but also on the social objectives of the pension system. This is really the limit. If we champion rights in the second pension pillar, then I fail to grasp why we should not do so for the statutory pension systems. This is, in fact, another cause of my concern. I have the impression that some reticence has crept in recently in the Council too. Following the panache that was displayed under the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies, I have the feeling that the Council under Spanish Presidency is taking a bit of a back seat. And that, indeed, respite is being given to countries that do not have their pension plans ready and that no more work is being done on indicators which can make this open method of co-ordination more concrete. And that moreover, Barcelona was merely a summit where some of the preparatory work was done.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let there be no mistake: my group too is convinced of the fact that more people will need to enter employment in order to make future pension schemes affordable. But let us also be quite clear about these social objectives; let us spell out clearly that this is not about raising the statutory retirement age but about introducing incentives which encourage people to stay in the labour market and about a resolute fight against any form of age discrimination within the labour market. I hope that we will be able to demonstrate in our vote that this is what this is all about for us. And I also hope that the PPE-DE will not play any games with this open method of co-ordination and will join us in voting in favour of Mr Fatuzzo's report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have two points to make, and they are in actual fact the same two points Mr Kuckelkorn touched upon, one concerning the open method of coordination for pensions and the other concerning the internal market for supplementary pension schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">Open coordination, through which the Member States set common objectives and guidelines for future policy in the pensions area, analyse developments and exchange experiences, is in many ways a fruitful form of cooperation. It is especially heartening that the debate on future pensions is no longer concerned only with national finances and with how expensive it will become over the next ten years because of the many pensioners. It is a good thing that the Member States are talking together about how we ensure that good, secure conditions for pensioners can be afforded in the future. However, I wish nonetheless to highlight the problem that exists with open coordination, namely the democratic deficit. The objectives and guidelines agreed by the Member States for future pensions are initially drawn up by so-called ‘high level’ representatives in the shape of officials despatched by the governments of the Member States. The agreements are then confirmed by ministers of the Member States who, it must then be assumed, have popular mandates. It is a case of having to ‘assume’ because there is no democratic debate on this matter <span class="italic">here</span>. When we adopt legislation in the EU, there are public debates in the Member States, that is to say in the national parliaments. There is a system for consulting special interest groups so that the politicians have an objective basis for making decisions. Here in the European Parliament, we have our open debates so that the public can hear and understand what the arguments are behind our decisions and so that special interest groups can make their presence felt in the debates. Open debate and this basis for decision-making are totally absent when countries cooperate by means of open coordination. If we are serious about this cooperation and want to see it reflected in actual policy, then the doors must be thrown open when decisions are made concerning objectives and guidelines. The national parliaments must be far more actively involved, and local authorities and special interest groups must play their part. The European Parliament can also play a positive role in this cooperation, for it is in this context that we of course bring all cultures together and look at things in their overall context. It cannot be emphasised enough that efforts must be made to democratise open coordination, and I would urge the Council to address this subject. Cooperation on a subject such as future pensions, in particular, demands transparency, for this is a subject that deeply affects us all, and I believe that a lot of the fear concerning the possible implications of pension reforms could be exorcised through greater openness.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I wish to mention briefly is that of calling upon the Council and the Commission to bring about the speedy adoption of the Directive on Supplementary Pensions. It must, of course, be the right form of directive that we adopt. We must avoid constricting rules that hamper existing schemes. With that in mind, however, it is important to get things moving. By means of common rules, we can make life easier for employees in companies that operate across borders and can promote competition and efficiency on the part of pension providers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know that this is subject on which he feels very strongly – at last he has got his five minutes on it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would agree with much of what has already been said in this debate. When we are looking at safe and sustainable pensions, it is a particular problem for women. There is a very strong gender dimension to the pension issue. We see many severe disparities, especially in relation to occupational pensions and even State pension entitlements, where women are effectively penalised for taking on domestic responsibilities; for having worked part-time or flexibly. As new working patterns become more common, it is clear that we need to ensure that pension provision is guaranteed for both men and women in those different working environments. Perhaps, as is usually the case, once more men start working flexibly, we will suddenly see much more interest in pensions keeping up with different forms of work. That is maybe cynical if truthful.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also, as Mr Van Lancker has said, an issue, which touches very strongly on poverty. We already see in far too many countries, pensioners with an inadequate basic pension unable to participate fully in society and often unable to meet their basic needs. The key, of course, is decent State pensions, and funding them is a political choice. My group does not believe that pension costs will necessarily destabilise economies or society, if such choices on spending are made carefully. Indeed, the cases of people playing by the rules and investing either in their companies – with the Enron example before us or indeed in Equitable Life in my own country – and making private pension provision, show that you cannot trust the markets any more than you can sometimes trust governments. The democratic deficit in open co-ordination is also becoming even clearer. This is obviously an issue we need to address extremely rapidly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this context, the Commission and the Council have often called for pensions system reform in the name of the Stability and Growth Pact and combating state deficits. Whilst national competence with regard to pensions is not called into question, the open method of coordination, an integrated approach serving national strategies aiming to ensure safe and sustainable pensions, is being proposed and this is the subject of Mr Fatuzzo’s report. We must find out the reason for this type of cooperation and how the objective of safe and sustainable pensions will be achieved. The issues of retirement age, guaranteed rights, the payment of pensions, in other words, retirement conditions, are all the more sensitive as they arise at the end of a lifetime of professional and human endeavours and are a guarantee of positive relations of mutual support between generations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good that Mr Fatuzzo’s report recognises that the debate on pensions must not be restricted to financing problems, but that rights must also be guaranteed. It is also good that he proposes to strengthen the open coordination method by democratic will, involving NGOs, the social partners, the candidate countries and the European Parliament in defining effective indicators and mechanisms with a view to assessing reforms and achieving modernisation. However, the report does support the Commission’s basic plan for a universal pensions system, although it waters them down by asking for collective systems of funded pensions to be promoted over individual financial pension and savings schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know whether that will answer Mrs Van Lancker’s question, but the report basically supports the Commission’s desire to move towards more <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> reserve pension funds and not to use state spending within the framework of compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. Nevertheless, we are all thinking about the Barcelona European Council which called for Member States to raise the retirement age by five years by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the question of financing arises. The development of the contributory system cannot be considered in the new demographic context without an increase in funds. That would be irresponsible. New resources must therefore be found. We believe that there should be greater focus in two areas: the development and creation of quality employment for new contributors, and alongside that, making financial income subject to social security contributions at the same rate as wages and salaries, as advocated by an amendment tabled by my group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report certainly has good points. For instance, I especially welcome the emphasis placed on the link between the labour market and social protection. As long as rigid labour markets prevail in Europe, as long as employment rates, particularly among the youngest and oldest members of the active population, are prevented by corporate and protectionist policies from rising above their current low levels, as long as the labour market is organised in this way, it will be difficult or even impossible to guarantee to today’s and tomorrow’s pensioners conditions which are both dignified and sustainable in the medium and long term.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel, however, that certain points need further emphasis. The issue of pensions is not an easy question to deal with, and it is not one that can be resolved without cost. There are legitimate, quite specific interests involved. There are interests that are protected and interests that are not. On the one hand, we have powerful lobbies – and quite rightly so – including politicians and pensioners who vote, who belong to trade unions, and on the other, we have a lobby which has absolutely no power at all because it does not vote and does not belong to a trade union, namely the younger generations. I feel that the arguments surrounding the issue of pensions are first and foremost – for that is how things are – representative of a battle of interests between generations. At this stage, it is the poorly represented younger generations who are losing the battle, and who should be represented differently in Parliament and, I feel, in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The labour market and pension reforms were intended to avoid the explosion of this intergenerational dispute. There are few guidelines to be followed for the reforms that are necessary, the first certainly being the need to raise the retirement age limit. We are familiar with population trends, life expectancies and the quality of life of elderly people, and so we must not continue to work with pension parameters that were appropriate maybe thirty or forty years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, we need to eliminate corporate privileges and make increasing use of second- and third-tier funded schemes, leaving public welfare expenditure with the sole task of guaranteeing the minimum level. All the rest must be entrusted to funding mechanisms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He reiterated on this occasion that in 2040, there will be more people in the world who are over 60 years old than there will be under fifteen. The forecasts for European demographic change are even more significant, as 40% of the European population will be 65 or over in 2025, according to Eurostat. Therefore, the consequences for the balance of pensions systems, in particular, of this ageing of the population – which is in fact an undeniable sign of progress in terms of health and social aspects – give cause for concern, as the current proportion of four workers to one pensioner will only be two workers to one pensioner in 2030.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the European debate particularly welcomes the Commission’s communication, which aims to guarantee safe and sustainable pensions through an integrated approach to the strategies of the Member States, whose pension schemes, especially state schemes, are managed at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that many countries of the European Union have begun to take bold steps to perpetuate their pensions systems. This is not the case of the French Government, which has not implemented the urgent and essential reforms, and, what is more, the national debate with which we are faced in France is evidence of this.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to point out here, in particular by referring to the Fatuzzo report, is that although the organisation and financing of state pensions must remain the responsibility of the Member States, the open coordination method proposed in this field by the Gothenburg Council should certainly encourage national reforms and enrich them with experiences of other States.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, Commissioner, we look forward to the presentation of the first national plans in the autumn, while insisting once again that the European Parliament should be more closely involved in this procedure. Also from this perspective, unlike others, I am delighted that the Barcelona European Council of 15 and 16 March 2002 committed, on the one hand, to stepping up efforts to provide mature workers with greater possibilities of remaining in the job market, for example by means of flexible gradual retirement programmes and guaranteeing genuine access to education and life-long training, and, on the other, to gradually increasing the average retirement age in the European Union by about five years by 2010. It seems to me that we should be able to offer, in the current context, an approach of free choice, based on employees’ individual careers and their various life stages, which sometimes require them to keep working past retirement age, as obligatory retirement can lead to an immeasurable waste of human resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The main aim of today's report is in fact to investigate how we can help national pension systems achieve the three basic objectives of retaining their capacity to achieve the social objectives which they have set, staying financially viable in the long term and responding to society's changing needs. To put it plainly, they are being asked to adapt without reducing the level of protection or standard of services which they provide. Consequently, as our political group sees it, collective state pensions systems still take priority over purely private systems and are still one of the main ways of redistributing wealth, which is why they must continue to be funded by society as a whole. As I see it, the amendments proposed by the PPE-DE undermine this basis and the balance struck in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. Proposing that only health care and social protection should be funded from the state budget, with workers' pensions paid for solely out of workers' and employers' contributions, does away with any notion of solidarity. Similarly, expecting Member States to include the positive impact which reducing the pension burden on contributions would have on the cost of labour and increasing pro rata contributions would have on auxiliary pension funds in their strategies means, to all intents and purposes, that the entire burden of pensions is shifted on to the workers. On the contrary, the whole point of the reform should be to broaden the base of contributors and extend alternative forms of funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, the proposal to ensure the reforms are democratically legitimate, by giving the European Parliament a more active role in commenting on national strategy reports and indicators to evaluate results and by extending the social dialogue to include representatives of pensioners, non-governmental organisations and women's organisations, is fundamental to the success of the reform process, which is why I feel that Amendment No 17 should be withdrawn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At Barcelona, the Council set itself the objective of increasing the retirement age by five years by 2010, without any conclusion from Parliament or the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the subject, and, most importantly, without taking account of the expectations of the citizens and the social partners, for whom this idea is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, which is not competent to decide on matters of social protection but which, in fact, is exercising this competence in the name of establishing the single market in funded pensions, should play a greater part in extending the public debate on the future of pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">How should this be done? First of all, by noting, as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has done, that this is essentially a social challenge with financial aspects, and not the other way round. Second, this challenge will only be taken up if we accept that the determining factor will be the employment rate rather than population ageing. We already knew that pension funds do not affect the key choices that have to be made by society: what is this question? What is this choice? What proportion of overall wealth do we want to allocate to pensioners?</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, we upheld the contributory pension system as a collective system of inter-generational support that creates a social link. Now, we should be completely immune to capitalisation, in view of the Enron affair and the situation of British insurers who are begging their clients to use contributory pension services.</p>
<p class="contents">For many companies, employment remains a factor in cost adjustment. The oldest workers, who are also the best paid, often pay the price of company exclusion policies.

<p class="contents">It is certainly important, as stated by the rapporteur, Mr Fatuzzo, that we guarantee the right to adequate pensions, regardless of the problem of financing, and avoid the risk of making workers and pensioners responsible for any imbalances in pension systems, since maintaining a fair system is more a problem of distribution than of demographics. It is, therefore, important that we guarantee a public and universal social security system, which is able to combat poverty and maintain a satisfactory standard of living for all pensioners, as we proposed in the amendments we tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not acceptable that, on the pretext of the budgetary consolidation stipulated in the Stability Pact, we move towards laying down rules and recommendations which, in practice, threaten the right to pensions that enable pensioners to lead a dignified and independent life and to participate in social and cultural activities. Hence the importance of expanding the base of contributors, of exploring alternative forms of financing statutory pension systems, for example, by extending social contributions to financial profits, and by conducting a thorough review of some legislative initiatives, specifically the directive on the activities and prudential supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision.</p>
<p class="contents">Of equal concern is the approach outlined by the Council in the conclusions of the Barcelona Summit, proposing a progressive increase of around five years in the effective average age at which people stop working in the European Union by 2010. We are opposed to any attempt by the Member States to take the Council conclusion to be a starting point for increasing the legal retirement age or for extending the periods in which contributions are made in order to acquire full pension rights. We therefore hope that the proposals we tabled are approved so as to improve the content of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When he first came into this House and made his maiden speech, he spoke about the rights of pensioners and the duty that each of us had towards them for the future. A lot of people derided him or laughed at him because of what he had said. However, all I can say to Mr Fatuzzo is: <span class="italic">"veni, vidi, vici"</span>. The issue of pensions, future contributions and necessity of securing pensions, is partly financial, no matter what anybody says. Of course, first and foremost, we have a social obligation and social concern for the most vulnerable within our society. Unless we put in place a proper financial model and basis for securing universal pensions for all, the system is bound to fail because of demographics and other priorities that may arise.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that each of us has to come to this debate and to this argument from the basis of guaranteeing maximum opportunities for employment, maximum opportunities for social protection and maximum opportunities for forward-planning with regard to pension needs. Many people have spoken about how best we can deal with this. I would point Members to the example of Ireland, my own country, where over recent years, we have been putting aside one percent of gross national product to deal with future public pension provision for the year 2025 and onwards. We do not have the same demographic problem in Ireland as there would be other countries, but we have taken that decision now, even though at the moment we could use the money for other things: infrastructure and so on. But we have given that commitment. That is one of the issues that has to be looked at: making a tough long-term political choice rather than a short-term political choice with regard to how we use funding.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point I will make, Mr President, is that I agree with the rapporteur when he says that the pension system should include individualisation of pensions, social security and taxation systems. However, we should be opposed to a harmonised and uniform system across the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my view, the stereotype of old age has itself become old and outdated. It bears no relation to contemporary society. If asked to think of someone aged 60 or 65, one does not conjure up a picture of a decrepit individual whose physical and mental capacities are significantly impaired. That longer life span, extending well beyond the age of 65, represents a considerable achievement as regards culture, society, health and economics. Nonetheless, this achievement may become a problem if we fail to appreciate its deeper meaning and adapt accordingly. It is important to take advantage of its full potential.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said that ageing is the most far-reaching social phenomenon of the beginning of this century. As Mrs Hermange already stated, the ratio between the potentially active population and that over the age of 65, currently 4 to 1 in many Member States, will become 2 to 1 towards the year 2050. It is essential to adjust to such changes so as to minimise their negative aspects. Achievements in the areas of culture, society, health and economics mean senior citizens should be able to enjoy a good quality of life at that age too, and society should benefit from their experience and wisdom. It will therefore be necessary to provide for a combination of public pensions and offer older people the opportunity to work if they so wish. Flexible working patterns and equal opportunities are very important in this connection and need to be promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">Women often work on a part-time basis, or may have done so in the past. Sometimes they join the labour force later in life, or return to it after perhaps bringing up a family. I believe the best approach is an open method of coordination. This makes it possible to approximate legislation on social matters between Member States. It also makes it possible to ensure that these people do not endure poverty at that stage of their lives. In addition, it facilitates mobility by recognising that pensions can be exported, as stated just recently at the Barcelona Council. Further, it also allows the skills of the so-called third age to be put to good use through social ventures and voluntary work, though not exclusively in these areas. Above all, it means senior citizens can be encouraged to be actively involved in the workplace, by promoting the policy of gender equality, as I said earlier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At this very moment, the second United Nations World Assembly on Ageing is taking place in Madrid. I therefore congratulate Mr Fatuzzo on having drafted this report, which highlights just how crucial it is that we come up with a solution to the problem of the future sustainability of pensions systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is facing an enormous challenge in the forthcoming decades as a result of the increased ageing of the population, which is related to the falling birth rate and to greater life expectancy. The ageing of the population and the reduction in the number of people of working age requires innovative and effective policies to be drafted and implemented. It is crucial that the Member States of the European Union undertake a speedy reform of their pension schemes, which will require changes in the organisation of labour, the creation of more and better jobs, specifically for older people, and a redrafting of demographic, birth and immigration policies.</p>
<p class="contents">If it takes too long to implement these reforms, as the rapporteur states, the European social model and the growth and economic stability of the European Union will suffer serious consequences. In this field, one of the most important measures is the promotion of policies that foster the idea of active ageing; in other words, every citizen must have the option to retire or to remain in the labour market on a full or part-time basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Incentives must therefore be provided for later retirement, lifelong learning must be promoted and health systems must be improved. Legislation regulating social security systems falls within the sole competence of the Member States, as we all know, which explains the considerable differences between these systems. The importance of this issue and its economic and social effects, however, require a global approach and global strategies. The European Union must, therefore, play a leading role in supporting national strategies, by means of an open method of coordination, setting common objectives and working methods, and by promoting the exchange of experiences and of good practices in addition to undertaking an ongoing and coherent evaluation of the progress that has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect that should be emphasised is the considerable proportion of elderly people in the Member States who are victims of poverty and social exclusion. Pension schemes must contribute to eliminating such problems and to maintaining standards of living that are worthy of the third age. Lastly, I feel obliged to state that current pension schemes are particularly unfavourable to women, and the Member States must, therefore, give priority to gender equality and European legislation that effectively guarantees the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of gender in pension schemes must be promoted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And the size of the challenge is matched by our responsibility at European and national level to achieve these targets and reform our pension systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Commissioner, supports your efforts to highlight the importance of these reforms and their financial as well as their social implications and it supports the initiatives being taken to coordinate pension policies through joint objectives, joint working methods and joint monitoring and evaluation of the progress made. We maintain that these policies must be cohesive and must complement coordinated policies on employment, social exclusion and poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Because these policies are so sweeping and so important to Europe both now and in the future, they have to be democratic and they have to increase the involvement of the social partners and of social and regional agencies and women's organisations because these social reforms are particularly important to women; and, come what way, the method of open coordination must guarantee that the European Parliament is fully involved. But that alone is not enough. The reforms needed will only be viable if they are supported by the whole of society. Public opinion is unprepared and uninformed. I think the European Commission urgently needs to organise information campaigns in liaison with the national governments and social partners. This is particularly important in Member States which have neglected or do not have the courage to implement suitable reforms and in order to prepare the candidate countries.</p>

That, though, is the fault of – among other things – the over 200 amendments that our rapporteur had to deal with, the final result of which is the interminable resolution containing the relevant and the irrelevant along with, unfortunately, several contradictions and repetitions.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite that, this report is important because we indeed do not want to be left out of the European dialogue on safe pensions, not least because of the effects that unsustainable pension schemes could have on the value of the euro, quite apart from the pensioners' standard of living. If the euro is weak, we all suffer from it. Time means that I must, unfortunately, limit myself to a few fundamental principles. One is that, even if the decision-makers at national level retain responsibility for pension systems, it is still for the EU to call on them to introduce in due time reforms to secure the long-term sustainability of their systems, in order to guarantee pensions that are adequate and safe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that one should also welcome the Commission's effort to monitor and promote these processes of reform through more in-depth cooperation between the Member States and on the basis of an open method of coordination. We can agree to the three guidelines on safe and sustainable pensions, as endorsed at Gothenburg. We may therefore expect the Member States to help to bring about a consensus capable of sustaining them in the solution of their common problems. We know that reforms of the pension systems have been introduced too hesitantly in various Member States, because they shrink from politically unpopular decisions. We therefore hope that the non-binding method of open coordination can contribute to the setting of common objectives and to speedily turning these into national policies.</p>
<p class="contents">As a woman – and, having been the youngest Member by far in 1965, I have since, unfortunately, become the oldest female in this House – I of course welcome the call, in the communication from the Commission, for pension systems to be examined with a view to their modernisation, with priority being given to the removal from all three pillars of all existing discrimination on the grounds of gender. That should have been done long ago in view of the directives from the 1970s on the equal treatment of women and men, which are still current. The Member States must of course ensure that women, and also house-husbands, who are for family reasons not represented in the labour market, as well as spouses who help out in family businesses, get opportunities to accrue individual pension entitlements. I would like to make particular reference to the spouses helping in businesses; there is a report on them by me dating back to 1995, and the Commission has still not yet responded to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, if you would allow me, as the oldest woman in this House, to say something further, it will be to those who have today resisted the idea that we, in view of our longer life expectancy should, of course, be able voluntarily to work for longer. I would like to add to that that they should perhaps take me as an example of how work and commitment are excellent ways of preventing premature ageing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Lulling represents my older female colleagues here, whereas I am the youngest female member of the PPE-DE Group. I can fully endorse what Mrs Lulling said in her speech just now. This shows that there is no generation gap in the European Parliament at least.</p>
<p class="contents">If the post of EU liaison officer for senior citizens were to be created the rapporteur, our colleague, Carlo Fatuzzo, would be the most likely candidate for the job. I am sure that young people in Finland, at least, would support his election. The way in which he devotes himself to his work is unequalled.</p>
<p class="contents">Pleasantries aside, however, Mr Fatuzzo has focused his efforts on defending the interests of senior citizens in Europe. For several decades he has had professional experience of elderly people’s issues, which is also evident from this thorough and very professionally prepared report. The report is based on significant social phenomena. The growth in the number of pensioners, which is due to increased life expectancy and relatively early retirement, will eat away at the funding of the present pension schemes unless essential and sufficiently radical reforms are implemented in good time.</p>
<p class="contents">We need solutions at both national and Union level. There are such considerable differences between pension systems in the various Member States that the responsibility for regulating the organisation and funding of statutory pensions must be that of the Member States alone in the future also.</p>
<p class="contents">At Union level we can participate, instead, in defusing the pensions bomb by promoting the development of cross-border personal pension and savings schemes. Firstly, these will be sustainable in terms of their financing; secondly, they will provide the capital companies need in the form of investments; and thirdly, they will serve the changing needs of individuals better than universal statutory schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Member States are shrinking from making the decisions necessary for all this to come about. The drafting of the directives on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision in particular has been painfully slow. It is hardly far-sighted to bury one’s head in the sand. Like my colleagues, I too urge the Council to face up to the challenges of our population growth at long last and take the necessary decisions, while Spain still holds the Presidency, that would enable institutions that offer supplementary occupational pensions to operate constructively in our internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The guarantee of a secure old age has played a key role in different cultures throughout the ages and all over the world. Care of the elderly is a yardstick of a civilised society. Making the decisions in good time is above all in the interests of the younger generation as every wasted day increases the costs of reform and aggravates the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I add my own congratulations to Mr Fatuzzo and his own way of pressing the needs of pensioners. Pensioners across Europe have reason to be grateful to him for the work he has done.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue that tends to be raised most with the Committee on Petitions is increasingly that of people who in their working lives exercise their right to move across and work in various countries in Europe and then retire elsewhere. I well remember the case of a German citizen, married to a French woman, who had spent much of his working life in Belgium, had then retired to Spain and wanted to know who was going to help him in filling in his pension claim forms. There was also an Italian citizen who worked much of his time in Luxembourg and then retired to Italy. He pointed out that the arrangements (in place at the time) made it possible to accumulate benefits, but nevertheless penalised migrant workers who found themselves having to deal with any number of national pension schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">In another case earlier this year we considered a petition from a British citizen, on behalf of 40,000 British pensioners living in Spain, who complained that the British Government was refusing to pay them the winter fuel allowance. His argument was that it was paid to all pensioners living in Britain, regardless of means, regardless of how cold or warm it was in the part of Britain they lived in. I represent the Isle of Wight – the sunniest part of the United Kingdom – but the same winter fuel allowance is paid to people living in the cold north of Scotland; the British Government refused to pay this to the UK citizens in Spain. These citizens appealed to the European Parliament and I am delighted to say that as a result of that petition, the winter fuel allowance is now to be paid to British pensioners wherever they live. The point I make is that British pensioners have to look to the British Government, German pensioners to the German Government and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not disagree that it is the responsibility of national governments, but the point that needs to be made, is that more and more thousands of citizens who are pensioners, who work in different countries in Europe, will retire to different countries in Europe. It is very important that the Member States that have responsibility for pension schemes bear in mind the needs of citizens who use their European rights to work and retire in different countries of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is quite beyond dispute that the EU needs to be active in this area as well as in others and to make its contribution to a possible solution of these problems, but it must do this within the framework of the legal bases in the Treaty establishing the European Community. Social security systems differ very widely from one EU Member State to another. More so than nearly all other legislative areas, they have grown from historic roots and have therefore evaded harmonisation of any kind at the European level.</p>
<p class="contents">My criticism is directed at the method of so-called open coordination for pensions that the Council has introduced, a method that the Fatuzzo report welcomes. This procedure would lead to the European Union appropriating for itself, without any basis in the Treaties and, so to speak, cold-bloodedly, a legislative authority that belongs to nations. Council resolutions cause Member States to subject themselves to ever more restrictive and more detailed demands, the result being a quasi-legal obligation and liability. We have, indeed, already been able to observe this development in the area of policy on the labour market and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in favour of a clear demarcation of legislative competences between the EU and the Member States, that being the only way to guarantee the citizens of Europe comprehensibility and transparency, in short, legal clarity. In addition, the most fatal side effect of what is termed open coordination is that the only institution of the European Union to have any democratic legitimacy, namely Parliament, is completely sidelined. The Council has announced the extension of open coordination to other highly sensitive areas such as health provision and care for the elderly. It is therefore high time for Parliament to show the Council where the lines are drawn and take a position on this, above all in defence of its own interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The CSU delegation within the European People's Party, because of its substantial misgivings about open coordination, will not be voting in favour of the Fatuzzo report. I would like to see wide-ranging discussion on this issue in Parliament in the future – with specific reference too to the legislative work of the Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Fatuzzo for his report and to express my admiration for his enthusiasm and staying power on the subject of the reform of pensions systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Monetary Union and the increasingly integrated economic policies of the Member States of the European Union undeniably give all policies a European dimension, even policies which were strictly national until just a few years ago. In December, both the ECOFIN and the Social Affairs Council agreed on joint objectives and working methods for pensions. The fact that both Councils – both ECOFIN and the Social Affairs and Employment Council – are taking an equally categorical and focused approach to the issue of pensions is an important political step. As we have said time and again in this Chamber, this is not an economic issue, it is a social issue with economic implications.</p>
<p class="contents">In today's report, Parliament has, I think, put an optimistic foot forward on the road to cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, a new, ambitious programme of cooperation on the subject of pensions. The Commission presented its report on pensions in June 2001. Let me reiterate what transpires from both the Commission report and the European Parliament report, because I think it is important. Pension systems cannot be reformed in a vacuum. This issue does not impinge on just one type of legislation. It impinges on a set of policies whose repercussions will be felt by the pension systems. I need only mention policies to resolve Europe's demographic problem. The demographic problem was initially aired at the Madrid conference on the ageing population, which discussed the twin problems of the rise in life expectancy and the European countries' inability to make up their populations.</p>
<p class="contents">A second important chapter is employment and I would remind you of the important steps taken by the European Council on specific objectives and on the involvement of older workers in the job market. There is an important point to be made here. We cannot simply focus on increasing age limits, justified as they are by the rise in life expectancy and economic problems. No, that is not enough. We also need to present and implement a set of policies to keep and motivate older workers to stay in the job market. It is extremely difficult for people over 50 to stay in or find work in numerous industries in the private sector. So we need investment and specific policies in the employment sector to train these people and to ensure that the education system and the training system commit to specific quotas for older people.</p>
<p class="contents">Policies on poverty and social exclusion also need to be mentioned here. Several Members defined the connection between policies on poverty and the reform of the pensions systems and the Commission is currently working on new indicators for pension adequacy in relation to data on poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the question of pensions is, of course, a question of national policy; in numerous countries it is a question of regional policy. The European Union has no desire – and it would, I think, be impossible – to intervene in national systems or issue guidelines as to which is the best system and which is the worst. However, it is clear, both for reasons of mobility – several members referred to numerous new problems with worker mobility in the European Union – and because there are common causes for the problem of viability, that there is a need for cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">This need appears to be met by the method of open cooperation. This method is a new tool which we have tried in policies on employment and policies on poverty and exclusion and now we are really putting it to the test with pensions. Are there democratic lacunae? Indeed there are! Is there more room for cooperation with Parliament? Indeed there is!</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, if I may, to reiterate where exactly the European Parliament fits into the method of open cooperation on employment. Every year Parliament's presence is more keenly felt, greater account is taken of its proposals and it has a very important role in the application in question. The cooperation method on pensions has only just begun. In September, the Member States will submit their first reports. Parliament will be able to contribute to the Commission's joint report. And may I say I have no objection to sending all the reports to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, so that we can really work together right from the start.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, two issues with a European and a specific dimension. The first is the dimension of gender equality which, because of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and European legislation, have to be mainstreamed in all reforms. The second, as has quite rightly been stressed, is that enlargement and the candidate countries must be included in any plans. The conference which you have organised in May with authorities from the candidate countries is a good starting point for cooperation, given that the candidate countries will have to take part in this joint exercise in two years' time.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the agreed joint report with its three basic lines of approach and eleven points which all the countries must use as a basis for reform contains two important victories: the first is that the economic and social dimensions sit side by side and the second is that it gives maximum European added value to national policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
