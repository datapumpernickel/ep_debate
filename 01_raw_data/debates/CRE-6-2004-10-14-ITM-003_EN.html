<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morgantini (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> I hope that today’s debate will only mark the beginning of a useful and necessary collaboration between institutions and between committees of this Parliament on a question of the greatest importance for the Committee on Development, a committee that I have the honour – not too greatly merited perhaps – to chair, and which I am representing today.</p>
<p class="contents">Since its creation in 1971, the Generalised System of Preferences has become an essential instrument of the development policy of the European Union. I should also like to emphasise the good name that accrues to the European Community, in that it was the first to put this system into practice from 1971 and today, in actual fact, it is still the major donor in terms of trade concessions to developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In examining the Commission communication, we started from a principle according to which the main objective of the Generalised System of Preferences is, and must above all continue to be, the economic and social development of those countries, pursued in the spirit of international solidarity that should govern the foreign policy of the Union. In this context, we welcome the objectives put in place by the communication, namely the simplification of the regimes, the concentration of preferences on those developing countries that need them most and, above all, the promotion of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">We are fully cognisant that in order to attain these objectives the current system will have to undergo substantial reform. We cannot, however, ignore the fact that any change to the current system will have considerable effects in the countries that currently benefit from that system. There will be favourable effects but also, as representatives of various countries have pointed out, adverse effects. It is for this reason that the European Parliament has wished to make its voice heard from the very beginning of the reform process, namely to take note of the concerns, the opinions and the points of view of stakeholder countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that this democratic necessity is even more essential and important at this time, when the Commission has, to tell the truth, most regrettably not consulted adequately with interested parties before formulating its proposals. One must take into account, on the other hand, that the Council did take the opportunity to consult the European Parliament at its last meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">The opinions I am expressing today, as Chairman of the Committee on Development, are therefore only preliminary opinions, but they also appear in the motion that all the political groups have deemed it advisable to sign. Hence I trust that today’s debate will nevertheless help to clarify the issue and above all will allow the Commission to include some of our demands in the regulation that must be adopted by the Commissioners probably on 20 October. Consequently, I should wish to request the Commission to reply to the questions that we have posed in our examination.</p>
<p class="contents">In detail, there are three issues on which I should like to insist: the graduation mechanism, the functioning of GSP+ and the reform of the system of rules of origin. With regard to the first, while we welcome the simplification of the graduation mechanism, the fact that the Commission is proposing to base it exclusively on the criterion of market share, leaving aside any indicators of development and poverty, almost fills us with dismay. We cannot overlook the fact that these arrangements could have very negative consequences for major exporters. Without being necessarily hostile, we should therefore like to join the Commission and the Council in studying the consequences and the modality of this proposal in great detail in the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the new GSP+ system, which we consider to be of benefit, given that it supports sustainable development, it seems essential to us, however, to define criteria that are clear, reliable and at the same time realistic. We should like to see a firm commitment by the Commission to supply the necessary technical assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to stress that one of the obstacles to an efficient use of the system has, as we know, been the system of rules of origin. That is why we welcome a substantial reform of the system which favours regional expansion, although we hope that good intentions will result in concrete initiatives: a proposal, therefore, and an examination of the systems applied by other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall stop here, aware that I have highlighted only a few aspects of this difficult subject, but that is all I can do in the time allotted to me. As for the rest, I very much want to hear my dear fellow Member, Mr Barón Crespo, Chairman of the Committee on International Trade, and, of course, my other fellow Members, as well as the replies – which I trust will be detailed – that the Commission and the Council may possibly provide. I truly hope that we can have a fruitful collaboration that can yield positive results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, it is normal amongst parliamentary committees to fight for competences but, in this case, I believe that working together is a good omen for this new term in office.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the Commission – in relation to the Communication it has presented on the Generalised System of Preferences –I would like to add to Mrs Morgatini’s positive assessment with the following observations:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we believe it would be very useful – and this can be done when the proposal for a Regulation is presented – for there to be an assessment of the functioning of the system, for us to work on the basis of more than ten years experience and for the interested parties to be consulted. I believe this would be useful for everybody, including the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the general elements of the Communication, I would like to point out firstly that if we want the GSP to make a greater and better contribution to the development of the neediest countries, the commercial preferences must reflect the comparative advantages and export interests of those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that the preferences cover more products and, above all, that a significant number of products currently considered sensitive be transferred to the non-sensitive category. To this end, we must consider the possibility of broadening the preferential margin.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would also like to say that our committees are pleased with the Commission’s determination to improve and simplify the system of rules of origin. I would urge the Commission to promote an accumulation of trans-regional origin and to move towards harmonising the rules of origin systems in the various existing commercial agreements and systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, please allow me to refer to the new single system of additional preferences – known as GSP+. Although the creation of this new system responds, at least in part, to the need to dismantle the current ‘Drug System’ following the decision of the WTO panel, I believe it is very important to ensure that the current beneficiaries of the system enjoy a reasonable transitional period in order to meet the new requirements that the GSP+ imposes on them, so that they are not suddenly faced with the loss of preferences which they very much need and which they have justly deserved until now.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to guaranteeing a reasonable degree of transparency and democratic control, I would ask the Commission and the Council to begin a process of consultation on the first Regulation on the application of the new GSP sufficiently in advance for the associated countries, the non-governmental agents and the institutions of the European Union – including the European Parliament first and foremost – to participate and be adequately consulted. In this regard, I believe the Council’s conclusions approved in Luxembourg on 11 October are positive, since they refer to the need for explicit consultation with Parliament, thus going further than what is currently laid down in the Treaties. I hope that both Mr Lamy and Mr Nicolaï will make a firm commitment in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end my speech, Mr President, by highlighting the presence here today of Commissioner Lamy, which is an example – perhaps the last example – of his excellent willingness to cooperate with this House. As you all know, Mr Lamy has been an enthusiastic interlocutor with Parliament throughout the last term in office and a defender of joint work. Since I do not know whether I will have another opportunity to do so, I will end by inviting my fellow Members to join me in thanking the Commissioner for his excellent work on the Trade portfolio and in particular for the spirit of cooperation he has demonstrated in his work as Commissioner. <span class="italic">Monsieur Lamy, je vous souhaite des succès dans votre prochaine reincarnation </span>[Mr Lamy, I wish you every success in your next reincarnation].</p>

Like the honourable Members of this House, the Council welcomes the Commission’s communication on developing countries, international trade and sustainable development, the role of the Community’s Generalised System of Preferences for the period 2006-2015 and, above all, the general objective outlined therein. The GSP should be stable, predictable, objective, simple, transparent and compatible with the WTO, and it must take account of the developing countries’ specific needs. The Council backs the Commission’s efforts towards a comprehensive simplification of the GSP, the general objective of which is to help the developing countries drive back poverty and promote sustainable development. For that purpose, the countries eligible for GSP must be selected on the basis of objective development criteria. Like the European Parliament, the Council notes that further information is required about implementation before a definitive position can be adopted, so that it can, at this stage, say only a few words about the basic principles that are explained in the Commission’s communication. As is stated in the Council’s and Commission’s declaration about the European Community’s development policy, the Council takes the view that the common trade policy can lend force to the objectives of the development policy, with specific reference to the eradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development, of which the fight against drugs forms an integral component. Preferential access to the markets of the developed countries is a contributory factor in the economic development of the developing countries and helps to integrate them into the global economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to address a number of specific questions raised by the honourable Members of this House, and I should like to start with the GSP+. The Council is prepared to give favourable consideration to the GSP+ proposal. The substantial preferential rights conferred by GSP+ encourage developing countries to abide by treaties in the areas of human rights, labour rights, the environment and good governance, of which the fight against drugs forms an important component. However, a number of crucial aspects still need to be addressed, including a list of relevant treaties, the question of which treaties will be compulsory, the conditions and procedures for awarding and withdrawing the GSP+, fourthly, the monitoring systems that will be used; fifthly, any additional criteria which are tied in with the beneficiaries’ development needs, and, finally, the possible transitional regulation for the beneficiaries of the present incentive regulations which are unlikely to qualify for the GSP. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It consists of granting preferential tariffs, or reductions in customs duties, to nearly 180 developing countries, on the basis of general principles which we revise every ten years. As it encourages European importers to source supplies from these countries, the Generalised System of Preferences is in fact an aid to development through trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The system which was adopted ten years ago will expire in late 2005, and in 2006 a new ten-year cycle will begin. This is why I presented a Commission communication to the Council and to Parliament last July, the aim of which was to outline the general principles which will act as a basis for implementing legislation during this new period. This legislation will in turn provide a framework for Council regulations, and it will be possible to revise these regulations every three years in order to adapt them to economic realities, if experience shows that these have changed.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is the most generous partner by a long way with regard to trade preferences, and nearly EUR 53 billion of trade flows benefit from them, without mentioning the ACP regime. These figures mean that we exceed by a long way all the other countries in this field, as only USD 17 billion of trade flows benefit from preferences granted by the United States, which is the second largest donor. In addition, we are all aware that the EU’s enlargement to include ten new Member States can only increase its superiority in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mrs Morgantini and Mr Barón Crespo, the results produced by the GSP have been evaluated, and we have been provided with all the figures which are currently available. The evaluation shows that, broadly speaking, the system has produced positive results, but that there is still room for improvement. Be that as it may, the system has produced positive results; for example, the latest definitive figures available show that, between 2000 and 2002, our imports under this system grew from EUR 47 billion to EUR 53 billion, which is a significant growth, especially as certain products were removed from the GSP list for technical reasons. Similarly, the GSP utilisation rate, or the ratio of trade flows which are theoretically eligible for GSP to imports which actually benefit from GSP, has regularly increased over the past few years, and currently stands at nearly 55%. These are therefore the positive aspects, which demonstrate that the system works.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast, the current incentive regimes, and in particular all matters relating to the application of the social and environmental clauses, have had little success, as only two beneficiary countries, Sri Lanka and Moldova, which are not exactly giants of global trade, benefit from the social clause. We should take these experiences into account, and the objectives of the Commission’s proposed reform are therefore to make the system of preferences simpler, more generous, more targeted at the countries which need it and more objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the system must be made simpler. Why? Because a simpler system will be more targeted at developing countries and at operators in these countries who need security. This is why we propose moving from a five-pillar system, which is what we have at present, to a three-pillar system. The five pillars include the general arrangements, the social clause, the environmental clause, the drugs regime and the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative, which is in force for the least advanced countries. I propose a move from five pillars to three; general arrangements will be kept in place, and the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative will exist for the least advanced countries. There will also be an intermediary regime called GSP Plus, which will encourage sustainable development in all its aspects, including those relating to social, environmental and good governance issues and to the fight against drugs. GSP Plus will abolish customs duties for beneficiary countries which have committed themselves to ratifying and applying the main international conventions in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">Which conventions would this involve? We propose choosing conventions which are, so to speak, ‘unquestioned’ in the international arena, such as the United Nations pacts on political, economic, social and cultural rights, the International Labour Organisation’s fundamental Conventions, or the United Nations Convention against Corruption. Accession to some of these conventions will be mandatory in order for countries to benefit from GSP Plus, for example the two United Nations pacts, the eight International Labour Organisation Conventions, conventions against racial discrimination or that concerning women and all conventions relating to torture, children’s rights and genocide. We will of course demand that these conventions be ratified, and indeed not merely ratified but also applied effectively – this in response to Mrs Morgantini’s second comment. We expect there to be a two-fold evaluation in this area, the first being carried out when applications are assessed, as access to GSP Plus will be refused to beneficiary countries which make no commitments in this field. The second evaluation will consist of asking the competent international organisations to carry out some kind of evaluation of the application of each convention. A country such as Belarus, for example, whatever progress it makes with ratifying these conventions, could not at present be eligible. So much for conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">The system will therefore be simpler, and also more generous. Why more generous? Because customs duties are frequently eroded during multilateral trade negotiations, which means that the comparative advantage for countries benefiting from the system of preferences is also eroded. We must therefore compensate for this tariff erosion if we wish to maintain the benefits gained by developing countries from the GSP, and we propose extending the coverage of the GSP to include a certain number of new products, so that this tariff erosion is compensated by a growth of the export base. We are in the process of discussing this growth within the Commission, with a new deadline next week, and this is a point to which I shall return. We will deal with issues which are difficult, delicate and sensitive, but upon which we wish to make progress, as is the case with fisheries products.</p>
<p class="contents">Still on the subject of a greater generosity, and in response to Mrs Morgantini’s third comment, we intend to put forward proposals to adapt the rules of origin. As has been shown in a large number of studies, the rules of origin are a necessary condition for access to trade preferences. The conditions which we impose with regard to the origin of products do not exist in order to take with the left hand what we give with the right, but in order to guarantee that preferences actually benefit the country at which we are targeting them, and not others instead. In order to achieve this, conditions regulating origin and checks of origin are required.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, it is true that the rules in force today were drawn up several decades ago, at a time when the European Union was more defensive in its trade policy than is the case today. We must therefore adjust them in order to move away from the old system and to take into account the fact that processes today have changed. For example, in the context of globalisation and international division, as a result of which production processes have been splintered among different countries, renewed attention must be paid to the issue of whether there should be a cumulation of origin between the country from which the goods originate and certain countries from which other inputs used in the manufacture of the same goods may come. It is therefore in this spirit that we intend to put forward proposals, following the Green Paper which we published with Mr Bolkestein late last year. For example, and as just suggested by Mr Barón Crespo, research could be carried out into ways in which the system could be relaxed in order to encourage the regional integration of countries benefiting from preferences.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform’s third objective is to target preferences at the countries which need them most. This is clearly a politically sensitive issue, as there will be winners and losers as a result of any reform of this kind. We intend to target the system of preferences at the beneficiary countries which need it most, which in reality means the smallest developing countries, those which are landlocked and those which are the most vulnerable, and not the large countries which already occupy positions of increasing significance in international trade, such as China’s position in the international textile and clothing trade. We will of course keep the ‘Everything But Arms’ system in place for the poorest countries, as trade integration under this system is one of the characteristic features of the EU’s development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as limiting the criteria, we will therefore also need to continue helping a certain number of countries to gain access to our market and, once they have done so, to follow this up with a system of graduation. Quite simply, and in response to Mrs Morgantini’s first comment, we wish to carry out a radical simplification of the graduation system in order to meet the requirements of the World Trade Organisation, following cases against India on the drugs regime which were heard before WTO panels and which we lost at least partially. Our response on this issue will be to target graduation at the idea of competitiveness of beneficiary products. The key criterion will be market share, and the trigger for graduation will be a given percentage of imports into the Community. From the moment when a developing country achieves a certain share of the market in the European Union, we will consider that we have done what is necessary to help it export and that, to use a metaphor, the country can now fly with its own wings. Where will the threshold lie? It is still a little early to give you any figures, as we are in the process of discussing the issue within the Commission. This will clearly have consequences for the countries concerned. That said, I can already assure you that whatever the final figure we choose, it will be the very large exporter countries which could be affected, and not the majority of our beneficiaries, of which there are a total of 180, as I just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point upon which I wish to speak, Mr President, is in response to the oral questions. I understand from Mrs Morgantini’s speech that she is concerned that this House should be able to express its opinion fully on this new project. It goes without saying that we hope that this House will give its opinion, as this reform is important both from the point of view of development and from that of trade policy, and I should like to thank Mr Barón Crespo for his comments on the work of this Commission, in particular in its relations with Parliament, an aspect which will remain unchanged. It is quite simply the case that we have a number of time constraints, to which I referred very recently when I spoke before the parliamentary committee which is responsible for such issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we could not begin this reform before the arrival of the new Member States last May. It is absolutely essential that we involve them in a decision which will be binding upon the Union until 2015. Secondly, it was necessary to wait for the decision on a dispute brought before the WTO, namely the proceedings instituted against us by India with regard to the drugs regime. This decision was taken in April 2004, and it was then that we were able to start in-depth work.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, as this reform is to enter into force on 1 January 2006, it should be completed one year earlier if possible. Why one year earlier? In order to allow beneficiary countries and economic operators to adapt to it. This means that the first implementing regulation should be adopted during the next few months. Next week, on 20 October, I will present it to my colleagues, and it will be available to you immediately afterwards. I am aware and I understand that Parliament requires a certain amount of time; we will of course do all that we can to ensure that it has this time, and, as you know, our staff is entirely at your disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">To put it in simple terms, the goal is to help developing countries to export goods to us. These are developing countries and, by definition, they need more time than others to adjust to rules which can sometimes be complicated, even if the system we are putting in place will be a simplified one. My feelings are therefore that they will need at least nine to ten months, and this is the message I would like to convey to this House. I am sure that those of you who are committed to the system for development policy reasons will understand my concern on this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the European Union, we have established millennium objectives for development and have committed to those. They are, above all, focused on fighting poverty. The economic development is a key condition in this respect, and so we think it is upon this that the revision should focus. It is unfortunate that we need to do this under time pressure now that the complaint lodged by India with the WTO has been declared founded.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group is of the opinion – one fortunately shared by the Commissioner – that, firstly, the poorest countries should not become poorer still. In those cases where preferences have been eroded by lowering the rates for most-favoured nations, we would therefore ask the Commission to consider what else could be done. Secondly, we think that the system of graduation must meet its objective that the only countries or sectors to be excluded should be those that are already operating sufficiently competitively within the market and thus no longer need the GSP. Also, it is our view that good governance should certainly be given a place in the new GSP+. Finally, revision should also mean that the countries for which the GSP+ is specifically designed could make more use of it. What should become the most important instrument is being used only for 52%, or 55%, as the Commissioner stated a moment ago. This increase is positive, but the result is not yet satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two questions for the Commission. The idea behind the GSP’s revision is sound and clear; the intention is to create a simpler, more transparent and more objective system, and here, it goes without saying, we are completely behind the Commission. What is less clear is how exactly this can be achieved. For example, how does the Commission aim to prevent the planned GSP+ regulation, which admittedly will become one single regulation, from not becoming too complex in terms of implementation, adherence and control so that there is in practice too little of the proposed simplification and transparency? The other question, which has already been raised, concerns assessment. According to the communication, there is no assessment, or no sound assessment at any rate, a statement denied by both Mr Mandelson and Mr Lamy. If this assessment is available, could Parliament have this without delay? Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Against a background of trade globalisation, the reform demonstrates the will of the European Union to make market laws subject to the development objectives of the poorest countries and to human rights objectives, as well as testifying to our ambition to make globalisation more moral.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, a thorough evaluation must be carried out of the previous system, and in particular of its impact on the goal of poverty reduction. The complex and partial nature of agreements has sometimes made it impossible to achieve any kind of overview of the way in which the system works, especially as the close relations between exporting countries and certain multinational companies have prevented a thorough evaluation of the system’s impact. The Commission’s proposal to simplify the system is therefore to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to emphasise how important it is to clarify the conditions according to which preferential tariffs are granted, in particular with regard to respect for core labour standards. The need to promote core labour standards goes well beyond relations between poor nations and rich nations. Two conditions must be fulfilled in order to ensure that the system is as meaningful and effective as possible; industrialised countries must naturally be prepared to comply with it, but beneficiary developing nations must also take advantage of it to reduce inequalities within their countries and to improve living and working conditions for their populations. The way to achieve this, of course, is to incorporate criteria and conditions into the system which guarantee respect for workers’ rights and for the human rights conventions to which you referred. In this respect, it is essential that a distinction be made between the ratification of international conventions and their effective application. All our attention must be directed towards ensuring that future regulations clearly indicate the need for beneficiary countries both to have ratified international conventions on core labour standards and to apply them effectively and in full. Procedures for evaluating these two aspects must therefore also be laid down.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst on the subject of procedures, why should social partners not be involved in these evaluations by means of consultations? This would provide a guarantee that the experience and practical knowledge held by trade unions in the field of core labour standards would be put to use. More specifically, the European Union should endeavour to promote a greater effectiveness of the instruments of the International Labour Organisation, for example by the possible opening of enquiries to monitor respect for core labour standards under the GSP procedure.</p>

It follows that any change to the system has crucial implications for everyone concerned. The livelihoods of many producers in developing countries, but also in Europe, depend on it. I share the Commission’s view that the system should be simplified and should focus more on the countries in greatest need of it in order to be able to compete within the global market. What is important is that the system should become more flexible so that there can be systematic investigation of whether some sectors in beneficiary countries still really need the system in order to be competitive. If a country is guilty of unfair trading practices, of violating the WTO rules or human rights, a temporary suspension should always be possible. In short, I support the Commission’s objectives with regard to the GSP, but like Mrs Martens, I have my doubts whether the proposed reforms will reach far enough in order to achieve the planned objectives. It is, for example, unclear why the number of beneficiary countries is not subject to a thorough review, so that countries that are in the Top 20 in terms of world trade no longer walk away with preferences that are, in fact, intended for the poorest. It is also very much the question, Commissioner, whether the proposed reform is in keeping with the WTO’s current Doha round, at the end of which the poorest countries are to be awarded full quota-free and tariff-free imports. I can understand Commissioner Lamy when he states that prompt action is needed, but like the Council, I should like to insist on thorough consultation with the European Parliament and on all parties involved being given the time to adapt. It appears from the resolution on which we will be voting today that there is broad consensus about this revision. I therefore hope that the Commission will be making every effort to take Parliament’s opinion, which is unanimous, into consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also welcome the Council's recent conclusions, which very clearly demand meaningful consultation with the European Parliament. It is a matter of regret that the Commission's Communication was not the result of a full stakeholder consultation and did not appear sufficiently in advance to allow for meaningful consultation before the release of the next regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that Parliament and all other interested stakeholders have a proper opportunity to input into this very important process, and I am glad that Commissioner Lamy has agreed to that.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of substance, it is clear that the GSP urgently needs to be simplified since it is clearly not working properly. The rules of origin requirements are far too strict, with the result that a large proportion of developing-country exports to the EU fail to gain preferential access because they are deemed to be non-originating. One of the justifications for strict rules of origin is that they should promote so-called backward linkages, i.e. the production of intermediate goods in developing countries themselves. Yet the experience of this clearly demonstrates that rules of origin are not an appropriate instrument to achieve that goal. In fact, most developing countries are small, with little capacity to develop a full supply chain.</p>
<p class="contents">Sri Lanka is a classic example, having developed a thriving garment sector but still not having the capacity to supply textiles to support that industry. It relies essentially on an indirect instrument of trade policy to foster a supply response in developing countries that is likely to be much less efficient and much more vulnerable to abuse than straightforward financial incentives or technical assistance or infrastructure provision for the industries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that Mr Lamy says that we are going to have some real action on rules of origin. The Commission should be looking at far-reaching proposals, such as proposals that would in general allow a least-developed country export to qualify for duty-free access to the EU if at least 40% of a good's value is added in a least-developed country that is not necessarily the final country of export.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of textiles and clothing, we clearly need to go even further, because some of the poorest countries will face enormous shocks when the Multifibre Agreement is withdrawn. Organisations like Oxfam have made some very detailed proposals in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point relates to textiles again. When the MFA is withdrawn, some of the poorest countries will face major problems. I would suggest that developing countries which are highly dependent on textiles and clothing, but are not necessarily classified as least-developed countries, should be exempted temporarily from the existing rules of origin requirements. This applies particularly to countries that obtain more than 50% of their current export revenue from textiles and clothing. I would be very interested in the views of the Commission and Council on that proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What that means is that there exists in this House a certain consensus, particularly as regards graduation, the preferences that are to be changed, and the form that additional concessions are to take in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">What amazed me about the debate was that, if one wants to change systems of preference – which we do – there has to be an analysis first. Trade is not an end in itself; it serves to promote countries’ economic and social development, and so it follows that an analysis has to be produced, stating what existing trade under the existing conditions under the preference systems has achieved. Did it make countries poorer or less poor? Did it or did it not promote industrialisation? Did it help to improve health service provision in underdeveloped countries, or did it not? Have their young people become better trained and educated or less so?</p>
<p class="contents">What that means, then, is that we need in the first place objective criteria in order to evaluate what the existing systems have achieved in the way of development. I regret that I have seen no analysis of this whatever. Today, Commissioner Lamy said that such an analysis exists. There must be in-depth debate of these components in this House before the new Regulation is hammered out.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two more comments I would like to make. Firstly, when dealing with the systems of preferences, we will, in future too, have to work on the assumption that certain countries must be evaluated in different ways. It may be that markets in the developing countries will have to be protected if they are to be able to develop at all. There is a place for that. I cannot ‘open up’ every market if I want to promote countries’ development, particularly as regards food safety, agriculture and so on. Secondly, this is not just about trade, but also about the fact that, if things are produced in countries in which we want to promote social measures, the jobs involved must be proper and dignified ones. I believe that this should also feature in the analysis.</p>

<p class="contents">Since its signature nearly ten years ago, the Marrakesh Agreement has resulted in fundamental changes to the nature of the relations entered into by the European Union, and by France in particular, with their developing country partners. Today we have a new Commission communication presenting a project for reforming and improving the Generalised System of Preferences. It should firstly be noted that the Generalised System of Preferences has been a battlefield between two world views: on the one hand, that of a Europe – and more specifically of France – which is committed to its developing country partners and conscious of its responsibilities and historical ties, and, on the other hand, that of a Europe which believes that exposure to global free trade should be the only real means of economic and social development. I fear that this new Commission communication merely serves as a smoke screen to disguise the simple fact that it renounces our previous commitments in favour of those arising from our participation in the World Trade Organisation. This is what is euphemistically known as a WTO-compatible system.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, and more generally, this House and the Council have allowed the Commission to pursue two contradictory policies at the same time, namely an external trade policy of absolute free trade, and a policy of providing development aid to privileged partners. If we did not wish to allow the WTO to dismantle the Lomé Convention systematically, instrument by instrument, the Council should have acted as a supervisor and recognised authority, in order to provide coherent definitions and a determined defence of clear and long-term strategies, including all external policy instruments, in broad fields of common interest such as development.</p>
<p class="contents">This fundamental contradiction affects all of the policies which we intend to pursue together. How can we ask our fishermen to reduce pressure on fish stocks, at the same time as signing trade agreements with countries which do not wish to agree to make the same efforts? How can we impose environmental standards, social constraints and solidarity commitments on our companies, while exposing them to a competition which bears none of these burdens? Finally, how can we ask our partners from the South to believe in the long-term commitment of the EU and its Member States to their development, if, with advantages that are now barely appreciable, we expose them, reform by reform, to the forces of the single global market? I am speaking on behalf of the French delegation of my group. We are in no way opposed to the market, and we believe in free enterprise, in initiative and in individual responsibility, but we also believe that the State should play its role as regulator and strategist, both to protect its citizens and in the interests of its poorest international partners, as in the absence of this the market is nothing but a jungle.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the prosperity of our continent was mainly established in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries under relatively protected conditions, how can we demand of our partners from the South that they expose their nascent economies to the four winds? Maybe the young shoots of developing countries require assistance in some form from us on a provisional basis. Although admittedly imperfect, our GSP system must be kept in place. I also fear that, as in a great many other cases, the Commission proposal is not based on any impact study or evaluation of the system as a whole. I hope that this House will vote on a detailed proposal, but we must demand, ladies and gentlemen, that this only take place if we have been informed of the consequences which this reform will have. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European cooperation policy, which has as its goal the eradication of poverty in the world, cannot in fact be limited to development programmes, however detailed, substantial and advantageous they may be in many cases, but must make use of all the means at its disposal to promote growth in the most disadvantaged countries and thereby facilitate the economies and the exports of those countries as much as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">This must naturally take place not only transparently and fully in the open, and therefore after an exceptionally scrupulous analysis of the effects of the proposed action plan cuts, but also with the utmost speed so that poor countries may take advantage of these facilities as soon as possible. In addition to purely economic factors, such as market share, other criteria such as the level of development and the commitment of beneficiary countries to follow the path of democracy should then be taken into consideration, and preference should be given to trade in those products that frequently play a distinctive role in the economy of a given country, such as textiles for Sri Lanka, bananas for Barbados, and cocoa in the case of Côte d’Ivoire. Most of all this must be carried out in strict coordination with the World Trade Organisation, in order to avoid going behind the backs of the countries involved and to avoid performing the job of regulation within the Commission itself, as has happened in the past, when it is a matter that should instead remain within the strict competence of the WTO and of the entire international community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a member of the Committee on International Trade, I believe very strongly in this and we welcome the 2006-2015 reforms to the Generalised System of Preferences. They cover areas such as textiles, which is a particularly big area. However, there are potential dangers for developing countries in this revision; one country that has been mentioned already is Sri Lanka. I feel therefore that graduation is needed for some countries that are now independently competitive in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with graduation, it is important to extend the scheme to new products. One of our concerns relates to the new products the Commission proposes to add to the GSP system. The proposals appear to be rather vague and the graduation extension must be fully explained in the Commission’s legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to bear in mind that the GSP system was designed for the least-developed countries. I agree with the Commissioner that resources should therefore be focused on them. This brings me to a point that Mr Van Hecke raised: first of all we must try to ensure that rules of origin take into account second-stage products, which help countries to industrialise, and particularly ones such as cotton. However, we need to ensure that when the detailed proposals are set out on the rules of origin, which allow countries to industrialise without the scheme being too far-reaching, we also look at the way in which countries apply them. There has been some dispute as to whether countries have been apply them to transit products, thereby adding value to these. This is something about which we feel very strongly.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, the Commission Communication itself suggests self-regulation for LDCs under the GSP. We argue against this in the resolution, because the time is not yet ripe. We request technical assistance in the implementation of new schemes, especially with regard to self-policing. It is important that the Commission shows how this is to be done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the West, we have basic services, such as water, education and care, and we want these to be available elsewhere too. International trade plays an important part in this. Trade revenue can help increase the level of investments in basic services, but, in developing countries, particularly on the African continent, world trade plays far too small a role. The African continent accounts for only a 2% share in it. The European Union can, and must, change this. It is of the utmost importance that we, as the world’s largest trading bloc, should open up our markets to products from the least developed countries and, by way of positive sanctions, give development in the poorest countries an opportunity. As has been said before, the present system of trade preferences has, in practice, worked to only a limited extent, particularly socially speaking. Only Sri Lanka and Moldavia have benefited from it, and, as Mr Sturdy stated a moment ago, the complexity of the rules and limited capacity have meant that even Sri Lanka has, in fact, made too little use of the potential. That is why it is a good thing that we are moving towards a GSP+ system, one that is far simpler and involves fewer countries, but yields major benefits gradually and new products, which also creates real incentives. Indeed, if we really want fundamental working standards, to name but one major aspect, to be adhered to in practice in those countries and to be given a chance in them, we must actively focus our efforts. We resist the lobbying that would result in an enormous patchwork quilt of goals and countries, from which a huge number of people draw benefit, but where the poorest countries lose out.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Lamy should be praised for the excellent work he is making of the EPA (Economic Partnership Agreement) regulation, and we must carry on in the same vein. If the Caribbean Sea area and the Pacific Ocean experience special problems, which they do, we should try to use EPAs as a targeted and generous solution to them. We should adopt a harder line with regard to the new upcoming superpowers China, Brazil and India and impose stricter requirements where fundamental working standards are concerned. Finally, we should not pursue fair trade alone, but also, with regard to the protection of our own employees, fair competition. With regard to the rules of origin, I would request the Commission to focus on benefits for the least developed countries and agree to relax rules of origin, and to regional and developmental cumulation. Finally, if we want to encourage the regional economy, we must be open-handed in this respect too. An incentive of this kind, which is hugely concentrated, could really help the African continent to take a step forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We agree with the Commission that we need to simplify, concentrate and ultimately improve the system in order to make it more effective in terms of achieving its aims. There are still grey areas, such as the improvement of rules of origin, the key element of the system, which must play a vital role in helping the countries benefiting from the GSP system through clear operating rules. The same can be said of the simplification of the GSP+ system, which we agree with, but which we believe still requires clarification in terms of the ratification or application of international standards which do not in practice represent an obstacle to the genuine application of the GSP system, as stated by certain Latin American countries such as El Salvador, or key aspects relating to incentives in the fight against drug-trafficking, which are crucial to countries such as Colombia and Bolivia.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, we are in favour of the objective of simplifying, concentrating and improving the GSP system, although we feel it prudent to wait to see how it translates into the Commission’s forthcoming legislative text. At this point we would draw attention to the need to set clear criteria with regard to rules of origin and maintaining the GSP system for the benefiting Latin American countries and, in particular, the rules relating to combating drugs, which still need to be refined.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President, by saying that we support the joint resolution presented today as a joint compromise amongst the different political groups putting their signature to it, which has meant everybody giving ground for the sake of consensus. We therefore reject the amendments which go further than this compromise and which create ambiguity in the treatment of rules of origin, which we wish to make as clear, transparent and precise as possible in order to help third countries, while preventing fraud in their application. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, although I welcome the initiative, it must be said that it is very general. The Commissioner himself acknowledges that it contains a lot of very broad proposals. We want more information on thresholds for graduation and on how much the GSP will be improved for countries that are not graduated. I also look forward to more details on the rules of origin, because it is quite difficult to judge at this point whether what is being proposed is anything more than cosmetic.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to know whether the Commissioner agrees with my assessment that if the EU substantially enhances its preference system, it could meet the requirements of the improved GSP option, the EPA alternative, which some non-LDCs are continuing to call for, as the Commissioner is well aware.</p>
<p class="contents">At the meeting in Gaborone, the EU agreed to postpone until 2006 the anticipated review of the situation of non-LDCs that are not in a position to enter into EPAs. It also seems to me that WTO rules allow for differentiation between developing countries in non-reciprocal trade preference schemes, provided that such arrangements are based on objective criteria and that identical treatment is available to all similarly-situated developing countries. On the basis of that analysis, I would like the Commissioner to be more specific on whether, when Cotonou was negotiated, an enhanced GSP was looked at as an option for those that could not or did not want to enter into EPA negotiations. I asked for this information in committee, but I was not entirely satisfied with the answer.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like the Commissioner to provide more information and clarity on what is meant by 'vulnerable', 'special development needs' and 'small economies'. The Commissioner talked about landlocked countries, etc., but he needs to spell things out more clearly so that we know exactly what he means. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank him for his clarifications today; I agree with him that the Generalised System of Preferences is, in principle, a sound instrument for giving development opportunities via trade, but that the system is clearly in need of revision.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two questions for the Commissioner. I share his view that phasing out the trade barriers does, in fact, partly erode the Generalised System of Preferences and that it is thus more than necessary for us to concentrate on the countries that need this the most. I therefore share Mrs Lucas’ concern about the future of some developing countries when the textile quota lapses. I would very much appreciate it, Commissioner, if you could explain once more how this system of graduation can be deployed to help those least developed countries. You mentioned China as a very obvious example, but what about the position of Pakistan and India, for example?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the GSP+ system does indeed make it possible to use trade as a lever for human rights, labour rights, the environment and good governance. I welcome the fact that the existing regulations are being combined, for what is the use of awarding GSP+ to Pakistan on account of its drugs policy if child labour is still rampant? Commissioner, you explained that it is not only about ratification, but also about application, but quite honestly, it was not entirely clear to me which treaties you have in mind. You gave a whole list of items and tried to explain how those should be monitored, but I fear that the list you have given will make the GSP+ system completely inoperable. You also failed to mention in what way sanctions will be tied in with non-compliance with those fundamental treaties and how this system can be implemented effectively. All too often, GSP+ or the linking to working standards or treaties become ineffective instruments, because non-compliance is simply not followed up by sanctions. If you could explain this once again, I would be very grateful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The reform of the GSP effectively incorporates the idea that the best commercial preferences should be conditional upon respect for certain standards in terms of social protection, human rights, good governance and environmentally-sustainable development into our view of trade as an instrument for development and of development as a collective human right. Unifying all these criteria within a GSP+ category, as well as simplifying the system and making it more generous, as the Commissioner has said, moves in the right direction in terms of the coherence of Community policies affecting developing countries and corrects the fragmentation which has traditionally been dealt with within development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As spokesperson for the Socialist Group in the Human Rights Sub-Committee, I must congratulate the Commission on this aspect of its proposal, although other points of it can clearly be improved, particularly those which provide for rigid mechanisms for the preferences established for the less developed countries.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, this is not the very last time that I will appear before you because I will have the chance to see you again in plenary in October. Had this actually been the last time, I would have seen – in the combination of circumstances that sees Mr Moscovici in the chair – a sign, the like of which I receive from time to time.</p>
<p class="contents">Unusually for me, I will not be able to respond in detail to each of you individually, because I can only speak for a few minutes. I shall restrict myself to addressing the essential aspects, keeping it brief and to the point.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Martens asked me if the ‘everything but arms’ scheme is to be changed. No, it will not be changed, and there is no graduation in the ‘everything but arms’ scheme. She asked, as other speakers did, about the rates of use by the beneficiary countries of the Generalised System of Preferences. She is right. Let us simply be clear that, among the reasons why certain countries do not, in fact, have access to our market, even though they have the right to such access, are all of those factors that do not fall under the category of tariffs, such as those relating to sanitary and phytosanitary norms and the problems of standards, quality and certification. There will always, therefore, be a difference between theoretical and practical access, due to non-tariff-related issues, for which, unfortunately, we are unable to set up a specific scheme for developing countries. We are not about to set up a scheme for tolerance of antibiotics in prawns for the whole world, only later to set up a specific scheme that favours prawns from the developing world. Unfortunately, we cannot proceed in such a manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Castex suggests that I involve the social partners in cases where benefit from these preferences is linked to compliance with social clauses. We are already doing this, Mrs Castex, and we shall continue to do so. To give you an example, the inquiry that we are currently undertaking into respect for union rights in Belarus, which may lead the EU to remove the benefit of those preferences from that country, was triggered by a complaint from the European Trade Union Confederation. This is also, in fact, the basis for my reply to Mr Markov.</p>
<p class="contents">I was asked if the number of beneficiaries would be reviewed. The number of beneficiaries will, of course, be reviewed, and this review will be based on one criterion – that of market share. I said earlier, and I repeat, that the number of beneficiaries will scarcely be affected by this system. Let me state clearly that when we speak of graduation, we do not refer to one country and one product as being graduated, but to a country-product pair – country ‘x’, product ‘y’.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lucas asked me again about the timetable. I feel that I have explained our constraints, in particular those arising from the India dispute. As regards rules of origin, which she emphasised, as did others, namely Mrs Van Lancker and Mrs Kinnock, let me simply say this: supposing we removed China, a major exporter of clothing and textiles, from the scheme and we authorised Sri Lanka, which exports clothing, to procure its textiles in China; if I have understood correctly, this is what Mrs Lucas would like us to do. If this were to happen, we would be handing back to China through the back door, if I may put it that way, the advantage in the clothing and textiles sector that we would be taking away through the front door. We must not, therefore, put ourselves into that kind of contradictory situation. If, however, Sri Lanka wishes to procure its textiles in the surrounding region, we are probably – I must check with my colleagues – open to this.</p>
<p class="contents">I have almost finished on this point. Mr Louis does not like the World Trade Organisation; that is his prerogative. What is more worrying is that he considers the EU’s trade policy as characterised by unbridled free trade. This is obviously an exaggeration. Furthermore, I did not hear that from the mouths of other Members of this House during this debate. I should like to pinpoint the one sole point in his speech on which he agrees with the Commission – which is not bad going, incidentally – namely that the GSP must be preserved. I would, in fact, go slightly further and say that it must be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sturdy agrees on the link with technical assistance. Mrs Kinnock and Mrs Van Lancker want more details on the thresholds and on the lists of the conventions and the sanctions. Those details will be available on 20 October, when the Commission will make a decision on my proposal. Mrs Kinnock would like me to shed more light on the relationship between the economic partnership agreements and these unilateral schemes. They are two distinct systems; the function of the economic partnership agreements is to encourage regional integration within the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, whereas, for the moment, the GSP does not have that objective, other than through the rules of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">I have finished on that point, Mr President. I am delighted that, once again, Parliament has had the opportunity to hold a debate on trade policy one week before the Commission itself has debated the issue. This proves that, from the point of view of transparency, we have made some progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
