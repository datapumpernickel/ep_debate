<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lambert (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">deputising for the author</span>. – Mr President, firstly I should like to apologise for the absence of our committee chairman, Mr Bouwman, who unfortunately is ill this week, so that, as Parliament's rapporteur on this issue it has fallen to me to introduce the question.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has long been aware of the problems concerning the legal base for the inclusion of third country nationals on the same footing as European Union citizens under the proposed simplification of modernisation of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71. As Members know, this regulation seeks to coordinate social security systems between Member States for people moving and working across borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the reservations I have heard voiced about the extension of this regulation to third country nationals border, at times, on the xenophobic rather than the rational. You will be aware that the legal opinion provided by Parliament's Legal Services felt that Articles 42 and 308 of the Amsterdam Treaty, as initially proposed by the Commission, formed the appropriate legal base for this extension as well as for the regulation as a whole. The European Parliament agreed, as did the majority of the Member States, and that legal base provided for the equal treatment of third country nationals legally resident in the European Union and for the full involvement of Parliament through the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, this parity of legal base seemed to many of us to provide a strong signal in terms of the recognition of the contribution from third country nationals to the life of the European Union and certainly met the twin aims of simplification of the process and natural justice. To me that parity was a clear signal of an inclusive Europe. I and many others find ourselves at a loss, on reading the <span class="italic">Khalil</span> judgment from the European Court of Justice, to understand why this should materially change the legal base on which Council and Commission are now proposing the extension of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">Khalil</span> case, insofar as legal experts have explained it to me, involves people covered by Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 already, should they be allowed to legally reside in another Member State and thus cross borders. They are included under this judgment because they are stateless people with rights to social security equivalent to those of nationals in the state in which they now reside as a result of international historical agreements. But no right of free movement is provided for by their inclusion under the regulation. The regulation does not grant freedom of movement. It maintains certain rights for those who move through coordination of social security systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Council's statement last December and the Commission's new proposal do not explain the change in the legal base. They simply state it. It is an explanation that Parliament is now seeking. What specifically in the <span class="italic">Khalil</span> judgment has led Council to its conclusion that Article 63.4 is the correct base, when this was not the majority opinion before? Has the European Court of Human Rights case of <span class="italic">Gaygusuz v Austria</span> providing for nationality being no barrier to equal treatment to nationals in relation to social security not led to a conclusion of equal treatment in relation to the regulation and thus the parallel legal base? And why should the European Parliament not be involved in this area which is directly relevant to the lives of so many people? Hence our desire as well also to clarify the situation of workers in accession countries during any transition period when they will not be enjoying freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">Council and Commission will also be aware of this House's concern for the complex situation facing cross-border workers. The Belgian Presidency had put forward a number of proposals in this area, yet the agreement reached at present is only minimal, as parameter 8 concerning medical treatment shows. So what are the prospects for further improvements for this group of workers? We are also asking the Commission for its perspective on a number of issues where Council seems to be less enthusiastic about the Commission perspective as well. We would also ask whether the increasing links between the tax and the social security systems are being addressed by Council and Commission, either within the context of the regulation or elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all well aware of the desire of Council and Commission to see increased mobility within the workforce and, as a Member of Parliament's Committee on Petitions, I know as well that a number of those who work in other Member States find their situation made more difficult by the lack of effective information, but also by anomalies within the coordination system.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of us are concerned that Council appears reluctant to make free movement an easy reality. We know this is a complex administrative issue, but many of the niceties of exclusion of certain benefits and complex rules simply appear as barriers. It appears at times that it is easier to move ball-bearings around the European Union than it is to move people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Miguel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, on 6 February 2002 the Commission presented to the Council a proposal for a regulation to extend the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 to nationals of third countries who, solely as a result of their nationality, are not covered by those provisions. The said proposal is based on paragraph 4 of Article 63 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has agreed on the possibility of using paragraph 4 of Article 63 as a legal basis, as the Commission proposed. In accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4 of Article 63, the Council will have to adopt measures which define the conditions under which nationals of third countries, who reside legally in a Member State, may reside in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council considers that Article 42 of the EC Treaty, interpreted in the light of the judgements of the Court of Justice – in particular the judgement handed down in the Khalil case C-95/99 – does not seem to offer a sufficient legal basis for this extension. In fact, Mr President, it can be deduced from the Khalil judgement that the Court has not criticised the inclusion of stateless persons and refugees in Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, based on Article 51 – currently Article 42 – of the EC Treaty, solely insofar as it involves a small category of people, in relation to which the Member States have made international commitments. In fact, the Court decided as follows: “The Council cannot be criticised for having, in the exercise of the powers which have been conferred on it under Article 51 of the EEC Treaty, also included stateless persons and refugees resident on the territory of the Member States in order to take into account the abovementioned international obligations of those States.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Advocate General pointed out in paragraph 59 of his Opinion, ‘coordination excluding stateless persons and refugees would have meant that the Member States, in order to ensure compliance with their international obligations, had to establish a second coordination regime designed solely for that very restricted category of persons’.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Council believes that the applicable procedure for adopting a decision should be the one laid down in the EC Treaty. If the legal basis adopted for extending coordination to third-country nationals turns out to be paragraph 4 of Article 63, the Council will have to give its opinion in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 67.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to border workers, the Council has reached an agreement in principle in the field of sickness and unemployment benefits according to which the situation of former border worker pensioners will have to be studied. According to the provisions of the current Regulation, the border worker may receive healthcare in the territory of the competent State, but does not enjoy this right as a pensioner. For reasons of continuity, so that treatments already started may continue, the former border worker should be allowed to continue to receive sickness benefits in the territory of the State in which they formerly worked.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the unemployed worker, who during their last job resided in the territory of a Member State other than the competent State, the main objective is to incorporate them as best as possible into the labour markets. Furthermore, it will be appropriate to guarantee the social protection of the unemployed while bearing in mind the financial aspects of the issue and guaranteeing effective control.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the relationship between taxation and social security, this is an issue which essentially falls within the competence of the Member States and not the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be stressed that, in a general sense, the guidelines for employment for 2002 draw attention to the need to adapt the tax and benefit structures in such a way that they do not have a negative effect on participation in active life, particularly in relation to women.</p>
<p class="contents">Nationals of candidate countries who become Community nationals purely as a result of accession will be included, by virtue of that accession, within the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71. The possible exceptions to this principle, which could take the form, for example, of transitional periods, will be determined within the framework of the accession agreements, which are currently under negotiation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no need to read out its actual text, since the Presidency has already done so. We believe that the Khalil sentence, of October last year, raises the inadequacy of the legal basis of Article 51 (currently 42) and obliges us to reconsider that of the Decision proposed in 1997. Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, with the new provisions of Title 4, we believe that the appropriate legal basis is paragraph 4 of Article 63 of that Treaty, while bearing in mind that Article 308 of the Treaty can only be applied if there is no other legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">You also ask for the Commission’s opinion on a series of parameters proposed by the Council, specifically parameters 6, 10 and 11, relating to agreements between countries, unemployment benefits and family benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the first point, the Commission believes that parameter 6 is acceptable, since this possibility is laid down in the current Regulation. The Commission believes it positive that in the Regulation, unlike the current one, criteria are established to maintain these agreements, especially in cases which are more favourable to the person affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to unemployment benefits, the Commission regrets the lack of progress in relation to parameter 10, which does not provide any essential modification of the current provisions, above all because it does not offer any specific solution in the relation to the situation of border workers.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to family benefits, parameter 11 does not correspond exactly to the Commission’s proposal, but, in any event, the Commission considers it positive that that parameter intends to guarantee the beneficiary the maximum amount of benefits. This parameter will improve the situation of pensioners and orphans in comparison with the Regulation, since these people will benefit from the same provisions applicable to the same category of family benefits as self-employed and salaried workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The relationship between taxation and social security is another of your questions. It is true that Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 refers to the coordination of social security systems in the Member States. There are no explicit rules for the coordination of these tax systems and this issue is largely resolved by the bilateral agreements on double taxation which have been reached by almost all the Member States. The agreements follow the model of the OECD, which means that, in most cases, the income from salaried work (and also freelance work) is only subject to the taxes of either the country in which the work is carried out or the country of residence. Therefore, if they are subject to the taxes of the Member State in which they work, that country has competence both in terms of taxation and in terms of social security.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Justice confirmed that, in the absence of harmonisation at Community level, the Member States have the competence to establish the criteria for allocation of fiscal competence in order to eliminate double taxation, but, in doing so, it is logical that they should respect the principles of Community legislation and, amongst others, that of the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of nationality.</p>
<p class="contents">My final comments relate to enlargement. Firstly, the negotiations with the candidate countries, as the Presidency has said, on Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, in its part relating to Chapter 2, have provisionally been concluded – or have been concluded – with all the countries apart from Estonia, and this Chapter 2 also includes the coordination of social security systems. However, the annexes are still under negotiation. It has been entrusted to the administrative Committee for the social security of migrant workers, which will shortly present to the Council’s working groups the results of its debates on entries, which the candidate countries have asked to be included in those annexes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Regulation (EEC) No 1481/71 will be applied to nationals of candidate countries as soon as they accede to the European Union, since there is no provision for a transitional period in the field of the coordination of social security systems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why? Because I am not getting a straight answer from the Council or the Commission. Within this internal market, we are in favour of the free movement of goods, people and services. I have included people, for this is particularly a problem in border regions. However, the answers that I am receiving are inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">If I consider my own region, I notice that the labour market there can no longer function without workers from abroad. Needless to say, we must make the conditions attractive for these people to come. This means, first of all, that we must ensure that shop-floor workers who work in a Member State pay both taxes and social premiums in the same way. I would therefore like to know whether it would not be possible to draft a kind of 1408 that applies to the fiscal status of border workers. This is my first question.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is directed at the Council concerning what is so nicely termed ‘Council parameters’. Incidentally, I very much regret that the Commissioner is not present, for he is truly competent in this field and knows how long this issue has been outstanding. Studying these Council parameters – and, Mr Miguelez, I hold you in very high esteem – I note that what you have written in the Council parameters is diametrically opposed to what has been presented to us in recent jurisdiction by the European Court of Justice. And I wonder whether you really believe that you can get this issue, in which Parliament has also been involved since Amsterdam in terms of codecision, approved. For the aspects you mention, such as sickness benefit and child benefit, are incompatible with what has been pronounced, and the Commissioner will back this up. So, with all due respect to Mrs Lambert, for she made some valid points on third-country problems, among others, which I endorse, a change is needed here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, to obtain some clarification, and second to get things moving in this whole field. Clarification, because we Members of Parliament soon realised that the contributions made by Commissioner Solbes and the representative of the Council did not make it clear why the legal basis has been changed in Article 63(4). It was simply stated, without any justification being given.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Tampere, we have taken very seriously the Council's announcement that the legal status of third-country nationals, that is to say citizens who live and work in the EU, who are legally resident here and do not come from one of the 15 Member States, should be approximated to that of Member States' nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe's institutions want more clarity and transparency without waiting for the Convention. However, these new proposals are creating more confusion than before, because, if we have to deal with two different legal bases, that is certainly very confusing. It is also unsatisfactory because it rules out codecision by Parliament. What a short-sighted strategy on the part of the Commission! You know that up to now we have always been on your side when it comes to modernisation, to changing and improving things for Europe's employees, Europe's workers. I think it would be not only very short-sighted but also a dangerous strategy to exclude Parliament at this stage. It is of course possible for the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark to apply to opt out under Regulation 1408, and that would really be disastrous, because no one in this House could welcome a further social policy opt-out. The result would be a patchwork quilt of a social policy which would certain not confirm and win the trust that employees ought to have in Europe's institutions. So we are all delighted that the United Kingdom has stopped opting out of social policy. Is this an attempt to reintroduce that?</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason for our question was of course to get the plans for reform moving. I remember that an undertaking to update this directive was given in Edinburgh back in 1992. Please note – an update. I would like to remind you once again that Regulation 1408 does not involve harmonising social systems, but is about coordinating the framework conditions, as it were, in order to encourage and support our citizens in making use of their scope for mobility in Europe. Every couple of weeks there are fresh appeals from the Council and the Commission to young people, to workers, to the public in general, to take advantage of this freedom of movement. However, I would like to say here that the framework conditions consist of some very complicated and unwieldy legislation. In Germany we would say that is a book with seven seals, a closed book if you like, even for the initiated.</p>
<p class="contents">The 12 parameters that we now have before us do not add up to the qualitative improvement that we actually promised ourselves. I naturally agree with the critical comments made by Mrs Lambert and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, and also with the criticism that you expressed on behalf of the Commission, Mr Solbes.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point I should have mentioned was the time frame. We had expected that the Spanish Presidency would have presented a methodical, reasonable and effective proposal by June. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course Article 63 is to be used as a legal basis for guaranteeing third countries’ nationals freedom of movement. Moreover, I have also in the past put forward the view that the actual legal basis was not perhaps the most important thing right now, for what is at issue is guaranteeing the rights of these people. I think, however, that, in the long term, we must arrive at a situation in which Parliament also obtains direct influence on this area. It will require a change to the Treaties, and I am ashamed to say that, during the negotiations in connection with the Nice Treaty, my own country resisted our obtaining influence over these matters because of the Danish reservation. Moreover, I quite agree with Mrs Weiler that we must get away from a situation in which some countries are accorded reservations in connection with parts of such a policy. We must all pull together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the system of taxation and social security. The tax system is the responsibility of the Member States and it is decided in accordance with the place of residence. That is how it is and treatment varies depending on the Member State. The social security system is regulated at Community level by means of Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71 and is defined in accordance with the place of work. We do not have fiscal harmonisation and that is the reason why the system I referred to earlier is applied, basically taking the agreements of the OECD into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point raised relates to what our objective is in relation to social security. Our objective is, clearly, to apply the same social security system and the same rights to all citizens of the Union, but also for all legal residents.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the problem of the opting out by Ireland and the United Kingdom, as the honourable Member knows, it is true that the intention is to use the new legal basis. Ireland has indicated that it is going to participate. In the case of the United Kingdom, the issue is still open and it will be until the beginning of May, which is when it intends to adopt its decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the nature of the new text, it is intended to be more modern than the previous one, with a simpler and more accessible definition for users of the current legal system. The new text is intended to include both the conclusions arising from the judgements of the Court of Justice and the various amendments which have been introduced since 1971.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that there is a debate on the legal basis, but we believe, of course, that the one used is the correct legal basis in accordance with the current system, and it has clearly never been the Commission’s intention to affect Parliament’s rights in any way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
