<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolai Wammen, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– Mr President, I welcome the fact that this Parliament is focusing on the issue of small and medium-sized enterprises. Given the current difficult economic climate, it is all the more important that SMEs, which are the principal contributors to our economies, are provided with a climate in which they can flourish and grow.</p>
<p class="contents">You have chosen to focus this debate on two specific issues: that of access by SMEs to Structural Funds and that of the definition of SMEs. Both of these have been the subject recently of oral questions to the Commission. In fact, it is correct to address the Commission on both these issues and I am sure that the Commissioner will be able to respond in more detail to the particular points which I know are of concern to this Parliament, to the Commission and, of course, to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Presidency is concerned, I would like to share with you a number of points which are important to the Council. Firstly, SMEs are the backbone of our economy. They are the drivers of wealth creation and of our ability to adjust flexibly to changes in demand, and are a major source of employment. That is why SMEs have been at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy. At a time when more than 25 million people are unemployed, we need the SMEs to generate jobs, especially for young people.</p>
<p class="contents">SMEs draw valuable support from the Structural Funds. Indeed, over the period 2007 to 2014, SMEs will have benefited from these funds to a total of EUR 70 billion. This financial support helps strengthen the competitiveness of SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">During the credit crunch, ensuring that SMEs have access to adequate finance has become even more important. For this reason, a number of schemes guaranteeing loans to SMEs have been extended, and there are several new initiatives designed to provide SMEs with interest-rate subsidies and to increase the credit ring-fenced for SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Financial instruments constitute a rapidly growing and effective form of support for SMEs from the Structural Funds. They complement grant financing and are more sustainable because the money can be recycled and used again in the future. Venture capital and loan funds are also indispensable for SMEs. In addition, SMEs benefit from financing through the European Investment Bank, which provides loans at advantageous rates. These constitute valuable financing mechanisms offering a flexible approach that is an alternative to either grants or loans from commercial banks.</p>
<p class="contents">A further valuable source of funding comes from the various initiatives set up jointly by the Commission and the EIB. The financial instruments known as JEREMIE, JESSICA and JASMINE are designed to improve SMEs’ access to finance by providing equity, loans and guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">On the matter of the definition of SMEs, I am aware that the Commission is preparing a survey to assess Member States’ opinions on the current definition and whether it could be beneficial to change it. In the Council, we have not yet had an opportunity to discuss this issue and we are looking forward to receiving the Commission’s survey. That said, it is important to note that the current definition means that 95% of all companies in Europe are SMEs. It therefore seems natural that we have a thorough discussion and a proper analysis on a possible change of the definition, and we also look forward to hearing the opinion of Parliament and discussing this issue with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, honourable Members, Commissioner, the focus of your interest this morning is the issue of access to finance by SMEs – and rightly so, given the current economic climate. I would like to close by emphasising that, while access to finance is, of course, extremely important, SMEs also need a favourable business environment in which to be able to develop. The Small Business Act, adopted in 2008, has been key in helping SMEs, through the creation of a comprehensive policy framework. In conjunction with this, many Member States have taken steps to help SMEs – for example, through the establishment of ‘one-stop shops’ for people starting up businesses – but we must all remain particularly vigilant so that we continue to provide SMEs with a proper environment in which to grow, and so that we simplify the business environment and reduce the burden of red tape on all businesses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Johannes Hahn, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Wammen, honourable Members, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) lie at the heart of the European economy. We have a total of around 23 million SMEs in Europe, which amounts to 99.8% of European companies. Therefore, the growth and future competitiveness of Europe depend on the competitiveness of our SMEs. The crisis has hit SMEs in the same way as all other businesses. It is generally SMEs which now have greater difficulty in obtaining loans and outside capital. For this reason, there is a public responsibility to help SMEs, so that they do not become victims of credit squeezes and are able to make full use of their potential for innovation. This is why the European Commission has repeatedly taken measures over recent years to give SMEs better access to capital. By adapting existing programmes in 2010 and 2011, the Commission has succeeded in increasing the funding available for financial instruments, such as loans and guarantees, to more than EUR 8.1 billion. This was the situation at the end of 2010. The money has been used to finance a total of 300 different instruments in the Member States and more than 90 000 direct jobs have been created as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament once again for its rapid, committed and ongoing support for the amendments to our regulations. The amendments have been needed over the years to respond to precisely these challenges. For example, working capital has been designated as eligible for subsidies in the context of revolving funds and a significant contribution has also been made to the process of overcoming the crisis, particularly in certain Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In January this year, the Commission took a further step, together with the Member States, and adapted the programmes in such a way that the funding still available could be used specifically to create new jobs. Its initiative also included measures to combat youth unemployment. This reallocation is primarily intended to benefit SMEs, in as far as the funds available still allow for this, because it is SMEs that can create lasting jobs in Europe. I would like to remind everyone that there are around 24 million unemployed people in Europe and 23 million SMEs. In simple terms, if every SME hired one unemployed person, the problem would almost be solved.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative will result in between EUR 5 billion and EUR 8 billion being reallocated, as things stand today. During the next programming period, the Commission has put a clear emphasis on ensuring that SMEs benefit from the Structural Funds. A total of 80% of the money from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in more developed regions and 50% in less developed regions will be spent on these priorities, including innovation in SMEs, renewable energies and energy efficiency. It is important to remember that, in absolute figures, the 50% in the less developed regions amounts to more than the 80% in the more developed regions.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative clearly focuses on the priorities and also sends out a strong signal that we want to improve the competitiveness of SMEs. To achieve this, we must, of course, also work together to make it easier in administrative terms for SMEs to access money from the Structural Funds. I would therefore like to thank the European Parliament for the many proposals it has submitted with the aim of simplifying the administrative processes even further. At the same time, I would like to mention that a significant proportion of the administrative challenges are at national and regional level. For example, we will be making the implementation of the Small Business Act subject to <span class="italic">ex ante</span> conditionalities, or at least that is what we have proposed. We need joint efforts at European level and by the Member States on behalf of our SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one final point that has already been mentioned. The definition of the term SME is a frequent topic for discussion. You will be aware that the European Commission regularly reviews this definition and that another independent evaluation is currently under way which will also take into consideration the number of employees and the turnover limits. We are expecting to receive the results of these investigations in the early autumn of 2012. The results will, of course, be discussed openly and on a broad basis. At the moment, I cannot say whether this will lead to a change in the current definition.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, SMEs form the backbone of the European economy. Over recent weeks and months, many discussions have taken place on the subject of growth and measures to stimulate growth. I would like to make it clear that anyone who wants to take lasting steps to promote growth must begin by increasing the competitiveness of SMEs. The Commission at least is prepared to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I regret to say that often, they are written by officials for officials, and not for entrepreneurs. There are far too many entrepreneurs giving up before they even get started. We all know that it is the small and medium-sized enterprises that are creating the jobs, and that is why we must make the application procedures more accessible. We have to get rid of this red tape. I also think that we can, in fact, improve the way we link access to financing for enterprises with the challenges that Europe is facing. After all, we have work to do in respect of energy efficiency. Might it perhaps be an idea to create a link between the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises and some of this work by taking money from the Structural Funds and giving it to small and medium-sized enterprises? This could create lots of jobs for those termed ‘blue-collar workers’; in other words, ordinary people in boiler suits, craftsmen, who could be employed to provide insulation, install new windows, and so on. This would allow us to solve both climate problems and employment problems, while at the same time allowing the resources in the funds to be used for the benefit of small and medium-sized enterprises. It is, after all, precisely these companies that are creating jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the SME definition is concerned, I think we should be cautious about shifting the current definition too far. I do not think it should be expanded under any circumstances because, as the definition stands at present, it already covers more than 99% of all enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are doing a great deal for them. I believe that this is something really special because, in contrast to other large economic areas, we have smaller companies which are competitive on global markets and which are flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions. That is the special feature of SMEs in the European Union and we are providing them with support. They are at the centre of our structural policy not just in the next subsidy period, but also here and now.</p>
<p class="contents">We have done a lot to ensure that they can access the money from the Structural Funds more easily. However, I believe that there is potential for further improvement and simplification in this area. When a small company applies for a loan at favourable interest rates, it should not be necessary for the company to fill out reams of forms. I think that there is still room for improvement here.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I also believe that by means of an intelligent initiative, we can encourage SMEs to create closer links between economic growth, an innovative approach to economic development and the struggle to reduce youth unemployment levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hahn said in a previous debate that if every company in Europe were to hire just one young person, the problem of youth unemployment would effectively go away. He is right to a certain extent. I am not trying to say that we should insist that money from the European Union will only be made available when companies take on one or two young people. That sort of approach reminds me of my past in the German Democratic Republic, which was also unable to resolve this sort of problem. However, I think it is worth considering how we can establish an intelligent project that could be subsidised by the European Union and would give young people real opportunities for training followed by jobs within companies. Perhaps we will be able to make progress in this area in time for the next subsidy period. However, I must make it clear that I do not want to see merely windfall effects for companies. There must be lasting growth and a lasting reduction in unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">I do have one request for the Commission. I know that the Commission is currently reviewing competition law. It would be very helpful in this respect if we could ensure that regions are not pulled apart and that the subsidy conditions in one region are not completely different from those in another. This would lead to more bureaucracy and make access to subsidy funding much more difficult. I hope that the Commission can come up with a positive proposal in this area which will not result in the regions being torn apart. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s cohesion policy should be able to help resolve this problem. There are various programmes which have already been mentioned. A study by the European Parliament on the effectiveness of the Structural Funds and other measures aimed at regional SMEs has evidently highlighted some weaknesses. These include a failure to distinguish between different types of SMEs – such as micro-enterprises, but also self-employed people – major bureaucratic obstacles during the process of applying for finance, together with the reporting and monitoring requirements, the need for advance funding for projects and a lack of standardisation of the rules and procedures across different subsidy programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me to make a few requests to the Commission. We should be able to simplify the process of obtaining finance from the Structural Funds. We need to improve the access to Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises (JEREMIE). The contribution of EUR 50 000 required from the applicants is too high. We need to relax the requirement for advance funding for projects. We also need to take a more targeted approach to providing finance for different types of SMEs, to reduce the amount of cofinancing required and to close the financing gap between the individual depreciation cycles. In addition, we need more support to help SMEs to help themselves in the area of financing. Professional organisations could make a contribution in this respect. We must help SMEs to become stronger and to increase their capital. They have to do this in order to obtain loans from the banks.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hahn, it is, of course, also important that Basel III is implemented in such a way that it does not obstruct the process of lending to SMEs, but instead creates opportunities for companies to access loans easily and under favourable terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The huge role of SMEs in job creation is even more important for sectors of the population such as women, immigrants or the young. Young people currently account for 40% or almost 50% of unemployment in many Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The high unemployment rates demand of the political class – of all of us – that we make this economic sector more competitive in Europe. There have been very indebted SMEs in Europe in recent years. In fact, we believe that 85% of the jobs created in the European Union were created by SMEs, especially new companies. However, we believe there are major administrative burdens. There is therefore a need to provide for programmes specifically intended to boost the SME sector in the upcoming Cohesion Fund reform. We need to use innovative measures, facilities and new technologies to streamline the mechanisms for coordinating the various administrations; to show the potential of cross-border companies; to risk opening up the market; and to help SMEs to combat the crisis and the lack of jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very lonely matter for small businesses to start and to grow – and even to survive – and we need to give them all the assistance we can that is reasonable.</p>
<p class="contents">The concerns of small businesses are fairly consistent over the years. First of all, they need access to information. They need assistance in finding out where to get help. Secondly, they need assistance to gain access to finance. It is particularly difficult for people to raise small loans; banks hate lending small amounts of money to people and small enterprises; they like big amounts which they can manage and charge good fees on. That is a big challenge. But we can do something about the burden of administration, of red tape. Complying with regulations is more difficult for small businesses than it is for larger firms.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to close by saying that, for the longer term, I hope the Commission will take on board the last point in our question about allocating unspent balances in other budget lines to research and development.

However, this sector is the most vulnerable to the impact of the economic crisis. Profit margins of small and medium-sized enterprises in Greece have been eroded by as much as 60%, which is the highest in Europe, followed by Spain with 55%. This compares with Germany, where the profit margins of small and medium-sized enterprises have soared to 21%. My country, Greece, has witnessed the biggest deterioration in the sector and access for small and medium-sized enterprises to bank loans is now non-existent. Many companies are closing, making the situation in the entrepreneurship and labour sectors even worse. However, according to recent lending surveys by the European Central Bank, banks have increased the criteria for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises. The Commission therefore needs to consider and propose measures to facilitate the take-up of funds, especially by countries which are unable to raise their share of cofinancing due to strict austerity measures. The Commission needs to foster cooperation and synergisms between the Structural Funds and the European Investment Bank in order to identify financing instruments that will generate exponential results. The most profitable sectors of each economy must be identified and proper strategic planning is needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much can be said about how crucial SMEs are to helping economic growth and job creation. Whatever might be said, what is certain is that implementing so-called austerity measures leads daily to the strangulation, asphyxiation and destruction of thousands of SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Until we break with and reverse the path of recessive policies, it will be impossible to promote economic growth and job creation. The statements being made in political circles – from the right to the centre-left – of the intention to make austerity incompatible with growth are nothing short of illusory; an attempt to push blindly ahead, and to use fine but ineffective words to hide the tragic and material consequences of austerity policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The very measures imposed by the troika in Portugal provide a good example of this social tragedy. Since these measures were implemented in Portugal one year ago, 203 500 jobs have been destroyed, equating to 558 jobs per day. Many of these jobs have been lost from SMEs because the companies in question went out of business, but it could not have been any other way; and that is so logical that a child could understand it. Wage and pension cuts and increased indirect taxation on the products sold by small and medium-sized enterprises lead to reduced consumption and then to SMEs going out of business.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is the same European Commission that fixes – along with the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank – the measures ravaging Portuguese SMEs that is now telling us about the need to support SMEs. It is true that it is important to support SME creation, but it would also now be logical to stop applying political measures that are condemning existing SMEs to go out of business as we speak.</p>
<p class="contents">Support for SMEs should involve State aid, made available by reversing the process of monopolisation of the economy, which has been exacerbated by the creation of the single market and which has benefited big capital within the Member States, as well as multinationals. There is a need to regulate key factors of production, such as energy or banking, so that SMEs will not, as customers, be subjected to unbearable monopolistic prices, such as the interest rates that they have to pay to access credit. EU funding must be made more accessible to SMEs, by cutting red tape and streamlining processes, by ensuring timely payment, and by positively discriminating in favour of areas and sectors facing particular difficulties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my mobile surgery, that goes around every town and city in the West Midlands on a regular basis, I meet shopkeepers who say they are being strangled by European Union regulation; business rates are too high; there is not enough training; there is not enough access to finance. Yet all they hear of, all the time, is more EU funds – the UK being the second largest contributor to the EU but having few recipients of aid and training.</p>

Today, growth is a universally acknowledged priority. Yet this was not the case until recently, and my group can be rightly proud of having consistently pressed on this matter, in calling for some significant changes to the focus of European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been mentioned, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – which are the productive backbone of the economy – need not only the urgent interventions that will be discussed later but also long-term measures to cultivate the human capital of the young men and women of Europe. These measures must send them the message that a business-oriented outlook and a spirit of enterprise mean more than a career or a question of personal success or adventure. Indeed, these attitudes are also useful to society, because they help to create – through a model of development based on widespread enterprise – the conditions for fairer and more sustainable growth, as Ms Krehl has already said. For we want to see development that is innovative, and that is both able to seize all the new opportunities and sustainable in environmental and social terms.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the long-term efforts, in terms of training, I would also advocate revisiting technical colleges, which are a real asset in Europe, one that we have neglected for too long. These are a great resource and a great way of learning about science and technology, and therefore of getting a taste for creating something new through your own ingenuity.</p>
<p class="contents">As for resources, while still on the subject of urgent action – and I address these remarks especially to the Commission but also to the Council, which together with Parliament, must make a decision on the Structural Funds Regulation – it will be essential to coordinate resources. Shall we be able to use the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs (COSME) funds (the financial instruments for SMEs), the research funds and the Structural Funds in a complementary approach? If we use these resources wisely, in a complementary fashion, then we shall be able to get the most from them; otherwise, we shall risk spreading them too thinly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Structural Funds are indispensable, and they are intrinsically focused on this priority. Nevertheless, Commissioner, while recognising the importance of thematic concentration, I believe that it is also important that the regional authorities should be able to contribute to the planning and decision-making process, because while it is true that many regions need guidance, many others are quite capable of planning and setting priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The regions are key, for they are the engine room of progress, of business growth, of the spirit of new employment, and of the desire to participate, including on the part of all the economic, social and community bodies. Hence, the regions are the main resource where EU policies and the policies of the local authorities must come together. I must emphasise, then, the importance of coordinating resources.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, as regards the definition of SMEs – a subject on which the Member States will have their say, and therefore the Council will need to as well – in my view, what counts is not only the structural elements – employment and turnover – but also the quality of the small and medium-sized enterprises, which operate locally but think globally. I therefore ask that special consideration be given to the fundamental nature of small businesses and their support network. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Participating in projects financed by Structural Funds now offers a real chance for survival. However, European institutions, and especially national governments, retain the vital role of supporting SMEs by means of economic measures which will enable them to gain access to cash and investments so that they can complete the projects which are in progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The effectiveness and efficiency of the funds allocated to the financial instruments for SMEs have been diminished due to a regulatory framework that is inadequate and far too complicated for the different types of financial instruments used. The direct consequence of this is to discourage rather than encourage potential beneficiaries. In order to enable high-quality strategic projects to develop and ensure the biggest possible absorption of the Structural Funds earmarked for this sector, the private sector, immediate, specific measures need to be taken not only to simplify the rules of operation, but also to provide the necessary technical assistance in terms of accessing the funds, implementing the projects and improving entrepreneurial skills. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think this is a question that we should be asking. However, we must make the context clear and if we weaken or water down the definition of SMEs by including mid-caps, there will be less money available to distribute to the SMEs in an area where the funding was already insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if we reduce the cofinancing requirements, overall, fewer SMEs will have to share the available funding. This means that the only option available to us is to increase the money, if we are prepared to do so.

Micro-businesses should be exempted from large swathes of EU legislation and, when they are included, they should have a light-touch regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to funding is also a problem. Some suggest increasing allocations of EU budgets for SMEs, but here again, bureaucracy can be overwhelming. I have had many complaints from small businesses that have taken part in EU projects and have then waited for months or years for payment, and sometimes the money has never arrived. If a company is being contracted to carry out work and the work has been delivered, then it should be paid on time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission claims the Late Payment Directive will solve this problem but, like much EU law, it has had unintended consequences. I know of one sector where large companies have simply cut out buying from smaller ones. We need to stop just talking about SMEs, and take some action.

Despite the fact that in the current programming period, the allocation of resources in my country is relatively high, representatives of small firms are, however, pointing out that interest in these funds and demand for them is higher than the amount available.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that a specific feature of the Polish SME sector is that it is dominated by very small firms – micro-entities. These comprise as many as 96% of all SMEs, of which over two-thirds involve self-employment – the people who run these firms are self-employed. So it is necessary to remove numerous barriers, including most of all the growing bureaucracy. Furthermore, at a time of deepening recession, a difficulty is presented by the fact that there is a general deficit of the own resources necessary in the EU system of cofinancing. It is also necessary to give attention to the waiting period for these resources, which is too long, as well as to the fact that advance payments are not made for these projects. The European Parliament should therefore simplify and improve procedures when it starts work on drafting new rules in 2013. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In preparation for this debate, I visited one of those projects in which European money from the Structural Funds is being used to preserve industrial heritage and provide the opportunity to start up new businesses. In the space of two years, 400 jobs have been directly created, and around a thousand jobs have been brought about. The idea, then, is to use existing instruments, along with the investment of private capital, to bring local and regional authorities together.</p>
<p class="contents">I have three questions about this for the Commissioner and the Minister.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, is it not possible for the financial framework for 2014-2020, which we are now discussing, and which frees up some new money again, so-called revolving funds, to be moved up the agenda? We have a Council, an informal Council, coming up. There is a summit coming up. Should this not be used as precisely the opportunity to send a political signal? By which I mean a signal with which we provide clarity about heading 1 of the multiannual financial framework. Then, money will be released again.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is, would it not be possible for you to ask each individual Member State to produce a real action plan for SMEs? Why is that necessary, you may ask. The reason is that a number of Member States are still stuck in a bureaucratic muddle in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that there are improvements we can make, we can cut red tape. By way of example, pre-financing for projects is still a major problem. The banks are not providing it, and companies do not have the money. We need to put a stop to this and create momentum. Could I have an answer to these three questions please? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union is doing lots on that, but there are still plenty of things that could be done in addition.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, on access to finance, we definitely need to increase possibilities for advance payments, especially for micro and small companies. It is very difficult for them to go for cofinancing.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the next multiannual financial framework (MMF), we need to look at things again. I am the rapporteur on the next MFF. There is a proportionate decrease in cohesion funding and a decrease in the access of SMEs to financing. Yes, there is increased access to financing for cutting-edge high technologies, but how many small and medium-sized enterprises maintain cutting-edge technologies? All in all, this will lead to a decrease in financing for SMEs under the next MFF.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, again on cofinancing, we have been considering something the President of the Commission suggested, which is to use funds not spent by the end of the current framework period not only to stimulate employment, but also to stimulate SMEs. As regards red tape, one should not only make available and promote best practices, but also penalise bad practices, because it is absolutely inadmissible that in some Member States, funds earmarked for small and medium-sized enterprises remain unspent, for whatever reason – be this administrative or otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, on enabling access to markets, this is very important in terms of enlarging the digital market – there are plenty of things to be done and we are moving forward with the digital agenda – and also in terms of the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Small and medium-sized enterprises do not have appropriate access to European markets at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is no one simple answer to the problem of SMEs’ lack of access to credit. My colleague, Sharon Bowles, has been doing her best through amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive, but SMEs need other avenues to finance in addition to bank lending.</p>
<p class="contents">Crucially, along with the financial instrument itself, there must be proportionate corporate auditing and reporting standards, because there is no point in making finance theoretically available to SMEs if there is so much red tape that in practice, no small business has time to put in an application.

A large percentage of the unemployed used to work in such enterprises; at the same time, owners of such enterprises lose their job, which is often overlooked in the unemployment rates. Today, we have a dual problem, because small and medium-sized enterprises are unable to access either loans or financing under European programmes. It is a fact that, currently, 80% of loan applications by small and medium-sized enterprises are turned down in Greece. This means that there is no money either to take action or to import raw materials or products and they end up going under. On the other hand, the current terms of access to European financing do not allow small and medium-sized enterprises to take action, because they need to spend the capital first, because VAT is not eligible and because, in the end, they have to wait a long time to get back the money they have spent. That is impossible if they go under. We therefore need to change, so that we can put what the Commissioner said into practice. Every small and medium-sized enterprise needs to take on one young person and we need to combine financing for small and medium-sized enterprises with financing to address youth unemployment, so that these targets can be attained. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are the backbone of our economy and access to sufficient capital has been a particular problem for them during the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">A recent study carried out by the European Parliament shows that the existing funding instruments are not adequately targeted. The reason for this is that a proper distinction is not being made between the different types of SME. They are not a homogeneous group, either in terms of the number of people they employ or of their turnover. One consideration is the company’s current phase of development. A young and innovative entrepreneur who is just building up his business has different requirements from a traditional family company.</p>

They represent the greatest source of new jobs, and it is to SMEs that the economy owes its growth.</p>
<p class="contents">According to European statistics for 2005-2010, 85% of new jobs were created in SMEs. In Europe, 99% of firms are SMEs employing up to a dozen or so people. In this context, it is worrying to see the position of the Commission, which is proposing a change in the definition of SMEs by extending it to include firms with larger numbers of employees. Does this mean, Commissioner Hahn, that SMEs are going to have to compete for support with firms which have several hundred employees and which have well-prepared staff whose only role is to secure EU funding? Will this not create difficulties in obtaining support for scientific research and innovations in the framework programme, where awards are made on a top-down basis?</p>
<p class="contents">You said, Commissioner Hahn, that SMEs are the backbone of the European economy. We all know that we should take particular care of our spine. Without increased access to EU funds, without reducing administration and without simplifying the process of applying for funds, which is complicated and too protracted, the Commission, Commissioner Hahn, will be one of the many voices in the European Parliament which have pointed out the problem and understood the reasons for its existence, but which, unfortunately, have not resolved it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I think, like many of my fellow Members, that their access to Structural Funds should be simplified and increased, but also promoted through training and support related to the procedures that are inherent to accessing these funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I also recognise that the legal framework in which they are developing must be adapted to the resources they have available to them in order to face up to their obligations, and that is where the definition of SMEs becomes important, as this will determine the law applicable to a company. The current definition would cover more that 67% of workers in the EU. It is therefore an important sector of our economy and of the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">As is often the case in our legislative decisions, we need to find a balance. As for SMEs, their legal framework should combine both the objective of effectiveness, allowing for their development, and the objective of adequate protection of workers’ rights and the general interest. However, an unbalanced reduction of SMEs’ administrative burdens could entail a risk, for example, in terms of health and safety at work – workers cannot be subjected to different risks, particularly with regard to measures aimed at improving workers’ health and safety in the workplace; health and safety in the workplace cannot be considered an administrative burden – or even in terms of reducing accounting and financial obligations for some SMEs, which is particularly worrying for workers’ representatives, and rightly so in my view. How can we involve workers in company decision-making processes if they do not have the information based on which decisions about restructuring, for example, are made? A minimum level of transparency for workers and third parties is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in the hunt for excessive administrative burdens on SMEs, let us not lose sight of the objective of these burdens and let us not discriminate against the workers in these companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not need to invent any new growth funds, which is what the left-wing governments in Europe are currently calling for. However, we do need to ensure that the EUR 350 billion currently being proposed is carefully targeted and quickly reaches the people in the regions who need it. During this process, we can learn from the practical implementation of European structural policy, in particular, where competitive procedures were used and where companies had to compete for EU money. In the competitiveness regions, we have introduced more medium-sized companies to European programmes than ever before. One example is the field of nanotechnology, where some regions have succeeded in combining cutting-edge European research and start-up companies. Competitions have also been successfully held in areas such as energy efficiency and sustainable production processes.</p>
<p class="contents">Competitive procedures are efficient and they represent the opposite of the scattergun approach. Therefore, we must incorporate this option in the Structural Funds regulations, as has already been done in the Connecting Europe Facility in the field of infrastructure. In the case of small companies, European stimuli are often a decisive factor for start-ups and for international business relationships. Providing this funding in the context of a competition is very similar to the way in which the market economy works and this is known to be very efficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we have heard this morning does not differ significantly from what has been said in previous debates.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, first of all, to say something to Ms Ford, whose speech I listened to. Of course, it is not at all helpful to make an organisation responsible for the fact that things are not going as we would like. I do not believe that it is the European Commission’s fault that in certain respects, SMEs are not making the progress that we had hoped for.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe that restricting the discussion purely to financing issues does not help us. Where I come from in Germany, and I believe that this is not the case only in Germany, SMEs are not so much concerned about financing, although, of course, this may be a problem in individual situations. Primarily, they are worried about the fact that the legislation is so complex that it has become completely incomprehensible. Therefore, I believe that the discussion on the issue of how the definition of an SME can be made better, more precise and more targeted is an important matter, not only for SMEs, but in general terms for our legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that 99.5% of all companies are SMEs, and, Mr Wammen, you mentioned this, shows that we have a problem, because in principle, this means that all companies are affected and, therefore, our measures are not being accurately targeted. For this reason, I am very interested to see the results of Mr Tajani’s study, which aims to produce a new and more precise definition.</p>

<p class="contents">I also believe that SMEs have very different interests.

<p class="contents">Perhaps the most worrying thing is that, while Member States are endeavouring to balance their economies, value added tax is now being increased in almost all countries, making it difficult for small service companies. When value added tax goes up, prices rise, and when, at the same time, people’s pay and pensions are cut, there is no demand, and generating demand is now a key issue for service companies, Commissioner Hahn.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Commission really needs to make every effort to get us out of this economic crisis, and fast. Furthermore, the Member States have to be involved in the process: everything else is of less importance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If not, you should get to know him. Around 20 years ago, Mr Hanselmann founded a company with three colleagues from the University of Paderborn. Now it has 1 000 employees. He received a loan from the state subsidy system in North Rhine-Westphalia to set up his company. This shows that state subsidies for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and subsidised loans are helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">We need an initiative in Europe to promote the start-up of SMEs. The aid available must be made simpler. It must have lower thresholds and involve less red tape. One approach could be innovation vouchers. In addition, we must reallocate the unused money from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund so that SMEs in Greece, for example, can obtain loans. However, to be able to do this, we also need different banking systems. One possibility would be cooperative banks and savings banks which the outlying countries in particular do not have. We need both things: a solution for the outlying countries and a policy for highly innovative companies in wealthier regions which will reinforce their strengths.

Small businesses are often established and run by people with only primary or secondary education. Therefore, both small businesses and entrepreneurs need simple rules for their establishment, operation, accounting and also their taxation. If we fail to force our governments to push through a simple and transparent scheme for the operation of small and medium-sized enterprises with a minimum of bureaucracy, officials in our countries will continue to bully small businesses.

They also play the role of a major employer, especially because all the large companies tend to have their headquarters in the Asian countries, mainly for cost reasons, which I personally consider to be socially and politically inappropriate, and I hope, Commissioner, that in the future, this Parliament will also discuss this topic. The economic crisis, however, has hit small and medium-sized enterprises hard. Although they are currently facing a difficult period in an effort to survive, they are much more successful than larger firms and are also more adaptable to the market situation. Paradoxically, they find it more difficult to gain financial support than large companies. In the light of the above facts and the enormous importance and the contribution of SMEs to the European economy, we need to focus on finding new ways to use the Structural Funds. We must focus on removing bureaucratic and administrative barriers and generally simplify the provision of credit to SMEs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The economic recovery will obviously come about through better use of public resources to help companies that are creating jobs, primarily small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We should therefore recall that the 23 million SMEs in Europe are vital for economic development in our regions. Yet they have structural difficulties when it comes to obtaining financing, and the current crisis has only aggravated the situation. In February, we were already debating the use of regional funds here in Parliament to better combat youth unemployment and support SMEs. The Court of Auditors’ March report confirmed what we had already known for a long time: SMEs’ access to financial engineering instruments is far too complicated.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the Commission set aside a budget of EUR 27 billion for SMEs for this period. Do we know what has become of that budget? We all know the difficulties they are facing. The time has come, not so much to debate the definition of SMEs, but to determine how we can best take into account their differences and their needs when implementing our policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the time of just under two and a half minutes that has been allocated to me, it will unfortunately not be possible for me to give a detailed answer to all the questions that have been asked, but you will receive a reply in writing. I would like to summarise some of the main issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the current period and it is correct that restructuring measures are under way. However, it is now the job of the Member States to make appropriate proposals. You can be sure that the Commission will not only look favourably at the proposals, but will also take a proactive approach to all of those which aim to subsidise small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and to combat unemployment, in particular among young people. I would like to ask for your support in your Member States and in your constituencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, subsidies for SMEs have often been discussed, in some cases with a focus on the future. For the forthcoming financial period, we have made highly specific proposals for the minimum funding in the budget to support SMEs. In my introductory speech, I said that 80% would go to the less developed regions and 50% to the more developed regions. I have listened to discussions in the Council and in this House which have been critical of these limits. If you really believe that we should invest in SMEs, in innovation and in competitiveness, I would ask you to make every effort to safeguard this minimum allocation in the budget. We definitely need to identify tailor-made solutions for the individual regions in future, using the best available banks, which should also be subject to a certain amount of competition. I agree with all those people who are critical of the fact that the mobilisation of the funds takes too long, from the start of the process through to the money reaching the beneficiaries. I also think this is too long-winded and we will see what we can do in future to improve the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that one important measure, and other speakers have also mentioned this, could involve, for example, that part of the future financial framework, in other words, heading 1, which specifically concerns sustainable growth and which amounts to around EUR 500 billion. We could make a clear statement before the summer that this money will be available in the next financial period. This would definitely send out a strong signal to the citizens of Europe and also to the markets which would give them the security to plan ahead and to decide where investments should be made. I can imagine that this would provide an impetus and an incentive and that growth would be reinforced by concrete actions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of the economic situation, on behalf of the Presidency, I would like to lend my support to this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to financing for small and medium-sized enterprises is crucial if we are to be able to continue to benefit from the economic growth to which small and medium-sized enterprises contribute, especially innovative companies. For the same reason, the Presidency is working on projects such as the creation of an internal market for venture capital, and is also trying to get as far as we can with the proposed Programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs (COSME).</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must ensure a good environment for small and medium-sized enterprises that provides them with the best framework conditions to allow them to develop and grow. In this connection, I should like to express my thanks for the many contributions made, including those from Mr Bendtsen and Ms Krehl. I have listened with great interest to the possibilities for combining work on energy efficiency with the creation of jobs for small and medium-sized enterprises. Both are very important priorities for the Danish Presidency, as part of our efforts to create green growth and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s Small Business Act of 2008 was also a significant step, and we must also emphasise the efforts made in many Member States. As an extension of this, the Presidency has chosen to focus on streamlining and the simplification of rules, such as the rules on tendering. Simpler rules on tendering will make it easier for SMEs to bid for contracts. Another example is the initiative to create a genuinely digital internal market, which is crucial for giving small and medium-sized enterprises access to growth opportunities. Thirdly, and this answers Mr Kalfin, Mr Rübig, Mr van Nistelrooij and others, an important element of the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework (MFF) involves ensuring that a greater portion of the EU budget is earmarked for growth-promoting measures, including both research and development, and enabling the resources of the Structural Funds to target these areas to a greater extent. This is an important part of the work that the Danish Presidency is carrying out in respect of the MFF agreement for the period 2014-2020.</p>
<p class="contents">On that basis, I would like to thank the European Parliament for the support it has given to the Presidency’s work, and I am looking forward to the great efforts that we will make together – Parliament, the Commission and the Council – to ensure that Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises once again experience growth so that we can create jobs, not least for the millions of young people who have an expectation that together, we will deliver results for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The job loss in Ireland’s SME sector in recent years equates to 15% of the workforce. It is the same across the EU. I welcome the Programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs which is to be implemented from 2014 to 2020 with a budget of EUR 2.5 billion. For those currently in charge of enterprises, however, 2014 is a long way away. I ask the Commission to provide information on the measures to be adopted by it immediately, in cooperation with Member States, to help SMEs in the short term. The obstacles to funding must be tackled without delay, along with excessive red tape and excessive administration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The continuing crisis situation has left more than 25 million EU citizens unemployed and it is therefore necessary to exploit the potential of small and medium-sized business to contribute to reducing unemployment and creating jobs. I believe that access to financing is one of the main problems remaining, which is making the situation for small business worse. The Council member mentioned that over the period 2007-2014, small and medium-sized enterprises will have access to approximately EU 70 billion in financial assistance from the Structural Funds and various programmes for small business administered by the European Investment Bank. However, some years ago, there were more than a few misgivings about the effectiveness of assistance allocated because it emerged that the Member State commercial banks administering EIB financing during the crisis tightened lending conditions even more and this hampered SMEs’ opportunities to receive assistance from EU funds. The lack of information in the Member States about the accessibility of such financial assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises also remains a major barrier to using the assistance allocated. I believe that the Commission must provide data about the assistance that has so far been allocated to SMEs, how it was distributed in the Member States, and assess the effectiveness of that assistance and determine the most effective principles for the provision of assistance, so that SMEs can take advantage of financing opportunities in a timely manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, the instruments aimed at improving access to funding play a vital role. In Romania, SMEs account for 99.7% of all companies. In addition, they generate two-thirds of jobs. Funding is, indeed, one of the most serious problems that SMEs face as only 15% of them receive any credit from banks. This is why it is vital for them to be involved in projects financed by the Structural Funds as they provide an important source of development for small and medium-sized enterprises. The JEREMIE holding fund is subsidised in my country by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), and its objectives are to achieve sustainable growth in the production sector. At the same time, another aim is to create an environment conducive to the development of businesses by adopting a flexible strategic approach. So far, roughly 6 000 contracts outlining funding have been signed, aimed at the SME sector, as part of the development programmes. I should emphasise the importance of retaining initiatives of this kind as part of the future cohesion policy. At the same time, I welcome the use of European funds in supporting the creation of SMEs, in particular by young people. This will spark the entrepreneurial spirit among them, thereby also ensuring economic growth and a decline in the unemployment rate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Equally, SMEs are the hardest hit when it comes to the application of heavy handed and unnecessary over-regulation by Brussels. The UK Government pledged to financially support small businesses and free up capital for investment yet have done nothing to hold banks accountable when they have failed to meet the prescribed targets – despite the government and taxpayer being a major shareholder in two high street banks. This issue does not require action from the EU, as such action, in line with all other EU policy making, is liable to be counterproductive to its objectives. Instead, it requires competence and commitment from the UK Government, which could only be achieved if the UK left the European Union and freed British business from the shackles of European regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

SMEs have proven their job potential in the past – 85% of all new jobs created in the EU between 2002-10 were in SMEs – and can do so again. Over the past couple of years, the EIB has provided loans of EUR 250 million to Irish banks for onward lending to SMEs. It is not clear how much of this has actually reached SMEs.

It is therefore important that the currently applicable definitions of ‘micro-’, ‘small-’ and ‘medium-sized’ enterprises not be changed. The proposal to raise the size limit for a medium-sized enterprise from 250 to 1 000 employees would effectively create a two-tier system in which companies of quite dissimilar size and wealth would be categorised together, thus inevitably favouring the larger organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

New innovative businesses need to have better access to financial support in the form of start-up aid. The Commission must take the following specific steps, which are essential in facilitating the implementation of an entrepreneurial framework: - draft a plan for launching on the market and selling innovative products; - devise a clear strategy to ensure that every European citizen has the opportunity to work in another Member State; - establish a new set of measures for SMEs in order to implement a new energy efficiency plan. The economic crisis will persist as long as there are no jobs.

In practice, SMEs are still faced with significant bureaucratic obstacles. While large organisations can afford to hire experts to help them to take advantage of all the loopholes, over-regulation is thwarting small companies at every turn, taking up much of their time and money and, as a result, slowing down economic activity. In particular, the increasingly stringent regulations imposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision have been draining the financial lifeblood from SMEs, which are already under-capitalised. In addition, these companies have been hard hit by the slowdown in economic growth caused by the sovereign debt crisis. Against the background of the global recession, the business climate for SMEs has deteriorated. It is still easy for large companies to access subsidies, while medium-sized businesses are almost reduced to begging. If 99% of European businesses, which are also the largest employers, have access to only 10 to 15% of European funding, it is high time that the EU’s system of subsidising large companies and multinationals is changed, by renationalising the subsidy system. In addition, tendering processes and public procurement must finally be made more SME-friendly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It offers Member States the opportunity to use part of their EU Structural Funds to finance small and medium-sized enterprises by means of equity, loans or guarantees through a revolving holding fund. At present, one of the toughest problems encountered by SMEs in attracting Structural Funds is the lack of cofinancing capacity. Indeed, in the present climate, continuing, developing and diversifying initiatives like JEREMIE as part of the future cohesion policy would be necessary and beneficial to many entrepreneurs. However, far more effort ought to be made to raise public awareness of initiatives of this kind among those interested in this, with efficient measures also being required to cut the excessive red tape. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the situation of SMEs and the use of European Union funding should be made more efficient and that it must be ensured that there is no repeat of the liquidity crisis which took place during the financial crisis and which had a particularly strong effect on SMEs. Another extremely important issue is the reduction in bureaucracy in order to ensure that SMEs have greater and easier access to support from Structural Funds, and also to ensure the subsequent monitoring of its use. The requirements for the preparation and submission of annual reports and financial reporting by SMEs should also be harmonised and simplified in order to reduce their administrative burden.

Many of them are going under at the expense of the creation of a grey economy. It is therefore a good thing that the Commission has come up with proposals for SMEs to have the opportunity to gain access to the Structural Funds. During the crisis, there has been a tightening of credit conditions, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. Therefore, increasing the capacity of loan guarantee programmes, investment in equity funds and micro-credit programmes for SMEs is a way for services and employment to develop and grow. However, together with these new measures, we need tighter, more thorough supervision of compliance with current guidelines which are designed to create conditions for the stabilisation and growth of SMEs, for example, Directive 2011/7/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 on combating late payment in commercial transactions. This directive requires public authorities to make payments within 30 days. The facts are alarming: if small and medium-sized enterprises want to win a contract, they are forced to negotiate repayment terms of 2-4 months, both in the public and governmental sectors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have heard a great deal over recent weeks about actions to kick start growth and combat unemployment, especially among young people. This kick start to growth could begin with SMEs and with action to strengthen their competitiveness. European money has already contributed a great deal to this sector, but I am convinced that much more can be done. We must ensure in the new programming period for cohesion policy that we include long-term actions that will improve access for SMEs to the Structural Funds and simplify procedures, so as to relieve the administrative burden and cut the red tape that often gets in the way of their business.

At the end of the European Council meeting in January 2012, Dr Barroso suggested that the Member States should restructure EUR 82 billion of Community funds, and Portugal has already submitted its strategic plan. It is therefore crucial that the Commission reach a quick decision on this plan, so that it can come into force quickly. Recently, in this very Chamber in Strasbourg, the European Commission tabled a new package of measures intended to create more job opportunities and to support entrepreneurship. I believe that SMEs should have easier access to the new package of measures, and that an action plan should be set out including targets and metrics for their implementation.
