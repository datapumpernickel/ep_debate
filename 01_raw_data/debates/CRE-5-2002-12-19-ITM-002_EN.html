<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the issue of public services is the subject of a major debate in Europe and elsewhere, and the general trend observed during the past 20 years has been a development of the role of the public authority, which no longer produces directly but regulates and establishes the rules for the game. This is the case in Europe, in particular, where the goal – which was also a necessity – of creating a single market has certainly facilitated this development.</p>
<p class="contents">Experience has shown that the creation of a single market based on the system of healthy competition is fully compatible with socioeconomic concerns, of which services of general interest are one of the most practical elements. Furthermore, a higher level of competition throughout the economy has led to an increase in the effectiveness of services of general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The history of the Community has always been consistent. At each new stage in European integration, progress has been made towards both freer movement of goods, persons, services and capital and greater inclusiveness and cohesion. Each step forward in the area of the internal market has gone hand in hand with the introduction of measures to ensure that the weaker regions and citizens are not left lagging behind. This was the case as regards the Single Act and the case at Maastricht and Amsterdam too. One example is the inclusion in the Treaty of the policy of economic and social cohesion, of consumer protection and of environment policy, all of which are intended to complement and balance the strategies of opening up the markets and liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 16 of the Treaty, introduced at Amsterdam, explicitly recognises the role of services of economic general interest. It confirms the need to find a better way of reconciling harmoniously and coherently the principles relating to services of general interest and the other objectives of the Treaty, particularly the internal market and free competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has always recognised the primordial role of services of general interest. In its 1996 communication on services of general interest in Europe, it proposed a reference to the promotion of these services. The sectoral legislation adopted at Community level relating to major network industries, particularly the energy sector, contains extremely ambitious goals as regards high quality public services.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Commission has always applied competition and market rules in such a way as to avoid the supply and development of high quality services of general interest being hindered. I could mention by way of example the communication on public broadcasting, introducing rules on state aid, which was drawn up by Mr Monti and myself last year and which is an example of the way we can apply competition rules intelligently while giving governments all the leeway they need to organise public services properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Services of general interest are thus an essential component of the European model of society. They contribute to the citizens’ quality of life and are an essential condition if the citizens are to be able to exercise many of their rights fully.</p>
<p class="contents">In its report to the Laeken Council, the Commission declared its intention, and I quote: ‘to examine the suggestion to consolidate and specify the principles on services of general interest underlying Article 16 of the Treaty in a framework directive’</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission decided to carry out this examination within the framework of a Green Paper. There are two main reasons why it has adopted this approach. Firstly, the questions raised are very broad in scope and cannot be addressed in a debate limited to a proposal for a framework directive. Secondly, given the expectations and existence of very different positions with regard to the feasibility of a framework directive and the added value it would represent, it appeared essential to establish a reference framework first. We must not underestimate the technical and conceptual problems which would certainly be raised by the establishment of a framework directive either.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Paper will allow the Commission firstly to examine whether a framework directive would be appropriate and secondly to launch a large-scale debate on the overall issue. Therefore, the purpose of this Green Paper is not to delay the feasibility study on a framework directive. Quite the opposite: given the diversity of the traditions, structures and positions existing in the Member States, only a broad European-level debate will be able to draw out enough common ground for an overall Community framework to be established. In addition, alongside the preparation of the Green Paper, we are working on other dossiers, particularly in the area of the application of rules on state aid and in the field of the evaluation of services. This work could, moreover, be a useful contribution to the Green Paper. As regards the timetable, the Green Paper should be adopted in March 2003 and the conclusions drawn before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">This, Mr President, is the Commission’s statement on this matter.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Langen (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Reding's task today is a difficult one, to make a statement on the Commission's behalf on action that the Commission has been putting off for a year. It is the case that, thirteen months ago, Parliament delivered its opinion on services of general interest by a well-supported vote, with 435 votes being cast in the final vote. Since then, the Commission has done little. It has submitted four documents. The latter two of these, submitted before the Copenhagen Summit, just as the submission of the others six months ago preceded that in Seville, say nothing more than that rulings are awaited from the European Court of Justice. I do not at all understand, Commissioner, why the Commission does not have its proposals debated here in Parliament, openly and with no holds barred. If, as in this case, you gaze fixedly at the European Court of Justice in the same way that a rabbit gazes fixedly at a snake, you are not acting as if all options were available to you.</p>
<p class="contents">Although, Commissioner, you are affected by this only tangentially, this being primarily a matter for the Competition Commissioner, it is for this reason that I really do want to insist with some emphasis that the Commission should not just hand out ‘non-papers’ that it sends to governments – the last was on 12 November this year – but should involve Parliament in this debate. We are not prepared to take the rap for whatever decisions the Commission comes up with if Parliament cannot be properly involved in the legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">So let me say quite bluntly that, as you have already mentioned, we called for a framework directive. We called for a framework directive on the basis of Article 95, which deals with the internal market. That means that this public debate on the basis of Article 95 leads to a decision by Parliament and the Council by way of the codecision procedure. What has been submitted to us so far says only that previous procedure in competition policy was being followed, in other words, that a decision by the Council would be sufficient, that Parliament would be informed and should then see what happens next. It is exactly as you have said: the topic will give rise to a great debate on social and economic policy. Far from being something that the Commission can sort out with the Council behind closed doors, that must be done in public view, here in the directly-elected Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why I make these somewhat pointed observations is that these issues are dealt with in none of these documents, which are numerous and of varying quality, the non-paper being far and away the best of those that have been submitted. The evaluation methodology set out in the summer was put together so carelessly, and was of such poor quality, that it cannot serve as a basis on which to raise proper awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission to stop biding its time and do the business at long last! The European Court of Justice's ruling in the Ferring case is a workable basis on which to evaluate state aid and public services. I call upon you to be prompt in submitting decisions based on it and to delay no longer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Lancker (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would naturally like to thank the Commissioner for her announcement and for the prospect of a Green Paper. However, I do not often find myself in complete agreement with what Mr Langen has said. My group is particularly disappointed with the Commission’s reluctance to proceed with presenting the European Parliament with a framework directive. As you yourself said, services of general interest are the cornerstone of our European social model. I am talking about people’s social rights, basic facilities such as water, energy, public transport, communication and healthcare, which are furthermore essential for social cohesion and for the proper functioning of our economies. My group, and in fact the whole of Parliament, has been pressing for this framework directive for years. Even the Council is ahead of the Commission, as the Council pressed for this framework directive in Nice and then much more explicitly in Barcelona. Despite this, the Commission insists on broad consultation first via a Green Paper in the spring of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that the problems surrounding services of general interest are complex. I understand the differences in approach between the Member States. I know that there are public and private players involved, and it is therefore true that there are differences depending on the sector. However, in the meantime we are constantly being confronted with standpoints concerning the liberalisation of various sectors in the economy without having a framework directive that sets out the general principles. Let there be no misunderstanding: my group is in favour of the internal market, subject to certain social and ecological adjustments. However, the market is an instrument, and the market has its limits, and when it comes to people’s basic social rights, it is not the rules of the market and competition that should be laying down the rules of play.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Paper will furthermore arrive too late to contribute to the discussion in the Convention about the role of services of general interest. We are already holding this discussion at this moment. We will be completing it in February, and the Commission will not be presenting a Green Paper until March. I think that the Commission will be missing the boat.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is one last reason, one fact that causes me great concern, and that has to do with Mr Langen's comments. So far the Commission has always assumed that Member States were allowed to finance their services of general interest as a social mandate without this being regarded as illicit state support – and rightly so, in my opinion. However, the Treaty is undeniably lacking in clarity. Recent conclusions by two advocates-general at the European Court of Justice have demonstrated that this principle is no longer above suspicion. The Commission will now obviously conclude that they cannot give legal security to Member States in the area of the financing of services of general interest. So what has happened to this much-vaunted autonomy to organise their own public services? Ladies and gentlemen, the conclusion is clear to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we will immediately ask the Commission to issue a framework directive, as we have repeatedly done.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Convention must provide the opportunity to establish the basic principles of public services with complete respect for the powers of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, our constitution must clearly specify that services of general interest are our people’s social rights and must not be left to market rules and competition. I hope that the Commission can support us in our ambitions.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallis (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, I was going to say on behalf of my group that we are pleased to see that a Green Paper is forthcoming, but perhaps I am in the minority in saying that I am pleased to see that a Green Paper is forthcoming in the sense that something is actually happening. The promise of future consultation and feasibility studies is to be welcomed, but this should not be an excuse for doing nothing. In that sense I agree with my colleagues that something has to happen sooner rather than later. Process can be important, and we must get that right.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two points on behalf of my group, the first relating to competition. Competition is excellent – we agree with the internal market – in that it is a way of raising standards generally and can also be a way of raising standards in the services concerned, but not for its own sake. Perhaps it would be interesting to look at a country outside the EU – Switzerland – in terms of energy policy. Recently the Swiss had a referendum to ascertain whether they should liberalise their energy provision, presently provided by their local cantons. Swiss citizens voted against this because they were not satisfied that choice in that sense would raise standards – it might just prove confusing. That question was put to the citizens of Switzerland. We, on the other hand, are waiting for a framework to establish how we should introduce such choices across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue of particular importance to my group is universal services provision. This guarantees social cohesion across Europe. Taking my own constituency, for instance, and the current issue of broadband, letters are flooding into my office from constituents in rural areas who complain that broadband is available in certain cities, but not for them.</p>

I believe that services of general interest are at the heart of European integration, or rather that they ought to be.</p>
<p class="contents">Although their place and role in the Union are indeed recognised, in principle, in Article 16 of the Treaty, they are still subject to competition rules, with all the ensuing consequences. There has been growing pressure for faster liberalisation in many sectors. The Brussels European Summit, last March, was a decisive moment in this sense, moreover. Energy, transport, a new era for the postal services sector: the recurring argument is that liberalisation would be the solution to the need to modernise these services. This is not true, as we can see from numerous examples. I believe that one of the functions of services of general interest is to ensure social and territorial cohesion. They must guarantee access to high quality services for all citizens throughout the whole of the territory and at the same price. However, the rules of profitability and the principle of competition run counter to these objectives and these functions.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens’ needs as regards high quality European public services are currently being expressed in many Union countries. The drawing-up of common European rules allowing harmonisation from the top downwards has become a necessity, particularly in view of enlargement. The modernisation of services of general interest must be part of a measure not seeking to open up the market to competition but intended to respond to the needs expressed. That requires genuine democratisation and the genuine participation of workers and users in the development of these services. In this connection, the European Union has a particular responsibility. It must, first of all, allow a proper evaluation to be carried out of the different liberalisation processes, country by country. Despite calls from the European Parliament on a number of occasions, this evaluation of the consequences for safety, the environment, quality and social concerns has never been carried out. Why?</p>
<p class="contents">I too believe that we cannot wait for a Green Paper to be drawn up in a few months’ time to address this issue, however useful a Green Paper might be. Although a Green Paper might serve some purpose, I feel that services of general interest should no longer be seen as an exception to competition as they have been hitherto but, quite the opposite, that they must be seen as one of the European Union’s priority responsibilities. They must therefore no longer be subject to competition. Work is being carried out on a new Treaty within the framework of the work of the Convention with a view to the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference. We must address this issue in the debate on the Treaty. It is time to listen to the demands of the citizens, of the trade unions, which are demonstrating everywhere in a plea for high quality services. These demands go hand in hand with the need for a Europe of social progress, a more democratic Europe. That is why we cannot be content with a minimal definition of a European universal service. We must be ambitious for social Europe. We must place services of general interest at the centre of European integration and European citizenship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have already heard more sense from the Commission, when it started to express a doubt precisely as to this ability of competition law to bring about the achievement of all the social and environmental objectives. I believe that, in actual fact, we, and the Commission, in particular, would find it much easier to make these self-congratulatory statements if we had an evaluation, as my fellow Members have said. I feel that there is absolutely nothing to be gained in any quarter by underestimating the huge expectations of the European citizens, who are demanding more services, better quality and a higher level of safety. I believe that, if we were to turn a deaf ear to the doubts being expressed today regarding the continuity and sustainability of these services, particularly since<span class="bold"> </span>they have been called into question as a result of disasters and<span class="bold"> </span>particularly since this deterioration is currently evident in a number of public services, we would be severely jeopardising the future of Europe and the result of the decision that its citizens will have to take on the future Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">You have decided to open a broad consultation<span class="bold"> </span>process<span class="bold"> </span>on the Green Paper. It is true that this initiative is very surprising, given its connection with the – extremely problematic – debates that we wish to hold within the Convention with a view to fully enshrining the right to public service in the future European Constitution. I would therefore like to hear you speak about the organisation of the agendas, for it would appear quite incredible that a debate should be opened on the feasibility or usefulness of a framework directive under the current Treaties, even if the aim of the debate is to achieve the recognition of and basis for a European approach to public services in the future Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, as regards the consultation procedure, we have already been sufficiently traumatised by a number of proposals which were clearly going against a whole range of different interests within European society. I would like the Commission to explain clearly which public method of hearing will be used to enable the different players – users, trade unions, NGOs, local and regional authorities etc. – to make themselves heard during this consultation on the Green Paper. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the Commission’s concern continues to focus too heavily on the first point and too little on the second, the distortion of competition. This is not surprising, because the governments, and, therefore, the Council, are pushing in this direction because of the existence of<span class="bold"> </span>a clear conflict of interests. There are key sectors, such as the telecommunications, energy, water, transport, television and media sectors, in which the governments are both referees and players, they have to juggle with a burdensome conflict of interests, they are not regulators and legislators, they themselves are entrepreneurs with large multinational businesses which are sometimes used for political and other ends. Today, this conflict of interests has yet to be resolved in many European countries. Indeed, in these sectors, a no-man’s-land is being created where, rather than the good of the European consumer and the general interest, the specific interests of companies and of the economic and political potentates associated with them are being pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">There are countless cases of the allocation of inappropriate market spaces to such companies. One example is <span class="italic">Deutsche Post</span>, which uses its monopolist’s profit in the postal services sector to overcome competition through take-overs too, as happened in the case of <span class="italic">DHL International</span>, which <span class="italic">Deutsche Post</span> acquired, exploiting its monopolist’s profit to knock a competitor out of the market. Not to mention <span class="italic">EDF</span>: France agreed to work towards opening up its energy sector within the country, in the sure knowledge that <span class="italic">EDF</span>, which was 100% state-owned and not quoted on the Stock Exchange and which could give loans guaranteed by the state, would acquire companies abroad, in Italy and elsewhere, in other words that it would go shopping, consolidating a dominant position in the European market. Then, in Italy, there is the case of a major television company such as the <span class="italic">RAI</span>, financed with huge sums of taxpayers’ money, which competes in every way with other television companies as a commercial channel.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the situation: there are public services which ultimately create state companies that distort competition. When the states have freed themselves from all the companies, it might be easier to imagine a regulatory state, a state which contracts out or puts out to tender services which it considers that the market alone cannot provide adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one last point, Mr President, Commissioner. There is a service, the mobile telephone service, which the Commission does not deem to be a service of general interest. I feel that this is a serious mistake and that, now, the mobile telephone service is to all intents and purposes a service of general interest. Indeed, it is one of the services which is provided most effectively throughout Europe, extremely efficiently and with optimum prices, and it is a service of general interest which the market provides through a system of competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That being so, I want to give an example of how we in this House can bring some influence to bear. If we were actually to manage to at last make some progress with the legislation on local public transport, we would have done a substantial chunk of Parliament's and the Council's work. Here, for once, I would like to give the Commission credit for submitting a very specific proposal for a regulation on local public transport as long ago as 2000. We in this House delivered an unambiguous opinion on it in 2001. And what is the Council doing? It has shoved the draft in a drawer, done nothing with it, and still does not want to do anything with it. I believe that we have to make it clear to the Council that we will not put up with further delays on matters as fundamental as the right range of services provided to people in towns and in the regions, but may well have to consider bringing proceedings against the Council in respect of its failure to act.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, ladies and gentlemen, is this issue of legislation on local public transport so important? The law on the situation we are in is unclear. We have the option of awaiting rulings from the ECJ, but we want the decisions on what public transport systems should be like to be taken politically, and so we, the towns, the communities and private enterprise, need legal certainty as to how local public transport is to be organised.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to address is as follows. I believe that a slip of the tongue has crept in here. Services of general interest and competition are not mutually exclusive, but are, in my view, mutually complementary, something that we see particularly clearly in local public transport. If, in the exercise of its responsibilities for public services, the city or the region makes the right decision and defines what is required of local public transport – its accessibility to disabled people, the timetables, the intervals between services and the fares; you can add all the social factors you want – then, Mr President, it must be put out to tender, and then the best offer must be accepted, whether it be from the public or private sector. It is competition that decides, and the public that benefits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have had more lip service to the principle of services of general interest. We were told that the Commission was going to produce a framework for services of general interest before the end of this year, now we get a promise of a Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">We urgently need the framework directive, not a Green Paper. We urgently need a change in competition law which enables services of general interest, public services, to survive and to prosper, and we need a clause in our new constitution which guarantees public services right across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity and citizenship are at the heart of the whole notion of the European Union. I would argue that, having taken a major step this week towards the political and geographical unity of Europe, if we are to create European citizens, we must have services of general interest universally available, accessible, affordable and of high quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Properly understood, services of general interest are for all citizens, not just for those who are excluded, or poor or indeed disadvantaged – though obviously they are of key importance to people in that situation. Services of general interest support and sustain growth. They sustain environmental sustainability. They are a key component of any serious spatial strategy which will enable us to have sustainable rural communities and indeed liveable cities. They will provide us with healthy citizens who do not fear illness. They will enable citizens to commute and to communicate. They will enable citizens to be well-informed, to be well-educated, not only in terms of technological education, but also politically literate. All of these things are necessary if we are to create a Europe of which we can be proud and which citizens will feel they own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It does, however, strike me as incomprehensible that the final conclusions and specific initiatives associated with it are to appear as long as six months later. Analyses and the demands for action resulting from them belong together. Having been called upon to do so by the Barcelona Council in March 2002, the Commission, in June of that year, adopted a new methodology for evaluating the quality of public services. You will be well aware that opinions on this are sharply divided, and I am telling you now that, in terms of its quality, this new evaluation methodology is an unmitigated disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the invariable tendency of the debate on public services to bring forth ritual repetitions about deregulation and privatisation, it would at least be proper to conduct, in parallel with the Green Paper, a scientifically sound analysis of the situation in those markets and enterprises that have already been deregulated and privatised. There are marked distinctions to be drawn between the successes and failures in the various lines of business involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The questions that demand answers are, firstly, whether equal rights of access are guaranteed to all citizens of the European Union, irrespective of where they live or of their levels of income. Secondly: has the cost of the service increased or fallen? Thirdly: has its quality improved or got worse? And fourthly: have the service's employees experienced an improvement or a deterioration in their social conditions?</p>
<p class="contents">This also involves putting the service providers on an equal footing irrespective of their ownership structures. There is nothing fair about the competition if the regulations on aid put enterprises with a larger than 25 % public stake in them at a disadvantage over against their private-sector counterparts. So ‘yes’ to competition on the basis of the best services, and ‘no’ to competition on the basis of ownership! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, that is part of the job!</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to talk about the content, for my fellow Members have already amply expressed what are my views too. I have familiarised myself with the most recent Commission document, a concise text which was produced a few days ago. It points out, in particular, that the first general document on the subject produced by the Commission dates back to 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">Six years on, the Commission has announced a Green Paper. I do not feel that this is a responsible way to behave. You have timetabling problems which have already been pointed out by many people: you have problems scheduling your work to fit in with the Convention, you have scheduling problems with regard to the implementation of sectoral directives and you certainly have scheduling problems – as Mrs Ainardi mentioned – where enlargement is concerned. In any case, I believe that there is no point, ladies and gentlemen, in continuing to ask the Commission to produce documents. I am being mildly provocative in saying this: the Commission is divided. There is clearly no political leadership, which is disturbing considering that the Commission has sole right of initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that we Members of Parliament must now shoulder our responsibilities within the Convention. A number of contributions have already been submitted on the subject of services of general interest and the reconciliation thereof with competition law. In its first contribution to the Convention, in May, the Commission itself pointed out how important it is that we have legal bases for services of general interest. Page 6 of the document even states that, without this, any changes will actually be to the detriment of the European model of society and the values recognised by the European democracies. The Commission is therefore both aware of the problem and incapable of taking political decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">We who are members of the Convention or Members of the European Parliament must turn to our national governments and, within the Convention, we must fight to ensure that the future European Constitution genuinely contains legal provisions providing a framework for competition law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In simpler terms, that meant that there had to be an end to the inconsistencies arising from unclear case law and the Commission’s never-ending attempts to use its competences in the field of competition to meddle with the definition and functioning of services of general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Two years on, after a report from the Laeken Council and a call from the Barcelona Council for work to begin on a framework directive, we are still at more or less the same point, and the Commission’s only proposal is to put off resolution of the issue once again and draw up a Green Paper which will lead to a huge consultation process. This is extremely disappointing.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the solution is simple, clearly, the Member States still have to impose it. The Treaty must state clearly that, firstly, the Union recognises the freedom of administration of the States and their authorities, which includes their right to define and organise their public services, and, secondly, that the funding offsetting the additional costs<span class="bold"> </span>of successfully providing services of general interest is not to be deemed state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, there must be an end to the inconsistent behaviour of the Commission at international level. The negotiations taking place in the WTO on a future General Agreement on Trade in Services – GATS – are currently in serious danger of going off course, drifting away from the liberalisation of private services and becoming an indirect debate on the shortcomings of public services. These discussions are being led by the Commission with a complete lack of transparency and without a clear democratic mandate for the parties to agree on after a broad public debate. Moreover, this situation is strangely reminiscent of what is happening in the field of agriculture as regards the application of the so-called Doha decisions, which have not been democratically ratified by anyone.</p>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, there is such a thing as the Lisbon process, which speaks unambiguously in terms of the European Union having social cohesion as its objective. In my view, services of general interest serve that social cohesion. A large proportion of services of general interest are provided on a voluntary basis and not only as a main job. They contribute to a higher degree of humanitarianism, and, as a rule, they are at home in the area between the state and the private sector. The support they receive from the state is not to be regarded as state aid, and they are private, although not wholly subject to competition law. It is for this precise reason that we need a legal framework that provides legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Christmas being only a few days away, I would like to extend the warmest thanks to those who work, whether professionally or voluntarily, for the common good. Without them, our society would be a colder place, and the European social model would be unworkable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, the subject is a Green Paper, but there has already – in the year 2000 – been a Commission communication on services of general interest, a Commission report to the Laeken Council and, indeed, many documents and positions adopted by the institutions, particularly the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, at this rate, by the time the framework directive is adopted, all the sectoral directives on energy, postal services and transport will already have been adopted, the timetables will have been established for liberalisation and there will thus not be much left needing a framework. The Commission is, indeed, very behind and we can only wonder what this means. Where liberalisation is concerned, we legislate and we set dates without even planning proper mid-term reviews. When it comes to public services, we organise debates on debating documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Like many of my fellow Members, I, for my part, feel that a precise legal framework is essential to protect and facilitate the development of public services in Europe as an essential part of citizenship. Now, public services cannot be subject principally to internal market rules because their objectives are long-term objectives, not immediate profitability, whether they relate to social and territorial cohesion, equal treatment or, as is sometimes the case, even equal pricing. Thus, these are not objectives which will bring an immediate return on investments, and they therefore cannot be governed by purely commercial reasoning, including where their compatibility and financing are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, in the field of public services, we must be able to continue to finance what is not profitable with what is, and, therefore, that it is necessary to balance out prices. Since there is going to be a Green Paper, it would be appropriate, together with the social partners, users and local government representatives, to assess the long-term impact of liberalisation in a number of sectors in terms of quality and safety. I am thinking, by way of example, of the British railways, of employment and territorial cohesion. I am thinking of the postal services and the risk that oligopolies will form, and another example is telecommunications.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, in conclusion, that we need to give the Member States the possibility of having exclusive operating rights in certain geographical areas and of having reserved sectors which are not open to competition, for the expectations of the Union’s citizens are very high when it comes to public services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are, though, many people who are affected by this issue of general interest, and we are indeed seeing a burgeoning commercialisation of what are called services of general interest. To a large degree, such commercialisation is justified, but thought ought also to be given to whether or not we should go down this road.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has already been said about the Green Paper and the Convention, and also about the question of whether we have left things too late. There is one thing that we can say with certainty, and that is that Parliament believes that the dialogue between the Commission and the European Court of Justice must come to an end. Parliament is being ignored to an extent that, in this area in particular, could scarcely be surpassed; hence the urgent call for the Commission to make some progress on laying down specific criteria for this.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points that are of great importance to me, and that I would like to see resolved once and for all. One feature of the discussion on services of general interest is that the Commission is willing to get involved only where economic activity is concerned. I am sure that this is perfectly understandable in principle, but it always ends up being about questions of detail. Is an ambulance service an economic activity? Yes or no? We do not need decisions in individual cases, but we do need the Commission to at long last specify the criteria to which it will refer when it takes decisions in future. It is not acceptable for decisions – like those on savings banks – to be at short notice and always, immediately beforehand, forwarded only for information.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to subsidiarity, which does, indeed, loom large in the Convention's deliberations. This is where the Commission's delay in making its presentation to the Convention has been crucial, but the regions and the Member States must continue to be given the option of determining these matters themselves on a local basis. What must not be allowed to happen is standards being imposed by the Commission through the back door.</p>
<p class="contents">Subsidiarity is about having scope to take your own decisions on a local basis, so that things may perhaps be different in Bavaria – where I come from – from what they are in, say, Luxembourg, where the Commissioner comes from, or in Spain, Portugal, Greece or, in future perhaps, in Lithuania. That is why definitions must not be imposed through the back door. At the end of the day, though, I have to say that what we and the public need is legal certainty, and that is not promoted by what one of your fellow-Commissioners occasionally gets up to, then going as far as to advocate the deregulation of water. That, at the moment, is not on the agenda, and has to be dealt with in a sector-specific way; it is for that reason that the Commission needs to get around to taking action on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will shortly be saying something about the existence of other documents that are worth talking about and discussing, but first I will turn to the documents and the statement that you have given us.</p>
<p class="contents">You started by mentioning in your introduction that we are engaged in a discussion, and one that is being conducted in a very open way. At any rate, that is how it came across when interpreted into German. What do you mean by 'open'? Open as regards the possible outcome or open in the way the discussion is conducted? Both interpretations make me uneasy. With an open outcome? We have already moved on too far for that. Now you issue a Green Paper, which I see as nothing more than a means of creating a smokescreen while there are other decisions that urgently need to be taken. This is yet another exercise in avoiding doing anything, whilst, at the same time, very practical preparations are going ahead in other areas. Nor is the discussion being conducted in an open manner, for, as I have just told you, we have been given your statement on behalf of the Commission, along with documents of four or five pages each, not that the number of pages is of great importance. Yet, while we are given these documents, others are getting what are described as ‘non-papers’ – substantial documents that are really worth discussing, and in which we could find that there is legal certainty on specific points. Take the so-called non-paper dated 12 November, with its margin numbers – all 102 of them! You discuss these things with others, but not with us. I just want to pick up one point and be told what the Commission really thinks about it. Item 100 says: ‘An enterprise may provide more than one service to the public, some of them realising a profit and others showing a loss. Even if the enterprise does not provide public services, its services may cross-subsidise each other’. What that means is that, if we get an answer, we would be resolving an important financial issue, one that would help bring legal certainty. What we need right now is an answer and not this or that Green Paper, which serve only to delay the discussion process for ever and a day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the major problem we are facing today, caused by successive decisions by the Commission and the Council, specifically at the Lisbon and Barcelona Summits, which have speeded up the liberalisation and deregulation of several sectors, such as telecommunications, postal services, energy and transport to name but a few.</p>
<p class="contents">We are already beginning to see the consequences of these decisions, not only in the redundancies and in the greater instability of employment in some of these sectors, but also, in some cases, in the higher charges and prices and the poorer quality of the services provided. These developments have won the firm opposition of workers and of society as a whole, as demonstrated recently by the general strike in Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, therefore, acknowledge the importance of high-quality public services in guaranteeing all citizens the right of access, which also requires a firm stance to be taken in WTO negotiations against the liberalisation of public services.</p>
