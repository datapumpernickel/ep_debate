<p class="contents">A year ago, the European Parliament presented to Commissioner Liikanen its opinion on the Commission's Communication of July 2001. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur on that occasion, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, and all the Members of the European Parliament for the efforts they have put in to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In its resolution, the European Parliament essentially made two requests: firstly, with regard to form, Parliament called for framework legislation to be proposed in this field, including a clear and realistic timetable for the application of mid-term and final objectives, as well as the methods for monitoring its application; secondly, with regard to content, it requested, as a long term objective, the application as from 2010 of the four tests recommended by the European Enhanced Safety Vehicle Committee or other tests which would offer the same level of protection for pedestrians.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal for a Directive of 19 February this year is intended to respond to Parliament’s wishes. The report by Mr Vermeer does not actually question the central elements of that Commission proposal. The amendments he proposes clarify or improve the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 1, 2, 5 and 7 insist that the proposal is one element of a broader range of measures needed to guarantee a high level of protection for pedestrians, which includes active safety measures and changes to infrastructures. The Commission agrees with and accepts these suggestions.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 3, 6, 8 and 16 are intended to clarify that the problem of pedestrian protection can be dealt with through passive safety measures or combining active and passive safety measures, and we also accept these amendments because we share the rapporteur’s approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I can say the same with regard to Amendments Nos 9, 10 and 11, which refer to the application of the directive, obliging the Commission to inform the legislator with regard to the monitoring of that directive within a specified time period and specifying the comitology procedure to be followed with a view to the modification of the directive if that modification is restricted to introducing passive safety measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we accept Amendment No 4, which requests that the Commission examine the viability of extending the scope of the Directive to vehicles of up to 3.5 tonnes in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, the Commission accepts all the amendments presented by the Committee on Transport, as well as Amendment No 16. However, we cannot accept Amendments Nos 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 and 18.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the importance of this proposal to road safety and the timetable laid down for the application of the tests, as well as the consultation on the possible initiatives in the field of protecting pedestrians which preceded this proposal, the Commission hopes that it will be approved at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would once again like to thank Mr Vermeer and all the honourable Members for their work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall try to be as concise as during the procedure. The result builds on Mrs Hedkvist Petersen’s report from last year in Parliament, which called for the adoption of a regulation on voluntary agreements between the European Commission and the automobile industry as framework legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The report emphasises that the European Enhanced Vehicle-safety Committee (EEVC) test method should, above all, be a dynamic test method. This is an important position: particularly if we are talking about enacting legislation whose aim is complete compliance with this test method, the method must also be kept flexible. I think that, between us, we have succeeded in this. The emphasis must continue to be on passive safety measures. Active measures, and a combination of active and passive measures, however, must remain an option in this proposal, so that it offers even more guarantees of safety than the method currently laid down.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome of the independent technical feasibility study next year, for which the European Commission recently issued an invitation to tender, will be important. By July of next year it must be clear to what extent car manufacturers are obliged to implement the EEVC test method. I do not wish to take on board the extra amendments now on the table, therefore, because they put under pressure the compromise adopted with an overwhelming majority by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the speed of the process is particularly significant. We were able to achieve today's result in a little over two months. I should also like to endeavour to see to it that this first reading is the last. The contact we have had with the European Commission, and also the informal contact with the Council, indicate that we could be in a position not only to run through the procedure quickly, but also to conclude it smoothly here, so that we can very quickly set about effecting real improvement in road safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Our responsibility extends to the models of cars. In addition to this, we have fortunately been able to demand attention to the road infrastructure and also to the behaviour of the traffic users themselves. That is not our responsibility, but it merits a proper mention.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the Commissioner's statement, also on behalf of her fellow Commissioner, that she agrees to our joint request for the introduction of supplementary legislation for the category of motor vehicles up to 3.5 tonnes. I think that it is particularly important that we do not come to a standstill, but that we also emphasise and improve that safety aspect. It does not apply here, because the test method proposed has been tested on vehicles in the category up to 2 500 kg for 20 years.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism have endeavoured to reach a compromise, as proposed by a number of colleagues, on precisely this kind of point, so as not to delay this process; whilst also looking ahead to safety in the future. In short, we have seen a very successful process, especially as everyone was prepared to be generous in their cooperation. I should like to express my thanks for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, with Mrs Hedkvist Petersen's report and also with Mr Vermeer, has given a lot of support to the approach the Commission has taken. We did not feel it was necessary to table any substantive amendments to the framework directive because we felt that it covered the strategy that Parliament had laid down. Mr Vermeer has made some worthwhile improvements, but without in any way altering the substance of it. That is important and I agree with his analysis that we should not support the other amendments. I am delighted that the Commission is accepting those so we can move ahead as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one or two comments on our two proposed amendments, one of which the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism was kind enough to accept, and also some broader points about the whole proposal. First of all the recital that we proposed focuses very much on the importance of active safety measures, working with passive safety measures, in delivering the overall safety improvements that we want.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been enormous improvements in the technology over the past few months since we first looked at this. I declare an interest in this in that I am an automotive engineer and I have driven some of the cars with that technology. It is important to emphasise the practical nature of this. If we have technologies that will reduce collision speeds by sensing impending impacts, or even alter the direction of the impact, it will make a very substantial improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some people in this House who seem to think that the requirements are somehow a pushover. I just want to conclude by relating a recent experience when I went to the Young Designers Exhibition at Coventry University to see what young designers were looking at in car designs for the future. It will interest colleagues from this committee to know that many of those young designers were designing pedestrian-friendly cars but, in order to meet the EEVC Stage II tests, the only way they could meet those requirements was by putting the engine at the back of the car so as to leave enough crush space at the front.</p>
<p class="contents">Anybody who thinks that these Stage II tests are a pushover, or are easily attainable with current technology, needs to take a serious look at what is going on in the industry and not sit in this House drawing up unrealistic amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this I wish to express my gratitude to the Commission, but also to the rapporteur, Mr Vermeer, for his report, which helps to clarify the substance of the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">If we who sit in this Parliament want people to carry on believing in us and trusting us, then we should stand by the demands we made with reference to the commitment made by the European, Japanese and Korean motor industries and not make new ones over and above them. Now that we have the framework directive that we demanded at that time, we have the legal certainty that we called for, and we will continue to have an influence on any further significant development, while, at the same time giving the motor industry the time and technical resources that it needs to get things done. We are, moreover, allowing it some leeway when it comes to researching innovative measures of active and passive safety that can be even more effective and efficient. At the end of the day, this is about protecting people and not just reducing the consequences of accidents, but preventing them, and this is not just about using certain technologies and procedures – expensive and developed with the best of intentions though these may be. We will thereby be being particularly responsive to the public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Right up to the last moment, there was dispute about whether the EEVC’s four test procedures should be prescribed by law as the sole solution. There is no doubt that, even by today’s standards, these tests appear to be the most effective and the most cost-efficient, as well as to be the only ones available, but this is where criticism has to start. It would seem that a development has been missed out on, as these tests concern themselves more with the protection of vehicles’ occupants than with that of road users put at risk by the vehicles. Even consumers have a one-sided awareness of these things. They are increasing willing to pay for their safety as vehicle users, but demonstrably less willing to spend more on protecting pedestrians and the users of bicycles, wheelchairs and skateboards. This has to be the starting-point for a rethink, and one might well be sparked off, and accompanied, by a European campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this House must neither stand in the way of the EEVC tests being further developed on the basis of practice, nor fundamentally reject the development of alternative procedures that offer at least as much protection. For example, in other, very sensitive, areas such as air and space travel, methods of virtual simulation came in a long time ago. Why, in future, should not such testing methods, and others like them – for we are talking about the post-2010 period – not bring even more safety? Let us, by an overwhelming majority, secure the speedy implementation of the directive and thereby save human lives! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am extremely pleased that, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I have been able to help bring about the compromises required to produce the amendments that are before us and that I now hear the Commission is prepared to accept, something that I am also extremely pleased about.</p>
<p class="contents">Road safety is important to the European Parliament, a fact that is clear from this report. Our task is to look after road users’ interests but also to make sure that we obtain laws that enable industry to produce safety products, a consideration now evident from this directive. I am extremely pleased that the Third Road Safety Action Programme has come about. I think there are a lot of interesting aspects to it, and I am looking forward to being able to continue debating it here in Parliament. The programme has been very much influenced by the road safety debate we have had in Parliament in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been lengthy discussion of the protection of pedestrians. In Parliament, we have spent a year and a half conducting a debate both in the committee and in the Chamber. This has now resulted in the directive we requested last summer. We really did try to enable all the parties to contribute to our obtaining cars that are as safe as possible for unprotected road users. We established frameworks for the objectives and the implementation, and we emphasised the role of the European Parliament in following up this issue of road safety. Now, we have obtained the directive, and we see that there is an opportunity to use both passive and active measures to promote the protection of pedestrians. Independent investigations of the progress made are to be carried out, and the European Parliament is to have the right of codecision if there are major changes to the directive. Then, there are also committee amendments concerning sports cars: the large cars that we know are extremely dangerous and to which the Commission has also drawn attention in its road safety programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I am extremely pleased with the compromises that have been tabled. I think it good that we should open the way for active measures, but we must not abandon the passive ones. We cannot throw out the baby with the bathwater. I have played a part in bringing about the compromises, and I support the report. I think we should stick to the compromise so that a first reading is sufficient and we get a directive through quickly. I am extremely pleased with the outcome. I am looking forward to the ongoing road safety debate in Parliament, for it is very important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since then, the car has claimed a large proportion of these for driving and parking. This represents a great danger in populous urban areas, in particular, but also on narrow country roads with ribbon development. That danger is further increased if cars also have decorative fittings at the front or rear.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of sharp decorative fittings was banned at national level as many as 40 years ago, but there are still manufacturers and drivers who consider outward appearance more important than other people's safety. That problem cannot be solved on a voluntary basis; this particularly applies to the attachment of bull bars to energy-guzzling jeeps weighing up to 3.5 tonnes.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been pressing for legislation against the trend – still predominant at that time – for a long time in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. In plenary conclusions a year ago, Parliament demanded a framework directive in addition to the voluntary agreements with European and Asian automobile manufacturers. Today, I am arguing in favour of the amendments to it that afford maximum protection to non-motorists, instead of continuing to place our hope in motorists switching on their headlights in daylight, for example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This directive relates to the protection of vulnerable road users in the event of a collision with a motor vehicle. It brings to a conclusion many years' debate regarding the necessity and usefulness of legal provisions on passive protection. Although the result is unremarkable for balance between the benefits to society and industry, it is probably the best that can be hoped for at this moment in time. From that point of view, we support this proposal. It is now important to see to it that the agreements enter into force as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not my last word on the matter. The development of systems that promote safety does not stand still. We will also need to indicate a direction for the future. In that context, I wish to make three remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the proposal applies to a limited part of motor-vehicle categories M1 and N1. If the effect is to be maximised, the scope needs to be extended. The Commission should examine the conditions under which the scope can be extended to all the vehicles in categories M1 and N1.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, during discussions on this proposal, attention shifted from purely passive measures to both passive and active measures. We support this approach, but we are of the opinion that it is necessary to impose quality requirements on active systems, too. It should not be the case that passive systems meeting more stringent requirements are supplanted by active systems which are not subject to a single European quality requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the attention to active measures must not delay the entry into force of the requirements for passive measures. As has already been said, the results regarding passive safety were hard-won. Society will benefit from the quickest possible implementation of these, therefore. Holding a debate on active systems would not be conducive to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our thanks to Mr Vermeer for the energy and commitment with which he has launched himself into this dossier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe there are two ways of carrying out politics. The inflexible way, which makes dialogue difficult, and the flexible way, which involves giving ground and trying to be constructive, a positive politics.</p>
<p class="contents">We propose accepting a combination of passive and active measures (which in any event could have been included in another directive!) in the event that we replace the European Experimental Vehicles Committee (EEVC) tests, provided that these passive measures do not constitute more than 25% of all the measures. The alternative measures to the effective EEVC tests (which have proven to be effective for more than 20 years) should not therefore differ from the latter by more than 25%.</p>
<p class="contents">We concede that the EEVC tests can be subject to a further viability study (like the alternative measures which the industry may present). The condition is that this study must be entirely independent.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we wanted to clarify that the alternative measures must, in all cases, maintain the same level of protection as the EEVC tests, so that they protect all the parts of the body included on those tests.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that my group has made a great effort to make these concessions and I hope that you will accept them and that they will improve the protection of pedestrians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
