<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, let me first thank the rapporteur, Mrs Redondo, for her report concerning the Commission's 'Forest Focus' proposal for a regulation on monitoring of forests and environmental interactions</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal aims to contribute to the protection of the Community’s forests by means of monitoring. It builds on the achievements of the two Council regulations on the protection of the Community's forests against air pollution and fires, which expired at the end of last year. However, the proposal broadens the scope to include new environmental issues such as biodiversity, climate change, carbon sequestration and soils.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection of forests and the enhancement of their multifunctional role are matters of particular importance and urgency in the Union. The Community and the Member States are committed to implementing internationally agreed activities and to set up monitoring and reporting systems. Sound political decisions have to be based on reliable information.</p>
<p class="contents">We need harmonised and comprehensive long-term monitoring of forests at Community level. It is essential in order to provide information on the temporal and spatial variation in the condition of forests. Experience from the previous forest monitoring scheme shows that the harmonisation of data collection is of major importance.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two key issues which deserve special attention. Firstly, comitology. The report considers whether the principle of subsidiarity needs to be reinforced in the context of Forest Focus, and proposes strengthening the role of Member States in the proposed monitoring scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">Experience from the previous Community scheme shows that close cooperation between the Commission and the Member States is indeed needed to set up an efficient monitoring scheme. That is why the Commission proposed strengthening the comitology arrangements by incorporating a Management Committee. This is an approach which balances the evident need for greater involvement of the Member States, whilst being proportional to what, in Community terms, is a relatively modest scheme. Our view is that the characteristics of the scheme proposed closely fit the criteria for management committees set out in the Council decision on comitology.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to address the important aspect of forest fire prevention measures. Fires have affected forests in many parts of the Community, but in particular in the southern parts of the Community. The Commission takes this seriously and will ensure that all forest fire related measures introduced by the now lapsed Council Regulation (EEC) No 2158/92 will continue to be covered in future by Community legislation. The proposal for 'Forest Focus' and the regulation on rural development together meet these requirements. The activities that were not already covered by the provisions of the regulation on rural development, such as specific studies, and the forest fire information system, are now addressed by 'Forest Focus'. The Commission fully understands Parliament's concerns, which are reflected in those amendments concerning forest fire prevention measures.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission regrets that the incorporation of forest fire prevention measures within the 'Forest Focus' proposal cannot be accepted. Our two institutions share the objective of preventing forest fires, but this duplication of measures already covered by the rural development regulation would lead to legal and budgetary uncertainty which may impede our attainment of those objectives. I should like to reassure Members that the approach proposed by the Commission will allow the continuity of the forest fire prevention measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already urged Member States to incorporate any necessary amendments to their national or regional rural development plans. The question of the budget increase is linked to the issue of fire prevention measures. It follows that just as the Commission does not support additional fire prevention measures within the proposal, nor does it support the proposed budget increase. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Redondo Jiménez (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, as the Commission has just said, we are dealing with a report which we will vote on tomorrow, which has been approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and which in overall terms has supported the report produced by this rapporteur. <span class="italic">Forest Focus</span> replaces two regulations in force until December 2002, the legal basis of which, changed from the former Article 130 to the current Article 175, was changed on 25 February. In other words, it became subject to approval by co-decision. This report studied both protection against fires and atmospheric pollution, and now actions in the field of biodiversity, climate change and the retention of carbon are going to be included. Actions in the sixth framework action programme in the field of the environment which the European Commission and the Community are obliged to implement. However, the proposal replaces the majority of the measures on fire prevention in the former Regulation (EEC) No 2158/92.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the Commissioner has just told us that these measures are included in the rural and regional development programmes which he mentioned. I must say to him that the Member States have already presented the plans of the rural development Regulation, which was approved in 2000, but which has not been able to take account of fire prevention plans. Therefore, it does not seem to make sense to have asked the Member States to guess that in 2003 or at the end of 2002, as it should have been, this Parliament and the Commission were going to debate the replacement of the Regulation and that it was going to be transferred to the rural development programme and furthermore that it was going to be transferred with a miserable budget of EUR 5 million, because this quantity does not appear in the rural development programme. It will therefore have to appear in order to balance the 2002 budget. That is, EUR 18 million per year.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, Commissioner, we are spending EUR 18 million. That is what is balanced and consolidated in 2002. The Commission proposes EUR 13 million. It seems absurd that we want to take the same measures, plus those relating to biodiversity, climate change and the retention of carbon, with such a significant reduction in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that considerable efforts have been made, both by the Council and by this Parliament, to reach to a compromise agreement, with compromise measures which ended in 2006. It appears that it has not been possible for the Commission to reach this agreement. I am sorry, Commissioner, but this is a regulation which is decided by means of co-decision in this Parliament and I therefore believe that the proposal which was originally on the table has been withdrawn by this rapporteur in Amendment No 44 so that we can all discuss it on equal terms. I believe that we all have to make a move, not just Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the amendments presented by the Group of the European Socialist Party, this rapporteur accepts Amendment No 48. However, Amendment No 47 is not acceptable since it would go against the spirit of the report. There are other amendments presented by this rapporteur: two of them are amendments of a legal nature, and a third in which all we ask is that the idea already included in the recitals of increasing the scope of the European forest information system be incorporated into the Articles.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have liked to have introduced some other ideas, such as prioritising certain methodological projects and also promoting ‘old’ activities, if I may put it like that, and not just those proposed in the new modules.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that it would most advisable for the time periods to last one year, and that there be a pilot period, which needs to take account of the frequent interactions of the experts. I do not believe it is a good idea to transfer these issues to the rural development programme, Commissioner, since that would mean moving from the only regulation which is currently subject to co-decision and it is the only regulation which protects our forests. I would say, to use rather unorthodox terms for a plenary session, that this would be like leaving a sweet at the gates of a school.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we have time to clarify both the budget and the harmony of these regulations. I believe we are obliged to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission proposal combines two former regulations, one of which concerns the protection of the forests from air pollution and the other forest fire prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets has delivered an opinion on this matter. In its first opinion it said that the financial statement of the Commission proposal is compatible with the ceiling of heading 3 of the financial perspective and that it will not restrict other action in the period 2003-2006. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, however, raised this financial framework of EUR 52 million to EUR 67 million. This being the case, the Committee on Budgets stated that the framework was compatible with the ceiling of heading 3, if necessary through a reduction of other policies or through recourse to the provisions of the interinstitutional agreement. In practice the Committee on Budgets is warning that reductions in other areas of policy will have to be made or increases in the financial perspective will have to be resorted to, which will be politically very difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">The opinion of the Committee on Budgets is based on the new Rule 63a in Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, which obliges a committee to adopt a position on the compatibility of proposed legislation with the financial perspective. This is meant as a guiding principle for the plenary debate, which of course is free to take its own decision. This week Rule 63a is being applied not only to this report but also to that by Ulla Sandbæk, for example. It should be noted that if the committee responsible increases the financial framework in question it must once again request an opinion from the Committee on Budgets. Verification of compatibility does on no account constitute a position on whether the proposal by the committee responsible regarding a larger financial framework is appropriate or reasonable. This procedure will hopefully become automatic and natural.</p>
<p class="contents">The plenary session must have knowledge regarding the compatibility of the financial framework with the financial perspective so that it can take its decision. The procedure increases the responsibility of the committees responsible for the legislative proposal being debated at the time. Activity-based budgeting, which is already established, also has the same objective. Verification of financial compatibility under Rule 63a thus serves, above all, the interests of the committee responsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You took account of the substance of our opinion at the preparatory stage when you were doing your own preparatory work. For that I thank you sincerely.</p>
<p class="contents">Our greatest causes for concern in the preparatory work were connected with two matters: the Commission would have liked to assume the authority that normally belongs to the Member States in matters to do with forests, and, secondly, it sought to insist on an unrealistic data gathering programme on the part of the Member States that would have been unreasonable, not to say impossible, to realise in practice. This unrealistic attitude was particularly apparent in the targets for measuring biodiversity, calculating the frequency of occurrence of species.</p>
<p class="contents">When considering costs, it is not appropriate to move forward to a context of action on a wider scale than that now being undertaken internationally within the framework of the Food and Agriculture Organisation. It would be wise to investigate the situation first and then see. With the changes we are making we can guarantee that forestry policy will remain in the hands of individual countries and of the Standing Forest Committee that represents the Member States. Information compiled in the future in the EU will be important for monitoring the development of the forest ecosystem, but we cannot base a forestry policy, an EU approach to the management and use of forests, on that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would in this connection like to point out that forests vary greatly in different parts of the EU and forests and timber mean very different things in different countries. It is owing to these differences that I have strong reservations about any forestry policy being managed from Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that forests play an essential role, because they have a multifunctional role, and as president of a regional national park I am particularly sensitive to the various measures concerning the preservation of natural spaces, and in particular forests. They are essential to us, amongst other things in order to prevent climate change. However, we should not regard forest areas solely as the lungs of Europe. They are not just green spaces; they are also a not inconsiderable source of economic, social and tourism activity.</p>
<p class="contents">At Community level, it is essential to compare the various experiments being carried out in Member States in order to promote the exchange of information and create an effective benchmarking system. We must never lose sight of the fact that it is at the most local level that this part of our heritage is managed best and will continue to be managed best. This is why the monitoring of forests should not be the sole responsibility of the European Union. The principle of subsidiarity is vital, and what is involved here is almost a range of responsibilities shared between the Union and the Member States, the Union and local governments. and the Union and local operators represented within the European Advisory Committee on Forestry and Cork and the Standing Forestry Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for the Union, in conjunction with the Member States, to determine the broad outlines of the measures and the main objectives, and to make provision for adequate financial resources to enable those objectives to be achieved. The Council has a responsibility to take on here. The Commission is proposing that repair measures following forest fires should be reinforced. I totally agree with this important step, but I would also ask that research into the causes of such fires should be reinforced. Repair should not be the sole objective of long-term management. As part of the move to preserve our forest areas, public awareness is important, because the forests belong first and foremost to the public, and it is up to us, as Members of the European Parliament, to represent that public. That is why I believe that forests should definitely come within the scope of the codecision procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commitment to monitoring biodiversity, climate change and carbon retention and soils calls for multifunctional action. There are tasks in this area that we can deal with jointly at European Union level. These include the development of common knowledge to serve as a basis for the ecological monitoring of forests, so that information based on genuine knowledge is obtained on the state of the forests.</p>
<p class="contents">As we develop the measures to be taken we nevertheless have to remember that the importance of forests varies greatly in different parts of Europe. The forests themselves are also different. For this reason any questions relating to forestry must be regarded as being based on the principle of subsidiarity. Neither should we develop new institutions. The tasks contained in the EU’s forestry action plan must be dealt with within the context of present systems, making use of existing monitoring methods.</p>
<p class="contents">At Union level responsibility must lie with the Commission and the European Environment Agency. The Commission must also work in close cooperation with the Standing Forestry Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, Mrs Redondo Jiménez, for having worked to take the Commission proposal in this direction, by which I mean she has focused on the importance of the principle of subsidiarity. I do, however, think it problematic that the rapporteur has included measures relating to forest fire prevention in this regulation. The Group of the Party of European Socialists agrees that forest fire prevention is an important part of European collaboration and a matter that requires solidarity among us. The difference of opinion is connected, however, with how this should be financed. We heard in the Commissioner’s speech that the Commission in its proposal has worked on the assumption that provision for forest fire prevention is to be made by means of the rural development fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The PSE Group has tabled Amendment No 47 which aims to guarantee that all operational sectors are taken into account equally in this regulation. Neither is the PSE Group in favour of increasing appropriations for the Forest Focus action plan, as agreed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. We first have to discover what measures are to become the European Union’s responsibility, and what again it is more sensible and more economical to do within the context of existing systems. It is not until we have discovered this that we can decide what sort of increase the budget needs. At this stage we shall oppose the increase in the budget referred to above. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It goes, 'The culture of peoples is measured in terms of their love for trees' – and I would like the peoples of the European Union to demonstrate this.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about forests we are talking about one of the most important ecosystems on Earth given their wealth and importance for the international community, since they offer both productive and protective services.</p>
<p class="contents">The European continent shows the general characteristics of a region located in the planet’s northern hemisphere and has forests with highly differentiated coniferous and non-coniferous species which reflect the regional biodiversity and bio-climatic wealth of the old Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of all of this, we must recognise the importance today of the report by Mrs Redondo Jiménez for nature in the European Union. I believe there are various reasons for this. On the one hand, the report considers in a general sense the general actions necessary to prevent the deterioration of Community forests as a result of atmospheric pollution and insists on implementing a specific European Union policy to combat forest fires, which are one of the factors threatening the survival of the forests. Furthermore, it specifically recognises the ecological wealth of certain European regions, such as the so-called outermost regions, in which certain forest ecosystems stand out, which in some cases are genuine natural botanical museums, as in the case of the region I come from, the Canary Islands, where forest observatories should be established in these unique Macaronesian islands, one of the bio-geographical regions of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) with the greatest biodiversity in the European Union. But all of this could come to nought if the Commission does not allocate the funding needed to adopt the measures necessary to achieve an appropriate European policy on forests.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the rapporteur on her sensitivity to the problem of forests and on her courage in defending the Community forests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Between 1992 and 2002 around 800 projects and 18 national programmes were funded in six countries, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Italy and Portugal, totalling around EUR 123.6 million, which demonstrates the importance of this Regulation. Consequently, taking account of the degree of efficiency and budgetary execution of the programme, which has always lacked further means, it becomes important to keep up actions to protect forests (both actions against both pollution and fires) included in the same Regulation, thereby honouring commitments, which will become redundant with the entry into force of the current regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take account of the fact that whereas pollution affects northern Europe more, forest fires are a scourge of the South, which means that the exclusion proposed by the Commission makes no sense, especially given that the preventive measures included in Regulation 2158/1992 contain actions not covered by the regulation on rural development, which has other aims for forests and forestry, despite what the Commissioner has said.</p>
<p class="contents">The failure to include these preventive measures in this regulation would mean a reduction in funds for fire prevention and would call into question a set of projects already underway, which have already demonstrated the added value of Community action. I therefore agree with the amendments tabled by the rapporteur, seeking to uphold fire prevention actions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance can support this report in its entirety and without reservation. Whilst I think it very much something to be welcomed that we at last have a commitment to woodland at European level, I share Mrs Figueiredo's view that we have to try to concentrate more on biodiversity, changes in climate and the database for monitoring purposes, and that perhaps less prominence should be given to forest fires. We must be clear in our own minds about one thing: this, too, is a matter of environmental concern, and so we should try to give this important step our support. We hope that this report can be adopted as soon as possible and will enjoy broad support in Parliament as early as first reading stage, so that we can start to implement this programme as soon as possible and so that the Member States have the resources to at last implement this programme in a practical way.</p>
<p class="contents">Today marks the first occasion on which I have not needed to make use of all my speaking time, as I believe that we all agree that what matters is that we assign greater importance to European woodland, seeing it as an essential habitat and making it clear that changes in climate have to be monitored, and that the Commission's approach has to be widened a great deal to take account of biodiversity. We therefore give the report our full support and hope that the Member States will be able to get down to work as soon as possible.

Every summer brings with it this national scourge and its consequences, which are tragic at various levels: economic, ecological, social and human. Our forest heritage is gradually burning down and disappearing.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainable forest management is becoming increasingly complex and technical. Apart from fires, forests are exposed to other, more recent threats, caused by atmospheric pollution and climate change. It is always worth reminding fellow Members and making them aware of the importance of forests and their resources. To do this, it shall suffice to state that forests represent around 40% of the Union’s territory, a percentage that will increase once the process of enlargement is concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore warmly welcome the Forest Focus Programme, a Community initiative that will help to protect and value forests in Portugal and throughout the Community. European Union policy dovetails perfectly with cooperation in gathering data and in sharing experience and information amongst the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s initiative takes account of the legislative framework in force to protect forests against fires and atmospheric pollution and furthermore introduces a new Community mechanism for the long-term monitoring of forests and environmental interactions. For this programme’s financial support, it has been decided to allocate it a multiannual financial framework, covering the period 2003-2008, totalling EUR 67 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Monitoring is actually the key word in this proposal. I therefore heartily support Mrs Redondo Jiménez’s idea that it makes perfect sense to maintain specific measures for fire protection and rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree that this proposal must cover the commitments given in the Convention on Climate Change, which portrays forests as sinks full of greenhouse gases. Lastly, I am bound to regret the fact that the Commission proposal abuses the principle of subsidiarity, giving the Member States a rather passive role whereas it is their forests that suffer the damage. Even more serious is the fact that the Commission proposal does not cover the measures to prevent forest fires previously funded under Regulation No 2158/92. I therefore support all the amendments to the proposal that are intended to give the Member States greater involvement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, I do not think it odd that Europe should be concerned about the health of the whole of its forest heritage, because air pollution, plant diseases and even natural or accidental disasters do not recognise borders. Consequently, the best formula is no doubt the one referred to by Mrs Grossetête, in other words codecision, or development towards codecision, in matters concerning forests.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, apart from any approval that might be given to this Forest Focus programme, I believe that it has a harmful effect on a policy which was much appreciated and which was working very well, in other words Regulation (EEC) No 2158/92, which has been mentioned by a number of Members. I live in a region in the south of France, in which great efforts are being made, in terms of investment, to prevent forest fires. What is happening at the moment is highly regrettable, a sort of conjuring trick whereby Forest Focus first of all abolishes a source of funding which was managed under the codecision procedure, and renationalises it under the heading of rural development, even though, as Mrs Figueiredo said just now, we do not all have the same legal basis, we probably do not have the same funding, and we are also unable to finance the same types of investment. I am sorry that a policy which works is being changed. Moreover, it was a safety policy. Despite the fact that efforts are being made everywhere else in Europe with regard to maritime safety, air safety, rail safety or even health safety, the Commission is now proposing to simply do away with a policy of prevention and safety in the area of forests, which is an extremely sensitive area for all the countries in southern Europe. I believe that this is a deplorable step backwards. I am afraid that if, one day, we have disasters in the south of our continent, the public will blame us.</p>
<p class="contents">We are always saying that we want to be closer to the people, that Europe should have solidarity, that Europe should be on the side of Europeans. Yet in this extremely sensitive area, for which there was a procedure which worked well and was particularly well appreciated, Europe is now becoming invisible. It is removing this procedure from its policies and is renationalising it under the heading of a particularly risky policy of rural development. This is why I shall be supporting the remarkable work done by Mrs Redondo Jiménez and, in particular, the amendments which she has proposed, Amendments Nos 17 and 21, as well as Amendment No 47, proposed by the European Socialist Party. I hope, Commissioner, that you will reconsider your initial proposals, explaining that they will not be supported by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I want to say that I have nothing against those parts relating to forest fires and air pollution, for these are phenomena that are not confined within boundaries and that affect all countries in the same way. We cannot, however, support the third part relating to common monitoring of biodiversity. Why? Well, because this is an issue only affecting the Member States in as much as it is not possible to compare biodiversity in northern Scandinavia with that in southern Spain, or biodiversity in the Greek archipelago with that on the west coast of Ireland. What is more, no one can now say what is meant by biodiversity in a European perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission is asked what there is by way of a common forestry policy in Europe, the answer is that no such policy exists. If the Commission then repeatedly introduces new monitoring tools into this area, a policy is created in secrecy, and that is unacceptable. This is also an issue of ownership. Were it to be deemed under the policy that the biodiversity on a particular piece of land or in a particular area was so important that it needed to be conserved for the future – certain islands were mentioned just recently in this context – who would then compensate whoever was forfeiting his or her asset? The issue of compensation is at present an issue for each Member State. Where is the logic in this whole decision? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that all of us here consider it very important to continue improving and fighting for these measures against the factors which contribute to all the deterioration of the European Union’s forests, such as fires and acid rain, to which we can now add the Commission’s proposal, relating to the fight to improve biodiversity. In view of the obvious deterioration of the forests, I believe you should be sensitive to Mrs Redondo’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the issues I know best and which I believe is highly topical relates to the southern European regions, which are – as you know – most sensitive to the risks of forest fires. With regard to these regions we must continue to develop and expand a specific policy and we must combat forest fires.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the Mediterranean forests, although they offer a great variety of strategies for combating drought, at the same time these strategies make it very easy for them to catch fire. The dry, arid climate, accidents – caused voluntarily or involuntarily – are reasons for the vulnerability of an ecosystem which is under a lot of pressure and which requires a lot of assistance if it is to be conserved.</p>
<p class="contents">We will therefore support Mrs Redondo’s report, and we ask the Commission to be sensitive to her amendments, and also, the great majority of the speeches of those of us who are trying to support the report by Mrs Redondo. Prevention and safety are very important in terms of maintaining all the European forests, above all in view of the characteristics of the southern forests.

The southern parts of the European Union are at greatest risk of desertification, as various speakers have already said, due to their hot, arid climate, which is extremely propitious to fires. Therefore, if we wish seriously to preserve the forests of southern Europe, we will have to provide for the funding of fire prevention measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless the Council adopts Parliament’s amendments to achieve this, the countries of southern Europe will not have the means to continue the actions they have embarked on to prevent forest fires, actions which, by their very nature, cannot be separated from monitoring actions provided for, incidentally, in the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless forests are protected from fires, there is no point in talking about biodiversity, because when fires occur, they burn down everything. Neither plants nor animals survive. Tens of thousands of hectares burn down every year in Portugal and in other Mediterranean countries. Parliament has been sensitive to this scourge and has therefore proposed - and I hope will adopt – the amendments presented to us by Mrs Redondo Jiménez.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless the Council is able to understand this, doubts will remain as to its ability to understand the reality of the situation of Europe’s forests. I thank and congratulate Mrs Redondo Jiménez, who has guided us through this matter extremely ably, with great skill and tenacity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The way that this new proposal <span class="italic">Forest Focus</span> combines two old demands, that woodland be protected against environmental pollution and against fires, meets with my fundamental approval. Just so that you realise that I know what I am talking about, Commissioner, I will say that I have a background in forestry, but in a northern country.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to strongly emphasise the point of principle that forestry policy must remain in the hands of the Member States, and to keep on reminding the Commission of the principle of subsidiarity. Will <span class="italic">Forest Focus</span> have a beneficial effect on woodland and on those who own it, or is this just another exercise in keeping new hordes of bureaucrats employed and fed? I have to tell you that, representing as I do the German province of North Rhine-Westphalia, I get the impression that Brussels takes absolutely no notice of what is really going on in European forestry.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the European Union, 65% of the woodland is owned and managed by 12 million forest owners, and this branch of agriculture causes them serious problems as far as profitability is concerned. Two years ago, we ran a conference on this subject in Brussels. In my homeland, Commissioner, young farmers no longer have any interest in woodlands or in forestry. The property rights of woodland farmers are constantly being eroded. Why should a forester give his all without getting financial compensation, often without his efforts even being recognised by society?</p>
<p class="contents">If we say yes to it, <span class="italic">Forest Focus</span> will have to cover the social, economic and ecological fields in Europe. Bio-diversity and monitoring have a nice sound to them, but they do not give woodland farmers any financial entitlements in respect of the work they do.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say in conclusion that it is not those who are constantly discussing woodlands who are engaged in caring for nature and protecting it. I can tell you that if we do not succeed in making forestry a more profitable proposition overall for agriculture, young people in my homeland will simply throw in the towel. Even now, they are no longer prepared to clear up storm damage, for they take the line that this is a luxury they cannot afford. Let us not start imposing more and more new demands on them. Let us help to clean up the air. Let us help provide compensatory measures as well, so that they can do such things as fertilising the soil with manure and lime. Things really have to be said on the basis of practical experience, instead of just the empty forms of words that really do try my patience this late in the evening.</p>

I am pleased to say that there are 31 amendments which the Commission can fully support in part or in principle. The amendments which the Commission cannot support are: Amendments 1, 3, 8 to 11, 14, 21, 31, 35, 40 to 42, 45, 46 and 48 to 49.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the discussion about the financial issue of the EUR 5 million, the budget line available for the regulations on atmospheric pollution and forest fires also covered the EFICS. The EFICS has never utilised the available resources and there has not been an effort on the part of Member States to utilise the provisions of this regulation in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is based on the amount of EUR 16 million, which constituted the resources available for 2001, when the transfer of responsibilities of the two regulations had been finalised between DGs Agriculture and Environment. This amount has been reallocated between Forest Focus – EUR 13 million – and EFICS - EUR 3 million – to cover the monitoring needs related to forests.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rural development budget and provisions cover the measures on forest fire prevention, it was not deemed necessary to transfer additional resources to the rural development regulation. This type of transfer cannot guarantee that the available resources are not reattributed only to the Member States that have been recipients under the fire prevention regulation in the past. I have taken careful note of the views expressed in the debate, but I must stand by my previous remarks about the Commission's views on these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have discussed it many times; and as for the EFIS, this is an issue which is still being considered and which does not have so many arguments. We have just seen the Commission run out of arguments. It should reflect, and we should all reflect, in order to find a common position which is good for the forests of Europe, which, as we have seen here, is necessary and which this House supports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I therefore consider that the Commission’s proposed ‘Forest Focus’ places the emphasis on the right direction. However, I must point out that this proposal precludes the fire prevention measures for which provision is made in Regulation 2158/92, but which were not included in Regulation 1257/99, resulting in a very silly situation in which we have more money for monitoring forests and less money for preventing forest fires. If you cannot stop the fires, what is the point in monitoring the forests? I therefore suggest that attention should be given to continuing and increasing funding for preventive measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Neighbouring countries need to cooperate, so that they can prevent and fight fires efficiently, because fires do not recognise and more often than not cut across borders.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to be able to implement an ambitious programme, the budget of EUR 52 million for 2003-2006 needs to be increased to EUR 67 million, with provision for a proportionate increase following enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
