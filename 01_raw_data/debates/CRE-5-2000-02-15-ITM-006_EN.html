The Commission has proposed harmonising the authorisation procedure so that substances licensed before 1988 are put on an equal footing with substances authorised now. As far as we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are concerned, so far so good.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the directive also encompasses the authorisation of antibiotics, drugs, growth-promoters and genetically-modified organisms. That makes it a question of health, not just approximating laws, which is why we in the Committee on Agriculture take the view that the legal base – Article 37 – is not admissible here and that the Commission should submit its proposal to us on the basis of Article 152, that is to say with codecision by Parliament. We asked the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which pointed out that, as far as approximating laws is concerned, Article 37 is adequate in this case. However, we in the Committee on Agriculture have not confined ourselves to approximating laws; because this proposal also encompasses genetically-modified organisms, we have tabled a further proposed amendment which affects the content and hence public health.</p>
<p class="contents">We negotiated with the Commission for two years on the seed directive and came to a compromise regulating the release of genetically-modified organisms in the directive, taking the text on which Directive 70/524 is based as a starting point. Mr Byrne, we fail to understand why the Commission is not approximating the text on genetically-modified organisms as part of its harmonisation work. We have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the Commission on the text. Moreover, this text has also been adopted in the forest directive on the use of forest reproductive material and we feel that this text urgently needs to be adopted in this directive as well. The Commission pointed out in committee that it plans to present a novel feed directive in the future. However, that should not prevent us from harmonising the text in order to ensure that there is no legal uncertainty between the various directives. We are therefore assuming that you will accept our proposed amendment with regard to genetically-modified organisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Directive 70/524 still contains the old text because the seed directive was submitted to Parliament in 1986 and we then negotiated with the Commission until 1988, while the report on this directive was dealt with in 1994 and Parliament obviously did not accord genetically-modified organisms the same importance then as it did later when I was rapporteur. We therefore assume, Commissioner Byrne, that you too will accept our proposed amendment of the legal base. If you do not, we must reserve the right to refer this report back to committee and then negotiate this sensitive point with you, exactly as we did with the seed directive. I should point out that the text which we have now worked out is a valid compromise, both for your legal service and ours. In other words, we do not need to re-negotiate the text; we merely need to adopt this text in the directive. I can hardly wait, Commissioner Byrne, to hear what you have to say to our proposals.</p>

As far the Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee are concerned, it comes under competition. Of course we have to take account of the competitiveness of the feedingstuffs industry by harmonising provisions for substances authorised before and after 1988. We want to prevent the prices of feedingstuffs from rising and Mr Doyle’s proposed Amendments Nos 4 and 5 therefore deserve our support.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has said in his report, this is first and foremost a consumer policy matter. Food safety must take absolute priority over feedingstuffs in all our discussions. When we talk of transparency in the food chain, that applies from the hayfork to the table fork and consumer protection therefore logically starts with feedingstuffs. The antibiotics, growth promoters and genetically-modified organisms mixed in with feedingstuffs end up in the human food chain. The dioxin scandal brought home to us that we have to get out of this mess once and for all and regulating additives in feedingstuffs is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">According to Article 152 of the EC Treaty, we are obliged to obviate sources of danger to human health, whereby the accent is clearly on sources. Consequently, we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger, i.e. harmful additives in feedingstuffs. Otherwise, in my view, we are beavering away at the symptoms, but not the causes. People are especially wary of GMOs. We must confront increasing public awareness of GMOs by regulating their use in feedingstuffs accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">First, if an additive consists of or contains genetically-modified organisms, then it should only be authorised if it poses no risk to human health or the environment. Secondly, it makes sense to issue provisions for genetically-modified feedingstuff additives similar to the regulations in seed marketing legislation, as the rapporteur has said. And thirdly, if we are to have a transparent consumer policy, we need to label genetically-modified feedingstuffs. A clear declaration on feedingstuffs will allow double freedom of choice, both for the party using the feedingstuff and the subsequent consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">Responsible citizens should, in my view, have a choice. We all talk of scandalised citizens who have lost confidence in food safety. By regulating additives in feedingstuffs consistently, we can help significantly to restore confidence. I too, therefore, can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, we shall be discussing other proposals here in Parliament over the next few months. That this subject is of paramount importance is borne out by the huge public attention which the dioxin, antibiotic, sludge and other scandals have attracted. In other words, this is an important facet of public health protection, which is why we believe that Article 152 should be taken as the legal base, not Article 37, as proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment which the Commission has proposed, namely equal treatment for additives authorised before or after 31 December 1987, is uncontested and has our full support. However, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has voted unanimously on some important amendments to the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation proposed by the Commission conceals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives. Only companies which obtained the original authorisation will have the right to apply and companies which obtained authorisation at a later date will be excluded. This sort of monopoly, which could lead, for example, to an increase in the price of feedingstuffs, should be prevented by granting provisional authorisation to all companies which had marketed a specific substance by 1 April 1998. This would then apply until the re-assessment procedure has been completed.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important amendment to the Commission proposal is the inclusion, as recommended by the rapporteur, of genetically-modified organisms in the directive on additives, taking the compromise negotiated between Parliament and the Commission on authorisation for GMOs outside the scope of the release directive as the starting point. This already gives us a basis for the authorisation of GMOs. It is therefore only logical that we make provision for genetically modified feedingstuff additives in this case, just as we have in regulations already passed in other areas, such as forest reproductive material, to mention just one example.</p>
<p class="contents">The labelling of genetically-modified additives is particularly important in this respect. On the one hand, it enables farmers to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish to use such feedingstuffs and, on the other hand, it enables consumers to avoid foodstuffs produced using GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur, who has gone to a great deal of trouble. I think that we can all hardly wait to hear Mr Byrne’s reply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is less concerned with the types of additives and how they work. </p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is that, in future, all the directives are dealt with under Article 152, since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview. We cannot carry on as we have done up until now, that is to say dealing with each detail on its own, often only after the harm has already been done.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur places the emphasis on the testing and labelling of GMOs in feed additives. However, I should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotics. Certainly, five of the nine antibiotics that were originally permitted in animal feed have now been banned. It is nevertheless extremely important to ban the remaining four, both in the interests of human health and for the sake of the animals themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">We now know that resistance to antibiotics poses a very serious threat to people's health, particularly in the case of small children. A number of Member States are already able to show conclusively that improper practices in connection with the keeping of livestock are totally unnecessary. Several countries phased out antibiotics in animal feedingstuffs a long time ago and others are in the process of successfully doing the same.</p>
<p class="contents">We talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but, in the case of antibiotics, it has long since been forgotten. However, there is another environmental principle at stake, namely the exchange principle. I should like to say a few words about coccidiostats. They are a zootechnical product which is not totally necessary. There is a substitute, which is used to vaccinate chickens. Although it is a little more expensive, it does not harm the environment. Coccidiostats now accompany the manure that is spread on the fields. In that way, they end up in our water supplies which, as we all know, are our most vital resource.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Auroi (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">– (FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on additives in animal feedingstuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feedingstuffs and between producers of these additives. Yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affected Belgium and other European countries last summer we cannot just view this issue in terms of competition. You may recall, even though this passed virtually unnoticed by the general public, that the Commission’s scientific experts discovered industrial residues of dioxin-loaded chemical lime in the pulp of citrus fruit imported from Brazil. We must therefore closely examine all the elements of the chain involved in the manufacture of feedingstuffs for production animals. Incidentally, it is ironic that the problem is much less serious for the feedingstuffs of our dogs, cats and other domestic animals. Is it because of cut-throat and globalised competition that industrialists have allowed this sector to become a way of recycling all the waste from the agri-foodstuffs industry?</p>
<p class="contents">Such a serious issue cannot be limited to a technical debate, even though it is the directive itself which limits the authorisation of antibiotics and other growth promoters. The precautions which we are preparing to take in respect of feedingstuffs must also be applied to the food for the very farm animals which reach our plates. As forcefully underlined by this report, labelling is an absolute necessity so that each farmer on his holding is aware of all the ingredients in the feed which he is giving his livestock. He must also know whether his bag of protein granules includes GMOs as these components could represent a risk to public health. In any case, the precautionary principle requires these products to be clearly traceable at all stages of their marketing.</p>
<p class="contents">However, before labelling we need clear rules. Straight questions must be asked about the real end-use of animal meal, for example. Although we are looking at all the problems caused by these products in ethical and health terms, it is their use which must be questioned today. In this respect, the chapter of the White Paper on food safety which deals with feedingstuffs must serve as a working basis for going beyond mere commercial questions. The Commission has on many occasions used the farm-to-table example which our colleague in the PPE Group has just underlined. This is a good idea but it must be made to be meaningful and, to do this, the problems linked to animals and those linked to consumer health must be dealt with at the same time. </p>
<p class="contents">This is why it is essential to approve Amendment No 2 to Recital 4 which avoids the risks of the monopoly which would arise if companies which were the first to be authorised to place an additive on the market were to remain the only ones able to continue marketing it during the re-evaluation procedure. Also, Amendments Nos 4 and 5 to the new Article 2a must be approved as these will ensure that genetically modified additives are clearly identified as such, thus allowing users to make fully informed decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This directive on additives in feedingstuffs cannot achieve this on its own. Other directives will follow and I believe that the Committee on Agriculture is well placed to deal with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Up the point at which meat, milk, bread and other products are sold over the shop counter, feedingstuffs and additives are structured, mixed, blended, cut and transported several times. The fight by feedingstuff manufacturers to gain maximum market shares causes a lot of problems, just as it does in the foodstuffs industry. The negative consequences are well known, the positive ones less so. I am firmly convinced that the most sensible way of protecting the health of European citizens in the ecological chain is through the production of feedingstuffs in the region for the region. However, more work is needed on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It reflects the views and concerns of all EU citizens in the area of food safety and quality.</p>
<p class="contents">The events of the past couple of years have certainly created an awareness and concern about the real threat to food safety and public health. The swift action taken by this Parliament must be seen by all citizens as their greatest guarantee for the future, for you have set an agenda on food quality to which Member States must conform. But even in this crucial area of administration, Parliament reflects its commitment to subsidiarity by encouraging Member States to take on and to face up to their responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In Agenda 2000, we have in my view prioritised policies that are of direct concern to citizens: food safety, water quality, environmental protection and rural development. If we pursue this agenda with commitment and diligence, the early years of the new millennium will be a milestone in the implementation of policies that are people-focused and very much reflect community needs.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds. Those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely. I compliment the new Commissioner responsible for food safety, Mr Byrne. He has an onerous undertaking but he has responded quickly and effectively to the requirements of this House, as well as to the concern of consumers. I am particularly pleased that my own country, Ireland, is to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of traceability. This will make the island of Ireland the centre of excellence in the future for food production.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is therefore specified that, through the adoption of a regulation, the Commission will replace the existing authorisations with authorisations linked to the person responsible for putting the additives into circulation. This will occur at the same time for all the additives in question. A coherent legal framework must be re-established. As of October 1999 the Commission proposed introducing a legal basis into Directive 70/524/EEC for the replacement of the authorisations. However, we must ensure that competition distortions are not created, as highlighted by Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi.</p>
<p class="contents">Genetically modified additives must also be clearly identified in feedingstuffs in order to allow the end-consumer to choose food without GMO components or based on GMO components and to guarantee this. The consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal has no financial consequences for the Community budget. There must therefore be total transparency for producers and consumers in the area of food safety.

We therefore welcome the Commission’s proposal on additives in feedingstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on behalf of which I am speaking, namely the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, decided in December, on the assumption that the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture would draft such a good report, that we could waive our opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I should like to say a few words on the report and express a view on a number of points. First, perhaps, I should say something on the question of the legal base. Even if we have new Rules of Procedure in Parliament, and it may well be that, with such an ambitious chairman in the Committee on Agriculture, problems of legislative competence will arise more and more frequently between the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment, one thing is always crystal clear for me in this sort of conflict: cohesion in this Parliament is crucial and the legal basis of a question is crucial as far as I am concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, and I must address this comment to you Mr Byrne, I reject your choice of legal basis. If it is merely a hand-me-down legal basis taken over from previous directives, then it is a mistake to keep it. The Treaty of Amsterdam states quite clearly that, where people’s health is concerned, Article 152 is the correct legal base, and may I say to our own Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that it is simply not good enough to look at the Commission’s proposal and say, there is nothing in it about health and consumer protection, so it has nothing to do with health and consumer protection. My group, as Mr Kindermann has already said, will therefore vote tomorrow to change the legal base and I hope that other groups in this House will do likewise.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Byrne, I ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation. If we do not change it and we follow the Legal Affairs Committee, we shall be opening the floodgates to manipulation. The Commission would be able to determine the choice of legal basis by excluding any reference to health policy and we would suddenly find ourselves up against an Article 37.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to comment briefly on two other points. First, genetically modified micro-organisms in feedingstuffs. We cannot just refer to vertical legislation and say that at some point we will need another law. We do not have another law at the moment, and until we do, we must deal with genetically-modified micro-organisms as and when we pass legislation; we must include them as an add-on and insist that they be labelled. The rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign.</p>
<p class="contents">I say now, as I have said on numerous occasions in the past: yes, I too would like the Commission to propose a positive list which we can then debate and deal with in this House, but we do at least need a starting point for a positive list of additives in feedingstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is equally important to have strict hygiene requirements for the manufacture of additives and for proper controls to be carried out in the Member States. There are serious shortcomings in both areas and we have a great deal of work to do yet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an issue that we will no doubt be reconsidering on a number of occasions in the future. What has happened in recent years has brought to our attention the tremendous problems facing not only to the producers of food but also the consumers. We must strike a balance between them. We must resolve this issue, because it is important that consumers should regain confidence in the food they eat.</p>
<p class="contents">One way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned. GMOs are the new challenge facing us. This is something that people are very worried about and quite rightly so: I myself share these concerns. But I think we should not allow our concerns about GMOs to overshadow our concerns about growth promoters used in animal feed or antibiotics used in compound feed. Indeed, we should not allow GMOs to obscure the fact that meat and bonemeal are still included in animal feeds in many countries in Europe. One factor behind these developments that has been referred to in this debate is competition – competition between Member States on the cost of the production of food. These are all areas in which we have to ensure a level playing field: food must be of the same standard in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had the dioxin scare, BSE and many other problems. The main problem is a financial one, namely who bears the cost? The problem is that the cost is not shared equally between the consumer and the producer: the producer has been forced to bear all the cost. We need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred. We must also ensure that the food that is imported into the European Union meets the standards within the European Union. If we do not maintain those standards for imported food then we are going to encounter greater difficulties in the future.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span><span class="bold">.</span> – I should first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur, the committee chairman, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for examining the Commission's proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal is, as some of you have said, rather technical. Nonetheless it has a relatively simple objective: to harmonise procedures governing the authorisation of feed additives. At present there is a difference in treatment between authorisations, depending on whether applications were submitted before or after 1 January 1988. The purpose of the Commission's proposal is to harmonise procedures to ensure that no such difference exists. The scope of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited.</p>
<p class="contents">Five amendments have been presented by Parliament. I regret that the Commission is not in a position to accept these amendments, despite the fact that I am fully aware of the views and commitment of Parliament, the Agricultural Committee and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall deal with each of the individual amendments separately. The first amendment proposes to change the legal base of the proposal by replacing Article 37 with Article 152. I would simply point out that the Commission proposal makes no reference to health or consumer protection. The proposed amendment is technical and cannot be interpreted as having as its primary objective the protection of public health. I note that Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also accepts that Article 37 is the appropriate legal base. I remind Parliament that in Article 152 the primary objective is the protection of health. I commend to you the arguments set out in the letter from the Legal Affairs Committee which sets out the position, in my view, with precision, clarity and commendable brevity.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 2 and 3 go much further than the Commission proposal since they aim to introduce additional provisions on genetically modified additives. I am the first to accept that GMOs are a very important issue. I also accept and acknowledge that a number of initiatives to update EU legislation in the field of GMOs are necessary. However, this technical amendment is not the correct instrument to introduce such initiatives. The Commission is of the view that it is premature to amend the rules currently laid down by Directive 70/524 on genetically modified additives at this stage. Instead it is appropriate to await developments in relation to the common position on the amendment to Directive 90/220, which is currently in second reading in Parliament. The Commission envisages going much further than is currently proposed by Parliament in its amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I can also assure Parliament that I will ensure that the pertinent provisions of Directive 90/220 are included in the proposal for a recasting of Directive 70/524 that the Commission has proposed in the White Paper on food safety to present to Parliament before July 2001. I can also assure Parliament that all observations made here today will be fully taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 4 and 5 are also unacceptable because they give undue preference to copy products by granting them authorisation to be placed into circulation even before an application for authorisation has been submitted. The Commission insists on first evaluating such applications as to their safety and efficacy before giving authorisations. I can only ask you again to bear in mind the technical nature of the Commission proposal and to wait for the substantive proposal for a new directive on additives in feedingstuffs to address wider issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised during the debate. First of all, regarding the observations made by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I wish to assure him that we will change the procedure for authorisation of GMO additives in the Additives Directive 70/524, and not in the Novel Feed Directive. This is a directive that deals more specifically with raw materials rather than with additives.</p>
<p class="contents">The text taken by Parliament is from the Directive which was adopted in 1998. But the vertical legislation in Directive 90/220 on how to carry out the environmental risk assessment of GMOs has changed since then and is still changing. It is before Parliament for second reading. It is my belief that we should await the final outcome of Directive 90/220 and in particular, Article 11.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference was also made to the question of whether this proposal could give rise to the risk of the establishment of monopolies. Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi made reference to this. There are just a few points I should like to make on that issue.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, this matter has been in the pipeline since 1993, so it has not really been sprung on any other commodity producers. Indeed any such applicants can still apply in respect of their particular product. I should also stress that the Commission has never approved any application for an authorisation for GMOs to be included in additives.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Roth-Behrendt made reference to the question of the appropriate legal base, whether it should be Article 37 or Article 152. I again refer to what I said earlier in relation to this and assure her and the House that it would be entirely inappropriate for the Commission to seek to justify any measure based on Article 37 merely by excluding from the provision any reference to public health. This is an issue that has been looked at on at least two separate occasions by the European Court of Justice, which has laid down the legal criteria for situations such as this where the appropriate legal base has to be properly taken into account when putting forward legislation. The jurisprudence of the Court appears to be quite clear in relation to this. As an overall comment to the suggested amendments here, particularly in relation to the legal base issue, it would be inappropriate, in my opinion, to change the legal base to Article 152 in these circumstances, as it would be very likely to fall foul of the objective criteria that have been laid down by the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of you made reference – Mr Nicholson in particular – to the issue surrounding labelling. Directive 70/524 foresees the issue of labelling in the genetic modification of additives. It is already included now: "indication of the particular characteristics due to the manufacturing products". So this issue will be addressed. That formula enabled us to oblige applicants to put on the label the fact that genetic modification techniques have been used in the product, the subject matter of the application.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First allow me to point out, Commissioner Byrne, that the European Parliament has no right of legislative initiative. But we do reserve the right, when you propose to amend a directive or a regulation, to look at the whole regulation and not just the part which you have singled out. Nonetheless, we have confined ourselves in our proposed amendments to bringing the text into line with that of other directives and we have disregarded the question of content. For example, you did not go into antibiotics.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore talking about harmonising the legal provisions in the individual directives. My question, Commissioner Byrne is this: the UN conference in Montreal decided that genetically-modified organisms must be labelled for international trade. Do you really believe that, if we could, Parliament would permit labelling to be left off feedingstuff additives within the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Byrne, it appears that you want to engage in a test of strength with Parliament. We negotiated the seed marketing legislation for two years. I look forward to the next round. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This issue is before Parliament at the moment and there will be other directives dealing it, which will also come under the legal base of Article 152 which gives Parliament full competence in the areas of codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">I would assure Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that it is by no means my intention or wish to have any clash or test of strength with Parliament on this issue. It is my intention, as it has always been, to work in cooperation with Parliament, to ensure that the results we achieve are the very best results.
