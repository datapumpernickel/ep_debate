Their Green Paper initiative is a clear demonstration of their determination to tackle the problem, and I should also like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and on the committees whose opinion was requested, who have made a considerable contribution to the enrichment of my work.</p>
<p class="contents">Piracy and counterfeiting constitute a risk to consumer health and safety. Spare parts for cars and aircraft, toys and pharmaceutical products, all of which endanger the lives of consumers, are to be found on the counterfeit market.</p>
<p class="contents">Piracy also jeopardises innovation and the very future of certain firms. By way of example, I would cite the hundreds of thousands of jobs lost every year within the European Union due to this. Counterfeiters take advantage of the investments made by bona fide industry in new product research and development and in advertising. This also undermines the fiscal resources of the state authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it has been established that this phenomenon is often closely linked to organised crime. My report advocates a coordinated overall approach in order to combat piracy and counterfeiting. This approach has two aspects: prevention and law enforcement.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to prevent this scourge, we must first familiarise ourselves with it. We therefore propose an extensive public awareness campaign, with whatever programmes the Commission can suggest, and increasing awareness among the police, judicial and customs authorities. We plan to set up training schemes for these authorities and a cooperation plan involving the exchange of know-how and adoption of best national practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Prevention must also involve strengthened cooperation between the private and public sectors, and the legal protection of technical arrangements, while obviously respecting consumer rights. Indeed, making allowances for consumer rights and the legitimate demands of professionals is one of the difficult aspects of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, each Member State has its own internal regulations for law enforcement. In order to make them more effective, we must endeavour to harmonise current legislation and thereby remove the disparities between protection systems. Obviously, penal sanctions must be made more stringent and civil measures and procedures must be simplified. The approximation of the penal sanctions applied by different nations in the case of customs offences is certainly desirable. It will also be appropriate to pay particular attention to matters of international judicial cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude this brief overview of my report, I shall say that the effective protection and implementation of intellectual property rights must be an absolute priority in negotiations with countries seeking accession to the European Union and in all relations with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall add that we should try, in our plenary sitting, to preserve the consensus which emerged in committee when voting on this report, in order to ensure that the European Parliament thereby gives a strong political message as to its commitment in the fight against counterfeiting and piracy.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, I appeal to the Commission, which I hope will submit its proposed action programme for responding to the urgent nature of this phenomenon in the very near future. Since the matter would indeed seem genuinely to be one of absolute urgency, especially as regards piracy in the audiovisual media, the Commission must not fail to respond in a decisive and urgent manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps I do not need to point this out. There is clearly a risk that research, innovation, advertising investment, in short, innovation as a whole, will come to a standstill if industrial property rights are not adequately safeguarded. This is why these rights must be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">There are certain factors that have exacerbated the current problem, perhaps the most important of which concerns the technical advances that have been made, which enable computing, audiovisual and phonographic material to be easily reproduced very cheaply. The available figures for forgeries in these areas are scandalous.</p>
<p class="contents">What concerns us, then, is the impact that the completion of the internal market will have on the problem. In a Europe without borders, but having various legal systems, counterfeiters will obviously always choose the legal system that is the most beneficial to their own criminal ends. The Commission’s initiative in drafting the Green Paper is therefore praiseworthy, as it will initiate a debate to which all sectors concerned can make a contribution. We must remember that this debate will focus more on the contents of harmonisation than on harmonisation itself, since this harmonisation is the starting point that all parties have accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be premature for the European Parliament to enunciate its position on certain points, the precise content of which will emerge from the debate which is now beginning, but in some cases, it may be appropriate to establish this content. This applies, for example, to the issue of the right to information. It is precisely because we are aware of the problems encountered when introducing such a measure with regard to other laws in the past that we have to support the introduction of a law obliging vendors of illegal products to identify their supplier, as long as legislation on data protection and the constitutional right not to incriminate oneself are protected.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must express our support for certain technical mechanisms which facilitate the identification of goods. Now – and this is the basis of the amendment tabled by the Socialist Group – it must be stressed that this mechanism cannot and must not identify the distributors, because this could endanger parallel imports between Member States. We have tabled an amendment specifically in order to prevent these measures from being used for inappropriate ends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important both in terms of the functioning of the single market and, most importantly, for the protection of consumers. It is right that we should focus on the way in which counterfeiting is growing between the Member States, within the single market, as well as beyond the frontiers of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The consumer can be conned by counterfeiting in all circumstances very easily but it is always a menace. It is a menace because the counterfeit product carries none of the necessary guarantees of safety and quality which come from a product which the manufacturer can stand by and endorse. It can be dangerous to health. It can certainly be dangerous to innovation. It can be dangerous for the future of research. There is very little to be said for the counterfeiter except that, at best, he or she is a parasite upon productive industry.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a victimless crime. We are talking about things that seriously damage the marketplace. For that reason, the Environment and Consumer Policy Committee takes much the same line as the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in supporting and endorsing this report. Naturally the point we would wish to make in conclusion, however, is that in protection of the consumer, the provision of information must involve consumer organisations within the Member States themselves. They are best placed to pick up some of the worst scams which now prevail and inform the public that what may, at first sight, appear to be a bargain, is really a snare and delusion.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point has been touched upon by the previous speaker. It is this: there are those who would say that this debate embraces the debate about copyright and trademarks. These must be kept separate. A number of amendments from the political groups and the committees have tried to make this clear. There is a debate going on – and the Commissioner knows perfectly well about this – about parallel imports and whether these are now being used in some cases in a way which is damaging to trade, anti-competitive and against the interests of the consumer. We do not want to see these two debates confused. What we are attacking here in this proposal, and quite rightly, is those who, by the parasitic practice of counterfeiting, batten upon the public, confuse and deceive it and can sometimes actually damage society in the process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The text gives an accurate outline of the extent of the damage and its catastrophic repercussions on the economies of our countries and also on the health and safety of our fellow citizens, since the phenomenon now involves sectors as potentially dangerous as medicines and car parts. We can therefore welcome this appeal for increased awareness and for a uniform mobilisation of resources across the board in order to limit and eventually curb this scourge.</p>
<p class="contents">While the Fourtou report does not appear to play down the significance of the damage, it does, however, appear to disregard the urgency requiring that an appropriate policy is implemented straight away. Reading this text gives the impression that Parliament is urging the Commission to consider with the utmost urgency the technical definition of the measures which should be implemented, whilst in this respect the counterfeiters are, as always, one step ahead in terms of technology. If it is appropriate to use any more sophisticated technology that might make counterfeiting and piracy more expensive and more difficult to engage in, then the fight we undertake should not neglect to use radical means, applicable immediately. Failing to do so would mean that our policies, however well intentioned, will be forever missing the boat.</p>
<p class="contents">The text is still particularly vague as to the measures to actually protect patents and intellectual property rights which it would like to see Member States adopting. Without such measures, crafty economic opportunists and seasoned technological plagiarists will continue to pass well-disguised theft off as innovation. Similarly, something is amiss when we are striving for a raft of protective measures, which would make it possible to put an immediate stop to the sale of these goods, while there are reasonable grounds for suspicion and when the only thing lacking is the time needed to furnish proof. In addition to all the necessary schemes intended to combat the sale of these fraudulent goods, however, it is essential to cut off the supply of these goods pouring into the single market, flouting all the principles which are supposed to regulate its operation.</p>
<p class="contents">And in order to do so, Parliament must agree to remove the veil of doctrine which blurs the vision of the great majority of its Members when it comes to incontrovertible evidence of the need to re-establish internal border controls within the Community. It would also have been wise to specify in some form other than the desperately vague paragraphs 31 and 34 exactly what obligations would be required of candidate countries on the subject. Finally, and this is certainly the most serious issue, what cooperation policy do Member States intend to implement as of now in order to fight not only against the fly-by-night street trader, but more especially against organised crime, which nowadays apparently is becoming the real beneficiary of this expanding sector of activity?</p>
<p class="contents">The Union for a Europe of Nations Group will vote in favour of this report, even though it represents only the first minimal step in a Community-wide policy in which each Member State must take hard and fast action, and urges Parliament to vote in favour of its amendments, which would make it possible to give the text much more force than it has at it stands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Medina Ortega (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, this report is extremely late in coming, given that the Commission’s Green Paper was adopted on 15 October 1998. It is true that, in the meantime, we have had the elections to the European Parliament, but if consultation with Parliament regarding a Green Paper takes more than a year and a half, something is not working as it should, and Parliament and the Commission should therefore review their methods for cooperation so that this issue can be resolved more speedily.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Paper is, of course, a good one. It was well received by the various parliamentary committees and Mrs Fourtou has produced a good report that was adopted almost unanimously by the Legal Affairs Committee, with 23 votes for and one abstention. The opinions of the various committees are also favourable and have been well received; the opinion of Mr Berenguer Fuster, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the opinion of Mr Whitehead, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and the opinion of Mrs Montfort, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. The Legal Affairs Committee has incorporated most of the proposals made by the various committees asked for an opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important is that we are moderate and restrained when it comes to adopting the report. The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, for example, has tabled amendments which may affect the internal market. Specifically, I think that Amendment No 6, tabled by Mrs Thomas-Mauro, which requests that border controls be established at internal borders, is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of this kind of initiative is not to rebuild the borders that we have already removed, and that is one of the reasons why Mr Berenguer Fuster and myself have tabled Amendment No 9, which is designed to prevent internal controls from being re-established by clamping down on piracy. We must ensure, for example, that by clamping down on piracy, we do not contravene the agreements on the liberalisation of the internal market in matters of distribution. We must also prevent this provision, as Mr Whitehead said earlier, from leading to the regulation of all intellectual property rights, in the area of patents, for example, which is why we reject some of the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I think that the report is a good one, but I would draw your attention to one issue: when we discuss the conditions for accession of the candidate countries, we must attach particular importance to the issue of the protection of intellectual property and protection against piracy. In the accession negotiations, it must be made clear to candidate countries that the issue is extremely important to us and is, of course, extremely important to relations with third countries, since the development of international trade must be based on the recognition of the protection of intellectual and industrial property. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is vital for intellectual property to be protected.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">There are huge financial interests at stake for companies or people in possession of intellectual property. The development of society may suffer because artists are less inclined, in view of the enormous amount of counterfeiting that takes place, to invest time, energy and creativity in new products. The taxation system is adversely affected as a result, because counterfeiting is usually done on the black market. So I welcome the fact that something is to be done about it.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">If rules are to be put in place, then, as a liberal, I feel they ought to go the whole distance and not just part of the way. Indeed, that is why rules must be put in place, and why we have tabled an amendment together with other groups to make the end-user liable for punishment for possession. After all, as long as the end-user is able, without let or hindrance, to possess and make use of counterfeit products, there will still be a market for them and it will be difficult to cut off the producers and manufacturers at source because it is easy to make a profit and it will also continue to be a lucrative business.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we are pleased that several groups have given their support to Amendment No 8, which states that possession will have a deterrent and preventive effect on the consumer. This will be under certain provisos, of course, because the amendment came about on the basis of a compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that possession is to be made punishable, or that the possibility will exist of making it punishable in any case, and I would like to see this extended to the handling of stolen goods; if someone were to offer me a bicycle at a very low price, I would not buy it. It is a different way of thinking and the intention is not to introduce a separate supervisory body.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This report has got us off to a good start, but we do hope that the Member States will implement it in an effective and robust manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, piracy is commonly thought to be a trivial offence: people might think of Calvin Klein T-shirts or RayBan sunglasses that one can buy for next to nothing on some far-flung beach, or they might think of CDs that one can easily get hold of on the quiet. What many people are not really aware of yet is that piracy poses a real threat to public health and to the consumer in general when it involves spare parts for vehicles, particularly aircraft, or medicines, and I believe we have a duty to pass on this information, so that when it comes to taking preventive measures, it is easier to get away from the idea that piracy is a trivial offence.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The point has already been made several times today that we are confusing issues. However, I am not accusing Mrs Fourtou of this, rather all those of us who do not take the time to get to grips with the minor detail of each text, and who are no longer able, owing to pressure of work, to properly verify and counter-verify the investigations that texts require, for we are confusing issues. We are confusing copyright with the protection of industrial property. They are two different things. They are the same in that they both relate to counterfeiting in this instance, and to criminal activity. Needless to say, both types of activity must be punished.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Mention has also already been made today of the fact that artists, for example, would suffer terrible financial losses as a result. I would take issue with this because it is not strictly true. After all, artists are just happy to be heard, and it is of secondary importance to them whether the CD is a pirated copy or not, because once they have become so famous that pirated copies are being made of their CDs, they can manage perfectly well without these royalties. But they create a market for themselves in which to appear. I thought I would just mention this as a side issue.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">There is also a terribly malicious rumour circulating, which cannot, of course, by its very nature, be verified, that a great deal of counterfeiting and piracy goes on under cover of industry itself. That is the most reprehensible thing I have ever heard! If that really is the case – and we would have to look into it of course – then our approach should not be to punish consumers in the first instance, but those involved in the manufacture of the goods. There is also a difference, as I see it, between a small family in a poor country endeavouring, in a ‘family firm’, to improve its fortunes a little by counterfeiting, and T-shirts or other products of our consumer world, produced under the protective mantle of industry simply being sold there so as to create a market. I would like to see us draw distinctions here.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to stress once again that I am sceptical as to whether we really should be meting out such severe punishment to the end-user, for it is scarcely possible these days to detect the difference between an original and a copy. One needs a trained eye to do so! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must dress the wounds suffered by European industry, amounting to millions of euros (though the movement of the euro may relativise such a figure). We must consider the implications of these inferior quality products for consumers. We must find the means to curb the globalisation of counterfeiting and piracy.</p>
<p class="contents">This text illustrates our inability to regulate the internal market since we eliminated internal border controls within the European Union. The fact is, establishing a single market without internal borders, without these safety valves which, in the final analysis, would not disturb the ordinary citizen, offers an area which is a sheer delight, and a profitable one at that, for criminals of every kind. Modern-day pirates, come to Europe, the only risk you run is that of a few spot checks being carried out by customs officials looking for the needle in the European haystack!</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was indeed well advised and insightful when it adopted the opinion, since it adopted the amendments I tabled. Admittedly, candidate countries must undertake not to counterfeit or make pirate copies of our services (only, perhaps, of our values) but we should also consider the countries with whom we sign customs agreements. Should the aforesaid undertaking not be a condition <span class="italic">sine qua non</span>?</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, let us not be naively optimistic. A totally free area cannot be created until the structures to monitor this freedom are ready. I wished to point this out in my Amendment No 6, which was adopted within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Customs controls at the internal borders of Member States, in this specific context, do not represent a barrier to the single market but, quite the opposite, offer protection as regards the jobs, health and safety of European Union residents.</p>
<p class="contents">In adopting this very important amendment, realistic and constructive Members of Parliament will be cultivating the art of good border management. We must ensure that the European Union is not replaced by a poor quality counterfeit which would leave our States vulnerable to cross-border crime and which would be to the detriment of its inhabitants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our markets are adversely affected by counterfeiting and piracy, as are all world markets. It would, therefore, be a dangerously narrow approach to confine ourselves too much to the single market, suggesting that the entire solution could be found there.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like, at this Green Paper stage, to stress the fact that such illegal activities, when they affect pharmaceutical products, spare parts and toys, constitute a very real risk to human health and safety. And I appeal to reason to ensure that the attempts to reconcile national approaches do not compromise the arrangements already in place in our national states. I foresee the risks of allowing harmonisation to become an end in itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the real risk of losing focus, I should like to issue a warning to the Commission. Rather than on the counterfeiting of garden gnomes which it mentions, we should be concentrating on protecting patents, trademarks and copyright, which make it possible to guarantee consumer protection as well as ensuring the continued existence of firms that undertake significant investment up front in research and development and in the manufacture of quality products. Many jobs in the textile sector, the automobile industry and the sphere of culture also depend on these.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be serious about this. Software protection within European or national administrations requires much more than a code of conduct, but rather the strict observance of regulations, and I hope that the Commission will acknowledge that this is more a matter of determination to adopt sound managerial practices than of the introduction of a harmonised arsenal of legislative and criminal law measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Counterfeiting and product and brand piracy cause an enormous amount of damage. The figures produced by the Commission make for alarming reading. Nevertheless, one thing I would say in connection with the problem which has already been given voice to here today, and which is a serious one as I see it, is that, in future, existing, private information systems should be employed and linked up in the fight against counterfeiting and piracy. Once again, there is a danger that the European Parliament, in endeavouring to tackle abuses efficiently, will lose a sense of perspective and set up a Big Brother state.</p>

This document clearly sets out the importance of intellectual property in the contemporary world and the damage that theft of that property can do.</p>
<p class="contents">While many people quite rightly consider that burglary is wrong, there is not somehow the same feeling about, for example, the illegal taking and using of intellectual property, for example, pirated CDs or using Napster to get other people’s music off the Internet. But, of course, there is no fundamental difference between the two. In some ways the most interesting challenge posed by these relatively new forms of crime are the means of countering them.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, in any pan-national single market, measures cannot be confined to a single Member State’s jurisdiction but it does not automatically follow that the correct answer is European-wide harmonisation of penalties, criminal law and procedures. There is undoubtedly an overriding requirement for coordination and a single strategy to deal with the counterfeiters and pirates, but the principles of mutual recognition have not, in my view, been given the prominence I would like to have seen in the conclusions to the report. This tends to emphasise the need to harmonise more than is appropriate or necessary in the circumstances. However, having said that, it is important for the European Union’s judicial area to have a coherent and comprehensive framework for dealing with the problems of counterfeiting and piracy which is widely carried out both within and without the Union by increasingly determined and technologically sophisticated criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">We are often glibly told, rightly in fact I believe, that we are moving into a knowledge-based society. We therefore cannot allow that knowledge to be stolen from those to whom it belongs as doing that will undermine the economic base of the society. If that happens, we allow it to happen at our peril. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, we must take preventive as well as repressive measures. The consequences in economic terms are certainly not to be underestimated. According to estimates, the damage done accounts for between 5 and 7% of world trade. I would therefore ask the Commission if this problem should not be accorded more attention during the on-going negotiations at the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">After all, most pirated products come from countries outside the European Union, with the damaging effects being felt here. I will give you an example: according to recent investigations, if we were to reduce piracy by 10% in the information technology sector alone, this would immediately create 250 000 jobs within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We do well to put the emphasis on prevention. The European consumer must be made to realise that purchasing counterfeit products has a damaging effect at various levels, himself included. It hampers economic growth and endangers public health and safety. Worse still, there is a growing conviction that piracy is in the hands of organised criminals, who make a living out of it and engage in money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The action plan for combating organised crime made reference to this as far back as June 1997, as well as calling upon both the Council and Commission to put common provisions in place in the fight against organised crime pertaining to counterfeiting.</p>

The figures tell a different story. There is big money in illegal counterfeiting and piracy. What is worrying is that these criminal practices are rapidly reaching a professional standard.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I completely share the rapporteur’s view that there is a need for effective countermeasures, in respect of both civil and criminal law, although the latter falls within the authority of the Member States. Wherever illegal trading disrupts the functioning of the single market, the Union has a clear task ahead of it. The proposed resolution is designed to encourage the Commission to carry on down the path we have chosen. That being the case, the report is deserving of our support.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I do, however, consider the report to be rather inconsistent. Many tasks are assigned to the Commission when it is not always necessary to do so. Campaigns to raise people’s awareness seem to me to be a good idea, but this needs to be organised at the level of individual Member States, rather than at a European level. There is a need for minimum harmonisation of legislation, also in respect of criminal law, but it is jumping the gun to talk about involving Europol.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Many of the proposals have already been implemented in the Netherlands, and the same may well go for other Member States. Therefore, the Commission is going to have to focus primarily on collating information about this, possibly setting up cooperation agreements between Member States, for example in relation to customs, and produce a report on its findings. In this way, it will be possible to devise a well thought through and effective strategy for the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is to be welcomed that the Commission can count on Parliament’s support when it comes to taking concrete measures pursuant to the Green Paper. I would like to briefly go into the context and the most important phases of the consultation procedure and would like to say, in this connection, that the Green Paper on combating counterfeiting and piracy is of great importance to the smooth functioning of the single market. An amendment has been tabled to this effect, Amendment No 6 that is, and I would like to go into this in greater detail. As far as Amendment No 6 is concerned, I would like you to know that the Commission does not support the reintroduction of controls at the Community’s internal borders. The single market is now an unqualified success and there is no reason to impede the smooth functioning of the single market. The Commission does agree, however, that we must step up and improve the fight against counterfeiting and piracy, although it takes the view that there are other ways of achieving this goal rather than through the reintroduction of controls at the internal borders. Mrs Fourtou’s report contains a number of interesting measures, for example, for strengthening mutual assistance between the Member States, imposing heavier penalties and improving civil measures and procedures. I say that with particular reference to the comments made by Mrs Thomas-Mauro, who defended Amendment No 6 on this matter, and I am bound to advise her that the Commission cannot support the amendment. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, as you are aware, counterfeiting and piracy have become a widespread phenomenon over the past ten years, with a global impact, and this has been echoed by various speakers this morning. Such activities damage recognised trade and distort competition, particularly when, at the same time, advantage is taken of the disparities in protective measures between the Member States. What is more, criminal organisations seem to be becoming increasingly involved in the trade in counterfeit products and those obtained through piracy, and this is causing the business community to lose confidence in the single market, leading, in turn, to a decline in investment. If we want the single market to be successful, then it is absolutely essential for inventors, research institutes, artists and large and small enterprises to have confidence in the Community’s ability to safeguard their interests effectively. We need to tackle counterfeiting and piracy for the sake of innovation, employment and competitiveness in Europe, and that too has been emphasised more than once by those attending your sitting, Mr President, and also by Mrs Fourtou in her report. It is also important from the point of view of public health and safety. Counterfeiting can have serious consequences where pharmaceutical products, toys and automobile spare parts are concerned, and that is why the Commission has decided to tackle this problem and propose a number of solutions for bringing about an improvement in the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The consultation procedure initiated by the Green Paper has proved successful. The interested parties confirmed unanimously that we are dealing with an important subject. The business community subscribes to the proposals in the Green Paper and is asking the European Union to come up with an initiative for tackling the problem. The Economic and Social Committee, which also has a role to play here of course, produced a positive opinion on the Green Paper in February 1999 and various proposals from the Green Paper were incorporated in this opinion. The parliamentary recommendations Mrs Fourtou has included in her report are extremely interesting. Needless to say, the Commission’s services will look into them more closely and I am assuming that the Commission will react favourably to the majority of these proposals. In addition, I am planning to draft a communication, pursuant to the Green Paper, which will require the Commission’s approval in the very near future. An inventory will be made of the consultation procedure in this communication and an action plan will also be presented. I have the following to say to Mrs Fourtou on the subject of the action plan, particularly as she made a point of asking me about it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, we do not necessarily need to think only in terms of measures of a legislative nature, although they are still important. Mr Manders and also Mr De Clercq, and likewise Mr Inglewood, have spoken of the need to harmonise certain measures of a legislative nature and that is important of course. Amendment No 8, which relates to this issue, is therefore acceptable to the Commission. However, as I said, we do not just need to think in terms of measures of the legislative variety. I am anticipating that the action plan I have just discussed will also generate support, as I said, for information and awareness campaigns regarding the dangers posed by counterfeiting and piracy. </p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(EN)</span> Parallel imports are a different issue from the topic we are discussing this morning. Parallel imports concern products which have been commercialised for the first time in a third country by the rightholder or with his consent. Counterfeiting, on the other hand, relates to products which are fraudulently produced and which are commercialised without the consent of the rightholder. There is strong concern from industry that counterfeit products might be mixed with parallel imports.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the question of parallel imports and especially the question of exhaustion of trademark rights is under discussion as a separate issue within the Council and Parliament. Recently the Commission sent an internal paper on this issue to Parliament for information. I hope that the issue of parallel imports or, if you like, exhaustion of trademarks, which is the same subject matter, will be discussed at the Internal Market Council which is due to take place towards the end of this month. Obviously, Parliament will be advised as soon as possible thereafter of the outcome of those discussions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL) </span>There is also something else I would like to say to Mr De Clercq, who spoke of the World Trade Organisation, the WTO, and who asked to what extent this problem could be dealt with within the scope of the WTO. Well, there are agreements on intellectual property and the associated rights, and that is to do with international trade of course, which is why agreements of this kind come under the umbrella of the World Trade Organisation. These agreements also contain important measures concerning the way in which intellectual property rights can be put into practice. Now, before we start thinking about strengthening these measures, as far as the Commission is concerned, it appears important to ensure that they are also put into practice in an effective manner, particularly by the developing countries. So let us first see how far the measures that have been agreed upon work in practice, outside Europe, and particularly in relation to the developing countries. Afterwards, and in the light of our experiences, let us see to what extent it is necessary to uphold and strengthen these measures.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, that is what I wanted to say in response to the comments made by certain members attending this sitting, and to the questions some of them have asked. On a final note, allow me to say that the Commission hopes to engage in fruitful cooperation with Parliament on this important issue and may the sound cooperation we have enjoyed hitherto continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
