As you know, stocks of cod in several areas are in a quite disastrous state. Since the year 2000, the situation has dramatically worsened and the stocks are threatened with collapse. ISIS, the international scientific body, has advised closing cod, whiting and haddock fisheries for the duration of this year. This, it is thought, would be the safest way to rescue our cod stocks. However, such a drastic measure does not take account of the massive economic and social consequences that this would have on the entire sector. That is why a sustainable plan needs to incorporate all three dimensions of sustainability and that includes above all the economic and social consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore tabled an improved recovery plan to our technical and scientific committee as an alternative to a moratorium. It issued a favourable opinion. We then tabled this improved plan to the Council. In December 2002, however, the Council was only able to agree on a transitional recovery plan. I should like to stress, however, that this transitional plan is very positive because it already contains substantially reduced quotas, low fishing effort and improved monitoring mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time it was agreed that the Commission would make two new proposals for the long-term recovery of cod and hake in the spring. We will be tabling these proposals in April, and this week a hearing is taking place with the fishing sector and scientists from all of the Member States. I myself opened this hearing just this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously the long-term plan to rescue cod will be designed in such a way as to also make an appropriate contribution to stock recovery. I am aware that this plan will have severe consequences for fishermen in the short term. However, we can also intervene here with the help of the fisheries structural fund and cofinance social measures, such as for example compensation payments for the temporary cessation of activity or retraining measures. I can only urgently call on the Member States to take their responsibilities seriously and provide more funds in their programmes for measures of this kind. So far the following funds have been programmed for such compensation payments under the Structural Funds: Belgium has set aside EUR 800 000, Denmark EUR 1.6 million, the Netherlands EUR 1.3 million and France EUR 3.5 million. On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Germany have not programmed any measures of this kind at all.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the additional EUR 150 million of compensation to alleviate the socio-economic consequences in the regions concerned, I should like to make it quite clear that it is not the Commission that makes this decision, but the budgetary authority. Unfortunately, however, the Commission has not yet received any positive signal, either from the Council or Parliament, that the budgetary authority would accept such a proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to your demand for the creation of regional advisory fora, I fully agree with this proposal. I would explicitly call on the Member States to take the initiative here so that regional bodies of this kind can be set up as soon as possible. These fora would moreover provide a place where scientists, fishermen and all of the other stakeholders, including the regional authorities, could do precisely what you call for in your motion, namely hold regular consultations.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the call for extended powers of codecision, you know what the Commission's position is: the Commission fully supports this request.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stevenson (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">author</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, last December, as the Commissioner has just outlined, following a five-day meeting of the Council of Ministers, a new transitional cod recovery plan was agreed which has had a devastating impact on much of the EU whitefish sector. Under these new regulations, which came into effect on 1 February this year, savage quota cuts have been linked to draconian limits on fishing effort. Whitefish vessels can now only fish for 15 days a month, including steaming time to the fishing grounds, and the 15 days will be reduced to 12 days unless a further 20% of the fleet is decommissioned. We are literally asking our fishermen to burn their boats.</p>
<p class="contents">Scotland, where there are only 162 dedicated boats left in what used to be Europe’s biggest whitefish fleet, will bear the brunt of these cuts. If we scrap another 20%, the fleet will fall below the critical mass needed to sustain jobs in our harbours, ports and processing factories. The industry will go into free fall. In addition, the majority of the remaining vessels will be ones that, because they are under 10 years old, are not eligible for decommissioning subsidy. These are the vessels on which the future of our whitefish fleet relies. These are the vessels on which we rely to catch cod, haddock, plaice and other whitefish once the stocks have recovered and the total allowable catch limits have been increased. Sadly, however, these are also the vessels with the biggest outstanding debts to the banks. It would not surprise me if many of them were forced into bankruptcy. The skippers and crews, who have often mortgaged their homes to raise the cash to build these boats, will lose not only their jobs and boats but also their homes.</p>
<p class="contents">But Scotland is not the only country affected by these draconian measures. Ireland, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands and France have all suffered cuts. This is why the Committee on Fisheries voted unanimously - at least with only one abstention - to support this emergency resolution, the crux of which calls upon the Commission to adopt less drastic measures for the long-term recovery of cod which would secure the maximum number of jobs in the EU whitefish sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution also calls for the allocation of an additional EUR 150 million to compensate fishers, processors and ancillary workers affected by these conservation measures. I would suggest that EUR 48 million should be used for transitional funding to compensate fishermen and ancillary workers affected by the 15-days-at-sea fishing limits. I would hope that this aid could be found from the flexibility instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">The balance of EUR 102 million should be reprogrammed out of the FIFG for the 2004 budget and should be targeted towards golden handshakes to induce fishers and ancillary workers to leave the industry, early retirement grants and retraining aid, as mentioned by Commissioner Fischler.</p>
<p class="contents">One day last week in Scotland the entire whitefish fleet agreed to switch off its satellite tracking systems for 24 hours in silent protest at the catastrophe that has engulfed the communities involved. In the main fisheries inspection centre there is a large screen on which dozens of tiny lights indicate the position of each fishing boat in the North Sea and around the Scottish coast. These lights represent information beamed from the satellite-tracking systems. One by one the lights went out, signifying in a dramatic way the fate that awaits Scotland's whitefish vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the House will agree to provide this urgent and desperately needed support. Our fishing communities are crying out for help. Please heed their call. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Fishing is an economic activity. Sometimes we worry more about fish than about fishermen and we have to deal with both. It is true that it is an economic activity that involves a natural resource which must be protected. But this protection should be carried out through reasonable long-term measures, with expert scientific support – one of the European Union’s outstanding tasks – and with the support of the sector in question. And when these measures are taken in this way, the sector itself will accept them better. Furthermore, we must lay down accompanying socio-economic measures in order to alleviate their possible consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution being presented today to the plenum in the name of the Committee on Fisheries has been entirely accepted and moves in the direction which we have discussed in the Committee on Fisheries not only for cod and for these white species, but for all species in general. Today we are talking about cod and all the white species, but tomorrow we may talk about others and I believe that the solidarity with the people affected is laudable – in this case with the Nordic fishermen and essentially with the countries mentioned here, as well as Scotland, and all the Members have worked together on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been pleased by the words of the Commissioner in support of these measures proposed in the committee and I would like, Mr President, on a personal basis and as a Galician, to say that, just as this House showed solidarity with Galicia in the case of the failure to reach an agreement with Morocco or following the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident, it is now the turn of the Nordic countries and the Scots and we will stand together and show mutual solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stihler (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, in December 2002 the Fisheries Council agreed a compromise which effectively halved catches for the Scottish and UK whitefish fleets and stopped vessels going to sea for more than 15 days a month. These are drastic measures but far short of the all-out moratorium recommended to the Commission by its scientific advisors on fish stocks, ISIS.</p>
<p class="contents">United Kingdom and Scottish ministers have been attacked for agreeing to the hard-fought compromise. At the time one of the fishing leaders commented that he doubted that the Archangel Gabriel could have got a better deal in the circumstances. Inevitably such actions have a socio-economic impact on the communities that depend on fishing for whitefish - especially cod. We must acknowledge this.</p>
<p class="contents">I give my personal support to the resolution before us this evening. I also welcome the GBP 50 million compensation package approved by the Scottish Parliament last week and the related compensation packages in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">It is significant that we are discussing this issue as vital talks take place today and tomorrow in Brussels. Scottish and UK fishermen have joined fellow fishermen and civil servants from other EU countries at the European Commission's Fisheries Advisory Committee. Talks will focus on a long-term cod recovery plan. I am delighted that the Fisheries Commissioner, Mr Fischler, will bring forward amendments to the current restrictions which have proved to be 'too rigid'. However, the negotiations on the long-term recovery plan will be tough. We really have to think carefully about the right road to take. I want us to examine all possible options on effort control. Saying 'sod the cod', allowing fishing to continue and hoping for the best is hardly an option, nor is renationalising the CFP. This ducks the difficult issues posed by the need for stock recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">We really need to rationalise the CFP and cod recovery. We must work in a cooperative manner with industry, ministers and other organisations to seek a common solution. We must also create regional committees, allowing decisions to be taken as close to those affected as possible. Doing nothing in the light of declining cod stocks is not an option. The difficult task of arriving at a quota figure that is sustainable, yet scientifically credible, remains. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For colleagues whose constituencies are landlocked I offer the following analogy: supposing for good environmental reasons, such as a drastic cut in CO2 omissions, road haulage operators were told by the EU that they could only use their lorries for two weeks out of every four, and then only on condition that a significant proportion of the vehicles were taken off the road altogether. Imagine the fiscal consequences for the businesses concerned, then imagine that these businesses are the mainstay of towns and villages with fragile economies, and think what the outcome would be for local shops, schools and other services.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, we who represent fishing communities around the North Sea - certainly those of us from Scotland - do not need to use our imaginations. We can already feel the effects. Of course assistance with restructuring can be given from within Member States. As Mrs Stihler has already said, the Scottish Executive has managed to find GBP 50 million from its already restricted budget. That is a measure of the seriousness of the situation. But I believe that the EU too must shoulder some of the financial responsibility. This is in part because past shortcomings of the CFP have contributed to the crisis. To a larger extent, it is because any democracy must adhere to the moral principle that where the direct effect of legislation is the destruction of people's honest livelihoods, they are at least compensated accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the EU counts itself as such a democracy and that this principle will be fully expressed in the forthcoming vote.</p>

I can assure fellow Members that there certainly is a major crisis of confidence in the European Union's ability to manage fisheries at all. However, I will concentrate my remarks tonight on the main and most important purpose of the resolution which accompanies this question, that is, the social and economic consequences arising from the decisions made at the December Fisheries Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Businesses are already feeling the pain from the interim cod recovery measures: not just the fish-catching sector, but whole communities. It is predicted that the long-term recovery plan will continue to inflict real economic and social hardship. I hope, therefore, that this House will unite in support of this resolution, calling for up to EUR 150 million of additional EU funding - and 'additional' is the important word here. This amount would be in addition to Member States' commitments, constituting a fund to help offset the widest possible range of economic and social consequences that the European Union fisheries management decision will inflict.</p>
<p class="contents">My preference would be to aim for the use of the flexibility instrument for this. Not so long ago, as has been pointed out, the political will of this House and the Council, and the loss of fishing rights in Moroccan waters, brought about a similar, highly-concentrated downturn in activity. There will have to be detailed discussion of plans and priorities for the use of such a fund, but I certainly hope that this week we will take the first step towards setting it up. I call upon the UK Government to abandon its previous resistance to taking part in such a process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim is, in fact, long-term restocking designed to preserve as many jobs as possible in the fishing communities that have been netting white fish for years and that are to be temporarily and fairly compensated and not required to diversify once and for all into other areas of activity. In order to attain this objective, we need not, however, confine ourselves to these draconian measures for limiting the number of days on which fishing is engaged in. It is imperative that we learn lessons from the Canadian experience, which we need to examine very carefully indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">The moratorium introduced in the North Atlantic twelve years ago has not, I regret to say, had the expected effect. The cessation of fishing has had no effect upon the state of cod stocks off Newfoundland and Nova Scotia and in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Forty thousand jobs have been destroyed but, for all that, there has been no restocking. The Canadians now recognise that fishing is just one factor among others in the development of cod stocks. Other factors play key roles and must be studied much more shrewdly and taken into account to the same extent as fishing: climatic factors, the change in water temperature, the importance of natural mortality and the significant removal of cod by seals, of which there is a population explosion, as well as by mackerel and herring, which are proving to be great consumers of cod eggs. It would also seem that, in Canada, fishermen have not been sufficiently involved in the preparation and management of restocking plans.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want our game plan to give us every chance of success, it is therefore vital quickly to define a framework in which it will be possible to collate local experience and scientific expertise on a permanent basis and not confine ourselves to banning fishing and keeping vessels in port, as if such measures alone were automatically going to result in restocking. The latter, rudimentary courses of action must necessarily and quickly be supplemented by in-depth analyses – funded through the release of financial resources – of a wide range of factors, extending to include the effects of fishing for the purpose of producing fishmeal. This would make it possible to implement a much more elaborate administration policy and so to preserve as far as possible what must remain our chief objective: a future for the fishing communities concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is because of the failure of the common fisheries policy that we are having to provide this money.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also look at industrial fishing - and I know there are mixed views about this - in which sand eels are extracted from the sea bed. Sand eels are part of the food chain of the cod and these things are all linked. The process of having quotas for fish and throwing healthy fish overboard over the years has also contributed greatly to the position we are in. But we must now face up to the reality that cod stocks are low and that the families and communities involved in the fishing industry who need support should receive it.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly support the resolution to provide GBP 150 million of additional funding. I would urge the UK Government to take this up and use it in a very efficient way. One of the problems with funding of this type, as was found when it was used in Spanish waters, is that it is very difficult for the fishing boats, those tied up for the processing industry and others, to claim these funds. I would urge Commissioner Fischler to look at the way this money can be spent. If we offer people money and they cannot then obtain it, they will only end up more frustrated than they were before. I urge everybody to support this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The resolution deals with those aspects we are discussing in Parliament and, in general, with what gives rise to the problems in the regions when we implement such dramatic decisions concerning certain fish stocks – in this case, cod in particular. There can be no doubt that there must be a balance in the marine environment. There must be a balance in the stocks. Clearly, such dramatic decisions can, however, be damaging to the regions and to those communities that depend upon fisheries and the industry surrounding fisheries. The EU must therefore intervene and raise some of these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In that connection, I should also like to draw attention to the fact that fisheries-based industry and gutting and canning firms must have raw materials, and it is therefore now time for us to review the tariff barriers that prevent the raw materials from reaching our companies in the EU. Price mechanisms and tariff barriers mean that the prices for these raw materials are very much higher than the prices for the same raw materials on the world market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This crisis must not prevent us from taking necessary measures to conserve the white fish and cod stocks in the long term, and item 2 of the resolution is therefore very important. In this, the European Parliament calls upon the Commission and the Council to ensure that changes to the measures taken to conserve cod stocks are made in such a way as not to lead to a further reduction in cod stocks but, rather, to maximise their chances of recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greens have also tabled a new amendment in which we ask the Commission and the Council to take account of the fact that ISIS researchers believe that many cod stocks in EU waters are now down to a critically low level. I do not believe that any of the laboured arguments we have heard in Parliament are of any help. Clearly, it is the fishing effort that matters. New test trawls on Sweden’s west coast also show that cod stocks are at their lowest level for 23 years and that the number of one year-old fish of this species amounts to only a tenth of the number a year ago.</p>
<p class="contents">This is worse than we thought. It is therefore also an unprecedented scandal that the EU is preventing us from calling a halt to cod fishing in these waters, which we would do by means of a moratorium. That this is a disaster is a matter of actual fact. We have our hands tied, which is enormously frustrating. I really want to question the way in which the Commission is acting in this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the end, we too have had our part to play in the fact that cod stocks are now at this catastrophic minimum level of one third, that is 50 000 tonnes. Let us not forget it!</p>
<p class="contents">My main comment, however, is as follows: I have taken over – foolishly, I am almost tempted to add – as the Committee on Fisheries' rapporteur for the 2004 Budget. The basis for this work is of course the current budget for 2003, a prominent feature of which is the reform of the CFP and its requirements. No provision is made in the individual budget lines for disasters, however, which means that we are not prepared for them, either in the Member States or in the European Parliament. Generous interpretation of the rules on flexibility and the reserve, as was still possible in the case of Morocco, is no longer an option. It is primarily the Member States that are having to pick up the bill for the consequences of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster off the coast of Galicia and the 45% reduction in the catch quota for cod. Their policy – the policy of the Member States – is also in need of reform. However we here in Parliament need to help the fishermen today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is still a fact that it is not pity or greed that motivates our actions here in Parliament, but the knowledge of the hardship being suffered by our coastal communities, which in addition have to earn their daily bread under the most difficult of conditions. We all know that in the peripheral areas of our prosperous EU there is usually no alternative work available. We, the EU, are a community based on solidarity and we have to help. But how? At times like this a great deal of good will and assertiveness is needed in this House, particularly in the Committee on Budgets, but also in the Commission and crucially – as I have said – in the Member States.

But this time it is extremely serious. Where I come from in Northern Ireland fishermen have already suffered severe setbacks and quotas and have cooperated in six-week closures during the spawning season, for the last three to four years. That was done in a cooperative way. No doubt they will cooperate again in the future, if such closures happen.</p>
<p class="contents">But what is the future to be? It certainly looks very bleak at present for those fishing communities. That is why I believe that this proposal - which I support - gives hope to the people who live in these remote communities, where no other hope exists for them and no one seems to want to help. By that commitment to those areas we would begin to show that we are giving them a lifeline for some kind of a future and that they have not been forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">As to that future, I have no doubt that the industry must be involved in the decision-making process. This has been one of the weaknesses down the years, for as long as I can remember. The scientists blame the fishermen, the fishermen blame the scientists and we try to find a way through. High-wire negotiations only lead to mistrust. I was in Brussels, along with Mr Stevenson, when the negotiations took place last December. The way they were conducted was no way for us to conduct such important negotiations. I hope you will bear that in mind and make sure it does not happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal for the stakeholders in the industry to be consulted in a meaningful way, not with platitudes. Their views should not be overlooked in any way. We are discussing people's livelihoods, their way of life, indeed their very existence. I call on the Commission and the United Kingdom Government - because in the past they have not shown themselves to be prepared to put up the matching funding - this time to put their money where their mouth is and make sure they give support to these communities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is precisely the reverse. We anticipated the 20% decommissioning – before it had actually happened – and did our calculations as if it had already taken place. On that basis we stipulated 15 days at sea, and so no further cuts are now going to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is news to me that the majority of the fishing fleet in the United Kingdom now consists of vessels that are under ten years old. I do not therefore agree that under this decommissioning exercise – which by the way was not something that we prescribed but was something that the United Kingdom decided to do on its own – vessels are having to be scrapped that are not eligible for decommissioning subsidy.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as I see it we have to draw a distinction. On the one hand, there are measures that need to be taken to rescue cod and the recovery plan has to be based on these. There is no way round this. On the other hand, we have to show sympathy for the social consequences that this is going to have over a particular period, for an interim period. There too we have to show understanding and help the fishermen. If we are only half-hearted in both respects then it will be completely counter-productive. If we only take half measures then we will not be able to bring about stock recovery and this will do huge damage to our fishermen in the long term. Considerably more fishermen will be faced with having to scrap their vessels because they will not be able to fish any more.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, it is of course also fair that we should offer help to alleviate the impact of the measures that we are having to take under the recovery plan.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that the Commission is monitoring the sand eel or industrial fishing issue with very great care. In the past we have asked ISIS to investigate this matter in detail. So far, in any case, we do not have any indication that industrial fishing – if it is carried out lawfully – has an adverse impact on cod stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is only right to set the record straight with regard to Mrs Stihler's comments too. She is quite right to say that Scotland, or the United Kingdom, has made GBP 50 million available – that is pounds not euros – to ensure adequate funding for social measures. This money is however coming entirely from national sources and has been declared as a national subsidy. This means that no Community money is being claimed for this, which also presents a certain advantage to the other Member States because there will be more Community funds left for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again: if you demand more money here then this decision has to be made first and foremost, if not in full, by the budgetary authority. The recovery plan is not a Commission decision either; it is the Council that decides, and the Fisheries Council will also be addressing this matter once again at its next meeting.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even at this stage I should just like to point out though that we are going to have to give this very careful thought because, as you yourself know, the funds available under the fisheries structural fund are very limited. If we are now to create a reserve for emergencies from the outset then obviously that money is not going to be available for the normal programme, which could ultimately mean that we leave money unutilised, because we can hopefully assume that in the future we will no longer have to deal with a series of disasters, but on the contrary that with the help of these recovery plans we will have things under control. We will be addressing this issue in great detail during the course of this year: proposals will also be made to Parliament for additional recovery plans. But as I have said, this is certainly something that it will be worth discussing in more detail and I am happy to do so. Perhaps we might also have an informal debate on this in the Committee on Fisheries, say on the basis of a non-paper of some kind.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
