Since 1985, we have witnessed a significant increase in the number of agricultural holdings and acreage devoted to organic farming.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet there has been a major slowdown in this growth in recent years because of problems relating to the production, processing and distribution of these products.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before us advocates the introduction of additional and enhanced measures with a view to eliminating these obstacles. The main objective is to raise everyone’s awareness, and not just that of an urban minority, of the advantages of organic produce for the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">An improvement in Community legislation, including the common agricultural policy, and an increase in public aid, are essential if we are to make organic farming a more dynamic aspect of sustainable agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the environment should be a priority, this issue should be high on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that I am certain that the high price of organic products is the main obstacle to their consumption, I am convinced that developing support for organic farming will result in a reduction in the price of organic produce and consequently in an increase in the consumption of organic products by the public at large.</p>

Let me take as an example the splitting of pensions entitlements acquired during marriage, so that a woman who wholly or partly gave up work in order to devote herself to her family duties is not left without social security after divorce. We therefore need a framework directive to put a stop to divorce tourism in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I also recall our 1996 report on the status of spouses who help out in small businesses and in agriculture. Ten years ago, we were demanding the lifting of directive 86 on the equal treatment of self-employed men and women and the spouses who help them out. Nothing has happened!</p>
<p class="contents">If I may now turn to the battered wives, let me add that men get beaten up too. Since 2003, Luxembourg has had a law that has already helped a great deal; its law on domestic violence bars violent men from the home, so that, if the man turns violent, it is he who has to leave the shared home, rather than the woman and her children having to flee to a refuge for battered women or to her family. It would be appropriate if the Commission were to recommend to all the Member States that they adopt a law along those lines if they have not already done so. There would then be no need for Beijing + 10! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We talk a lot about gender mainstreaming; I would ask that we also give thought to family mainstreaming when taking policy decisions that affect society. In future, when taking policy decisions, we have to examine the effect they will have on families; state programmes for encouraging women to return to work, in particular, must in future be guided by the principle of family mainstreaming. Work and society must fit the family rather than the other way round. Agricultural statistics, for example, still take insufficient account of the work done by farmers’ wives. On commercial farms, women work for around 63 hours a week. Agricultural statistics first deduct around 50% under the heading of provision for the family. Farmers’ wives do unpaid work at home, on the farm and for the family in exactly the same way as all women work in addition to the time they spend doing a job, but statistics take no account of what they do; it is still not taken seriously by society, and is not recognised as an economic factor. Generally speaking, the services performed by women must be fully taken into account in calculating the gross national product. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our so-called ‘civilised’ countries which pride themselves on their respect for human rights and the rights of citizens, did you know that in France, six women die every month as a result of domestic violence, with almost no public reaction? Did you know that, in 2002, this violence was covered by an amnesty, while there is no amnesty for the mistreatment of animals? Surely women are not considered as being less worthy of protection. Only a few days ago, police violently beat women who were demonstrating peacefully in Istanbul. That has to stop. We need to tackle the factors which, as in the case of women in Islam, contribute directly or indirectly to their subjugation. It is intolerable that, in our countries and throughout the world, archaic and inhumane practices such as excision, honour crimes, stoning and decapitation should be accepted. This day devoted to women must not just be a symbolic event; it must be an opportunity for true awareness of women's rights in France and throughout the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It does not make sense categorically to call for a ban on trading in egg cells and embryos. Women who are unable to have children of their own will always be able to come to agreements with other women who are willing to donate eggs. For many, childlessness is very painful and traumatic. It would be a mistake to criminalise such agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of egg donations entails many complex moral considerations. More clarification than is provided by the current resolution is needed in connection with the issues both of what interventions in reproduction should be permitted and of what the consequences are both for those women who donate eggs and for the childless women who desire help.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why, in spite of everything, we choose to vote in favour of the resolution has to do with the situation that gave rise to it, that is to say the exploitation of poor women in Romania, which is something we view seriously, without having a detailed knowledge of all the facts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Interest in the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is hypocritical, unless it is linked to a demand for immediate specific action to destroy them, starting with the European nuclear powers (France, Britain), and unless a clear request is made for US nuclear weapons to be removed from Europe. From this point of view, with the situation as it stands and taking account of the fact that the United States have reversed their commitment not to use nuclear weapons and strike first, the reference to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons directs people's attention away from the real dangers arising from the imperialist nuclear powers. We support general nuclear disarmament and that is why we shall abstain from the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The danger represented by nuclear arms being acquired by pariah states not committed to international law and by terrorist groups cannot be compared with the acquisition of such arms by states which form part of the fabric of modern international relations, and it would not be reasonable to act as if the two were comparable.</p>
<p class="contents">Against that background, the situation both in North Korea and Iran gives us cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Iran, the hopes we are pinning on the work done as part of the negotiations conducted by the EU should not blind us to the fact that the indications of any real commitment by Iran to the proposals are very slight.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of North Korea, however, there are more than indications, there are clear statements and instances of behaviour on the part of the leaders of that country that should give the international community pause for thought about what actions it may have to take in due course.

<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is against the background of the growing pressures and threats directed by the United States at countries in this region such as Syria and Iran – for which the US sought to secure the support of France and Germany at the recent EU and NATO summits – that attempts are being made to justify dangerous ventures and an escalation of destabilisation of the region, in particular in Lebanon, and to undermine that country’s national unity and the implementation of the Taif Agreement.

<p class="contents">- If we are to increase the level of research, we need an increase in funding. The budget of the Sixth Framework Programme amounts to only 5.4% of total public research spending in Europe, which means that it is not viable to create any kind of European Research Area. Financing for the future programme is essential, but the final amount of the Union’s financial perspective is not yet known. The rapporteur calls for a doubling of the budget, which seems logical.</p>
<p class="contents">- The content of the next Framework Programme needs to be changed in various ways as compared with the present programme, but not quite as proposed in the report. Research must support innovation, but it should not be totally redirected solely towards increasing competitiveness, as is the case with the Commission’s guidelines, following Wim Kok’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">- Greater attention needs to be paid to the working conditions of all those engaged in research. The rapporteur states that the EU needs 700 000 new researchers by 2010 if the target of 3% of GDP investment in research and development is to be reached. This implies adequate investment in human resources in order to produce more researchers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It will only be possible to create the European Research Area by increasing the EU’s financial support for research, in the context of improved coordination between European, national and regional research policies. For this reason, I wholeheartedly approve of the proposal to double the budget for the Seventh Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU needs 700 000 new adequately skilled researchers by 2010 if the target of 3% of GDP investment in technological research and development is to be reached.

Furthermore, to reach this target, two thirds of the investment in research should come from the business sector.</p>

<p class="contents">The objective of making Europe more competitive requires funding for research.

As I said yesterday, just as there is agreement about the Lisbon objectives, there is also general recognition that we urgently need a new, strong and courageous attitude. I would like to add another epithet: creative.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kok report on the Lisbon Strategy stated that it is necessary to increase the attractiveness of Europe for researchers and scientists. In fact there are a great many sources of information and statistics showing that Europe has been suffering from a massive haemorrhage of its best scientists and researchers. It is important to halt that haemorrhage.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to pursue the objective of the European Research Area by means of practical actions, such as greater technology transfer, especially to small and medium-sized enterprises; full and efficient use of the Structural Funds to support research and development at regional level; placing special emphasis on interdisciplinarity in the training chapter; strengthening the role and responsibility of universities in the Europe of knowledge; promoting the mobility of researchers by encouraging and facilitating family unity; achieving the objective of 3% for R&amp;D; funding and disseminating centres of innovation, such as the proposed European Institute of Technology; providing primary and secondary education with technological instruments to encourage research; and promoting information campaigns about success stories. Putting it simply, to ‘stop the laments’.</p>

It is for this reason that I gave my wholehearted support to this ambitious report.</p>
<p class="contents">A country such as Belgium has a duty to follow the example of certain of its European neighbours who have had the courage to invest in scientific research. In this context, Finland is a good role model. With 3.5% of GDP devoted to research, it has already exceeded the EU’s 3% objective for 2010. The results in Finland speak for themselves. The annual number of new PhD students has doubled in ten years and the country has added an extra 26 000 researchers over the same period (+50%).</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to bring about a change in mentality. On average, a young European researcher working in the USA has a research grant 2.5 times higher than in Europe. To stem the brain drain, we need to make Europe more attractive for the top researchers, and also encourage our young people to follow scientific careers.</p>

Healthy ecosystems provide important social and economic resources. The Natura 2000 network, based on sites protected under the Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive, is contributing towards achieving this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">In its proposal for the financial perspective for 2007-2013, the Commission intends that the annual cost of managing the Natura 2000 network, EUR 6.1 billion per year, should be financed from existing funds. Although the objective of reversing the loss of biodiversity is being pursued, no attempt is being made to combat its causes: we need a change in the production model based on profit maximisation, of which one example is the release of GMOs into the environment. Similarly, the necessary financing is not provided for, as this objective has to ‘compete’ with other economic and social objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore consider that the appropriations for rural development, which are intended to compensate farmers’ additional costs, and those for the Structural Funds should be proportionately increased if the costs of managing Natura 2000 are to be found from these funds.

It is farmers, across the length and breadth of Europe, who both ensure that nature is accessible to all and produce healthy food. Our farmers are in no doubt about what is required of them; they farm in accordance with best practice. It is for that reason that there must be certainty about the additional requirements prescribed for FFH areas by the European Union, also being adequately funded by it: ‘he who places the order pays the bill!’ It is not acceptable that the funding of Natura 2000 should be to the detriment of other agricultural and environmental measures or of other rural development programmes. Many issues have yet to be resolved. Precisely what actions are ultimately to be taken in the certified areas is to be decided at regional level in the first instance. It is important that funding for these actions should be in place. Those resources intended only for the management and organisation of the Natura 2000 areas must be kept to a minimum. We have to take care that there is no build-up of additional bureaucracy. Rather than putting money into management, bureaucracy and administration, the projects that are funded must be efficient, must help the environment and achieve tangible results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We voted against it because we think it is bad for the European food industry: half a million European jobs depend on industries that use sugar and they will be facing higher sugar prices than the rest of their competitors throughout the world.

In the debate between agriculture and development cooperation, two aspects were not given sufficient attention.</p>
<p class="contents">The first one was sugar and public health. Diabetes has now become public disease Number One. It is a disease with debilitating symptoms and effects, and is also very expensive socially and economically. In addition, the consumption of sugar is a major factor in obesity, which is also an increasing public health problem. The EU was right to announce that – in cooperation with the WHO – it would fight obesity and diabetes. The consumption of sugar must be reduced, and the decline in the consumption of fruit and vegetables must be reversed, and so it is inconceivable that this House should commit to low sugar prices and that not one cent of subsidy should be available for fruit and vegetables. If we want to grant agricultural subsidies and keep prices down at all, we should do this for healthy products.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect is Lisbon. The EU aspires to be the most dynamic and innovative economy in five years’ time. Everything should be geared towards that goal and sufficient means should also be freed up for this purpose. This House had fine things to say on this very subject only this week. It is difficult to see what contribution the sugar subsidies make to achieving the Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must grant farmers from developing countries full access to the market. I wholeheartedly support amendments to this effect. Needless to say, a sound scheme must be put in place for the European sugar farmers and for the workers in the sugar sector, but the long-term continuation of support for an unhealthy product and a sector that is somewhat resistant to innovation is inconsistent with this. We must stop this absurdity as quickly as possible. That in itself is sufficient reason to vote against the draft resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It was because of these allegations that in July 2004 the Commission brought forward a proposal for reforming the COM for sugar, based on a two-stage price reduction phased over three years of 37% in the guarantee price and 33% in the institutional price; on the abolition of the intervention price, which is currently three times the world market price; and on eliminating public intervention, which will be replaced by a system of private stocks. The intervention price is to be replaced by the reference price. Furthermore, sugar production quotas and subsidised exports are also to be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">The only support envisaged is the introduction of income aid in the form of a decoupled payment to sugar beet producers to partially compensate them – for 60% of the total – for the loss of income resulting from the reduction in prices, together with the introduction of possible transfers of quotas between operators in different Member States.</p>

<p class="contents">In common with the producers’ associations and some European governments, I believe that a measure of this kind will lead to concentration of sugar beet production in just a few Member States. I believe that production should continue to be spread throughout the entire Community, not just for environmental and economic reasons, but also because otherwise there is a risk that thousands of jobs will be lost, jobs that will be hard to replace, thus leading to unavoidable social costs.</p>
<p class="contents">To my mind it is essential for the planned reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar to guarantee price levels ensuring adequate remuneration both for Community producers and for suppliers in developing countries, while avoiding the temptation to disrupt the equilibrium prevailing in the sugar sector. Failing this, I believe that serious damage will be done not just to Community producers, who will suffer from a drastic fall in income, but also to Community consumers, who, as at the time of previous reforms, will not even benefit from a reduction in the price of sugar, which will be entirely lost through market mechanisms.</p>

We need a proper single market in sugar which this resolution does not address. We need to help the least-developed countries by allowing them access to EU markets, but this needs to be discussed fully not determined by an oral resolution.
