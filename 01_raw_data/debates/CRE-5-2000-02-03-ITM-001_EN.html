<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Florenz (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, nine million cars are shredded and scrapped every year in Europe. Even though they can no longer be driven, these nine million cars may still be traded and moved across borders; and not just intra-Community borders, but also those outside the Union. It is therefore only right that the European Union should draw up Community rules on how these nine million vehicles every year are to be recycled and processed.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the directive has a few weaknesses that we in the House should work on to produce a directive which is genuinely ground-breaking. We therefore have a number of amendments. I personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective. I do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive. Nor do I think that motorcycles should be included, as the distinctive culture of recycling within the motorcycle industry obviates the need for a European directive in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not looking for such rigidly high recycling quotas when it comes to special-purpose vehicles either. I want special-purpose vehicles such as ambulances to have high recovery quotas. This is my main concern in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the directive solidly regulates the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in Europe. This can be left as the Commission has proposed with the Member States ensuring the appropriate collection points for draining cars. This will involve, for example, disposing of more than 32 million lots of used oil, removing break fluid, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">An important part of this directive is the issue of what to do with used parts. What should we do with the shredded products? We should not overlook the fact that, although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery, they are by no means the only point. Do not forget that, in the case of cars, 80% of environmental impact comes through driving, 1% through recovery and 19% through construction. Quotas are not, therefore, the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility, just one of many. Of course we need to aim high, but quotas must not become an end in themselves. We must understand that the bigger picture is important when it comes to the environmental impact of cars.</p>
<p class="contents">I am far keener to see us move away from today's car, weighing 1,400 kg and driving an average of 200,000 km, to a future car capable of driving the same distance but weighing just 1,000 kg. This would at least mean 400 kg times 200,000 km less transportation. This would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large reduction in CO2 which, if I have rightly understood the Kyoto Protocol, is the important factor. We therefore consider that, in future, vehicles which clearly and effectively use lightweight construction methods will produce less CO2 and should receive preferential treatment in their combustion quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">It should not be for each Member State, but for you and your staff, Commissioner, to decide whether these lightweight construction vehicles (and there is also talk of 3-litre vehicles) should receive preferential treatment. We think they should.</p>
<p class="contents">May I say something about costs. Some say that all the costs should be borne by the manufacturers; that this is only right and in the very best interests of the consumer. However, this can be seriously questioned as the manufacturers will pass on all the costs to consumers and acquire for themselves a state-sanctioned monopoly on recycling. I can only warn you against consenting to this. There are amendments which propose splitting the costs fifty-fifty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car. The money from this pool, system, or however you want to picture it, would mean that from 2006 all vehicles in circulation could be taken in without cost to the last holder. This too is a particular desire of my group.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal to split the costs has a crucial advantage, namely that we won't be an immediate candidate for the Court of Justice when the directive is adopted. The car industry is concerned about and half expecting repercussions, which is a serious problem which we must address accordingly. This is why I propose splitting the costs between the first holder and the manufacturer.</p>
<p class="contents">As for a ban on certain materials: of course we need one! A car has dangerous components which we must ban long-term. This means that we need a pressure instrument. The Commission has put forward various proposals which are too stringent and we have come up with some alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of sound amendments. This Parliament has been given more authority, so let us use it! Let us have the courage to put together a ground-breaking directive. A directive which we put together just for the sake of it would not be worthy of this House. I ask for your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not consider this directive to be at all satisfactory since it does not answer the real question over what is going to be done with vehicles which have already been abandoned and which, today, can only be removed at local authority expense, i.e. the taxpayers’ expense. The principle of ‘polluter pays’ is not being applied. Vehicles already abandoned have also been abandoned by Community legislation, in that they are not taken into consideration either in the texts on emissions or in this text on end-of-life vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">The only merit of this directive is that it looks to the future. It has not, however, been possible to solve the problem of vehicles currently being used but which are already old and which cost far more to recycle. On the other hand, we can be fairly confident for the future because we know the efforts that car manufacturers are prepared to make in order to find (a) materials that are easier to recycle and (b) to set up recycling industries.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to stress the need to maintain a flexible approach to recycling, reuse and incineration, as far as the new particularly light materials are concerned which make it possible to reduce vehicle consumption and therefore emissions. This is a problem of compatibility between our directives on end-of-life vehicles and the former directives, including the one on auto-oil, which we voted on a few years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore congratulate the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on having the wisdom, in order to make things perfectly clear, to reintroduce the clause making an exception of the vintage cars which are part of our industrial and cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let me say that this directive is not ambitious enough to solve the problems of present car numbers and it is rather hypocritical with regard to the fate reserved for the wrecks which still clutter our forests, lakes and gardens. Once again, the principle of ‘polluter pays’ is not being applied. The taxpayer is still footing the bill. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Neither is correct. We simply must realise that the directive on the table is a sound directive. It means ecological progress for Europe, and we can be proud of ourselves if we succeed in enacting it and setting it in motion.</p>
<p class="contents">All the same, there is one point on which we are in conflict. In the grand scheme of the directive, it is perhaps a minor point, but nevertheless a disputed one. It concerns the issue of recycling costs. Here we find ourselves fundamentally at odds with last year's debate in the Council when freedom from costs for the last owner and the issue of financing were lumped together and a question mark placed over whether the last owner should really be free from costs. Last February in this House we unambiguously decided (and we Social Democrats are sticking to this) that the matter of freedom from costs for the last owner is not open to question!</p>
<p class="contents">So who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of? For us this is straightforward: in the case of new vehicles it should be the manufacturer since this will also compel manufacturers to design and build recyclable cars. And what about vehicles which are already on the road? Let us look at an example. Rover in Great Britain, if they were responsible for all end-of-life cars, would actually be responsible for 5.8 million cars within the European Union and would immediately have to set aside EUR 250 million against recycling costs, whereas a manufacturer from Korea building similar cars would only have to shell out peanuts, as a representative of Deutsche Bank put it. Such distortions in competition are not about environmental protection; they simply affect investment potential and the jobs of those building cars in Europe. Consequently, for end-of-life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end-of-life vehicles in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs.</p>
<p class="contents">I can understand it when colleagues from countries which do not build cars advocate that manufacturers should pay the full whack and that they are not interested in the problem of distortions in competition when it comes to setting aside funds. However, I would ask these colleagues to show solidarity with the more than 2 million people who make a living from building cars in Europe, so that these jobs can be secured in the future. I am in favour of stringent environmental requirements, as you know from the auto-oil programme and the debate on exhaust emissions, but I believe that they should be the same for everyone! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sterckx (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I think we need this directive. Firstly, because it clearly stipulates the environmental objectives. Secondly, because it can promote recycling, which is important. Thirdly, because it sets out a clear procedure to combat pollution caused by heavy metals. This is also an important point. The directive affords a European framework, also to Member States who already have systems in place and who wish to continue to use these. </p>
<p class="contents">So, first of all, we need to keep the recycling percentages at their present level. This will, of course, provide the necessary incentive for technological innovation and for identifying ways of dealing with materials that we do not as yet know how to dispose of. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to retain the details as they are included in the common position. As from 2006, therefore, all vehicles should be handed in at no cost to their last owners. Needless to say, this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way. </p>
<p class="contents">Is this too much of a burden? There is, however, one thing we should not overlook. The directive applies to complete cars, that is to say cars with none of the essential components missing. According to the experts, few of these complete cars are of no value. After all, recycling and the re-use of components form part of a sector which is not necessarily loss-making. Quite the reverse, in fact. At present, there is a whole raft of companies which make a living out of them, and a decent one at that. This directive encourages the whole of this sector. It is a sector which comprises small and medium-sized businesses. Since, in this case, transport costs are high, a system will have to be introduced which will need to be very much decentralised, because transporting an end-of-life vehicle over a distance of more than 100 km is not a profitable activity. </p>
<p class="contents">I think it is a good thing that this directive does not need to apply to historic vehicles, and I think we ought to add this provision to it. I think, therefore, that vintage cars ought to be exempt. </p>
<p class="contents">Also, it is a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer. That is a basic principle which we must uphold. As manufacturers are responsible for the design, they can give a great deal of consideration to the environment at the conception phase. We must also insist that the cost is borne wholly or largely by the manufacturer, as stipulated in the common position. I find this a well-balanced formula which does not preclude a number of other things. I think we need to retain it.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why our group will remain as close to the common position as possible and will not alter its essence. After all, we are all aware how difficult it was within the Council to bring this common position about, and that it was a very difficult balancing act to reach this common position. In my opinion, we should not jeopardise that common position, because it is a directive which we desperately need for environmental reasons. I would ask you to support this common position. Our group will, at any rate, do this as far as possible – for environmental reasons and because we have this directive which is well-balanced and encompasses a whole range of issues and difficulties including, for example, the way in which the costs are to be distributed.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Does this European Parliament support the ecological principle of manufacturer’s liability, that is to say that cars, once they have reached the end of their lives, are the responsibility of the car manufacturer? No, according to the Christian Democrats in Amendment No. 38: car manufacturers and car drivers should split the cost 50/50. It is evident from the packaging directive in which this 50/50 compromise is included that this does not work. Packaging still accounts for a mountain of rubbish in Europe and is a burden upon the environment. Some of the socialists under the direction of Mr Bernd Lange say: yes, we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 according to Amendment No 45. The common position stipulates 2006. According to the group of the Greens, this gives the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparations. I would therefore urge my colleagues not to support Amendment No 38 of the Christian Democrats and Amendment No 45 of some of the socialists. </p>
<p class="contents">If car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their cars, they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re-used more easily and more cheaply. The problem of plastic and PVC will then no longer exist in cars and these products will be replaced by plant-based bioplastic. This is ultimately cheaper, also for the consumer. </p>
<p class="contents">For twenty years, the majority within Parliament has attempted to make European environmental policy greener. Today, this green position is being threatened under pressure from, in particular, the German and French car industries. That is why I urge you to vote against Amendments Nos 38 and 45. We, the Green Group, by and large support the common position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left therefore want as comprehensive and consistent a set of regulations as is humanly possible in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">With this directive, we have the chance to take a big step forward, but this presupposes that the Council’s position is not torn to shreds and weakened in Parliament’s reading of it. If they were adopted, many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive. This applies, above all, to amendments from the Group of the European People’s Party but also, unfortunately, to some of the amendments from Mr Lange, as I see it. </p>
<p class="contents">It is easy to see that the car industry in certain countries, for example in Germany, went in for some pretty tough lobbying before the present directive was adopted. For ourselves, it is crucial that the following principles should apply. </p>
<p class="contents">The polluter should pay. This means that it is the manufacturer which should take full responsibility, financial as well as otherwise, for recycling vehicles. There must be rules governing existing vehicles too. Where this aspect is concerned, we cannot accept any weakening of the Council’s position regarding the date from which the regulations are to come into force. There should be no falling-off in the percentages concerned or in the requirements for recycling vehicles from particular years, and it is important to limit the use of dangerous substances such as lead. We shall vote against any amendments which run counter to these considerations. </p>
<p class="contents">If those amendments were adopted which would considerably weaken the directive, this would be very detrimental, not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament’s credibility on environmental issues. Reference was made earlier on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be given to the millions of people who work in the car industry in various countries and to those countries which have large car industries, for example my own country, Sweden. I was myself a car worker before I was elected. I believe I am one of the few members of this Parliament to have stood beside a production line and assembled cars. I think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry. These would, of course, be to the advantage of modern, progressive car manufacturers who think in environmentally friendly terms. It is precisely this type of car industry which we should be encouraging in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment. Our citizens expect us in this regard to protect their interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Each year, there are between 8 and 9 million vehicles scrapped within the European Union. This in itself generates a large amount of waste. Car manufacturers, the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that in the Netherlands there are authorised treatment centres in place to collect end-of-life vehicles and this process should be extended across the length and breadth of the European Union. From an Irish perspective, I know that the Irish Department of the Environment is already having consultations with motor industry representatives to ensure that appropriate collection centres are put in place in Ireland in the near future to deal with end-of-life vehicles. I see no reason why licensing arrangements cannot be organised across Europe for collection centres to scrap the 8 to 9 million vehicles which are disposed of within the European Union on an annual basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of re-use, recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years. In accordance with new provisions included in the Amsterdam Treaty all the 370 million consumers within the European Union have a right to consumer-related information. I believe EU consumers will support those car manufacturers that incorporate the most environmentally-friendly practices in the coming year.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the European Community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also think that a great effort has been made to arrive at intelligent recycling of materials, a reduction of polluting waste and the promotion of technological innovation. In this regard, we are certainly on the right track, but as some Members have already stressed, the real issue here is the possibility that manufacturers’ responsibility will become a shared responsibility. I would like to say that in Italy, considerable headway has been made in this sector; we are perhaps the first in Europe to have regulations encouraging us to take end-of-life vehicles off the market, but in our country the average age of cars on the road is rather high, and we therefore have serious concerns over the problems that this directive could entail for the market. </p>
<p class="contents">We need to conduct a serious analysis of the matter. In Italy, we have begun to withdraw and recycle around 80% of old cars, but there is a market problem which could trigger a crisis – in terms of unemployment given that in Italy industry often resorts to lay-offs and redundancies – and cause problems for workers in different parts of Italy. We must therefore try to reconcile the two requirements – Parliament is sometimes a little extremist, adopting positions that are either extremely pro-green or extremely anti-green – and, all things considered, find a way to combine the effort made by Mr Florenz and that of other Members, who are trying to reconcile the two positions as best as possible. </p>
<p class="contents">These worthwhile amendments are the outcome of this; I think that we will be able to arrive at a solution to the problem, that is, to reconcile environmental requirements with market and labour requirements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To that extent, it might be thought desirable, even if it is not a matter of urgent necessity.</p>
<p class="contents">The key questions now are who pays the EUR 262 per car for the 9 million cars that are disposed of each year? Who pays for the collection, the dismantling, the disposal and so on? And should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that has ever been made?</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal from the Council, the common position, is that manufacturers should pay the lot. That would mean billions of pounds or euros for each of the major companies in each of the countries of the European Union. That cost would inevitably be passed on to the price and hence to the buyers of new cars. Because European car manufactures have been operating here for many, many more decades than companies from Japan, Korea and elsewhere, that would be a much greater burden on the older European companies and a competitive gift to their competitors from elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend Mr Florenz, Mr Lange and others who have sought from both sides of the party divide a compromise based on shared costs. I also commend to you the amendment standing in my name and colleagues from Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and Britain, to remove the retrospective nature of this measure. Retrospective law is bad law, it is unfair law and often it is unworkable law. Most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest, which clearly there is not in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I have called for a roll-call vote on this. We can see who is prepared to vote for a retrospection which is of doubtful legality, which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the European car industry.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These amendments actually have the advantage – and I should like to stress this – of reconciling environmental constraints and economic imperatives. The Council’s common position was to say that car manufacturers should bear all, or a significant part, of the costs of recovery and recycling. But, as Mr Lange so rightly said, this solution is totally unfair to European car manufacturers.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming from a country which does have a car manufacturing industry, I can tell you that it is not possible, retroactively, to impose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road, i.e. effectively making them bear the costs arising from 80% of the total number of cars in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demands we are making of them today into their manufacturing procedures and their manufacturing costs. The common position puts European car manufacturers in a disadvantageous position in relation to manufacturers which have just come to the European market. Of course, we are not here to defend a particular national interest or a particular industrial lobby. We are here to build a Europe that is competitive on the world market and to safeguard jobs in economic sectors where we are actually competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, I urge you to support the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange. These amendments will be supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists since they effectively reconcile all the interests involved – economic interests and environmental constraints – while granting Member States the freedom to select the means to implement these constraints, since these amendments envisage that the systems in place in the Members States, and some of them work perfectly well, will be able to continue to operate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must, of course, be exempt from the scope of this directive. Cars are also part of our cultural heritage. I think we would all agree on that. Having said that, one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12, i.e. the date on which the directive will come into force. Parliament’s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive’s entry into force, for new vehicles, is not terribly realistic. The European car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be recovered even though they were not designed for recycling. The common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road. This would, furthermore, make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses.</p>
<p class="contents">Like my group, I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which, I feel, offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Will we give our backing to forward-looking environmental and consumer protection or, as the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others cause me to fear, will we allow ourselves to become a servant of the German car industry? The credibility of Parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake. It would be shameful to say the least if the European Parliament were to draw back from the professions the governments of the 14 Member States and the European Commission have been making concerning manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection!</p>
<p class="contents">The intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendments is obvious: to sabotage the directive! The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation. In setting up numerous hurdles their sole aim is to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type approvals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by 12 years or more. This is totally unacceptable. I therefore appeal to the German delegates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today! The red-green federal government has not exactly covered itself with glory in the debate on the End-of-life Vehicles Directive. Do not continue in this vein! The whinging about competitive disadvantages is laughable if it only concerns competitive disadvantages sustained by the German car industry.

It is high time that we reached an agreement. Since I more or less share the views of my colleague, Mr Sjöstedt and the representative of the Greens, Mr de Roo, I am not going to use the two minutes allotted to me, and I will highlight just two issues. Firstly, and this is perhaps the basic point of the proposal, the idea, which goes hand in hand with recycling and the use of waste, that we should use materials which will subsequently cause less pollution. Another point is that waste should not be incinerated or crushed, not only in the case of lead, cadmium and mercury, but also in the case of waste which contains PVC. Parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context.</p>
<p class="contents">The other question is who should bear the cost. I agree with previous speakers who have said that the polluter should pay, and this proposal expresses that idea very well. Producers must pay – although we all know that the consumer will ultimately suffer the consequences of this – and they must take responsibility for the costs before 2006, as some of the amendments propose. We are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to set percentages and a date for vehicles to be composed of recyclable materials. I believe that this proposal relies on very long deadlines.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I believe we should favour the creation of small and medium-sized businesses which, if subject to rigorous approval and duly authorised, can promote the creation of jobs in this very important area, preventing the emergence of monopolies by large companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to work out what we are going to do with the millions of vehicles we abandon each year. In some of our Member States, voluntary environmental agreements have already been signed to ensure that our ditches, canals and fields are not filled with these ugly and dangerous wrecks, inhabited occasionally by an alarmed farmyard chicken.</p>
<p class="contents">I come, of course, from a country that is proud of its car industry and of its commercial success both in Europe and in third countries. I can gauge its importance for my country’s international reputation. I know of the proactive attitude of the European car manufacturing industry which has set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismantling end-of-life vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of the difficulties the Council experienced in finding a compromise. That is why, today, we must be understanding alchemists, concerned for our environment. This will either be the century of waste management or it will not. As far as I am concerned, at least, the principle of ‘polluter pays’ must be applied. The car industry, increasingly more respectful of the environment, has, I am sure, anticipated this kind of increasing awareness. Indeed it is accepting its responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the Member States, however, who will have to implement this directive, and let us beware of going into too much detail because the industrial traditions, the demolition and crushing sectors vary according to whether you are in Italy or in Finland. I am opposed to making the car owners liable. The men and women on the move throughout Europe pay for their car and their catalytic converter, pay their national taxes and the tax on fuel and are therefore already paying a high price for their magnificent machine and their freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">It would certainly be unwise for my fellow Members in the major groups of the federalist tendency to seek to make the European Parliament unpopular in this way by creating a liability shared between the owner and the manufacturer. How, furthermore, can a fund be created which will pay for vehicle recycling and manage operations within Europe. Who is to pay for recycling the car I bought in France if I register it in Belgium? Which national fund will pay for my end-of-life vehicle? Let us beware, too, of worrying the world of business with the legal uncertainty of an unacceptable retroactive application. It is not our intention to start a punitive legislative campaign here today, but to continue on our present course, advocating sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, a sound common position submitted by the Council is in danger of being changed for the worse from an environmental point of view here in Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">Every year, we discard a huge amount of cars which contain many dangerous substances. This is why it is important to prevent waste materials. We should also aim for minimum quantities of heavy metals, as well as of other dangerous substances and materials. In addition, car manufacturers need to produce and build these cars in such a way as to facilitate simple dismantling and re-use. What is left of the stripped vehicle also requires to be processed adequately. I therefore welcome with open arms the percentage levels for re-use and recycling which have been proposed by the Council. These days, the complete dismantling of end-of-life vehicles is economically viable. This means that we move away from shredding. The prescribed objectives are most certainly viable and, in the Netherlands, a value of 86% recycling has now already been achieved. </p>
<p class="contents">The best way of achieving proper collection is to ensure that the last holder and/or owner can deliver the car to an authorised treatment facility without any cost. The processing cost can then be incorporated in the price of new cars. The proposals made by a few MEPs impact greatly on this system. The so-called shared liability is very cumbersome and does not stimulate innovation. If the system of delivering cars to treatment facilities without any cost is applied, it will also transpire that the cost of processing will come down considerably. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity. A laborious conciliation procedure would entail an unnecessary delay, at the expense of the environment. Why cannot we just be satisfied with the common position currently tabled? If we are, then all that remains for us to do is to congratulate the Council on the result achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has delivered excellent work under pressure both from his colleagues and from the car industry. Add to this the fact that he had to do this from his green approach and, against that background, find a compromise. That was not easy.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, I am not dissatisfied with the present common position and certainly not with the philosophy underlying that common position. I would like to comment on two things. Firstly, vintage cars and motorbikes. These should indeed be excluded from the directive. Secondly, the controversial question as to who bears the responsibility for taking back cars. </p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to alter the text of the common position in any way. The manufacturer is and should be liable and the last holder and/or owner must be able to hand back the car without any cost. In my opinion, there is too much initial hesitation. The car lobby has led too many people up the garden path. I would also like to mention that experience has nonetheless taught us that the processing cost is in fact passed on. These costs are not very high. In the Member State where I come from, you are talking about 150 Guilders per car. If you charge this from day one, you can process the old cars straight away. </p>
<p class="contents">A very large industry might then emerge which would ensure that scrapyards, which used to be a common feature in our Member States, would then disappear. I do not wish to make any changes to this particular aspect of the compromise. I think it would be a good thing if we were to approve the present legislation together as soon as possible. This is positive because, in that way, the nine million cars which are introduced each year onto European roads will actually be processed appropriately, and this will benefit us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore think it is crucial for the environment that the ban on using poisonous heavy metals should be fully implemented and that we should not reduce manufacturers’ liability. If we do reduce it, we remove from manufacturers the incentive to design and produce cars which give rise to less waste. The common position, which was arrived at with great difficulty in the Council, which the Commission has endorsed and which was also maintained in Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, complies fully with the environmental requirements. I therefore find it incomprehensible and very curious to see amendments from members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the objectives of which are to weaken the environmental requirements and significantly reduce car manufacturers’ liability. If these amendments are adopted, I think that we shall cause Parliament seriously to lose credibility on environmental issues. So far, we here in Parliament have been positive catalysts for environmental protection but now, if the amendments proposed by Mr Florenz and Mr Lange are adopted, we are to become a negative factor for the environment in Europe. What is more, if we reduce manufacturers’ liability on this issue, this will also have serious consequences for subsequent matters in other areas, for example the forthcoming directive on scrap from computers and other electronic equipment. I would therefore recommend to Members of Parliament that we cut across party lines and vote against all the amendments to the common position which would weaken environmental standards and reduce manufacturers’ liability. We shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has become eminently political. Yesterday we honoured our institution with a political debate. Today, if 314 Members of Parliament yield to the strength of the lobbying of some car manufacturers, we should be doing ourselves dishonour.</p>
<p class="contents">In expecting consumers to bear half the cost of the recovery of end-of-life vehicles, as Amendment No 38 stipulates, even though the common position states that all recovery costs should be borne by the manufacturer, Parliament would, for the first time, not be acting as the defender of the rights of the consumers and citizens of Europe, it would be turning into mere sounding box for different lobbies.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept this. It would be a precedent which would open the door to all sorts of pressure in many other areas. It would also be the first time that the European Parliament would be weakening a Council position, whereas usually we are complaining that their position is not strong enough. The free recovery system, for example, for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly. Thus, for the consumer, for the environment and for the new jobs to be created in recycling, the Council’s common position definitely must not be amended. It is, as it stands, perfectly acceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a useful measure and it is one which we all need. Most of the technical issues have been resolved. There are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">We have arrived at the final question. In the first reading debate it was only the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who posed that question in Parliament. That is quite simply: Who pays?</p>
<p class="contents">The Council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost, not all of it as Mr Bowis has mistakenly said. In fact perhaps as little, the lawyers tell us, as 20% or one-fifth of the cost. That is not unreasonable. If you look at the UK consumer for example, who buys a Rover, as Mr Lange has indicated or for that matter any other make of car in the UK and who has for years been paying excessive prices for those cars, over and above comparable prices in other parts of Europe, why should they pay? They have paid already.</p>
<p class="contents">Why should the very same people as taxpayers or as future car buyers, pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer has made the profit from? I cannot accept that. There are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case. I cannot accept it and I will not vote for it. The responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer. It is the manufacturer who has to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government. The common position is a reasonable compromise. Some of the amendments today are totally unreasonable in that they take away completely the responsibility from the car manufacturer of paying a little if any of the cost of disposal of cars on the road.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of Europe I am voting against those amendments.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is disgraceful the way in which the German Presidency handled this matter. Firstly, Herr Trittin, the Environment Minister, was not in tune with his colleagues in the Cabinet, then Chancellor Schröder blundered in like a bull in a china shop, having no expert knowledge of this process. Mind you, even the Resolution of the Finnish Council Presidency in June was not the best result that could have been done achieved. There are certain weaknesses, the greatest of which, in my opinion, is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small businesses; after all, the car industry is more than just large companies. It is in the area of supply that small business plays an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interests of those employed in small and medium-sized enterprises. For there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector. </p>
<p class="contents">The plight of small businesses is also addressed by numerous amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and also the amendments in question from our group to Article 5 concerning costs. The common position is also no great shakes from an environmental viewpoint. It fails to take in the bigger picture and when my fellow delegate from the Greens says that this is the first time that the European Parliament has toned down a common position, I really must object, because quite simply, it is not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern, low-consumption cars such as the 3-litre car, which contain a great deal of plastic, by means of rigid, high recycling quotas! Consequently, we must support an amendment which at least permits exceptions in the case of particularly economical cars. The objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation. However, the arguments of the plastics and car industries would be more persuasive if a commitment were to be given to reducing CO2 levels in Europe in other sectors besides these. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first concerns the manufacturer’s unrestricted liability to take back end-of-life vehicles. There is the risk of creating a monopoly within the car dismantling trade. This particularly applies in areas within the EU where distances are great and where a lot of small companies are involved in dismantling vehicles. I believe that, quite apart from the nature of the issue concerned, the EU’s directives should not treat small companies within the Union unfairly. Unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers would also be in danger of creating a situation in which the market for used car parts disappears, for manufacturers would have a greater responsibility to sell new parts. Yet the trade in used car parts is important, especially for those who collect and renovate older vehicles. The principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also dubious in terms of the principles governing the market economy. It should be possible for changes to be made to companies and for the latter to be sold and wound up. They should be able to establish themselves in new markets, but also to leave old markets. To bind manufacturers by means of a liability which can extend very far back in time ill accords with a flexible market economy designed to promote development. </p>
<p class="contents">The second principle in the Council’s common position is the retroactive element in the draft directive. It conflicts with established economic and legal principles retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product. To do so also changes the owner’s liability retroactively. Over the years, a consumer may have altered the product in a number of ways. </p>
<p class="contents">Every country within the EU now has rules governing the scrapping of cars. Some may be better than others, and some worse. In anticipation of this EU directive’s being implemented, EU countries ought however to be individually liable for scrapping vehicles in the best way possible so that the retroactive element in the EU legislation is not applied. This does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The production line was invented about a hundred years ago, I believe, by Henry Ford and what we are proposing to do here is to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse – to dismantle vehicles, to take the pieces apart and seek to recycle them. One thing we should stop and think about is the fact that there is a very uncertain market for recycled plastic bumpers of cars. The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so.</p>
<p class="contents">There is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars, recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non-metallic parts. This is a very environmentally reasonable approach. It is just as good environmentally to burn old plastic as to burn new oil for energy recovery. This method of disposal of cars carries no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pays because the “dead” car would actually have a small value going into the recycling and reclamation process.</p>
<p class="contents">I would oppose this directive on the basis that it is too prescriptive, it ignores what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it sets in stone methods which are not necessarily the best environmentally, and are certainly very damaging economically.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Social-Democratic Group has submitted a few important proposals for improvement over the past couple of days. I would especially draw your attention to Amendment No 45, in which a choice is made in favour of laying the cost of disassembly and recycling at the door of the manufacturer, for new cars at any rate. Consequently, consideration will also be given to recycling during the conception phase and production. </p>
<p class="contents">For the cars currently on the road, it would be reasonable to share the cost, for example by setting up a fund such as that in the Netherlands. The common position stipulates that manufacturers should not only bear the cost, they should also take back end-of-life vehicles. This is a big problem in my opinion. I urge that car manufacturers should most definitely not be given the task of organising the dismantling and recycling of vehicles, as they would gain an excessive hold over the second-hand components market. They would then determine their own prices. Anyone who has been in an old car knows that this is to the detriment of the consumer and the amateur mechanic. The European consumer organisation, which has asked us to support the common position on this point, is to my mind letting the consumer down. </p>
<p class="contents">A second argument for keeping the dismantling of cars out of the manufacturers’ clutches is the cost of transport. If car manufacturers all set up their own dismantling companies, this will necessitate transporting end-of-life vehicles over long distances. This is environmentally unfriendly but also expensive and does not benefit the consumer either. I would therefore appreciate your support for Amendment No 45. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If you travel to the Netherlands, you will find that every last owner can get rid of his car cost-free. You will also find that these cars are suitably disposed of, that new material flows have been opened up in order to recycle materials, that 85% of the weight of a car is recycled and that 92% of all cars in the Netherlands are recycled. This is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes. Should this be condemned ecologically, Frau Breyer? I do not think so. The Netherlands has an exemplary model for disposing of cars as per the wishes of the directive and the issue of whether the buyer of a new car should pay or, in the case of end-of-life vehicles currently driving around, the manufacturer, has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with ecology; it is a simple question of competition!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The issue here is whether a European manufacturer should pay EUR 250 million or a Korean manufacturer, say, EUR 2 million. In terms of the people who build cars here in Europe, I am in favour of not making competition unequal but, in terms of environmental protection, I want freedom from costs for the last owner, to be financed by a special fund, and manufacturer responsibility for new cars, which will force them to assume responsibility for building recyclable cars!</p>

<p class="contents">The main thread of the discussion is about whether or not the manufacturer, the vendor, or whoever, should take the end-of-life vehicle back without any cost. I will only give the example of my own country to illustrate how this system functions there without any problems. We have reached an agreement with all the parties involved. These include car manufacturers, second-hand car dealers, the federation of the car industry, the metal processing firms, shredding firms and the government. </p>
<p class="contents">An environmental policy agreement has been signed on a voluntary basis. The car industry – and Belgium produces a great many cars– did not have any problem with that. Belgians can deliver their cars back to the vendor without any cost. In connection with this, we have noticed how – quite contrary to what has been said here to the effect that the scheme would be to the detriment of employment – a number of small businesses have taken the recycling of materials to heart and are doing very well. Some businesses have become hi-tech businesses, because they managed to recycle certain materials, even materials which are not yet included in the directive. So this means that we are developing a new sector and new employment and doing the environment a huge favour into the bargain. I am in favour of collection free of charge. It worked for us. Why would it not work elsewhere? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for an interesting debate in which many important arguments have been presented. Would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minutes. Allow me briefly to comment on some of the assumptions and principles behind the present directive. Allow me also to begin by commenting on and responding to a couple of the most important arguments in this debate. </p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I think I should repeat some of the basic facts which Mr Florenz and others have already mentioned. What we are discussing here is the fact that close on ten million cars are scrapped every year in the European Union, resulting in approximately as many millions of tons of waste. This means that almost ten million tons of waste are created by these cars, and approximately seven per cent of the latter are abandoned out in the open. Moreover, they constitute environmentally hazardous substances of the worst kind. Approximately ten per cent of lead production is to be found in cars, but also cadmium, chromium, mercury and other very dangerous substances. This is something you already know, but I would nonetheless also repeat it for the benefit of those who are listening. Cars are one of the fastest growing sources of waste we have in Europe. We know that waste from cars exists and we know how we ought to be dealing with it, and there is no excuse for not taking action. </p>
<p class="contents">The present directive has three aims. First of all, we want to stop heavy metals from being used in the manufacture of new cars. Secondly, we want to establish the fact that the manufacturer is liable. We can no longer take care of these matters at the end of a product’s life-cycle. Instead, we should avoid creating so much waste. We should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various contents of a product. Thirdly, we wish to achieve the recycling objectives specified in the present directive. These are the three most important aims of the directive. This is, of course, because it is a waste of resources for us not to ensure that materials in cars are recycled. It is, above all, the manufacturer’s resources we are wasting if we do not get to grips with a car’s life-cycle. </p>
<p class="contents">Two important questions have arisen in this regard. Yes, there are in fact more than two questions, but I want to mention just two of the most important. First of all: who should pay? And secondly: are we reducing the European car industry’s competitiveness by means of the present proposal? </p>
<p class="contents">The first question, then, is about who should pay. The directive states that the polluter should pay and that the cost is to be borne mainly by the manufacturer in accordance with the principles to be found in the EU’s treaty concerning the manufacturer’s liability. It is nonetheless clear that the cost will be borne jointly by manufacturers and consumers. We have calculated that the cost of recycling cars does not constitute more than one per cent of the price of a new car. Do we imagine, then, that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive? No. Clearly, we shall all have to bear the cost of serious damage to the environment, but it will be very much greater. Moreover, the cost will have to be borne in the future. The cost will not therefore disappear, but now we are clarifying whose liability it is and how the cost is to be distributed. Are we therefore talking about a car industry in crisis? Is it an unprofitable industry which we are discussing and which we really have to help by not imposing more taxes upon it? Is it the case that the car industry definitely cannot afford these? Is it the case that the motives behind the proposed measures are in actual fact concerned with reducing the competitiveness of the European car industry? No, of course not. It is quite the opposite. Do you believe that consumer demand for environmentally friendly cars and more fuel-efficient cars is going to decline in the future? What kind of requirements do you think our children and grandchildren and future legislators are going to make of cars? Naturally, that they should be environmentally friendly, that they should be recyclable, that they should be fuel-efficient and that they should not pollute our environment. It is, of course, only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry. </p>
<p class="contents">We must create forms of motive power which are not damaging to health and which are of such a kind that we can deal with the relevant waste, recycle materials and compete by means of environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient cars. The fact that we have a European car industry which has already made great strides more than properly compensates for the fact that there are, in fact, a good many cars on European roads for which they must take responsibility. The cost is not insurmountable; nor is the task an impossible one. If we develop motive power of the kind I have described, I am quite certain that market forces and commercial interests in the car industry will ensure that mechanisms develop for dealing with both the cost and the workload. These will consist of everything from insurance to sensible and effective scrapping and recycling systems. The industry itself will ensure that these systems are introduced in Europe. They will not represent an insurmountable cost for the European car industry. They will instead help industry to be in the vanguard of eventually producing environmentally friendly and more fuel-efficient cars. We must do this for the sake of the environment. The costs will not disappear. Nor will the waste disappear. But, otherwise, we must all of us, as taxpayers or citizens, foot the bill. What is more, the costs will be higher the longer we wait before taking action. </p>
<p class="contents">That is what I should like to say by way of introduction. I also want to comment on the question as to whether there is to be any retroactive legislation. If we assume that, on average, a car has a life of eleven years, do Members, indeed does anyone, believe that we should wait for eleven years before we get to grips with this problem? Do you think that, when we legislate about chemicals, we should say that we are ignoring those chemicals which are already on the market and that we are legislating only for what is to be produced in the future? Clearly, we must consider the problem which exists here and now and the challenge presented by the existing range of cars. It is still not an insurmountable problem. We can deal with it. We already have an infrastructure. We have what we require in order to deal with end-of-life cars. </p>
<p class="contents">I naturally hope that the result of today’s vote will be a good one. If I have not already done so, I would also thank Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz for the hard work he has put into this proposal on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. In fact, it is in many respects pioneering work when it comes to re-use and manufacturer’s liability. I believe it will have very positive and noticeable effects on the environment. We cannot continue to close our eyes to these matters. As I have said, we have both the knowledge and the resources to cope with these issues. </p>
<p class="contents">After the first reading in the European Parliament in 1999, the Commission’s proposal ended up in an awkward political situation in the Council. However, we obtained a well-balanced common position in July during the Finnish Presidency. Now, we must ensure that the present legislative process is concluded successfully. </p>
<p class="contents">A total of 48 amendments have been tabled. The Commission can adopt 10 amendments in their entirety. Three amendments can be partially approved, and one can be approved in principle. Certain amendments concern improvements to the Commission’s proposal which we adopted as early as at the first reading or else they reintroduce into the directive such parts of the original proposal as the Council has removed. This applies to Amendment No 5, excluding section 1; 8 and 9, section 1; 10 and 12, section 3; 15, 16, 20, 22, 24 and 25. These amendments can all be approved. Amendments Nos 6 and 21 are new; the Commission can approve these. The Commission can also approve Amendment No 26 with certain editorial changes. I want to emphasise that a number of the other amendments affecting the proposal’s basic components involve a considerable watering-down of the level of environmental protection aimed at by the common position. They cannot therefore be approved. </p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has traditionally made a major contribution to strengthening environmental legislation in Europe. It would amaze and depress me if it were not to do so today. I am very concerned about certain amendments from Parliament which bring the absolutely basic pillars of the present proposal into question. These concern, for example, the phasing-out of heavy metals, manufacturer’s liability and the requirement for recycling. I want to deal with these amendments on a group-by-group basis. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 4, 11, 12, 13, 28, 30, 32, 37, 42 and 48 concern the phasing-out of heavy metals. Amendment No 12 involves a delay of at least ten years in bringing the provision into force. Amendments Nos 13, 28, 32, 37, 42 and 48 involve introducing unnecessary conditions and exceptions. This would mean that the process of replacing dangerous substances would be implemented more slowly. Amendments Nos 4, 11 and 30 mean that heavy metals have to be separated from the waste before recycling. The Commission considers that the type of phasing-out proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 34, 36, 38, 44 and 45 relate to the manufacturer’s liability. The compromise reached by the Council is fair but fragile. The Commission does not consider that the amendments would improve the balance without, at the same time, creating tensions. </p>
<p class="contents">I regret the confusion which arose recently due to internal documents from the Commission being wrongly used, so creating uncertainty about the Commission’s attitude to the issue. I want to emphasise that, as early as 1997, the Commission proposed a special clause concerning manufacturer’s liability and that the Commission entirely supports the common position. This does not impose disproportionate costs upon manufacturers. Far from it. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 39, 40, 46 and 47 concern quantified objectives. The high level of protection aimed at by the common position would be very much undermined if the recycling objective for the year 2006 were removed. These amendments would also make the objectives awkward to deal with and difficult to supervise. </p>
<p class="contents">Allow me also – listen carefully to what I am saying now, because I have heard this reiterated in the debate – allow me to comment on the issue of vintage and “cherished” cars as mentioned in Amendments Nos 3, 7, and 9, section 2, and 35. Such vehicles are not covered by the definition of waste and are not therefore included under the directive. So, whatever has been stated in this regard, vintage cars and motorcycles are not included under the directive. </p>
<p class="contents">We do not consider that Amendments Nos 2 and 14 add anything to the directive. Amendment No 23 involves the Commission’s having to adopt quality standards for reusable components. This is not covered by the directive. An ad hoc directive should therefore be demanded from the European Parliament and the Council. Amendments Nos 29, 31 and 41 water down the requirements concerning the dismantling of vehicles. There is a danger of Amendments Nos 31 and 41 reducing the chances of recycling plastic, tyres and glass. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission cannot approve Amendments Nos 1 and 33 for reasons to do with legal clarity; nor Amendment No 19, which the Commission considers to be unnecessary at this stage. Furthermore, Amendment No 43 does not fall within the directive’s area of applicability.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
