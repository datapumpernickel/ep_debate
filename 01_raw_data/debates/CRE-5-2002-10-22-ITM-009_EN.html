The task in hand is clear indeed. We were asked, especially in view of the experiences of 1999, to find another, less ambiguous way whereby the Commission, and not only the Commission, was in future to be granted discharge. What was at stake was that there should be the minimum of room for manoeuvre where people are simply stalling, that proposals for decisions that are very clearly set out should also result in appropriate results, and that no areas of uncertainty should remain.</p>
<p class="contents">If one is dealing with Parliament, one learns that this place attaches primary importance to compromises, and it is compromises that we have worked towards very intensively. For that, I would like to thank not only the officials of this House, who, with great commitment, kept on coming up with new formulations and proposals, and not only my own colleagues either, who had a part in this process, which – as we don't work as quickly as Elmar Brok – has in the meantime lasted nearly a year, but also the Members of this House belonging to other groups, who have made the effort to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Compromise means that there is give and take, and that is a small chance to take part in a process, if you are seated up there in the gallery or, through some other fortuity, find yourself listening to what is being said. I hear that amendments handed in by the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control at the very last minute, which go against this great ideal of compromise, are now to be promptly withdrawn. If they ask how it is that a rapporteur does not know that, it has to do with another of the realities of life in this House, that is, the fact that such last-minute agreements are often reached outside the plenary and are often not completely transparent. But we will shortly hear whether we have pulled it off.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another thing, though – I am looking around to find Mr Bourlanges, with whom I did most of the negotiations – and that is something I can do.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interjection by Mr Bourlanges)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps Mr Bourlanges will hear it as well. There is another thing; that is, that I have to offer and would like to say that I withdraw the request for a split vote that we made on one point, itself very close to the heart of Mr Bourlanges and of the PPE Group that he represents, in other words that there will be no split vote on the matter that is so dear to them. It goes without saying that this is being done in the hope that we can achieve the precise result that we need, which is broad agreement to this report. It is the case that, without 314 votes, we will achieve no durable compromise, and we will make no progress without effort. My concern is not only that unambiguous rules should be created for the Commission, but also – something in Article 93a to which I would gladly return – with working out how this Parliament should at last flex its muscles a bit more at the Council in its executive capacity, and that we should make this our concern. I believe that to be this report's second pillar, if that is indeed the term to be used. It is, in this sense, my very great hope that we will now, on the one hand, hear about compromises struck outside the plenary, and, on the other hand – as Mr Bourlanges is also on the list of speakers – that we will hear him say that he agrees to it, and that we may thus bring the whole business to a satisfactory conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to say that we made a good team. It is a topic that was extremely complex and difficult to comprehend, but I am pleased that a report is now before us, which we can broadly endorse.</p>
<p class="contents">The discharge of the Commission and of other bodies since the fall of the Santer Commission has become a special event in European political life. Compared to the years preceding that fall, it is now one of the highlights of the political year. According to the Treaty, it almost seems as if it is a purely administrative procedure, but the Commission, along with every MEP, knows better. It is currently a political event. If no discharge is given at the end of the year, this sends a clear political signal to the Commission, and a debate in this Parliament on the Commission’s political and other functions strikes me as absolutely inevitable.</p>
<p class="contents">What rules should, in general, apply to a discharge? The procedure should not be too complicated. Each member should be able to understand it. Secondly, in the event of a vote, every member must be able to understand the consequences of this vote. Thirdly, in the year n+2, in other words, two years following the implementation of the budget, a clear political judgment should be given about the functioning of the Commission. The advice given by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs meets these criteria, in my opinion. I welcome the results and we will be voting in favour of them. I also think that the proposed timeframe, namely to grant discharge or postponement in April and to pronounce a final verdict in October, is the correct one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The discharge procedure is of course of very great importance to the Commission, and it is enshrined in the Treaty itself. Now it has a place, and is couched in even clearer terms, in the financial regulation, so that there are two existing legal bases, which of course have to be taken together in reaching decisions. I must therefore raise the question of whether all the amendments that have been submitted are in accordance with these legal bases.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last two years, Parliament has negotiated with the Council and the Court of Auditors and done very in-depth work on the recast financial regulation. A good and clear result has finally been achieved. Article 146 (1) states: 'The European Parliament, acting on a recommendation from the Council, which shall act by a qualified majority, shall give a discharge to the Commission before 30 April of the year n+2 in respect of the implementation of the budget of the financial year n. Where the time period provided for in paragraph 1 cannot be adhered to, the European Parliament or the Council shall notify the Commission of the reasons for the suspension of the discharge resolution. Where the European Parliament defers the grant of the discharge resolution, the Commission shall act as soon as possible to remove the causes of impediment.' End of quotation from Article 146.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the legislative authority had a clear aim in choosing this formulation. Where, exceptionally, the discharge resolution is deferred, the Commission is to respond very quickly in order to remove the causes of the impediment. Now these proposals refer to October, all of six months later. That is, of course, not exactly a quick response within the meaning of Article 146. This deferment procedure also involves three other difficulties. The first is that the Commission has to take care that Parliament keeps the reasons for the suspension of the discharge resolution realistic and within the bounds of feasibility. The second is that, if it is envisaged that action will be taken, six months is again a relatively short period. If the Commission is meant to come up with responses and commitments, it can – and should – do so more quickly. Thirdly, if these conditions are to be seen as a normal option in the Rules of Procedure themselves, there is of course the risk of suspension being regarded as a regular course of action.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that Parliament already, of course, has instruments available, by which it can impose further tasks and actions on the Commission, and, indeed, it has done so in recent years. The resolution on the discharge procedure was combined with quite unambiguous demands, concerning which the Commission is drawing up a follow-up report – not as a matter of choice, but because it is obliged to – and has to set out in clear terms what measures it has submitted in accordance with the motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday evening, amendments were tabled on what I would like to call the ‘October option’ question, and these now raise further issues. The Commission would therefore welcome it if these could be further clarified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bourlanges (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the discharge procedure is something that is particularly important. It is one of the European Parliament’s major powers and this was evident during the most serious dispute between Parliament and the Commission, which occurred on the occasion of a vote on discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, Parliament’s objective over the last 15 years has been, first and foremost, to ensure that the scrutiny performed under the discharge procedure is a political scrutiny in the fullest sense of the word, in other words a power of scrutiny which is an expression of the taxpayers’ desire to ensure that public money is not wasted, and which is not just a technical formality.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we felt that it was not just the Commission but all the bodies that have their own budget which, by extension, should be subject to the scrutiny of the discharge procedure by Parliament’s granting of discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we felt that since the Treaty bestowed upon us the power to grant discharge, we should also have the power to refuse to grant it. So, under the authority of the Committee on Budgetary Control and its chairman, Mrs Theato – whom I would like to congratulate –a genuine power of Parliament has progressively built up, and Parliament, through discharge, is, therefore, well and truly expressing the concerns of taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, extending the discharge procedure poses a number of problems. The first of these problems is the danger that this procedure will go on forever without achieving results. The report before you by Mr Hans-Peter Martin lays down, for all the provisions, relatively short and relatively reasonable deadlines. In this respect, I shall say to the Commission ‘Commissioner, you cannot ask us to grant discharge within a short deadline as well as telling us that, for your part, you need time to take the decisions necessary for you to comply with Parliament’s procedures. You must choose: either you want extra time, and we grant you discharge later, or you want discharge quickly and you make haste yourself’.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem that we have had is a problem relating to coherence between the three votes, namely the vote on discharge, the vote on the approval of accounts and the vote on the resolution. There are three different votes for a single decision, which may lead to inconsistencies between the three. The report before you, which we firmly support in the PPE-DE Group, resolves the problem by combining the discharge procedure and the procedure for approval of accounts and by giving the President the possibility of avoiding putting a resolution to the vote which would contradict the provisions relating to the vote on discharge by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The third problem, which was the most serious and which we have encountered on several occasions, was the problem of majority. As soon as we had the possibility of granting, postponing or refusing to grant discharge, we were faced with two risks. The first was that no vote might be accepted, with a majority of both the Commission and then Parliament voting against all three of these options. We were at an impasse. The second risk was related to the equality of votes, both in committee and in Parliament, whereas the Treaty obliges us to take a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before you does not resolve this problem in an entirely satisfactory manner, although, in my view, it does resolve it in the best possible way. The report essentially proposes to divide the procedure into two phases: during the first phase, we shall choose between granting and postponement, at the proposal of the Committee on Budgetary Control; during the second phase, if discharge has not been granted once the postponement has expired, we shall choose whether to refuse or grant discharge. If one option were rejected, the opposite option would then be adopted and we would therefore avoid the danger of an impasse that we have constantly flirted with, in the Committee on Budgetary Control. This is a very good system and we give our very strong support to the compromise that the main groups have reached. In this respect, I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur for his comments regarding the withdrawal of his request for a separate vote. A compromise is an achievement, we shall stand by this and we thank you for standing by this too. Mr Martin, I wish you good luck. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morgan (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, as we are political anoraks in the Committee on Budgetary Control and there are a lot more people listening to us tonight, I will try and explain to them what is going on because budgetary control and discharge are really not terms that normal people understand.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the primary tasks of the European Parliament is to assess the way the Commission is functioning. We are here to make sure that the Commission carries out its work properly. Therefore when people say that the Commission is unelected, we can tell them that we keep the Commission under control and hold them to account. One of our formal responsibilities is to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget. We have to be able to account to the people who elect us and explain to them how their money is spent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgetary Control is the principal committee responsible for leading this task on behalf of the European Parliament: we scrutinise budget lines, follow up potential scandals, we see how the money is being misspent and we try and find out why processes are so complex and cumbersome.</p>
<p class="contents">It was the discharge procedure that ultimately led to the forced resignation of the Commission back in 1999. That is what started the whole process.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is a danger – we must not be naive about what is going on – that the whole process could be hijacked for more sinister and for more political motives. It has become almost established practice within the Committee on Budgetary Control to postpone the discharge and to ask for more information. That means that there are now three options. In the past there were two options: we could give or refuse discharge. Now, as Mr Bourlanges has explained, we can give, refuse or postpone discharge. It is much easier if we have only two options and that is what is being put to us today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner has a point when she says that the Commission could probably comply more quickly. I do not see this October part-session as the date by which we have to have the answer. That is the latest point at which Parliament gives its decision. We do not have to stick to October, but we have to do it by October. That is a slightly different interpretation. It is clear that we all want to complete it before the summer. It is also right that the Commission should have this additional breathing space, because if Members refuse discharge and want to criticise the Commission, then it needs time to try to put things right. The new process will also ensure that the process does not go on and on. That is what has happened in the past. It is what happened in the 1996 discharge – it just carried on. We are giving you an end date, we are telling Parliament that by this time it has to decide one way or the other. That is why this system is much better. The situation is clearer and the process will not be hijacked for political aims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament must acquaint itself with how finances are being managed and establish whether the Commission has been doing its job properly. Parliament cannot therefore grant discharge without justification. Granting discharge means that the information received and obtained by Parliament indicates that the Commission has functioned properly. If there are points that need clarification that emerge later on, we can always return to them, even if discharge has been granted.</p>
<p class="contents">The report proposes that a deadline be given for discharge. This is a good thing. A situation where discharge is still pending from one year to the next, as has been the case here in recent years, does not show a businesslike or responsible approach to administration.</p>
<p class="contents">One problem is refusal to grant discharge. If discharge is not granted and a decision is taken on this, the reason is either malpractice or political distrust. Malpractice necessitates bringing charges against the authority or authorities concerned. If malpractice is not indicated, the accounts must be closed. If the reason for refusal of discharge is political, I think the Commission in that case should be forced to resign.</p>
<p class="contents">The system that has now been outlined, according to which refusal of discharge would be followed by a vote on a motion for censure, is good but unclear. If there is a motion for censure against the Commission or a Commissioner but discharge is not granted, there is a contradiction in the system. The contradiction may be due to the fact that discharge can be refused by a simple majority but a motion for censure only by a qualified majority. For that reason this conflict should not in any sense be made possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur and I also had some good discussions. The granting of discharge is Parliament's most important prerogative as a monitoring body when it comes to the assessment of how the budget has been managed by the executive – that is, primarily, by the Commission. This is a political act and not only the closure of the accounts, important as that is.</p>
<p class="contents">Using the reports of the Court of Auditors and other information, some, incidentally, from the Commission itself, we look to see if the objectives set have been met with proper and economic use of the funds allocated. We highlight weak points in order that they may be rectified and also avoided in the forthcoming budget. Where the three discharge options, which the rapporteur has elucidated – grant, deferment, and refusal – are concerned, I think it right to specify time periods, so that there will not be two discharge procedures running in parallel, as often happened in the past, but so that one procedure is concluded before the beginning of the next, and so that the two stages can function. Mrs Schreyer, I believe that the timeframe is indeed sufficient – if the time taken up by the summer recess is included – for constructive solutions to be arrived at in due time.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to tell the rapporteur that I cannot, however, accept that discharge should be deemed to have been granted if, in April, the plenary rejects a proposal from the Committee on Budgetary Control that it be deferred. Such a refusal may have contradictory motives behind it and does not express Parliament's unambiguous will. I might add that the Legal Service's opinion says the same thing. Granting discharge would be the wrong answer to the question put, and, for those to be given discharge, it would be a second-class discharge, being granted <span class="italic">en passant</span>. I would therefore have liked the proposal, in its three parts, to be sent back to the Committee on Budgetary Control. Should the discrepancies between the resolution and the result of the vote, as described in paragraph 3 of the new Article 5a, occur, the Committee on Budgetary Control should be given the task of removing them and submitting the resolution to the plenary for a second time.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as has already been mentioned, my group's amendments have been withdrawn. I must therefore rely on my own experience when I say, as I have done before, that, although there is in the report much that I can accept, I do not feel able to vote in favour of it if no other way is found of dealing with the issue of suspension and hence of the grant of discharge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is precisely the concern that brings us here and which led our rapporteur to find a way of setting a time limit for our examination of the Commission’s financial management. I would say that, from this point of view, this is a legitimate concern and that the wording chosen is perfectly reasonable.</p>
<p class="contents">In this debate, however, we cannot forget the fact that underlying the discharge procedure are aims that are very clearly expressed in Article 276 and, specifically, that the European Parliament is examining the accounts and the balance-sheet setting out the Community’s assets and liabilities. And, in this context, we must bear in mind that the accounting and financial control systems of the European institutions, on the basis of which these accounts and balance-sheets are drawn up, must be totally exemplary and must strictly, fully and unequivocally comply with the highest international quality standards. This is one observation that we must take into account for the financial year that we are about to begin.</p>
<p class="contents">Another observation to be emphasised is closely connected to the way in which the discharge has been undertaken in previous years, particularly the discharge for 1999, and concerns outsourcing. Mr Bourlanges is, as a matter of fact, the author of many of our references. I should also like to take this opportunity to stress the importance of this aspect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Convention has tried to live up to this task, and has, among other things, set up a working group on the simplification of procedures. Today's report by Mr Martin again makes it abundantly clear just how urgently necessary it is that this group should exist and that it should produce a result.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999, as one of the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I experienced first-hand the dilemma into which we were all plunged by the Rules of Procedure – or, as one should perhaps say, the Rules of Disorderly Business. At the time, the conduct of a number of Commissioners was unacceptable, discharge ought really not to have been granted, but, reasonably enough, we neither wanted nor were permitted to make scapegoats of the Commission as a whole. The problems of those days have been resolved by history – or probably, only by the honourable attitude of our present colleague Jacques Santer. It is evident, though, that we have not learned much from this. The system now proposed is no less complex than its predecessor. The present system is just as opaque as that which went before it, and if there were any need of proof of this, it has been provided by the events surrounding the efforts towards a compromise on this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Goethe, that prince among poets, has his Faust say that he is driven mad by thoughts that seem to revolve in his head like a millstone: '<span class="italic">Mir wird von alledem so dumm, als ginge ein Mühlstein mir im Kopf herum</span>'. I do not believe that we should inflict such headaches on our citizens in Europe – at any rate, not in the long term. All we can do, then, is to take on ourselves the task, here today, tomorrow and the day after, of finding a compromise and, in the Convention on the Future of Europe, to work out a model in accordance with which the public and their representatives understand what the political implications of discharge resolutions are and are meant to be.</p>

Of course, details are deceptive – as you, being an outstanding representative of the legal profession, will be well aware. It was in precisely such a decisive situation as this in which we found ourselves. Let us move more towards clarity, or towards what one might term the absence of intellectual doubt. Absurd though it might sound, I was wholeheartedly on Mrs Theato's side, and said that it really should be worked out with absolute clarity and utterly unambiguously, and that the third variant was to be left open. But that, Mr Rack, would have meant that the amendments would have been far more extensive, far more complex and much harder to understand. Hearing what we have heard from the Netherlands, and other positions, makes it possible, however, to live with a fellow-countryman saying that sort of thing.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to enlarge on two points, those made by Mrs Theato and by Commissioner Schreyer. Both refer to legal bases and to the Legal Service, both of which are sources of doubt. Of course we had to give ourselves safeguards on that, in order to have any chance of reaching a compromise, as we eventually did when we negotiated one with Mr Bourlanges and the Liberals' Mr Duff.</p>
<p class="contents">One legal opinion is now being pitted against another, and that is something we will have to live with. I do think though that, as a whole, what we have worked out reflects this House's thinking, and it goes without saying, Mrs Theato, that I respect your attitude. I only hope there will not be too many who think as you do, as otherwise we will be back to the beginning. Those who want everything sorted out in the Convention will perhaps be happy with that. There is no more simple way, though, for us to put this together. We have to make a political statement – that is our task as MEPs, but the Rules of Procedure are not designed for that purpose. With that in mind, then, thank you again for your cooperation and support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
