This idea of respecting international law, including humanitarian legislation on human rights and refugees, is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports a peaceful and constitutional solution to the crisis and that is necessary in order to hold free and equitable elections in the future within a climate which makes them possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has also supported the initiative of CARICOM and calls on all the Member States to accept and support it as well. This initiative is based on the resolutions of the Organisation of American States and must contribute to a sustainable solution to the crisis. The European Commission has granted financial assistance to the mission of the Organisation of American States in Haiti in the sum of EUR 1.25 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the departure of President Aristide, the Commission has noted certain positive developments on the political front and, in particular, in the process which has led to the appointment of Mr Latortue as provisional Prime Minister. His appointment is an important milestone in the initiative of CARICOM and should open the way to a constitutional solution to the current difficulties facing the country, provided that the necessary measures are adopted to break the cycle of violence and establish a climate of security in Haiti.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, the European Commission dedicated EUR 1.8 million in urgent humanitarian aid intended essentially for health assistance for people in the areas affected by the rebellion and in Port au Prince, and we are prepared to study the possibility of additional aid in accordance with humanitarian needs. In this regard, we are working in close cooperation with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Haiti in order to ascertain the existing needs. This team is receiving support and funding from our Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO).</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that the Commission is also working in cooperation with other international donors present in Haiti in order to coordinate development strategies and respond to the country's immediate needs, with a view to speeding up development aid as soon as the circumstances allow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The slaves overthrew their French masters and established the world's first black republic, which they named Haiti. A Proclamation of Independence pledged both brotherhood to those former masters whom 'do us justice' and 'its government henceforward to be one of justice'.</p>
<p class="contents">That was as good as it ever got for Haiti, which in our lifetime has sunk into poverty and terror. It has become a byword for state-sponsored violence and horror, with the Tonton Macoutes and the years of Papa Doc. With Aristide came a beacon of hope, which was snuffed out by a military coup, reinstated, but then the country steadily lapsed into a regime of economic decline, human rights abuses, murderous militias and dubious electoral practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it has imploded again. Bodies lie in the streets – victims of all sides – and children caught stealing beg for mercy to spare their lives. Children are at risk from hunger and disease. Factories and warehouses lie demolished, and with them have gone the jobs. Armed bandits, drug traffickers and death-squad leaders are exploiting the leadership vacuum. The world listened too late to Caricom's increasing anxiety, as so eloquently expressed by Louis Straker, Deputy Prime Minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, at the ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Addis Ababa a few weeks ago. By that point it was too late to bring the government and opposition together – not that the opposition was particularly helpful when it came to sticking to its conditions for cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">What can be done? France has sent troops to join those of the US. Presumably they will keep their EU partners informed, consult with them, and call on them as and when necessary. Should the rest of us wring our hands and leave it to them? Do we follow in the wake of UN resolutions? Do prepare and activate our humanitarian and subsequent development aid? Do we contribute to the cost of peacekeeping? Do we respond to UN calls to unblock roads to bring food and aid to the north? Do we help the local police to recapture the 3 500 prisoners who have escaped from 20 prisons, making it difficult to bring to justice the perpetrators of crimes during military rule? We need to do all these things. We need to release the frozen EDF monies. We need, once the multinational interim force has re-established order, to support CARICOM initiatives for a stabilisation force. We need to give support to the Prime Minister, Gérard Latortue, appointed by the Council of Wise Men, and the interim President, Alexandre. Then we need to help with bringing the guilty to justice and the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission.</p>
<p class="contents">On a day when terror has struck on our own continent, in Spain, and our hearts are with the people of Spain, we need to find room in our hearts for the people of Haiti too and to lend them our support and help them to have justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Failing that, there is the threat of continuing political and socio-economic collapse, with all its terrifying consequences for its people.</p>
<p class="contents">I have recently read reports from reliable sources in Haiti of just how little change there is in the situation there, and how grave it continues to be. Even more than the restoration of public order, the first priority is the rehabilitation of Haiti’s national police force, at the heart of which are reliable people who deserve every support on the part of the interim international emergency force. After all, in that way alone will it be possible to proceed with the mass disarmament of all the lawless warring groups. So far, though, the international emergency force continues to adopt too passive an approach; the result is open season for criminals and armed gangs. So it is, according to informants on the ground, that the bloodletting in Haiti continues. This is quite unacceptable, Commissioner. I call upon the international community to take firm action in Haiti in order to stabilise the situation. What will otherwise become of the provision of humanitarian aid?</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the foreign aid workers who remain are under enormous pressure as they attempt to alleviate the misery. Let me quote from what one of them said: ‘Personally, though, I am still convinced of the usefulness of what we are doing here, or else I would have left the country a long time ago; my family are worried about me, and that is what they have asked me to do. I think that, in these difficult times, it is more than ever vital not to leave the people of Haiti alone in their struggle for autonomy and democracy and to support them without controlling or coercing them.’</p>
<p class="contents">Such a courageous, steadfast voice must speak to us and bid us get involved in Haiti. What are we to make of the tireless dedication of these brave aid workers? They do not want to leave Haiti; nor, in any case, can they. I therefore ask the Commission, while we await a new government in Haiti, to use its best endeavours in order to resume ongoing activities as soon as possible. In that way, we will be keeping hope alive among the rural population and we will not be wasting any more time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was expecting France and the United States to be congratulated – especially France, as a European country – for having put an end to an insurrectionary crisis, which was visibly degenerating into a very serious civil war. Yet, I did not see such congratulations in the draft resolution, even though the European Union has been saying, for several weeks, that it is greatly concerned about the outbreaks of violence and called on all political forces, without exception – and I am quoting the Presidency declaration of 18 February – to refrain from any kind of violent behaviour. These friendly calls came to nothing, whereas France and the United States have at least achieved something.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also expecting France to be congratulated for not being cravenly disinterested in a country with which it maintains cultural links and with which it has long-standing ties of affection, even though this country is in immediate proximity to the United States. France intends, in this way, to show that it is still aware of its historic commitments and the European Parliament should have been able to support this act of responsibility. I also expected France to be congratulated on having implemented a measure for preventive diplomacy, a measure to which the European Union, if it had been a good sport, would have been able to lend its support.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, the proposed resolution seems to primarily deplore, without daring to say so clearly, the fact that a European country took an initiative without continually remaining in the ranks of those who issued friendly calls. This is a negative attitude and altogether deplorable, which leads the draft resolution to surprising expressions. For example, I see in Recital F, that the conditions for the departure of Jean-Bertrand Aristide are criticised in a veiled manner and he is referred to as President, even though everyone knows, and the report itself recalls this in Recital H, that the election to his second term in office took place without the participation of the opposition parties, which wished to protest against the vote count at the previous parliamentary elections, thus creating a crisis which has only got worse and degenerated since.</p>
<p class="contents">I also see, in paragraph 11, that the European Parliament called for the multinational interim force, authorised by the United Nations Security Council, to be formed, not of French, US and Canadian military personnel, but of United Nations peace-keepers, as if the European Parliament’s one overpowering concern was to exclude from this force the countries that have a presence in the region, because they are the ones primarily interested.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, I am disappointed that the draft resolution does not recognise that France acted out of duty and general interest, that it gave assistance to a population in danger – to avoid the worst – and that France defended the sovereignty of the Haitian people and that furthermore, France endeavoured to protect the legitimacy of a process of political restoration. This, I stress, is par for the course because the Council of seven wise men, representative of the diversity of Haitian society, has just nominated a Prime Minister, Mr Latortue, with the approval of the interim president Mr Alexandre, which, by the way, makes Recital K of the draft resolution somewhat out of date. We should welcome this recent decision, which is within the context of a move towards reconciliation and opens the way to forming a transitional Government of National Unity that will itself be responsible for preparing the next elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
