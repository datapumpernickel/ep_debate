I should like to take this opportunity to thank him and to wish him all the best in his new job. As you know, he is now the new President of Hungary. It is particularly important for Hungary that we have someone who has such strong ties with the European Union and here in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is an adaptation of the Seveso II Directive, and it is concerned with preventing major chemical accidents, such as have occurred here in Europe in Seveso, Schweizerhalle, Toulouse, and so on, or if accidents do occur, initiating appropriate protection measures for the population and the environment. The Seveso II Directive has been very successful. It now needs to be aligned with the regulation on the classification, labelling and packaging of dangerous substances and mixtures, known as the CLP Regulation, which will enter into force on 1 June 2015, and with it its Annex I, which lists the relevant dangerous substances for the establishments. That is why this adaptation is now necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, we have around 10 000 chemical establishments that directly produce these substances and are affected. At this point, I should like to add that it is important that we keep our strong chemicals industry in Europe. We have just been discussing jobs. We need this industrial base if we are to be able to offer jobs long-term. At the same time, we must naturally ensure that the environment and also people are protected from the dangers that such establishments present.</p>
<p class="contents">The revision should also serve to enhance the level of protection, not decrease it. That is why we must work to improve implementation and, naturally, also to enable the establishments to compete on equal terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Our approach to harmonising the terms on which the establishments compete was, naturally, to try to reduce the overall administrative burden as far as possible in all the Member States. This is indeed a major challenge for us Europeans. Many of our global competitors have very lax regulations and, of course, this makes things very difficult for our enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Another reason for the adaptation was the Aarhus Convention. As you know, this is a convention that the European Union has also signed up to for improved public access to information on access to the judicial system. In this area, we have been able to make substantial improvements that will give people living in the immediate vicinity of such establishments better access to justice and also enhanced information rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The main problems have been with the Council. In particular, we tried to have inhaled substances included. In the main, this was accepted. There are time-limited exemptions only for seven substances. In the case of substances that affect the skin – or toxicity category 3, to put it in technical terms – we succeeded in getting three substances included, while the rest are not. Nonetheless, as part of the agreement, the Commission will investigate whether they can be included in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament also considers it important that we prevailed in respect of the alignment of Annex I. The ordinary legislative procedure will be used here, not the delegated act planned by the Commission or the implementing act planned by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I should like to express my heartfelt thanks once again to all the shadow rapporteurs that our strong position in Parliament has enabled us to assert ourselves against the Council and the Commission. We have achieved significant improvements. I would like to thank all those involved once again, and repeat my good wishes to János Áder as he takes up his new position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">John Dalli, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, we stand on the threshold of a first reading agreement on the revision of the so-called Seveso Directive on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr János Áder, who is today represented by Mr Seeber, as well as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, for the excellent work carried out on this proposal; and, in absentia, congratulate Mr Áder on his new responsibilities at the very highest level in his home country.</p>
<p class="contents">Industrial accidents often have serious, even devastating, consequences: workers are killed; the public is exposed to chemicals resulting in immediate injury or long-term health impacts; water sources are polluted; companies may have to close. Some well-known major accidents like Seveso, Bhopal, Toulouse and Buncefield have taken many lives and cost billions of euro.</p>
<p class="contents">The Seveso II Directive, which dates back to 1996, addresses this by setting rules for operators and competent authorities of Member States. Rules focus on accident prevention, through safety management, inspections and land-use planning. When accidents do happen, Seveso seeks to limit the consequences for man and the environment, through appropriate information and emergency planning.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is satisfied with the compromise text on which Parliament is invited to vote, which aligns the directive with the new international rules on the classification of chemicals and significantly improves the EU rules on accident prevention and control.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me explain why. Firstly, the rules on inspections are far more detailed and effective than before, imposing inspection action plans covering all establishments and ensuring follow-up by operators. Secondly, the rights of citizens are better guaranteed. Citizens will have easier access to more information, including on inspections, and their participation in land-use planning projects will be better guaranteed by strict procedures. Finally, in case those rights are not respected as they should be, citizens will now have the right to go to court, in line with the EU commitment under the Aarhus Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that this will allow citizens to exert the necessary pressure on operators and competent authorities to implement – in the best way – the Seveso legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The way the scope of the directive has been defined was a major issue in the negotiations, and will now reinforce the level of protection of citizens and the environment as the rules will now also apply to establishments handling substances with inhalation vapour toxicity, which were previously not covered. However, we consider that there is a need to deepen our knowledge regarding substances displaying dermal toxicity. The Commission is therefore making the following declaration, announcing its intention to further analyse the consequences of accidents involving such substances: ‘The Commission acknowledges that the compromise reached on its proposal implies an improvement of the level of protection of human health and safety and of the environment as compared with that provided by the current Seveso II Directive 96/82/EC. The Commission intends to undertake a further analysis of the likelihood, risks and potential consequences of major accidents involving dangerous substances classified acute toxic 3 dermal. Depending on the outcome of the analysis, the Commission may present a legislative proposal to also include this category within the scope of the directive’. This may lead to a legislative proposal to amend the scope of the directive on this point, if deemed necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the European Commission can support the compromise package in order to reach an agreement on this directive at first reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Or, given the accidents and natural disasters we have experienced since 1996, are we progressing towards greater safety for people, the environment and society, without pointlessly encumbering industry? It was to try to achieve this goal that I agreed to be rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">After listening and exchanging opinions with others, we were keen to propose amendments which, without calling the industrial process into question, would bring about greater safety for citizens and the environment and give new rights to those who are the first to be exposed –the employees of companies in the chemical and transport industries.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite frankly, our views were given scant regard. Once again, money overrode the human aspect, and progress will be marginal.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that there is still a gulf between the lofty principles discussed and the harsh daily reality on the ground. This is true of industrial installations and storage facilities and for the transport of dangerous substances. To evade the so-called Seveso legislation, companies have chosen to reduce stocks of products classified as dangerous, leaving in storage tanks these same products which, maybe tonight, will sleep somewhere near you while waiting to be delivered tomorrow morning with all the risks that that entails. This cannot be allowed to happen. Meanwhile, we were being led to believe that we would be better informed and better protected!</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, major contradictions emerge. How can security be strengthened when, day by day, employees are being placed in an increasingly precarious situation and are not always trained as they should be? How can security be guaranteed when some countries use their laxity to carry out environmental dumping? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I do, however, consider the addition and clarification of provisions relating to providing information to the public, public consultation and participation of the public in decision making to be of particular importance. It is very important that this information be complete and relevant. We do not want to overwhelm the public with unnecessary information, but we do want the information to be clearly worded and easy to understand. Keeping the public informed is vital in building trust as well as in raising public awareness of the correct action to take in the event of a major accident.</p>
<p class="contents">Annex I is a key element of the Seveso II Directive and is essential for setting the scope of the directive.

<p class="contents">It was important to my group that we maintain, and preferably increase, the protection of people and the environment when revising this directive. I think we have succeeded in that aim. All Seveso facilities are required, under the Seveso III Directive, to develop a Major Accident Prevention Policy (MAPP), which is to be implemented by means of a Safety Management System. This applies unless the Member States decide differently on the basis of a risk analysis. This is a step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement tightens up the requirements relating to internal and external emergency plans, the requirements relating to the carrying out of inspections by the Member States and the requirement to take into account ‘domino effects’ – that is to say, external circumstances that could aggravate the accident – and it improves the information provided to the general public somewhat. Certain information concerning the establishments is to be available electronically at all times, even for those establishments with the lower safety classification.</p>
<p class="contents">My group would have liked to have gone a little further when it comes to protecting the environment and people, however, by extending the scope of the directive. We would also have liked to have improved the information provided to the general public. The fact that ordinary legislation will now be required in order to amend the criteria that govern which establishments are covered by Seveso III is not an optimum solution, either. However, in view of the fact that the Council was not able to agree to amend this via delegated acts, this was the only option.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we think that, overall, this is a good agreement and we will vote in favour of it tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we can be pleased overall with what we have managed to achieve in the agreement at first reading during the Danish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The tragic experience from major industrial accidents in the last few decades, such as Bhopal in India in 1984 and Toulouse in France in 2001, highlighted a pressing need to revise and update European Union legislation in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Council was not as ambitious as Parliament on the issues concerning the scope of the directive and public access to information and justice, we managed to stand up for the need for higher standards of access to information, including online information. We also successfully reached agreement on exempting certain substances so that they are managed using the codecision procedure and not by delegated acts.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Áder also introduced greater flexibility compared to what was envisaged by the Commission with a prerogative for Member States. The final report has provided major improvements regarding the scope of the directive and the provisions on exempting substances, although I personally regret that we were unable to go further on the requirements for access to information and company inspections.</p>
<p class="contents">We can be pleased, on the whole, that this new, improved directive reinforces a few important proposals for protecting health and the environment, as well as for transparent information and the rights of European citizens to have access to information.

<p class="contents">I think it is unfortunate that the Council is not here, as I think it ought to have tried to defend publicly what it stood for in the negotiations, namely, a cynical zero sum game in which the reclassification of chemicals will not result in any increase in protection. Instead, we have a zero sum game concerning the number of facilities that we want to be covered by the directive, rather than considering the health benefits and protection against accidents. It was unfortunate that the Council took that attitude. In the end, however, we obtained an agreement that will, in fact, work better in many ways, as Ms Westlund and others have mentioned. It was particularly important that we did not exclude whole categories of chemicals, as the Council initially wanted to do.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, there are a number of tasks that the Commission still has to do, including investigating the requirement for insurance. This is something that I think is extremely important for the Commission to get on with now. It must not be the case that the costs are passed on to the general public when these companies cannot manage to keep their facilities intact, clean and in good condition. Instead, this is something that they must insure themselves against. This must not be a burden borne by taxpayers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The object of the directive is to prevent and control accidents involving dangerous chemical substances and provide citizens with information. That is a good thing. However, as a result of the opposition in the Council, the opportunity to protect citizens and the environment in the event of an accident has not been exploited to the maximum extent. Our populations must be kept safe, even if they live close to a business that uses substances that are dangerous to inhale or that can be dangerous in some other way in the event of an accident.</p>
<p class="contents">The most positive thing with the proposal, however, is that the citizens of the EU now have access to more information.

Moreover, a significant increase in administrative costs due to the need to align with the Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) Regulation would especially affect users downstream and small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore well aware of the concerns expressed by the European industrial associations that are calling for option B to be selected. This would involve leaving the scope of the Seveso II Directive virtually unchanged, for it is well established and has been shown to work effectively. The broad-scope or open approach has been used for every new environmental regulation affecting industry. We believe that it is a poor way to legislate, because ideology ends up predominating over practical realities. We support the idea of extending the directive’s scope – in Article 2 – to offshore platforms and the associated oil and gas pipelines, along with carbon capture and storage (CCS) plants and salt cavities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Information for the public and their participation in decision making is not just a right, it is a necessity: only an informed population can limit the dangers and only a population that decides to do so can protect itself from abuses. Prevention and limitation of the consequences are the first priorities, so I welcome this proposal. However, when we see that even recently, in Hungary, the poorest of the poor were abandoned following the toxic sludge spill, and when we see that, in the chemical accident in Bhopal, India, hundreds of thousands of victims were left to their fate at the same time as the company was operating and making a profit in Europe, we cannot remain ignorant; we cannot forget. There is also a need for these companies to be held financially and criminally responsible, and for even more transparency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim of environmental legislation should not only be about response but, above all, prevention, in order to stop such accidents. In future, we must go further and apply the so-called precautionary principle. The directive being debated today is especially intended to ensure that legal requirements are in line with technological progress. Sadly, it is regrettable that we are not ambitious enough and are so far trying to catch up with reality. For instance, offshore hydrocarbon exploration, extraction and transportation do not yet fall within the scope of the directive. It probably makes little difference whether a tanker is carrying oil or gas or, for instance, ammonia. In every case where there is an accident, the damage is significant. However, I am very pleased about the inclusion of the provisions of the Aarhus Convention in this document. In my opinion, citizens have the right to obtain information, participate in decision making and have access to justice. I believe that all of this will ensure a high level of environmental protection. It is important for citizens to receive information about actions in the event of a possible accident and for them to receive information about the date objects are inspected. I would like to give my congratulations to the rapporteur Mr János Áder, who I believe has done a great job and would like to wish the Hungarian Presidency good luck. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why we must do everything we can to reduce the risk, as well as the likelihood, of such accidents being repeated.</p>
<p class="contents">How do we do that? Firstly, we must allow even unscheduled inspections, and it must not be simply routine. The people who live close to such industrial establishments must be very well informed of what is going on there, what happens there. In the event of an incident, we must make sure that the situation is clarified promptly. This is very important, because it can save human lives.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the Council has not done itself any favours here. I also think the Council should be here for this debate in Parliament. Apparently, however, other things are more important. I think the Council might have saved face if it had explained why this legislation has been watered down. That is what I would have liked to see. However, strong legislation in this area will also create confidence. This confidence is needed when the Member States plan large infrastructure projects. At such times, there are always major reservations among the population. Strong legislation here, such as we have achieved today, creates confidence; and that is only possible where there is the greatest possible degree of transparency. It also requires authorities to be better networked with each other, to cooperate more with each other; we also need more communication, and dealing with such large, dangerous establishments must never become routine. We must not allow that to happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They destroyed public and private property and damaged the environment, resulting in costs of the order of billions of euro. The directive is important because it places obligations on operators and on authorities in the Member States to prevent accidents and limit their consequences. The European Union should systematically tighten legislation on inspection and risk analysis. Revision of the directive will improve coordination of legislation and will therefore put an end to the unnecessary duplication of inspections. It should also be pointed out that sub-contractors should be subject to special supervision, because it is often they who are negligent, as we saw in Hudson Bay. The European Parliament, which represents the citizens, should be able to play a full part in this decision-making process, so I support the view of the rapporteur that amendments to current legislation should be made under the ordinary legislative procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should also keep Parliament regularly informed about industrial accidents and the responses made to them. Public opinion must also have easier access to transparent and reliable information about possible dangers and what to do if an accident should occur. The Internet is an effective tool for making people aware of these issues. It should be put to use as quickly as possible, starting with an information campaign regarding the new classification of toxic substances and the hazards they pose to life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Merkies (S&amp;D). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, there was a major fireworks disaster in Enschede in the Netherlands 12 years ago. It claimed the lives of 23 people and made the headlines all over the world. Last year, we had a major fire at Chemie-Pack in Moerdijk, a company that had long provided insufficient information. It was all simply down to inadequate enforcement. Also, when it comes to the fireworks disaster in Enschede, people knew for a long time what was going on in that company; they had been given free rein for a very long time.</p>
<p class="contents">Every time a disaster of this kind happens, we go modifying legislation. However, we first of all need to properly supervise enforcement, because that is the most important element. I think it is a good thing, though, that this directive has now been revised because, indeed, transparency for the citizens, knowing what happens within a company, is extremely important and does, indeed, inspire confidence. In particular, the fact that such information is now also available on the Internet is very important right now. It provides our citizens with easy access to this kind of data.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the fact that a single body is not in charge of the provision of information and that the municipalities or authorities do not always have the expertise to carry out proper inspections continues to be a problem. We really have to work on that. We need more support for the authorities to carry out inspections properly and we also need to inform the emergency services thereof. We need to ensure good provision of information for the citizens so that their faith in us can be justified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 21 September 2001, a stock of ammonium nitrate exploded killing 31 people and wounding a further 2 500, who are still traumatised to this day. The damage caused was unbelievable.

Although, in the revision of this directive, the Commission introduces a new, more sophisticated classification system that distinguishes three categories of toxicity and differentiates between five possible routes of exposure, and proposes a tightening of the existing rules for inspections, some areas of safety protection are not adequately covered in it. In particular, regulation of accountability relationships in the use of subcontractor services is missing, as are provisions on the transport of hazardous loads and their temporary storage in areas which are not covered by the directive. Another serious deficiency of the draft is that there is too much scope for granting derogations to Member States. A number of disasters in recent years have drawn our attention to the fact that, in order to guarantee the safety of equipment, it is necessary to take account of natural risks that are not included in the draft, in addition to the technological risks. I therefore consider it highly necessary to support all the draft amendments of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy which address the shortcomings of the draft submitted by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps we could have gone further, but it was mainly a case of blocking by the Council. The debate has also clearly shown that we have to pay attention to good implementation. I believe it is one of the main problems of European environmental legislation that we sometimes create very good law, but that some Member States are very slow and lax in implementing it. That is worth drawing attention to here, in the case of Seveso III, because it is specifically concerned with human lives that are put at risk if they live close to such chemical establishments. There is a certain danger potential, and that needs to be properly managed.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been made clear that the instruments available, such as emergency plans and so on, should be as precise as possible and should involve the public, so that every citizen knows how to react in the event of a worst case scenario – if such an accident occurs. Well thought-out plans can save a great many human lives. We all know that time is of the essence here; as is, of course, the training given to safety personnel, both those in the establishment itself and those from the area affected.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also key that trust is built up in the population, so that the population feels included, and, of course, prevention is also important. In the case of prevention, too, the management of the establishment is key, as is the local management in the area concerned. We may consider ourselves lucky that, with the ordinary legislative procedure, we have ensured that Parliament is fully involved in the adaptation of this Annex I. We have to make sure that we are not pushed aside here. We have succeeded in that. I would therefore like to end by reiterating that overall, I believe the compromise is in order. Naturally, we might have wanted to go further, but for the sake of agreement with the Council and the Commission, we can accept it.</p>

I supported the approach advocated by the rapporteur in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, namely, that the level of health and environmental protection should be at least equal to or higher than the current level. To achieve an equal level of protection and prevention throughout Europe, Member States must arrange for the exchange of best practices and the sharing of necessary information. This would allow for a quicker identification of the causes of accidents and the mitigation of negative consequences. It is important to note that in the future, any extension of the scope of the directive must be preceded by impact assessment. The stipulation that amendments to Annex I must be made in an ordinary legislative procedure is an important aspect with regard to the role of Parliament in the legislative process. In the interest of citizens, operators must inform and cooperate with local authorities and must assume liability for any accidents. A reduction in the administrative burdens of small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector can be implemented only if an appropriate level of protection is maintained. In the interest of preserving the health and safety of citizens and preventing disasters, facilities covered by the Seveso Directive must, without exception, comply with the best available techniques. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also proved that compensation for accidental damage is only guaranteed if the operator has comprehensive environmental insurance. I welcome the fact that in his report, Mr Áder proposed the introduction of mandatory insurance in the European Union. Depositing industrial and mining waste cannot be considered a final solution. The amounts deposited should be reduced to a minimum, and efforts should be made to recycle the waste generated. Red mud could yield considerable quantities of iron ore, as well as chromium, copper, nickel and other valuable metals. The available procedures to extract these are not yet economical.
