<p>The Italian Prime Minister, Mr Amato, has stated that the staging of a festival in Rome to celebrate World Gay Pride 2000 would be ‘inappropriate’. After months of controversy, the Italian Government’s spurious opposition to a peaceful festival is continuing to harden, to the extent of appearing to be a discrimination-driven violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The right to demonstrate and the freedoms of assembly and association, expression, thought and conscience, not to mention the ban on discrimination, are common to the constitutional traditions of the Member States and are therefore general principles of Community law. In the light of this, and given that the Union respects fundamental rights as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights (Article 6(2), TEU) and is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms (Article 6(1), TEU), should the Council not take action against Italy under the procedures provided for in Article 7 of the TEU?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>However, in general terms the Council would like to emphasise, for Mr Turco’s information, that organisation of events such as the one referred to in his question is a matter solely for the national police authorities, one of whose tasks is to maintain public order. It is also important in this context to remind the honourable Member that the legal institution to which it falls to judge possible infringements of human rights and fundamental freedoms by a European state in the first place is the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Within the limits imposed by the need to maintain public order, the Council obviously attaches great importance to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as these are cornerstones of the entire structure of the Community.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0485"></a>

<p>‘The government of any Member State or the Commission may submit to the Council proposals for the amendment of the Treaties on which the Union is founded.</p>
<p>If the Council, after consulting the European Parliament and, where appropriate, the Commission, delivers an opinion in favour of calling a conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States, the Conference shall be convened by the President of the Council for the purpose of determining by common accord the amendments to be made to those Treaties. The European Central Bank shall also be consulted in the case of institutional changes in the monetary area’.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member can see from this text, the Council, therefore, as an institution, does not take part in the Intergovernmental Conference responsible for revising the Treaty and for that reason, it is out of the question that it could adopt a position on proposals for such a revision, all the more so when, as the honourable Member observes, the statement in question was not made at a formal sitting of the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0494"></a>

<p>For fifty years the peoples of Nagaland, an area in the north-east of India, have been involved in a bloody conflict against both the Indian Government and Burma. Two years ago the Indian Government and representatives of Nagaland began negotiations with a view to arriving at a fair political solution to the conflict, and a cease-fire came into force. On 19 January 2000 Mr T. Muivah, Secretary-General of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN), was arrested in Thailand as he was travelling to the Netherlands to participate in negotiations with the Indian Prime Minister’s representative. He was charged with possession of false travel documents. In view of Mr Muivah’s extremely important role in the talks, his detention is likely to be detrimental to the ongoing negotiations and the current cease-fire. Does the Council agree that it is proper for the goodwill currently demonstrated by both parties to be encouraged? If so, does the Council not consider it would be desirable to provide Mr Muivah with an official laissez-passer to enable him to move freely throughout the European Union so that he may participate under the best possible conditions in the negotiations with the Indian Government’s representatives?

<p>The Council is fully aware of the threat to the safety and lives of civilians in Kosovo posed chiefly by unexploded anti-personnel mines but also by unexploded cluster bombs.</p>
<p>As Mr Alyssandrakis is no doubt aware, in sharing tasks between the main actors and international organisations involved in the difficult job of normalising the situation in Kosovo, it was decided that the EC would look after the “Fourth Pillar” of UNMIK, which relates to economic reconstruction and development in Kosovo.</p>
<p>Mine clearance and other related tasks, including the location and neutralisation of unexploded devices, were delegated to other UNMIK and KFOR “pillars”. UNMIK recently confirmed in a public statement that mines had already been cleared from over 16 000 homes and from 80% of schools. Over 15 000 mines, cluster bombs and other explosive devices have been removed from public areas. Awareness-raising programmes on mines are being run in communities throughout Kosovo, and this includes the training of local teachers. A programme has also been launched to provide victims with emergency aid, rehabilitation and psycho-social support.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Alyssandrakis may be interested to know that the EC is giving financial support for the reconstruction of Kosovo for the period 1999-2000 up to the present via programmes totalling EUR 850 million, including reconstruction aid, humanitarian aid and exceptional financial aid for the year 2000. The total financial contribution made by the EC and the EU Member States during the same period is some EUR 3.1 billion. It is worth emphasising that ECHO has also been financing emergency mine clearance programmes and has been contributing to the work of the UN Centre for mine clearance, awareness raising on mines and mine mapping. This centre recently announced that over 1.1 million square metres of land in Kosovo had already been cleared of mines.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0501"></a>

<p>Formal adoption is due to take place before the end of the Portuguese Presidency. The Council is therefore most pleased with the speedy progress made on what it regards as a very important text.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0512"></a>

<p>On 26 May the Ombudsman made public allegations to the Parliament’s Committee on Constitutional Affairs concerning the difficulties he had encountered in gaining access to documents concerning the Thessaloniki underground railway. He said that he could not guarantee to the European Parliament or the citizens that the truth would emerge from the investigation that he was conducting, since it was blatantly clear from the five oral depositions which he had taken from the officials who were involved in the affair that these had been made on behalf of and on the advice of management, on the one hand, and on the other hand that the officials were bound by an undertaking to maintain professional secrecy. </p>
<p>What is the Council’s stance, in face of the obstruction of the Ombudsman’s work, with regard to facilitating the investigation of this complaint? Are EU officials who remain silent above the ‘laws’ and the Treaties and what is the ‘orchestrated’ deposition of the employees of the Commission hiding, since it follows from these that there was an intervention which departed from Community rules?</p>
<p>Does the legal status of the Ombudsman need revision so that he may conduct investigations without hindrance into all the areas which fall within his sphere of responsibilities, so that he may have access to all documents (as is the case, moreover, for all ombudsmen in the Member States), so that he may call Commissioners for hearings and so that he may take depositions from officials without restrictions?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council has stressed the importance of progress continuing to be made under the Stabilisation and Association Process which is the centrepiece of its policy in the Balkans. The new Stabilisation and Association Agreements with the countries in the region will cover economic and financial support, political dialogue, regional cooperation, harmonisation with EU legislation, free trade and cooperation in other areas of policy.</p>
<p>With regard to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, since its declaration of independence in 1999 this country has carried out far-reaching political reforms so as to transform itself into a democratic state. Its political maturity has been reflected in its policy towards its neighbouring countries and in its cooperation with the international community during and since the Kosovo crisis. Its increasing respect for human rights and the rule of law, including the rights of national and ethnic minorities and groups, is worth particular mention.</p>
<p>Accordingly, on the basis of the Commission’s positive report on the feasibility of opening negotiations with FYROM, the Council decided to give the Commission approval to start negotiations with this country. These negotiations opened in spring this year, and there have already been positive developments in the first two official rounds of negotiations held in Brussels on 5 April and 29 May respectively. Further technical consultations will take place during the summer with a view to concluding the negotiations before the end of the year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0479"></a>

<p>This has given rise to the Business Environment Simplification Task Force Action Plan (the BEST action plan).</p>
<p>The internal market competitiveness of the food industry is safeguarded by making effective use of vertical legislation to lift technical barriers to trade. The international competitiveness of the food industry is reinforced via a number of instruments:</p>
<p>First, by improving trading conditions with third countries by means of preferential agreements on tariff and non-tariff barriers;</p>
<p>Second, by using the export refund scheme to put the Community food industry on a level playing field with third country competitors;</p>
<p>Third, the Commission has proposed the Inward Processing Relief Facility in order to compensate the reductions imposed on export refunds by the GATT agreements. This proposal is currently in discussion with Parliament and the Member States;</p>

<p>The Lisbon Summit stressed the need to encourage an entrepreneurial spirit in the European Union, but in contrast to the USA, where banks give loans on the basis of the merit of the project concerned, in the EU the project’s merit is merely a necessary but insufficient precondition, and banks provide loans only against the personal guarantee of the entrepreneurs themselves.</p>

<p>There is a certainly a gap between the United States and the Community in terms of entrepreneurial culture and individuals’ willingness to take risk. However, the Commission is not aware of evidence that there is any fundamental difference between the two as regards how banks behave when granting credit.</p>
<p>Indeed, a recent survey by one of the Community’s largest commercial banks pointed out that collateral was required for 92% of loans granted to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the United States and that an additional guarantee - usually from the entrepreneur - was necessary for around half of these.</p>
<p>Having said this, the Commission believes that facilitating access to finance for SMEs remains a key element in maintaining and enhancing the Community’s competitiveness and in creating jobs. For this reason it continues to work in a number of areas:</p>
<p>First, on improving the relationship between banks and SMEs through the Round Table of Bankers and SMEs.</p>
<p>Second, on increasing the availability of guarantees through the SME Guarantee Facility of the Growth and Employment Initiative and by encouraging the development of mutual guarantee societies.</p>
<p>Third, on increasing the supply of equity for SMEs through the “Capital Risque pour les Entreprises en phase d’Amorçage” (CREA) programme, the European Technology Facility, and support for Business Angels activity.</p>
<p>These and other proposals for access to finance instruments are now part of the proposed new Multiannual Programme for Enterprise and Entrepreneurship.

<p>The honourable Member has referred in his question to the outcome of the evaluation in 1999 of 94 research proposals in Information Society Technologies for Persons with Special Needs. This evaluation was done by external peer reviewers who concluded that only 11 proposals were considered to respect the innovation criteria established in the 5th Framework Programme.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to these external peer reviewers, only 3 of these proposals had sufficiently convincing exploitation plans to pass the corresponding threshold set up in the 5th Framework Programme.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Commission followed the recommendations of this peer review evaluation and funded only 3 proposals. This was clearly a disappointing result.</p>
<p>Due to the importance that the Commission attaches to putting the information society technologies at the service of citizens with special needs, the Commission recommended the unsuccessful proposals to re-submit improved proposals in the Calls opened in February 2000.</p>
<p>In order to attract better research and technological development proposals, the Commission has made more explicit the conditions to be met in order to pass successfully the innovation and the exploitation criteria thresholds. In addition, an information day was organised on 17 March 2000 in Brussels with all the relevant information put on the Cordis Website. Also, Commission staff participated in several conferences and workshops in the Member States in order to highlight these aspects. Finally, a Helpdesk has been set up to answer any enquiries from potential proposers.</p>
<p>It is the hope of the Commission that the evaluation of this new call, which is taking place in this month of June, will result in a higher number of good quality proposals with a strong exploitation potential.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0515"></a>

<p>“... enhance cultural diversity and multilingualism ...;</p>

<p>In addition, the Commission has made a commitment to promote indigenous regional and minority languages.

<p>The European Year of Languages is targeted at achieving the following objectives: making the population aware of the rich diversity of the languages of the European Union, and of the advantages of having language skills, the promotion of lifelong language learning, and finally the collation and dissemination of information on teaching and learning languages.</p>
<p>The languages involved are the official languages of the Community, as well as Irish and Luxembourgish, and other languages suggested by the Member States for the purposes of applying the Decision establishing the European Year of Languages.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the aim of the European Year of Languages is to encourage the citizens of Europe to develop their language skills and to introduce the linguistic heritage of Europe to them, without favouring some languages above others.</p>
<p>Most of the activities funded will be opened to tender and will depend on the proposals submitted by European associations and organisations. The Commission is also, within each Member State, going to fund events to publicise the Year, as well as a massive publicity campaign accentuating the richness of Europe’s diversity of languages.</p>
<p>As far as the Media Plus programme is concerned one important aspect is to support and promote cultural and linguistic diversity (which was also the case for Media I and Media II).</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposal for the Media Plus programme (2001-2005) covers the implementation of a training programme for professionals in the European audiovisual programme industry (Media Training) and the implementation of a programme to encourage the development, distribution and promotion of European audiovisual works (Media-Development, Distribution and Promotion).</p>
<p>The experience gained under the Media I and Media II programmes and the assessments of the results obtained have led to the conclusion that there should be a greater consideration for the specific needs of the industries in countries and regions with a lower audiovisual production capacity and/or a restricted geographical and linguistic area.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the Media II programme also takes into account specific needs of countries and regions with a low audiovisual production capacity or a restricted geographical and linguistic area.

<p>The Commission is well aware of the high price differences for cars between the Member States and in particular with the United Kingdom, since it publishes a bi-annual report on car prices with a view to increase price transparency and consequently parallel imports. The differences observed since 1997 are partly due to the strength of the Pound Sterling and the additional cost of British specifications, together with the existence of low net prices in Member States with high car taxation like Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The Commission’s task is to ensure that parallel trade, which is an important factor for reducing price differentials, is not hindered by restrictive practices from car manufacturers. Various ex officio proceedings have been opened against car manufacturers in this regard and some of them should be finalised before the end of the year.</p>
<p>The Commission was informed of the remedies announced by the British Authorities to bring down prices for new cars, when the British Competition commission’s report on car distribution was published on 10 April 2000. It will observe the effect of such measures adopted at the national level on the level of prices in the United Kingdom before deciding on the adoption of appropriate measures at the European level.</p>
<p>Price differentials for new cars within the Community will be one of the important elements taken into account for the evaluation of the Block Exemption Regulation 1475/95 for motor vehicle distribution. The Commission will, before the end of the year, draw up a report on the evaluation of the Regulation which expires in 2002. That evaluation will be the basis for the future regime for car distribution in Europe.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0442"></a>

<p>The Commission is fully aware of the environmental problem of the river Varadar/Axios. Therefore financial assistance to address environmental problems in fYROM has been provided under the PHARE National Programmes and CBC Programmes.</p>
<p>An allocation of EUR 1.6 million was provided under the 1997 Phare Cross Border Co-operation Programme Fyrom/Greece (Sub-project MA 9707-02 “Environmental Protection”) for a project called “Automatic Monitoring Stations Downstream the Vardar River to Monitor Pollution Quantities by Various Parameters”. The project’s objective is to provide for a continuous monitoring of the pollution status and open the possibility of rapid action against potential polluters. On the basis of the information that the project will be able to provide, the Ministry of Environment of fYROM is supposed to take the consequent measures to solve the pollution of the river.</p>
<p>In the 1997 national Phare programme for fYROM, 2 projects were financed (for a total contribution of EUR 2 million): (i) “Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building” and (ii) “Waste water, water quality and solid waste management”. The objective of the first project was to assist the Ministry of Environment in establishing proper to deal with environment protection, including water protection. The project will assist the approximation of legislation to the Water Quality Framework Directive and the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive. Out of six components of the second project, three have dealt with water protection eg. National Waste Water strategy development and Waste Water Management system for Skopje. All the strategy is based on the development of the protection of particular watersheds that finally influence the main collector of Vardar/Axios river.</p>
<p>An additional allocation of EUR 3 million was provided under the 1999 national Phare Programme 1999 for FYROM to finance the following two projects: “Strengthening to the Ministry of Environment to adapt environmental legislation to the Community acquis” and “Environmental awareness raising, improvement of communication and environmental monitoring”.</p>
<p>The results of the above-mentioned projects and the regular consultations on Environmental issues between the Commission and the Ministry of Environment will contribute to achieve the common goal to safeguard the ecosystem balance and ensure the health of all residents in the region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0447"></a>

<p>The Commission has received invitations from BNFL to visit its Sellafield site and the MOX plant. However, it must be clear that any such visit could not be classified as a “special safety mission” as safety at the site is the responsibility of the operator (BNFL). Visits to the site to review its safety are primarily the responsibility of the competent national authorities, in this case the HSE.</p>
<p>With regard to radiation protection, the Commission will examine whether it is opportune to carry out a verification mission under Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty.

<p>The Commission was concerned at the New Year outbreak of sectarian violence and murder in El-Khosheh (Upper Egypt), the worst for 20 years. It was encouraged by the initial measures taken to restore calm to the area. And it looks to the Egyptian Government to make good its commitment to bring all those responsible to justice.</p>
<p>The New Year events in El-Khosheh were fundamentally different from those of August 1998 when inappropriate policing rather than sectarian bias by the security forces was the key problem. The matter was not well handled by the Government, internally and externally.</p>
<p>However, the latest events appear clearly sectarian despite originating in a simple commercial quarrel. In Upper Egypt, as elsewhere, chronic underdevelopment can dangerously accentuate sectarian tensions. Measures to restore sectarian harmony must therefore go hand in hand with socio-economic development.</p>
<p>The Prosecutor General’s report was finally published after considerable delay. Its commitment to the prosecution of the instigators, and the subsequent arrest of over 30 suspects, was encouraging. But its credibility was somewhat undermined by its claim that the riots and murders were not sectarian in nature. The final report by the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights has still not been published.</p>
<p>Claims that the arrests were not influenced by religious discrimination are credible. However claims that charges may be dropped against some of the most notorious alleged ringleaders, while not confirmed, are of concern. The Commission, together with Member State Embassies in Cairo, continues to monitor the follow-up to the events of January.</p>
<p>Sectarian violence feeds on poverty and ignorance. The Commission gives priority to a balance between economic modernisation and social measures (including poverty alleviation and the promotion of civil society and human rights). Upper Egypt is a target area for Community’s social and poverty alleviation measures.</p>
<p>The Commission is ready to assist with socio-economic development but the primary responsibility for restoring sectarian harmony lies with the Egyptian authorities and with the communities themselves.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0456"></a>

<p>The independent data protection authority in Greece has raised the issue of the religion of Greek citizens being recorded on their identity cards, saying it affects people’s private lives and can lead to discrimination against certain individuals.</p>
<p>In view of Article 13 of the Treaty, can the Commission say whether both the compulsory indication of religion currently applicable and the possible removal of this obligation, to be replaced by a voluntary indication, are compatible with the legal and political ‘acquis’ of the European Union? In which Member States is religion one of the items recorded on citizens’ identity cards?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>1. Article 8(1) of the European Parliament and Council Directive 95/46/EC, of 24 October 1995, on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, page 31), stipulates that “Member States shall prohibit the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, and the processing of data concerning health or sex life”. Consequently, the directive stipulates enhanced protection for certain types of data deemed to be sensitive. These include, among others, data on religious beliefs. The Member States are required to prohibit the processing of such data, given that this was considered, by the very nature of the information, to be a violation of the privacy of individuals.</p>
<p>Within this ban there are a number of exceptions, one of which may be the explicit consent of the individual concerned.</p>
<p>Moreover, processing sensitive information – assuming that it may be authorised under Article 8 of the directive – is still subject to the general legal conditions: Article 7a of Directive 95/46 stipulates that “Member States shall provide that personal data may be processed only if: a) the data subject has given his consent unambiguously …” and Article 6c of Directive 95/46 stipulates that personal data must be “adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and/or for which they are further processed”. Given that the purpose of an identity card is to identify the person by specifying details, particularly nationality, and since religion cannot in any case be considered as a key element identifying an individual, the indication of religion on an identity card, even with the explicit consent of the individual concerned, may be considered not to be “adequate, relevant and not excessive” in relation to the purpose of the identity card.</p>
<p>In the light of the above considerations, we find that indicating religion on the national identity card with the unambiguous consent of the holder may contravene Directive 95/46.</p>
<p>2. None of the other Member States which issues identity cards to their nationals makes any mention of religion on the cards.</p>
<p>3. The Greek identity card is a passport giving the holder the right to move freely and reside within the Member States. Indicating religion on the card may not be considered as an element required to identify the individual for the purposes of exercising the right to travel and reside in Europe.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0459"></a>

<p>It is always difficult to assess the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on employment inasmuch as the effects depend upon whether or not producers expect the change to be sustainable.</p>
<p>So, in the short term, the impact on economic activity may be limited, at least in part, to redirecting products initially intended for the internal market to external outlets. Such substitution phenomena are likely to predominate if the economic operators consider the depreciation of the euro to be temporary and easily reversible.</p>
<p>Moreover, the usual delays in obtaining disaggregated data per sector mean that it has not yet been possible to analyse the effects on import and export sectors. It is not yet possible, therefore, to give the honourable Member a precise answer for the period 1.04.1999 to 31.03.2000.</p>

<p>The euro was adopted by the 11 Member States of the euro zone as their single currency on 1 January 1999. At the time, the participating national currencies were fixed at the irrevocable conversion rates with the euro adopted in accordance with Article 123(4) of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>Using the euro as parallel currency is not an option anymore as the euro is the common currency and the national currencies are non-decimal sub-divisions of the euro. The proposal of having the euro as a parallel currency had been debated before the introduction of the euro, and it was rejected.</p>
<p>The euro is already the currency of the 11 Member States which form the economic and monetary union (EMU) area. Euro notes and coins will be introduced at the beginning of 2002.</p>
<p>Concerning transfers to depressed regions, there is no reason to think that the euro will increase the need for transfers. The economic benefits from the single currency (macroeconomic stability, lower interest rates, more efficient financial markets, lower transaction costs) will benefit depressed regions and thus reduce the need for transfer. In addition, within the Stability and Growth Pact, automatic stabilisers are able to work fully to counter an economic slowdown. Greater labour market flexibility should also enable countries to adjust their competitiveness relative to EMU partners if required.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Community regional policy has been designed to answer structural problems of lagging regions, and thus reduce the gaps in socio-economic development between them and the rest of the Community. Therefore, Structural Funds are clearly not an appropriate instrument to stabilise economic fluctuations. Furthermore, as developments in recent years confirm, there is no a priori reason to assume that depressed regions will be worst hit in case of asymmetric shocks.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0486"></a>

<p>The value of payments made in euros by businesses is ten times greater than the volume, principally due to the fact that many large businesses have switched to the European currency unit and because of the significant development of mergers and acquisitions (entailing share purchases in euros). The low level of use of the euro in transactions with national administrations must be put in perspective, then, especially as there is something of a time lag in the reactions of many indicators (one year, for instance, for income tax in most participating states).</p>
<p>The Commission nonetheless considers that it would be advisable to see a significant increase in the use of the euro by economic operators in 2001 in order to acclimatise them effectively for the new scale of values, thus preventing a psychological shake-up.

<p>In adopting the 1997 review report on the Common Position and Council Conclusions on « conflict prevention and resolution in Africa » of June 1997, the Council suggested that appropriate working groups of the Council should seek ways to combine the many reviews of matters related to conflict prevention into one single annual review document. The Commission has welcomed this suggestion. In close consultations with the Presidency and the Council Secretariat, the Commission will continue to contribute to such a combined report covering Union activities in conflict prevention in all its aspects.</p>
<p>Member States have up to now relied on Article 296 (ex-Article 223) of the EC Treaty in order to exempt trade in arms from the scope of application treaty rules, thereby preventing Community action. Instead arms trade is dealt with in the context of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. Full responsibility for the licensing of arms exports remains to national governments, but the code of conduct on arms exports provides a useful instrument for reporting and tracking trade in arms.</p>
<p>The second annual report on the application of the code will be drafted in the coming months. The Commission believes that experiences of the Member States from these first two years were positive. There are good grounds however for the continued strengthening of the Code and its implementation. The aim of the annual review process is to identify such potential improvements. Naturally any suggestions for amendments to the Code must win the support of all member states.</p>
<p>The Union has welcomed the recent adoption by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) of the optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The protocols reflect important international principles and represented an important step against exploitation of children. They will become important tools for the protection of children, both in conflict situations and in peacetime.</p>

<p>Regarding the revision of the agricultural regulations based on the POSEICAN programme, to which the honourable Member refers, the Commission expects to address the proposals to the Council in the autumn of 2000.</p>
<p>More generally, the Commission is actively making preparations for the implementation of its report dated 14 March 2000 (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2000&amp;nu_doc=0147">COM(2000)147</a> final). It plans to undertake an initial raft of measures this year. In some areas, these are measures within its own area of competence, such as the amendment of guidelines on state aid to regional development, which will most probably be dealt with at the beginning of July. In other instances, these are Council proposals, as in the agricultural sector, which has already been mentioned, or the areas of tax and customs. Compliance with this programme also depends, however, on the national and regional authorities who, in some cases, still have to send the Commission all the information needed to draw up the proposals.</p>
<p>As for the impact on the budget, the Commission recommends that the honourable Member refers to the conclusions of the Commission report dated 14 March 2000, stipulating that “special attention shall be paid to Commission proposals with impact on the budget in accordance with the terms of Article 299(2), under the financial perspectives adopted in the interinstitutional agreement of 6 May 1999”.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0469"></a>

At the same time, there is confusion over the release of the third instalment of State aid as well as over the assistance which Olympic Airways will need for the move to Spata Airport.

<p>The Commission’s present action with regard to Olympic Airways is governed by its Decision on 14 August 1998, whereby it authorised state aid to be disbursed to this company subject to compliance with a variety of conditions. In particular, the firm’s economic and financial recovery in the medium term was one of the key conditions. It was also explicitly stipulated that no further public aid could be provided in future.</p>
<p>The Commission brought independent consultants in to assess the precise position of Olympic Airways on the basis of the information regularly forwarded by the Greek authorities under the ‘monitoring’ procedure resulting from the above-mentioned decision. In the same way, it investigated the question of financial compensation relating to the transfer of Olympic Airways’ activities from Hellenikon Airport to Spata Airport.</p>

<p>Concerning a European Environmental Technical Bureau (EETB) proposals and strategy papers have been presented at various levels within the Commission by EEB since 1997. An official application has, however, not been presented until today.</p>
<p>The Commission already informed EEB in 1998 that the Commission’s budget line was unable to sustain the EETB. In various meetings in 1999, the Commission repeatedly explained to EEB representatives to possibly propose an alternative funding structure. No other funding options were ever provided by EEB.</p>
<p>EEB has not broken off its cooperation with the Community (for instance, EEB did not withdraw its request for subsidy for 2000); EEB only suspended its membership from the European committee for standardisation (CEN) Strategic Advisory Board on the Environment (SABE).</p>
<p>The European Environmental Bureau (EEB) has been funded under the Action Programme promoting European environmental non-governmental organisation (NGOs) (Council Decision 97/872(EC of 16.12.97) since its outset in January 1998. The aim of the financial contributions under this Programme is to provide support towards the costs environmental NGOs have in carrying out their annual work.</p>
<p>The total amount available for the whole Programme Period (1 January 1998 to 31 December 2001) is EUR 10.6 million, which gives about EUR 2.6 million to allocate each year. In 1999, the EEB was granted a contribution of EUR 580,000, which represented 22% of the total budget for that year (EUR 2 610 273). This makes them by far the biggest beneficiary under this Programme.</p>
<p>The following CEN standards in the field of packaging have been adopted:</p>
<p>EN 13427, Requirements for the use of European Standards in the field of packaging and packaging waste (the ‘umbrella’ or guidance document)</p>
<p>EN 13428, Requirements specific to manufacturing and composition - Prevention by source reduction</p>
<p>EN 13430, Requirements for packaging recoverable by material recycling</p>
<p>EN 13431 Requirements for packaging recoverable in the form of energy recovery, including specification of minimum interior calorific</p>
<p>EN 13432 Requirements for packaging recoverable through composting and biodegradation - Test scheme and evaluation criteria for the final acceptance of packaging …/…</p>
<p>In order for the standards to become harmonised standards in the sense of Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste, the reference numbers of these standards must be published in the Official Journal and the standards must be transposed by national standards.</p>
<p>Article 9.2 of Directive 94/62/EC states that, if a Member State or the Commission is of the opinion that the standards are not in line with the essential requirements of the Directive, they shall bring the matter before the Committee set up by Directive 98/34/EC giving the reasons therefore. This Committee shall deliver an opinion without delay.</p>

<p>Council Regulation (EC) 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund and Council Regulation (EC) 1268/1999 of 21 June 1999 on Community support for pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development (SAPARD) foresee in the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe in the pre-accession period both a mid-term and a final evaluation in addition to the ex-ante evaluations of the programmes. The Member States and the applicant countries shall submit annual progress reports, enabling the Commission to follow closely the situation in rural areas and to monitor the implementation of the programme and on this base to consider at that time the most appropriate procedures.</p>
<p>The Commission is now examining the programmes submitted by the Member States as well as the SAPARD programmes prepared by the applicant Countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Commission would stress the following points: as the continuation of farming in rural areas is essential, one of the measures decided by the Council on the basis of the proposal of the Commission is an important increase of the maximum amount of aid for the setting up of young farmers (by 67% if both the setting up premium and interest subsidy on offer are fully used). Moreover they can benefit from higher aid intensities for investment undertaken on their holdings.</p>
<p>In the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the same unfavourable trends (like ageing of population and farmers and negative migration) can be observed. This calls for an integrated approach embracing economic, social and environmental aspects of rural areas. The pre-accession strategy of the Community and especially the PHARE and SAPARD instruments should contribute to tackling these issues.</p>
<p>As the Community support under SAPARD – besides its first objective which is contributing to the implementation of the acquis communautaire concerning the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and related policies – relates in particular to solving priority and specific problems for the sustainable adaptation of the agricultural sector and rural area in the applicant countries, most of them have proposed some specific provisions to back up family farms and young farmers, although these provisions do not apply generally.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0476"></a>

<p>The inhabitants of the Cyclades islands are faced with tremendous problems caused by severe disruption to ferry services. The now burgeoning problems began when a large ferry company, the Minoan Flying Dolphins, took over six other, mainly conventional ferry companies through mergers and buyouts. The company proceeded to withdraw the big conventional ships from service and change the timetables, using profitability alone as its yardstick, which has caused severe problems in terms of bringing supplies to the islands, long delays, arbitrary alterations, and the amalgamation and cancellation of services with far-reaching repercussions for travellers and the islands.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that a monopoly with a dominant position has been formed and that ferry services to the Cyclades have already been cut by 30% during the first quarter of 2000 compared with 1999, and bearing in mind the social aspect of ferry services, what measures will the Commission take in the context of competition policy - ahead of the tourist season and the significant increase in passenger and commercial traffic - to put an end to this dominant monopoly which is fraught with danger for the economic development of the island regions and infringes basic civil rights such as the right to high-quality, safe transport services which operate freely and without hindrance?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In December 1998 the Commission opened proceedings against FIFA on the issues related to its international transfer system that were not assessed by the Court of Justice in the Bosman ruling. An oral hearing took place in June 1999.

<p>As the Member of the Commission in charge of Competion stated to the European sporting federations on 17 April 2000, these proceedings are following their normal course.</p>

On 19 January 2000 Mr T. Muivah, secretary-general of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN), was arrested in Thailand as he was travelling to the Netherlands to participate in negotiations with the Indian Prime Minister’s representative. He was charged with possession of false travel documents.

<p>The Commission fully shares the views expressed by the honourable Member.</p>
<p>An internal market also requires a coherent common external policy. The decision of Member States to conclude individual bilateral agreements with the United States fragments the internal market. Moreover, it does not create a truly open and level playing field between the Community and the United States in air transport. Finally, the Commission takes the position that, with the adoption of the third package (internal air transport market), the conclusion of such agreements now falls under the competence of the Community and is no longer a matter that can be dealt with by individual Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission is of the opinion that a common position is required as regards the United States. Thus it has proposed to conclude a Transatlantic Common Aviation Area between the Community and the United States which not only ensures full and mutual access to each other’s market, but also introduces all the necessary requirements to ensure a level playing field (convergence on regulatory issues, effective application of competition laws and also safety, security, environmental and social standards).</p>
<p>The implementation of such an agreement would benefit Community and United States economic interests, industry, workers, and most importantly of all, the consumers.</p>
<p>In view of the reluctance of Member States to achieve this common position, the Commission has initiated an infringement procedure against all Member States that have concluded such individual bilateral agreements after the acceptance of the internal market legislation. Against eight Member States this procedure has been completed.

<p>What measures will the Commission take to guarantee producers’ incomes and make the responsible agencies and their inspections effective, defining the characteristic features of genetically modified seeds and the methods of investigation in order to eliminate any suspicion of such practices and to protect the environment, consumers and farmers from the irresponsibility of the companies which are exploiting the lack of inspection?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>No genetically modified cotton varieties have as yet received authorisation for the placing on the market in the community under Part C of Council Directive 90/220/EEC of 23 April 1990 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms. Two applications, concerning the placing on the market of insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant cotton, are currently pending approval in the authorisation procedure under the Directive.</p>
<p>Under current Community law, the placing on the market, including the import, of seeds consisting of, or containing genetically modified material which has not been authorised in the Community under Council Directive 90/220/EEC or under equivalent product specific Community provisions is prohibited. This applies also to seed lots of conventional varieties that contain impurities of unauthorised genetically modified material.</p>
<p>As indicated in position 77 of the Annex to the Commission’s White Paper on Food Safety, the Commission has the intention to adopt, under the existing Community seed legislation, standards for purity concerning the adventitious presence of genetically modified seeds authorised in the Community as well as specific labelling requirements for seeds in respect of genetically modified material. This would ensure that these standards and labelling requirements are integrated in the official seed certification procedure established for seeds produced in the Community in Directive 69/208/EEC for cotton. The same measures would also be included in the seed equivalence regime governing the requirements for seeds imported into the Community as established on the basis of the same Directive for cotton.</p>
<p>Until then, the competent authorities of the Member States, under their general obligation to monitor compliance with Community law, have to assess the risk of the possible presence of unauthorised genetically modified material and, in case of suspicion, to carry out appropriate testing and follow-up action.</p>
<p>Member States can, in addition to the mandatory checks required under the relevant Community provisions, unilaterally include any other checks for compliance with Community law in the procedures applicable to imports from third countries and take the appropriate action in case of findings confirming non-compliance with Community law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0508"></a>

<p>With regard to the Framework Strategy, the aim is to co-ordinate all the different initiatives and programmes that are funded through different specific budget headings under a single umbrella.

Such actions will include networking, awareness raising, analysis and assessment tools, monitoring, reporting and evaluation.</p>
<p>The Commission would, once again, reiterate its commitment in pursuing the promotion of gender equality either by adjusting its policies (gender mainstreaming) and/or by implementing concrete actions designed to improve the situation of women in society (specific actions).</p>

<p>Speaking before the European Parliament’s Committee on Constitutional Affairs on 26 May, the Ombudsman publicly complained about the problems he had encountered in accessing documents concerning the Thessaloniki underground. In particular he said that he could not give any assurances to the European Parliament and the citizens of Europe that the investigation he was conducting would reveal the truth, given that the five oral depositions he had taken from the officials involved in the affair had clearly been made in the name - and at the prompting - of the administration and that the officials were bound by the obligation of professional secrecy.</p>

Are Commission officials who refuse to speak above the laws and the Treaties, and what lies behind the ‘orchestrated’ depositions of the Commission officials, given that their conduct suggests that there has been an intervention in defiance of Community laws? Does the President of the Commission intend to take measures to ensure access to all the relevant documents, to hold a hearing of the Commissioners and to allow depositions to be taken from officials without any restrictions so that the Ombudsman can complete his investigations unimpeded into the complaint that has been made on the basis of Article 195 (formerly 138e) of the EC Treaty?</p>

<p>The Commission would like to assure the honourable Member that contrary to his allegations, the Commission and its officials have cooperated fully with the ombudsman in his examination of the complaint on the Thessaloniki metro case.</p>
<p>The officials did in fact extensively reply to all the questions put to them by the Ombudsman and his services and provided access to all documents in their files, after receiving the necessary authorisations by the third parties and Member States concerned, in full compliance with the rules currently in force and applicable in such cases. The officials concerned, far from reacting in a manner dismissive of their obligations under the Treaty and relevant secondary legislation, have indeed acted in a strict observance of the rules imposed on them. This fact is expressly acknowledged by the Ombudsman himself in the note he presented to the Parliament’s Committee on Constitutional Affairs held in Brussels on the 24 and 25 May 2000.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to note that the comments made by the honourable Member do not seem to reflect accurately the opinion expressed by the Ombudsman himself on this case and on the Commission services collaboration with him and his services. It is also significant in this respect that he considers that he will be able to complete his examination of this case in a satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>The Commission would also like to inform the honourable Member that its services have finalised the examination of the second complaint on this case and is actually considering the next steps to be taken. As regards the Hellenic authorities request that the project of the Thessaloniki metro be cofinanced by Community support framework (csf) 3, it is currently under consideration by the Commission.

<p>Far too small a proportion of plastic waste is recovered or recycled in Western Europe. Out of the total of 30 m tonnes of plastic contained in articles manufactured in 1998, only one tonne was recycled, and 4.3 million tonnes of the plastic waste collected was burnt. The Association of Plastics Manufacturers in Europe (APME) and the Member States with the lowest recovery/recycling rates argue that the optimum recovery rate has now been achieved for plastic packaging and that increased recovery will not yield either commercial or environmental benefits. Yet purchasers of plastics take the view that demand for recovered plastic has risen, so that it is now in short supply. From a lifecycle perspective, is it better that plastic waste be reused as a material or used as an energy source?</p>

<p>The Commission agrees that the material recycling of plastic waste is a problem which has not yet found satisfactory solutions within the Community. There are several reasons for this situation, among them the number of different types of plastic and the cost of recycling.</p>
<p>The Community Waste Management Strategy of 1996 provides, in principle, for a preference to material recycling with regard to the incineration of waste with energy recovery, where environmentally sound. The Commission sees no reason not to apply this general approach to plastic waste. The incineration of plastic waste has a number of disadvantages which must be taken into consideration, such as emissions, residuals from the incineration process, the necessity to construct incinerators and to provide a continuous flow of waste inputs over a long period of time (20 to 30 years).</p>
<p>While the Commission therefore does not see a need to change its strategy on waste management, which generally gives preference to material recycling, it does not intend, at this stage, to take specific legislative measures regarding the material recycling of plastic waste. Indeed, it is up to the markets to develop techniques for material recycling and to make them environmentally and economically viable.
