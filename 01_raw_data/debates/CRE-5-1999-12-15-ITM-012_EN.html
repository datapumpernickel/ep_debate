<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Murphy (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – I would like to commend this second reading to the House. It is very much about prosperity, and about creating jobs in the European Union, particularly for our small and medium-sized enterprises, by creating a better business climate for those businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Paradoxically, I do not want this report to be used. In fact I would like to see it go out of fashion very quickly indeed. This sort of Directive should be changing the climate of our business economy, away from late payment to prompt payment. We actually want a culture in this European Union, in our single market, of prompt payment, not late payment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to place on record a number of thanks before I address the substance of our second reading: thanks to Parliament's services for working so quickly on this report; to the Commission for all its support; and to the Finnish Presidency for the courteous and careful advice it has given through this process. Thanks also to colleagues on the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy with whom I have worked very closely, several of whom I see here in this Chamber this evening. In particular, thanks to UEAPME who are very much the voice of small businesses in the European Union and who have given wholehearted support to this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">One further vote of thanks is also due, and that is actually to a ghost of this Chamber: that is, to my former colleague and good friend Lyndon Harrison, who was rapporteur at first reading, now Lord Harrison of Chester. It was Lyndon Harrison who, as rapporteur on 16 September 1998, said to this House: "It is time to outlaw cheating practices and give small and medium-sized enterprises the confidence to go boldly into the single European market knowing that they will be paid on time and in full." I could not agree more.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, from our position as a Parliament, that the Council's common position was a disappointment – especially when you consider that we share the same aim. Yet because we share the same aim, and because there is goodwill on both sides, I am confident that we will have an effective and efficient directive that will eventually be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is important to point out that there are large areas of difference between us. These include the rate of statutory interest to be charged when a late payment occurs; the length of the trigger period for interest if no contract has actually stipulated a payment period; retention of title in the course of late payment; the role of the public sector and the treatment of public procurement; and compensation claims arising from late payment. All these areas are very difficult and could cause problems between Parliament and Council. Nevertheless, it is my belief that they are integral to our aim and are broadly safe and sound, and will help create a better business climate for small and medium-sized enterprises as they develop to realise their full potential within the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Shortly after I was elected to this House, Mr President, one of my first pleasurable duties was to bring to the Parliament representatives from Dudley Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which was then in my constituency. They came to a hearing on late payments that was being organised in the Parliament and gave some very good expert advice, recognising that we had problems with late payment in the single market. Those problems have actually got worse, which is why we currently have a directive and a proposal before us this evening. The importance of this directive is that it will help us address that business climate, to have a cultural change so that we move away from late payment to prompt payment as the norm within the European single market and not, as it currently is, the other way around.</p>
<p class="contents">The small and medium-sized enterprises of the European Union are watching very closely to see how we react to this particular proposal and the common position. They will expect from this House tomorrow a strong vote backing the vote that was carried in the Industry Committee unanimously on Monday of this week. With those opening remarks, Mr President, I would commend our position to you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are being called upon to deal with a most serious matter. I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Murphy, for the excellent spirit of cooperation which we had and to congratulate the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy for its full and unanimous support for our joint effort. We must all, Parliament, Commission and Council, reflect on the responsibilities which face us. We must bear in mind that one in four SMEs which goes bankrupt does so because of late payments. We must be aware of the fact that 450 000 workers have lost their jobs at a time when the main problem facing the European Union is how to combat unemployment. We must bear in mind that every citizen in the European Union owes 65 euros due to late payments. We must bear in mind that we owe it to this society and to the entrepreneurial spirit of the European Union to give them the chance to develop on a sound basis. We must also understand that we cannot permit the unfair practice whereby companies or even the public sector, which is the worst payer there is in the European Union, are financed free of charge, thereby condemning thousands of enterprises to death, stagnation or entrepreneurial castration.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are now being called upon to do is to restore conditions of healthy competition. We do not intend to protect anyone. However, we do intend to set up a framework of fair practices, to try and lay down rules of healthy competition so that we can all use our abilities and skills to face the future with better prospects. I want us all to understand that several more thousand jobs are at stake if we back-pedal on this report which we are being called to vote upon. I received a call today from an organisation representing thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises to say that they wished to congratulate the European Parliament on behalf of European business people. That is precisely what we are waiting for here. That is precisely what we are attempting to do and I call on the European Parliament, where we have the honour of sitting, to vote by a large majority in favour of the text tomorrow, I call on the Commission to do justice to the text which we give it during its evaluation and, above all, I call on the Council to understand that we cannot proclaim left, right and centre that we are above the law, that we cannot proclaim left, right and centre that we are sensitive to the issue of job creation, that we cannot proclaim left, right and centre that small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the economy and, at the same time, refuse to vote in favour of and adopt the positions of this European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to achieve completion, globalisation needs clear, simple and effective rules which, until now, our businesses and our craft industries have not been able to take advantage of in an area as important as commercial transactions. </p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s position, which was presented at second reading, is still weak on this point and, in particular, it does not shield small and medium-sized businesses and craft industries from the inefficiency of public machinery and from the excessive power of big businesses. The amendments that Parliament has tabled are intended to fill this serious gap and have an ambitious objective: the creation of a legislative structure which, while careful not to create pointless bureaucratic complications, will allow the sizeable productive forces of the Union to flourish in the internal market, thereby facilitating their activities on the global market too. </p>
<p class="contents">The most significant innovations we wish to introduce are the following: careful consideration of the consequences of late payment for perishable foods; recognition of the right to demand compensation for costs incurred from debt collection too; retention of title clauses by the vendor; to ensure that an enforceable title can be obtained normally within 60 days of the lodging of the creditor’s action; and finally, greater transparency in the relationship between the contracting authority and the contractor, and also in a subcontractual relationship. This group of amendments may mark the beginning of a real cultural change in the current relationship between debtor and creditor. </p>
<p class="contents">My final observation is of a purely political nature. In the last few days there has been a lot of talk about the role and future of the Community institutions, but I would like to remind you that the credibility of a structure such as Parliament or the Council is closely linked to its ability to resolve the problems that trouble citizens in their everyday life, or to take positive action on these matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although we are a small House tonight this is a terribly important subject. It cannot be said too often that small businesses do not have deep pockets and so have greater difficulty riding out cash-flow crises than bigger ones. They often have to wait for money to come in before paying their own suppliers. If payments are delayed it has a knock-on effect. Sometimes they are dependent on one large customer. If this client delays or defaults on payments, that can mean the equivalent of a whole month's work lost, with potentially catastrophic effects. Worse still there is often no real redress. Though there is a statutory right, for example in the United Kingdom, to impose interest on late payments, there is practically no way to enforce this and court action is impractical to recover small debts. We need to have some form of enforcement machinery. There is also the difficulty of different payment terms across the European Union – 30 days in some places, 90 in others. The compromise of 60 days seems to me a sensible arrangement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is grand that the Commission has put its shoulder behind the wheel of speeding up commercial payments but it is far from the case that the Commission is beyond reproach itself. The Ombudsman’s report highlighted many instances of late payments to suppliers by the Commission. This point was addressed in the communication from Commissioner Liikanen and another concerning time limits. I am glad that the Commission is seeking to improve its own procedures to reduce late payments as I would like to see it put its house in order. I had a letter from a distinguished academic the other day pointing out that persons coming to give reports are often kept waiting for their expenses money for several months. This is unacceptable. We must make sure that the Commission does as well as it expects others to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it also transpired that the file of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs had been passed on to the Industry Committee, then I felt completely orphaned, but the coordinator and the new EPP shadow rapporteur have adopted me in the Industry Committee for a short while, which made up for a lot of things and for which I would like to express my thanks to both. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a word of thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Murphy, who has done a sterling job.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the common position is better than the original proposal. The Industry Committee, however, has incorporated a few more amendments and I hope that they can be conciliated swiftly because the SMEs are desperate for the entry into effect of this directive, but quality should come before speed. The report meets with my full approval. I still have questions but only with regard to the bill of exchange, Amendment No 18. I am aware that the bill of exchange is used in one of our Member States as a means to counter excessive payments. However, I do think that the bill of exchange is too strict an instrument. It is an unconditional order to pay a certain sum on a certain day and even if there are serious reasons for challenging the claim, one cannot refer to them as the debtor. If the bill also needs to be guaranteed and accepted by a bank, then this becomes an expensive business. Personally, I hold the opinion that we should confine ourselves to judicial review on account of unreasonable terms. I would like to know the Commissioner’s opinion regarding this Amendment No 18. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, first of all I want to thank you. A few parliamentarians will know the file very well. The Commission's proposal for a directive on late payments contains a package of measures to combat late payment in commercial transactions in the European Community. The directive applies to late payment between all enterprises including the public sector. It provides the legal framework to deter late payers from paying late or from imposing unduly long payment periods on their partners. Moreover, it renders the procedures for recovering debts quicker and more efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position agreed by the Council in July of this year has cut six operational articles of our proposal down to two. I am conscious of the fact that it is not easy for Member States to agree to changes in their legislation. However, the Commission has indicated that it would like to see a more ambitious approach to late payment. Without ambitious provisions, the directive will not reach its objective. I therefore welcome the interest Parliament has taken in our proposal and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Murphy, and the coordinators of the other political groups, on their excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the proposed amendments, I welcome most of them as they revive many of the Commission's original proposals and try to correct deficiencies in the common position. In this respect the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 to 17, 19, 21, 22, 24 and 26. There are other amendments where the Commission agrees with most of the substance but would prefer to reformulate them. This is the case with Amendments Nos 6, 20 and 25. In particular we would like to reduce the number of reports that the Commission is being asked to produce in Amendment No 25. It is better to use that time to pay bills more quickly, as was said by Mr MacCormick.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there are a very few amendments which the Commission cannot accept for specific reasons, and these are Amendments Nos 2, 18 and 23. Mrs Thyssen has just spoken about Amendment No 18. We do not think that Amendment No 18, concerning a debtor’s obligation to furnish a bill of exchange in the case of a long contractual payment period has a chance of being accepted by the Council. In fact it seems that this amendment is inspired by the law of one Member State and that the proposed rule has not worked well so far in that state. As a result, 15 Member States have opposed the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also prefer not to modify Article 4 on the duration of recovery procedures. The discussion in the Council was a difficult one. We believe that the result is satisfactory. Reducing the duration from 90 to 60 days, as proposed in Amendment No 23, would have the consequence of causing the Council to revert to the old version of the Commission proposal and exclude the period needed by the debtor for his defence. This would add some 30 days for most countries and the result would be similar to the one we now have.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, the Commission expects that this proposal will bring significant benefits to businesses, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises. Reducing late payment will improve businesses' cash flow. It will also reduce financing costs caused by being paid late and the heavy administrative cost of pursuing debts.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that early next year we can come back to the broader issues of enterprise policy. We need a new enterprise policy atmosphere in Europe and an environment where creating small and medium-sized enterprises will be easier and cheaper, and will be encouraged. That is the only chance for Europe to guarantee that our unemployment figures, which are too high, will be reduced. We need a lively, growing SME sector. Let this proposal be one part of this new approach.</p>
