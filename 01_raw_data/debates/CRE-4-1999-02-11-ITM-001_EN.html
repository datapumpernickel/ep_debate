<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Quisthoudt‐Rowohl </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, back in 1996, Israel became the first non‐European country to be fully involved in the framework programme for research and technological development, and it remains the only non‐European participant. The basis of this agreement is that research cooperation is fundamentally international in character and that it makes no sense to limit it to the territory of the EU if it would benefit both parties and if there are no other political objections. Israel pays and is treated like a Member State. The other states' contributions are not reduced, which means that the funding of the programme as a whole is topped up as a result of Israeli participation.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the fourth framework programme, which has been implemented since 1994, the number of calls for tenders for the various programmes was higher in 1995 and 1996 than at the end of the programme period. Although Israel, anticipating the conclusion of the agreement, began to contribute financially and submitted tenders, subject to conclusion, in 1996, the bulk of the funds for many programmes had already been allocated by that time. That is why Israel is very interested in full integration into the fifth framework programme from the outset. We all know that the start of a multiannual programme is an important phase, and so for sheer reasons of time my first plea to the House is that we approve this agreement today.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is, of course, essential to take account of the general political context too, even in the case of a technical agreement. Let me say the following on that: first of all, there are many strong links between Israel and the European Union. The value of trade between us is twice as high as that of Israel's trade with the United States. It is important that the Union's relations with the Middle East and its influence in that region remain steady and strong. This agreement is one of many instruments that govern these relations and with which Parliament will deal in greater detail in March. I believe that EU‐Israeli relations in general are so stable that they can withstand the difference, important though it admittedly is, in our respective assessments of the progress achieved in the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">And now my second point: even during the fourth framework programme, we were pressing for Palestinian research groups and companies to work with us and to be involved in projects. This agreement is therefore an indirect means of promoting mutual understanding. We shall insist that this cooperation be intensified, and when we come to review the programme here in Parliament we shall check that this is actually happening.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is this: if the agreement is implemented, information networks will be set up under Article 6. The Israeli side has expressed the wish to participate more fully in future evaluation measures. I would ask the European Parliament to support that wish.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth point I wish to make is that, in order to reinforce this cooperation and to incorporate it into the same framework as the other agreements and cooperative projects, we should ensure that regular contacts are established between the European Parliament and the Knesset, so that the research cooperation can be monitored and promoted at parliamentary level.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the groups in this House believe that, by approving the agreement and not suspending it, we would be intervening in the internal political debate in Israel, since as we all know, a general election is about to be called there. Let me say to you that our failure to approve the agreement today would constitute far more serious interference in Israel's domestic politics, and we have no right to exert heavy pressure on foreign governments to alter their domestic policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as your rapporteur I should like to make the following comment: relations between the Commission and Parliament are somewhat strained at the present time. For that reason it is my sincere wish, Commissioner, and not just a pious hope, that in future negotiations the Commission will provide Parliament with comprehensive information from the very start and keep it abreast of the latest developments in the negotiating process.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Stockmann </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group endorses the report and very largely agrees with what the rapporteur, Mrs Quisthoudt‐Rowohl, has said. The Agreement on Scientific and Technical Cooperation between the European Community and the State of Israel allows us to build on past successes, which began in 1996, at least as far as the present high level of cooperation is concerned. At that time Israel, with the status of an associated state, was allowed to take part in all non‐nuclear programmes under the fourth framework programme for research and technological development.</p>
<p class="contents">In a period of only three years, 369 joint projects, costing a total of ECU 53 million, have been successfully implemented. However, the added value deriving from cooperative arrangements is far greater than that. In fact, some 1 000 joint applications have been received. The continuation of this cooperation in the fifth framework programme is in the interests of both sides. Our own interest lies not only in the high quality of Israeli research, but also the emerging adoption of European processes and standards and the future development of more marketing opportunities in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel, for its part, has an interest in being involved in the discussion on strategic developments in the research field which Israel alone cannot achieve. Moreover, high‐tech products are the only means whereby Israel's balance of trade deficit, like ours, can be reduced. This cooperation in our mutual interest is therefore a long‐term proposition. That is why it is natural that not only Israel but also our Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy and the great majority of my group favour the smoothest possible transition from the fourth to the fifth framework programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Postponement of our decision for whatever reason would mean, as has already been explained, that the conference of foreign ministers on 22 February could not ratify the agreement, as a result of which Israel would be unable to take part in the first round of tendering, which will take place in March, and would be placed at a financial disadvantage, as happened in the fourth framework R&amp;D programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with its gross domestic product, Israel will contribute to the success of the fifth framework programme for research and technological development by making an annual commitment of around EUR 30 million. Various members of our committee have had the opportunity to see at first hand the high quality of joint EU‐Israeli research. At our insistence, Palestinian companies and research establishments were also involved in joint projects. It is true that even greater efforts could be made in this direction, as my honourable colleague said, and indeed we are demanding progress here.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own personal opinion, further research cooperation can help in the long run to stabilise the peace process, which, it has to be said, is seriously deadlocked. The aims of science are full understanding and effective communication. Its universal nature also offers a matrix for resolving conflicts that arise from sectional interests. Conversely, however, scientific cooperation can only flourish in the long term in a peaceful environment. Even if the procedure applied here is that of a simple hearing, I would ask the House to approve the report.</p>

We are delighted at Israel's participation in the Community's research programmes up to now, and we look forward to the results of the cooperation between the European Union and the State of Israel in connection with the fifth framework programme. Israel was, of course, largely created by immigrants, refugees and individuals with a very strong character, who have been able to endure dictatorships and oppression and who in many cases have an extremely high standard of education to contribute. This has been reflected in the research programmes. What is being made available here for the cooperation between the European Union and the State of Israel is therefore a considerable mass of talent with high levels of education, competence and diligence.</p>
<p class="contents">We look forward to the cooperation and hope that the report can be implemented as soon as possible.</p>

However, we cannot approve it at this stage, because we – the European Union and the European Parliament – would be being used by a head of state who has shown total disregard for the peace agreements and for the process of promoting peaceful coexistence in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to be manipulated by a head of state whose actions are almost Nazi‐like: he demonstrates nothing but racist disdain for the Palestinian people in general. As a result, and for that reason alone, we believe that it would be better to suspend the application of this agreement. We must hope that, after the elections, we will see the arrival of a new government whose behaviour and positive attitude towards coexistence, the United Nations resolutions, the Oslo Agreements and the Wye Plantation Agreements show that guarantees do exist.</p>
<p class="contents">We understand the situation in the region and believe that both parties should receive equal treatment. In order to do so, it would be more appropriate if, instead of establishing cooperation between Palestinian firms and universities in Israel, the European Parliament itself implemented an agreement with the Palestinian people, its research organisations, its university and its firms. This would be more fitting in that since the end of the Second World War – when the UN was set up – the question of consolidating the Palestinian state through a UN resolution has remained unresolved. By doing so, the European Union would be giving equivalent, equidistant and equal treatment to both parties involved in the conflict, thereby showing that it does not allow itself to be swayed by either side.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, when it comes to the vote on this report, our group will ask that it be referred back to committee so that it might indeed be approved under better circumstances.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Holm </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, this report on the research agreement between the EU and Israel is no simple matter. I can go along with part of what Mr Marset Campos said here, namely that this report, which we had thought would support the peace process, could just as easily be seen as a threat to that process if these issues are used to the wrong ends and in the political arena. As far as the content of this agreement is concerned, those parts of the programme that relate to nuclear safety and fusion are, of course, excluded. These areas are not included in this research agreement, a fact which I am pleased about. At the same time, however, I am concerned, because we need to be aware of the fact that Israel has nuclear weapons, even though the country denies this. I am a little anxious that, in spite of everything, funds will sneak in from other programmes precisely for use in research on nuclear fusion and nuclear activity. This is something that I simply cannot support.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, mention also needs to be made of Mordechai Vanunu, the Israeli researcher who disclosed details about nuclear weapons and nuclear energy research in Israel. It will soon be ten years since he was imprisoned. It would now be appropriate for Israel to release him as quickly as possible. There was an application for his release, but that has now been rejected. I would like to ask Mrs Cresson what steps the Commission is taking to seek Mr Vanunu's release. Openness is perhaps not Commissioner Cresson's strong point, but I would nevertheless like to appeal for efforts to be made to prevail on Israel to release Mr Vanunu.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several other parts of this research project which I do not, perhaps, view as positively as the rapporteur does. One such area is space research. We Greens do not think that the EU should take part in space research. We are therefore also against cooperation between the EU and Israel in this field. We are just as reluctant for such research to be conducted in the EU as we are for it to be conducted within the framework of agreements with other countries.</p>

Renewing a link between Israel and the European Union in the middle of an electoral period could be looked on, at least locally, as support for the political powers. It could also facilitate the re‐election of the rabble‐rousers and those behind the disastrous situation in which the peace process now finds itself. That would indeed be absolutely deplorable. It is also why some countries have still not ratified the association agreement with the State of Israel. However, in this case, the situation is entirely different.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth giving more consideration to continuing scientific and technical cooperation, especially as several Palestinian companies and universities are involved in this agreement. I am thinking, in particular, of Al Qods, the University of Jerusalem, and the University of Bethlehem. They will benefit from participating in it and this is also something that we must monitor.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, penalising universities or the high technology sector – which, on the whole, are avid supporters of peace – would probably amount to targeting the wrong enemy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, an agreement such as this is not only an agreement, or a matter of charity; it is also – and this must be pointed out – a means of returning to prosperity through exchanges. This all means that there are varying opinions within the Group of the European Radical Alliance. Many of us will perhaps abstain or will, in any case, either want to vote in favour or be tempted to do so.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Plooij‐van Gorsel </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Quisthoudt on her excellent report and the speech she has just given. I entirely agree with her, and my group will also be supporting her position. In an increasingly global economy and with growing competition, cooperation between European partners in the fields of research and technology is no longer enough. Scientific and technological cooperation between the European Union and third countries and the involvement of third countries in the framework programme help to promote knowledge and technology transfers and innovation in the European Union, which is good for employment here and helps to strengthen the links between people in the partner countries and the Union. Such cooperation can also help to find solutions to the trade disputes that the Union sometimes has with its partners.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Group is therefore very much in favour of continuing scientific and technological cooperation with Israel. However, we do not want it to use participation in the framework programme as a political instrument in the Middle East. There is no reason to block aid to its neighbours. The Union has good relations with those countries too, and our aid to the Palestinians in particular is not producing the hoped‐for economic development in the region because Israel sometimes frustrates our aid programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">My group therefore hopes and expects that if Parliament delivers a positive opinion on scientific and technological cooperation, Israel will clean up its act. I am hoping to see some positive developments in the Middle East.</p>

We would nevertheless like to take advantage of this debate in order to express our concern.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned because, although a large proportion of Israeli research is dedicated to the civilian sector, another part of it – for which we do not have exact figures – involves the military sector. With this in mind, it is impossible to forget the plane crash involving a plane full of chemical and bacteriological weapons, which claimed so many victims in the Netherlands. That brings us to a question I raised in this very House on an article in <span class="italic">The Sunday Times</span> , which I actually thought was a hoax. The article claimed that Israeli researchers had tried to isolate genes specific to Arabs in order to be able to use bacteriological weapons against them.</p>
<p class="contents">I did not receive an answer to this question, but in the Israeli press, the daily newspapers <span class="italic">Haretz</span> and <span class="italic">Maariv</span> also published the story, and it has not yet been denied. We could therefore be dealing with the most extreme and most abominable type of racism ever experienced.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, we would like to be convinced that these cooperation agreements are not going to contribute to such extremely dangerous research. We are in favour of the security of the State of Israel, and we are aware of the threats that have hung over this young nation. However, Israel must understand the desire of the Palestinians to regain their land and their sovereignty. Therefore, we would like Europe to do everything possible to ensure that a definitive peace agreement, based on the recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people, is finally reached. That is the necessary condition for peace in the region.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Swoboda </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, it has certainly emerged from the statements on behalf of the various groups that this is not a purely technical agreement but that there are many political aspects involved, a point which the rapporteur made perfectly clear too. It is true that there have been voices in all the groups, including the group to which I belong, which have spoken against the conclusion of such an agreement at the present time. However, it is my experience of foreign policy more than anything else which makes me think that the reasons against concluding the agreement are far more tenuous than those in favour of concluding it.</p>
<p class="contents">Whenever anyone says that we need a few good cards in our hand to engage in diplomacy and that such agreements should be used for that purpose, I can certainly endorse that argument. But if we in the European Union want to make our voice heard more clearly in Israel, which we do, and if we want to have more influence on the decisions taken by the State of Israel, we have no option but to approve this agreement. We would forfeit any credibility as a negotiating partner and any possibility of bringing our influence to bear in Israel if we did not approve this agreement now.</p>
<p class="contents">By so doing, we shall not be endorsing the current government. The choice of government is a matter for the people of Israel. They will decide who should be prime minister and they will no doubt decide on the composition of the Knesset. The agreement will scarcely influence their decision. The present government could perhaps use our rejection of the agreement to illustrate how ill‐disposed and hostile Europe is to Israel at heart, which is not the case at all. The only reason for our heavy criticism of the present government is that it has done nothing to promote peace and has failed to do many things that it could have done.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not know who the next prime minister will be; nobody knows that today. Above all, we do not know what the composition of the Knesset will be. That is why a postponement will achieve very little. The same situation, or even a far more difficult one, may result from the elections. Things cannot become all that much easier, given the abundance of parties and candidates. That is why it surely makes good sense to decide now. To my Palestinian friends – and I do not hesitate to say that I have very many of them and am in close contact with them – I should like to say here and now that, precisely because we are developing ideas in Israel, with Israel and for Israel, because we are establishing cooperative mechanisms that can help to break the deadlock on the peace issue, we in Parliament should, and indeed must, decide to ratify this agreement in order to maintain the common ground that can underlie and justify our continuing dialogue with Israel. For that reason, the Palestinian people have a special interest in our approval of this agreement, which I, particularly as someone involved in foreign policy, can certainly commend to the House.</p>

<p class="contents">Of course, we must ratify this agreement. The proposals to postpone it are extremely worrying because postponing the agreement would naturally mean changing the nature of the agreement. Excluding Israel from the first round of invitations to tender would amount to a virtually irreversible penalty and would make Israel into a lesser partner in terms of cooperation. This cooperation must be exemplary in all respects, and it is of fundamental importance, both in terms of scientific exchanges and in terms of developing our cooperation with all the countries in the region. It obviously augurs well that Israel is prepared to accept the participation of Palestinian Arabs in this project.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by saying that it is extremely worrying to see that some people are trying to postpone this cooperation. The combination of the extreme right and the extreme left is significant in this respect and it is clear that these attempts are due to the resurgence of old feelings of hatred that we would have hoped not to see here again.</p>

I am a friend of Israel too. I even have family in Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I think that the scientific cooperation agreement with Israel appears, at first glance, to be an essentially technical document that could stand in the way of the development of cooperation between universities and research institutes elsewhere in the Mediterranean. There is a risk that the adoption of this agreement could be seen as an electoral tactic and a positive sign for the Israeli Government, which would be encouraged to continue blocking the peace process. The Palestinians are already under considerable pressure to abandon their decision to proclaim a Palestinian State on 4 May 1999. Indeed, some of that pressure comes from this House, as we can hear.</p>
<p class="contents">We must use all the means at our disposal to put pressure on Israel, on Netanyahu"s government, to respect its commitments. We have the ideal opportunity to do so by postponing the vote on this scientific cooperation agreement until after the Israeli elections. This would not, in fact, be the first time, as in January 1990, Parliament blocked the scientific cooperation agreement so that Palestinian universities would be reopened; at that time, they had been closed for over two years. It was mainly due to this vote that the Israeli Government decided to reopen them. Why should we not repeat this approach in order to achieve some real progress in the peace process?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ford </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her work. There are two aspects to this report. Firstly, the technical aspect, and here the agreement is sweet: mutual benefit to the European Union and to Israel. The latter has a technological advantage in a number of areas: biotechnology, opto‐electronics, medical information technology and software development. The European Union can benefit from the knowledge that is available there.</p>
<p class="contents">The Israelis also have skills in space technology and in the nuclear sector, areas where I would have strong reservations about cooperation. This applies particularly to the nuclear sector: ten years ago I spent some time outside Mordechai Vanunu's prison in Gaza trying to visit him. He is, of course, still in jail. I would welcome the Commission putting some pressure on Israel to deal with that. I would reassure Mr Antony who has now left us that if anyone in Israel or, for that matter, in the Arab world was stupid enough to try and develop ethnic weapons, they would be self‐destructing in the sense that the gene pools of the Arabs and the Israelis are sufficiently close that it would be very difficult to identify or produce weapons that would not harm people on both sides of the divide.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this can be a force for progress. I will certainly be voting in favour of the report, as long as there is a commitment that we will not cooperate in the nuclear area. I certainly would not want to have any cooperation in the space sector and I agree completely that we should be encouraging Israel and putting pressure on the Israelis to cooperate with the Palestinians in their research programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that we will make sure that none of this money goes into parts of Occupied Palestine. That would be a provocation and the European Union would have some responsibility for that.</p>

The problem with this agreement is that no mention is made of cooperation between Palestinian research bodies. The rapporteur says in her introduction that after the agreement has entered into force, and after it has been in operation, we shall make an assessment of the extent to which different Palestinian centres have been given the opportunity to participate. This would appear to me to be a rather absurd way of drafting an agreement if one wishes to achieve a given objective: surely one would normally include that objective in the agreement?</p>
<p class="contents">This aside, I would very much like to endorse Mr Holm's request that we should do something for Mr Vanunu. I also believe that we must address the question of obliging Israel to sign a non‐proliferation agreement as far as nuclear weapons are concerned.</p>

<p class="contents">As many people have pointed out this morning, this is the result of particularly effective joint work: since 1996, 369 joint projects have received subsidies amounting to a total of more than ECU 59 million. It is also the proof of real cooperation between the European Union and Israel, and as we are well aware, it has considerable technological and intellectual benefits for both parties. This is a clear example of how a balanced partnership should work.</p>
<p class="contents">It is actually helping the peace process in the Middle East, and we make no secret of this. In fact, the agreement will lead to further joint work with Palestinian researchers, laboratories and universities. And the Israeli authorities have made commitments to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur very sincerely, to thank all our colleagues in the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, and, of course, to express my agreement with the very strong proposals made by Mr Stockmann.</p>
<p class="contents">A few weeks away from the Israeli elections, I would personally like to see in our decision – which I hope will be a positive one – a strong signal to those in the region with intelligence and spirit in favour of a peace based on development, progress, mutual respect and partnership.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cresson, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. – (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur and to the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy. They dealt with this issue in a very short space of time and almost unanimously support the conclusion of the scientific and technical cooperation agreement between the European Community and the State of Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament is now able to make a decision on this matter. In 1996, the Union and Israel signed a scientific and technical cooperation agreement for the duration of the fourth framework programme. Israel thus became the first, and currently the only non‐European, country to be fully associated with the Union"s research activities.</p>
<p class="contents">What has this cooperation become today? As has just been mentioned, it has led to around 350 joint projects and these have produced results that are already visible. New products and practices have been developed, for example, a high‐performance camera for medical imagery and a rapid photo‐printing machine, to mention but two. All these projects are based on partnerships that combine their complementary skills, and the institutions of the two parties involved draw considerable benefits from them in terms of knowledge, but also in economic and commercial terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The association between Israel and the Union is firmly based on the principal of mutual benefit, which is applied to each project. Israel"s population is among the most educated in the world. It could be looked on as an example from which we could learn a great deal. This is due to its extremely advanced technological know‐how, the dynamic nature of its small and medium‐sized enterprises and its innovation policy, which makes it the second leading country in the world in terms of the number of start‐ups that are generated as a result of cooperation between universities, laboratories, businesses and financial organisations. Moreover, I have visited the country on several occasions to see what progress was being made. Israel has become a partner that is very much in demand and highly valued by European consortiums.</p>
<p class="contents">All the evidence shows that the participation of Israeli institutions brings a considerable added value to our programmes. I would like to add that, insofar as the agreement guarantees reciprocity, European researchers also have access to Israeli programmes. The agreement has fulfilled all its promises. The two parties have therefore expressed their desire to continue and to strengthen their cooperation for the duration of the fifth framework programme. The Israeli authorities would like this agreement to be implemented as quickly as possible. In fact, Israel would suffer if there were a delay with respect to the agreement entering into force, as happened with the previous agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, the Commission and the Israeli authorities completed the negotiations in the record time of three weeks. Nevertheless, certain Member States are reluctant to bring this to a rapid conclusion and link the approval of the agreement to the progress of the peace process in the Middle East. On the contrary, I think that the development of scientific and technical cooperation could make a significant contribution to the peace process. As the rapporteur points out, it is important, from this point of view, for Israeli and Palestinian research institutes to be able to strengthen their cooperation. Some speakers have spoken on this subject, and I would like to reassure them. This work has already begun and such cooperation will be particularly encouraged within the framework of the international section of the fifth framework programme, which gives priority to actions in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p class="contents">Above and beyond its intrinsic interest, cooperation between the Union and Israel in research is part of a broad political perspective. This is an additional reason for concluding the agreement to associate Israel with the fifth framework programme as soon as possible. Finally, the Commission will continue to keep the relevant committees regularly informed of the progress of the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to respond to certain speakers, I would like to say that the Commission believes that rather than encouraging regrettable abuses, the renewal of the scientific and technical cooperation agreement aims to maintain dialogue within a specific sector and with a population that should be supported. We must not turn this agreement into a political challenge as the effects of this would be counter‐productive. I would like to add that the agreement does not cover nuclear research, even of a civilian nature, nor, of course, does it cover the military sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wishes to encourage cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian research institutes, as I have already said. In order to achieve this, it will use all the possible actions provided for in the fifth framework programme for the Mediterranean countries. One very specific area that comes to mind is that of water management. This is naturally an extremely important field as it is vital for bringing together populations that may be in a conflict situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel"s recent policies in certain respects have shown regrettable shifts. However, as regards the measures contained in this agreement, given that the peace process is facing certain obstacles, we cannot add to those problems by suspending cooperation with a scientific community that is among the most brilliant in the world. As has already been mentioned, its members are in favour of peace, and some of them are even very actively involved in the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not punish those people. On the contrary, we must try to help them, support them and continue to hold dialogue with them, in the interests of the people. If we do not, the people will be directly penalised by our reservations.</p>
<p class="contents">We must show that we are open and generous, although that must not prevent us from being aware of any possible shifts in Israeli policy. However, I do not think that we should join these two elements together in order to use this scientific and technical cooperation agreement as a bargaining chip. It is a good agreement, it has a certain symbolism and it has considerable political implications. It tries to take the best of both scientific communities in order to make things easier for the people there who are going through difficult times. We must learn to appreciate better their skills, courage, nature and great intelligence, and become aware of how much we have in common with them.</p>
