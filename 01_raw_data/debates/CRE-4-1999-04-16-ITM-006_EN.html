<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Estevan Bolea </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span><span class="italic"> – (ES)</span> Mr President, last November, a group of Members from Parliament"s Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy visited Venice. As usual, we were fascinated by the city"s immense beauty, but we were also very concerned – and still are – about its enormous and ever‐increasing problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Venice is an artificial environment created by man in the middle of a lagoon, yet it suffers from flooding due to ‘high water". This problem is becoming more and more serious and is essentially what has led to an exodus from Venice. This is what concerned me most, because a city that is truly losing its population will end up as a beautiful but dead museum, a still life.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1951, Venice had a population of 171 000; today, it has less than 60 000 inhabitants, and a large proportion of these – 25 % – are elderly people. Moreover, there are over 10 000 empty dwellings, which are not cared for and which are falling down.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, something will have to be done to keep Venice as it should be.</p>
<p class="contents">Venice is a part of man"s heritage. It belongs first of all to the people of Venice, to those living in the Veneto region, and to all of Italy, which is such an artistic country. It would be hard to imagine the world"s museums without the Italian artists who have filled them with such beautiful works of art. And that is exactly what Venice is.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is also true that very special measures are required. Technological measures, that is, the measures for which the necessary technology exists, are the ones that have essentially caught the attention of Parliament"s Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy. We must put an end to the floods that occur in Venice as a result of the growing phenomenon of ‘high water". We cannot prevent ‘high water" – it is a natural phenomenon – but we do have the ability to introduce mobile dikes and build an underground subway, and this has all been looked at. The <span class="italic">vaporetto</span> is the only form of transport in Venice and it creates serious problems for the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, we are asking the European Union, the Commission and, in particular, the Italian Government to take several measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we ask that resources be set aside for an intensive renovation of Venice under Objective 2 of the Structural Funds so that people can continue to live there. If this does not happen, Venice will disappear. Without people, there is nothing to protect and nothing to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we ask that tax concessions be granted to those companies that are brave enough to continue operating and producing in Venice at higher costs than other businesses. We also want the Commission to put an end to the sanctions it has imposed because the Italian Government has granted such concessions.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Venezia vuole vivere e deve vivere!</span></p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Liikanen, </span> <span class="italic">Commission. – (FI)</span> Madam President, at the end of January, the Italian authorities submitted to the Commission a series of observations containing a formal position on the initiation of a procedure, under the reference C 81/97, following a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 18 February 1998. This procedure concerned state aid granted in the form of relief on social security contributions. In December last year, the Italian authorities asked in a letter from the Italian Permanent Representative that the deadline stipulated for their reply should be extended to 15 January 1999. The <span class="italic">Vuole Vivere </span> group, made up of businesses in Venice and Chioggia, submitted its observations, which were communicated to the Italian Government. These are now being examined by the Commission"s services and will be taken into account in its final decision. We intend to make a decision on this issue by the end of May.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Venice being included in the scope of derogations under Article 92(3)(c), I would point out that it is up to a Member State to indicate those areas which the state wishes to include in its regional list. The Commission then investigates the proposals. The Italian authorities, however, only proposed a part of Venice as an area to come under Article 92(3)(c). By a decision taken by the Commission on 30 June 1997, it was agreed that this area qualified for aid.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Venice"s inclusion in Objective 2, it might be pointed out that a Commission proposal on the implementation of the new Structural Fund Objective 2 over the period 2000‐2006 provides for shared responsibility between the Commission and the Member States in determining which areas qualify for aid. As the Council has approved the regulation containing the general rules on Structural Funds, it is incumbent on each Member State to inform the Commission of those areas it regards as being in difficult circumstances, as long as they meet the requirements laid down in the regulations concerned. The Commission confirms those areas that qualify for inclusion in Objective 2 on the basis of these proposals and in close cooperation with the Member State in question.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of high water – <span class="italic">acqua alta – </span> in Venice calls for solutions that take account of the special features of the lagoon ecosystem. It is the task of the Italian authorities to find a suitable solution to this problem.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Malerba </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, as Mrs Estevan Bolea has said, Venice is an artistic and cultural heritage site which belongs to the world: this is known to all of us and has been officially recognised by UNESCO. I am sure that all Members are familiar with Venice and that some never tire of visiting it. As we are all aware, the Venice lagoon represents a very particular hydrogeological environment: its equilibrium is fragile and was damaged in the 1960s and 1970s by industrial development along the coast.</p>
<p class="contents">The phenomenon of ‘high water' which, when it occurs, floods the historic centre to a depth of roughly half a metre, is now happening about ten times a year and causing growing inconvenience to the inhabitants and, even more so, to the economic activities of Venezia Laguna, the island part of the city.</p>
<p class="contents">Venice is dying, it is said, not so much because it is sinking into the water – fortunately a very slow phenomenon – but because the population is declining, a very rapid phenomenon. Businesses which are not linked to tourism and produce high added value employment are relocating to the mainland to avoid the further inconvenience of Venice's severe transport problems. Yet Venezia Laguna did – and to a certain extent still does – have a tradition of non‐pollutant, high‐tech industry and services.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it is clear that the only way to keep these businesses where they are is by granting direct fiscal and economic incentives to firms operating in Venezia Laguna. This policy has been pursued by the Italian Government, with varying degrees of success, but it now appears that this approach is coming in for criticism from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I was pleased to hear that Mr Liikanen allows the Member State to have the last word, as it were, concerning this policy, but I fear the axe of DG IV – responsible for competition – which is normally reserved for state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The city authorities discussed this with us when our delegation visited them. I do not think we should become involved in the experts' debate on specific ways of solving the high water problem, but I do believe that Venice should be thought of as an area with particular problems, in need of aid and assistance to preserve a viable economic existence.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fassa </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems odd in a way that this House should be debating something as obvious as protecting the city of Venice. As many others have said, the city is a world heritage site located at the heart of an extremely fragile man‐made ecosystem. I should like to dwell for just a moment on this first point. The rulers of Venice in former times succeeded in creating a virtually unique model of development. They devoted incredible energy, hundreds of years ago, to protecting an unstable ecosystem. They began by developing trade, and then they transformed the city of Venice into a major international cultural centre which saw the inception of the modern publishing industry, for example, and always enjoyed far greater civil and political liberties than the neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that Europe's political leaders should now be addressing themselves to this issue, and considering how to overcome obstacles in this area, is therefore quite disconcerting in some ways. Community rules are designed to assist development, not to curb it. Community rules must not be applied unthinkingly across the board, as though the European Union were synonymous with uniformity. It is glaringly obvious that state aid granted to Venice is unlike state aid granted to any other EU region: it serves to safeguard our heritage, which we did not create but inherited. And because we inherited it, we are duty‐bound to hand it down to future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mistakes have been made, not least in terms of industrial development, partly by the Italian Government: the Porto Marghera petrochemical plant has almost certainly destabilised the delicate equilibrium of the lagoon. But as the Commission President‐designate, Mr Prodi, said here, we want Europe to be at the leading edge of business development. If this is so, we must ensure that Venice is one of the centres driving this new entrepreneurship.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Aelvoet </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the magnificent heritage that Venice represents is struggling with depopulation and mass tourism and is regularly under threat from flooding. The entire lagoon is heavily polluted, and the industrial hinterland on the mainland is mainly made up of huge chemical works which place an enormous burden on the environment. The Greens feel that a coordinated approach is needed to tackle these problems, both at national and international levels. We need to promote economic development that spares the lagoon and the historic buildings. This is why we are in favour of converting the petrochemical plants in Marghera to be more environmentally friendly, and we also wholeheartedly support the Italian Government"s decision to review the MOSE project for a sort of mobile protection for the city.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw attention here to an amendment by Mr Dell"Alba calling for the Italian Government to review this decision. That would be sending out a completely negative signal and would simply be maintaining an approach which does not come anywhere near the heart of the problem. I would therefore urge you most strongly not to support this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">We want Venice to become a place of innovative and sustainable urban development, and the Commission has come up with some good proposals for measures to promote sustainable urban development in the EU. The main elements here are tax incentives for housing restoration, with special conditions for highly sensitive locations such as Venice, of course; tax incentives for small and medium‐sized firms providing employment without polluting the environment; sustainable tourism models, perhaps with rules on limiting access in certain peak periods; and measures to support the local economy based on the sustainable use of natural resources and the city"s historic heritage.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Santini </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, many foreign colleagues from various countries are concerned about Venice and trying to help. This is the most telling proof of the fact that, as confirmed by UNESCO, Venice is a world heritage site.</p>
<p class="contents">Venice clearly does belong to humanity as a whole, since when wandering through its streets and over its bridges, eight out of every ten people one comes across are tourists, and seven of those eight are foreigners. Well, these tourists make Venice their own, using its services and damaging its structures, often for just a single day, meaning that the Venetians themselves gain precious little. It is only right, therefore, that this tide of humanity should begin to concern itself with protecting these assets and with the associated costs. What can be done, apart from levying indirect taxes on a few day‐to‐day consumer goods? At least three measures would be feasible at Community level – if I may put forward some concrete ideas – and it would be up to the Commission and the Member State, Italy, to devise the appropriate legal and economic instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, an ad hoc project could be included in the LIFE budget line for the high water problem; the problem is not a new one but is causing increasing damage to Venice. Secondly, Venice should be placed squarely within the future Objective 2, which deals with urban decline. Thirdly, in agreement with the Italian Government, a derogation should be allowed under Article 92 of the Treaty, referring to state aid, so as to grant tax concessions and incentives to all businesses which start up – or plan to do so in the future – and to keep alive initiatives liable to guarantee employment, but above all to safeguard the life and soul of Venice.</p>
