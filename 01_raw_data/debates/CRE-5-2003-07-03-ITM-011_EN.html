Only this morning, a Dutch aid worker over there told me that he would not know which party he would vote for in the general elections at the end of this month. His message is clear and fair: Europe must treat all Cambodian parties with the same amount of criticism as we follow their progress to the ballot boxes. In that sense, I am also waiting for the report of the EU election observers.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, Cambodia is undergoing a transition – from being a country primarily dependent on humanitarian aid to being a regular developing country. There is still a need for assistance from the European Union. I have heard very critical comments from the field about the coordination and effectiveness of this European helping hand. The way to build a better future for the people of Cambodia is through decentralisation and the frequent involvement of co-financing organisations. In short, the Echo investments, while useful, require a logical sequel in the form of the actual implementation of the EC strategy document for Cambodia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some two million people lost their lives, while an incalculable number were displaced and deported. Even the wearing of spectacles put your life at risk, and higher education meant that you were doomed.</p>
<p class="contents">If, today, you travel through this beautiful tropical country, with its impressive stone buildings that testify to the antiquity of its culture, then, wherever you go, you still come face to face with the physical and mental damage done to a tormented people, who, first, were terrorised by the Khmer Rouge, and then put under the yoke by their Vietnamese liberators, finally achieving a small measure of normality under the UN mandate. The reason why I have been able to follow this process is that I have visited the country a number of times and was one of the many who observed the elections in 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">I might add that nowhere else in the world are there so many households headed by a woman in comparison to those headed by a man. Even more than the women, it was their sons, husbands and brothers who fell victim to a system that held human life in contempt and in violent conflicts, including American bombs and Vietnamese landmines, which, time and time again, blew people to their deaths or left them gravely wounded – something that they continue to do. What is left is poverty, need, a people torn up by their roots, and – it has to be said – a certain willingness to resort to violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The latter is now, of course, being manifested in the run-up to the elections, but I do believe that it has to be made clear – as has been unambiguously stated by, among others, the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Cambodia – that the situation is proving to be less hazardous than it once was, and the organisation ‘Asian Network for Free Elections’ notes a marked decrease in violence in comparison to previous elections. As regards these elections, it will be very important that we keep an eye on how things develop before they are held, for it is clear that they will not pass without any friction whatever. Nor, I believe, can we expect them to do so in view of the history on which this country can look back. If, though, we can help to strengthen the forces of democracy in it, and deeply impress upon the population the significance of democratic elections, we will have taken an important step towards creating, in this region, something of an enclave journeying towards democracy, for we have to concede that conditions in neighbouring countries are no better – indeed, they tend to be even worse. I therefore hope that Cambodia will find its way to democracy, a way to be humane and a way to renounce violence, and will be able to lead its neighbours by example.</p>

When we in the ASEAN delegation were in Cambodia not so long ago, we met with some of the opposition parties and some of them were going to funerals of their members who had been killed. This situation is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights situation and standards have not improved in Cambodia in the last 10 years and human rights organisations have routinely pointed out that their big concern remains impunity for the perpetrators of human rights violations, notably members of the police and the military. The only successful prosecution in Cambodia dates back to 1993, when under the UN administration someone was charged and sentenced; that was a Mr Ten Seng, who is still working as deputy chief in the prison where he committed his crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also grave concern for the Vietnamese Montagnard refugees, who are still being returned to Vietnam to face ill treatment and unfair trials. This was brought up before in this Parliament. The legal safeguards exist but they are not being respected in Cambodia. There is a provision to outlaw the use of torture and to provide mechanisms and safeguards within the judicial and penal system against different forms of ill treatment and to ensure sanctions towards the perpetrators. That problem however, is still not being solved because there is a disregard for the existing safeguards.</p>
<p class="contents">I would hope that a new or future government and parliament would ensure respect for these laws and ensure that this kind of situation cannot continue. There must be total freedom there. It is also very important that the new future government or parliament will ensure the former leaders of the Khmer Rouge are put on trial. It is quite incredible to think that these people are still getting off scot-free for mass abuses of human rights.</p>

That is in itself an indication of some degree of progress towards democracy. At the end of the day, of course, what counts is the way in which these elections are conducted, as well as what happens before and after them, and whether the process is fair and deserves to be described as democratic. It is this that we have good reasons to doubt. Violence continues to overshadow the preparations for the election; opposition politicians are intimidated, two of them having been murdered in June alone. Everything demonstrates the total power wielded by the autocratic Communist Party, which evidently cannot reconcile itself to the idea that other parties have to exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Rules on local elections are infringed, as a rule by the local authorities, and such breaches go unpunished. The quality of a democracy depends on freedom of access to the media, above all to the electronic media, something that is not guaranteed, not least because the latter continue to be under the control of the Cambodian People’s Party and the Prime Minister, Hun Sen, or of organisations and persons associated with it.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is sending observers to monitor the Cambodian elections. To do so makes no sense unless they are able to do their work unhindered, and the country’s government must ensure that they are able to do so. By demanding all these things, we are not in some way illicitly interfering in the country’s internal affairs, but are acting on the basis of a cooperation agreement, Article 1 of which states in clear terms that respect for the principles of democracy and for basic human rights are among the elements of this agreement and that they must be adhered to by both parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1992, the European Union has been deeply involved in Cambodia. Having invested some EUR 250 million in the country, we can legitimately make certain demands as regards the fairness of elections. We therefore demand that the Cambodian Government should put an end to the violence and prevent the intimidation of opposition politicians and their parties. Our further demand of the Cambodian authorities is that they should ensure that these elections can be held freely and without interference.</p>

The Cambodian people deserve a peaceful future. This is why it is of great importance that the forthcoming elections should proceed in a fair and peaceful manner. Moreover, the mass slaughterers should not escape their sentences. My group has concerns on both counts.</p>
<p class="contents">We are receiving many reports on atrocities being committed in connection with the elections. The Cambodian People's Party is omnipresent and the authorities go out of their way to intimidate the people, particularly at local level. It seems that they can do this undisturbed and unpunished. The electronic media are also in the hands of Prime Minister Hun Sen's party. My group is particularly anxious that Sam Rainsy's party will not be given a fair chance as a result. Given his great courage and his merits in respect of a democratic Cambodia, Sam Rainsy deserves the Sakharov prize.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights situation is still bad. It is also regrettable indeed that, despite considerable amounts of European aid, economic and social development is stagnating. We are in favour of linking this aid to progress in the field of pluralism, human rights and free elections. After all, democratisation and prosperity cannot be seen in isolation from one another. We have to put the past behind us by doing now what is necessary to ensure a rich future for the poor Cambodian people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to thank all my fellow Members because I believe that this is a good resolution. Having said that, it always comes back to the question of whether the glass is half full or half empty: as it happens, Mr Nassauer sees the glass as half empty and Mrs Junker sees it as half full. Whatever the truth, I believe that the most important thing now is the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The national electoral commission has set good standards and is doing a remarkable job. We too have come a long way. In January and February the situation was extremely worrying. Violence is still taking place today. If, however, we compare the situation today with what happened at the last elections, things are better. It is true that access to the media is not perfect, but it is better. This is where our resolution is so important: we must remain extremely vigilant so that between now and 27 July, the situation remains positive and elections that are as democratic as possible are able to take place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that the coming national elections will be a key moment in the development and consolidation of the democratic system in this country. The Union is firmly committed to supporting this process, which will be backed up by the presence of international observers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, however, that in this regard we share Parliament’s concern that the existence of acts of political violence and the creation of a climate of interference and impunity at the moment is creating tensions in relation to this electoral process. Violence prior to elections is an issue which has been pointed out and highlighted by the Union during the elections of 1998 and 2002 and, although the majority of observers agree that the level of violence seems to be diminishing, there is still concern about its impact on the electoral process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission sincerely hopes that the measures adopted by the authorities to ensure that the law is complied with, without intimidation, harassment or violence, will have a positive effect and I can assure you that, in this regard, the Commission, in close coordination with the Member States, is continuing to monitor the process closely, in order to try to ensure that these situations do not arise.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also concerned about the need for press freedom in order to overcome the difficulties resulting from a public media which is firmly controlled by the government. In this regard, the Commission is insisting on the effective application of the positive measures adopted by the Cambodian authorities, and in particular by the national electoral committee, with regard to the media during the period prior to the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that this issue will be of particular interest and concern to the European Union's mission of electoral observers, which began on 11 June, with the arrival of the basic team, headed by Mr Evans: 36 European observers have already arrived in Cambodia and 70 additional observers should arrive on 22 July. The head of the mission of electoral observers will make a preliminary statement immediately after the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to our capacity for action in Cambodia, I must point out that the National Indicative Programme 2002-2004 allows us, by means of contributing resources, to try to have an influence on the processes of democratisation in the country. In this regard, the whole concept of governance has been treated as a fundamental horizontal and transversal issue, in all areas of cooperation. So far, we have allocated EUR 10 million to this field, which have allowed us, in particular, to support the electoral process.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these elements reflect the commitment of the Community and the Commission in the field of human rights and democracy, as demonstrated by the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, which has treated Cambodia as one of the fundamental target countries for this experiment. The NGOs, selected by means of invitations to tender, are acting as one of the main channels for the implementation of actions, within the context of this initiative, which are directly benefiting the Cambodian population.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the elements on which we are working, and this is the way we believe progress can be made on this process of consolidation and on achieving the fairest possible elections which will allow us to take a step forward in pursuit of this objective which we all share.</p>
