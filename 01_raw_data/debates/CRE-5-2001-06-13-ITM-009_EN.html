Nor would we like to have to repeat that these accidents take place mainly in work carried out on scaffolding, platforms and high places.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to refer to issues that should be dealt with by the rapporteur, whom I must congratulate, even though he is not here, not only on his work, but also on the sensitivity that he has shown on these issues affecting workers, who often lack training and preparation. We should not forget that construction is a bridging sector, which enables workers to move from the agricultural sector into the service or industrial sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the rapporteur’s sensitivity has enriched the debate as many of the amendments tabled were accepted, all of which aimed to enrich the debate and contribute to the adoption of measures to make employment safer. We know that zero risk does not exist, life is risky and work, which is the ultimate in active life, involves risks.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a generic text, in our Charter of Fundamental Rights, which has been published but not incorporated into the treaties, which in Chapter IV, under the heading Solidarity, states that "Every worker has the right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity".</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that respect for health, safety and dignity means a commitment from everyone, first of all from the workers themselves, and also from employers. Perhaps we should not establish a hierarchy, as we would obviously put the employers first, but the workers themselves must always have the necessary awareness and training to take on the risk, accept the risk and know how to respect it. No type of administration should be outside this commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to discuss this commitment from all in the sense that, as Bertrand Russell said, in order to be happy we need three things: the courage to accept the things that we cannot change, enough determination to change the things that we can change and the wisdom to know the difference between the two. I think that, in this sense, the fight against accidents at work should be one involving constant determination and constant courage from everyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He must be detained by something very important, for we are all aware of Mr Skinner’s great commitment to getting this matter finalised. EU rules are, of course, often criticised for being much too detailed. Rules concerning employees’ health and safety are no exception. However, the directive which we are to be involved in approving today shows why that degree of detail really is necessary. We already have general rules to protect employees, including against falls from height, but the fact remains that falls from height account for 10% of all industrial accidents in the EU. That is partly due to the fact that the rules are not kept on work sites, but it is perhaps also due to the fact that there is a lack of more precise instructions as to how such accidents are to be prevented.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who has tried to climb up scaffolding knows how, in that situation, one wonders whether the construction, which looks so flimsy, has been put together properly. It requires a certain knowledge to erect scaffolding properly, and I believe that the required training in the erection, modification and dismantling of scaffolding can help improve safety. I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, not only on behalf of Parliament but also on behalf of all those people who work on scaffolding, for a good result has in actual fact been achieved. Clearly, we have not, however, solved all the problems with this directive, and I can see four points in particular that we shall have to do further work on.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I very much support what the common position states about the need to find a solution concerning employers and the self-employed. I should like to see these people in general covered by the rules concerning the working environment, both because of competitive considerations and because their actions can help improve safety on the work site. Secondly, we must look at the requirements made of those products designed to improve scaffolding. It is a major problem for those who erect scaffolds that the components are often very heavy. They are thus not only very difficult to handle, with the risk too of dropping them, but they are also a contributory factor in causing those who work with these materials to become worn out. A third point is training. We have found a satisfactory solution in this directive, but I believe that training is one of the points we must be very careful about in the future. Moreover, I believe that, as time goes on, it will be quite natural to make much more stringent demands upon the content of training. Let us now see, however, how the Member States set about the task.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and finally, there is the attitude to health and safety. Legislation alone cannot prevent accidents of this kind. Prevention has a lot to do with the authorities’ having the proper opportunities to monitor whether the legislation is being complied with, but also with individuals’ taking the new safety rules seriously. We cannot have those who work on scaffolding playing Tarzan out on the work sites. This directive now provides a series of clear instructions and, if they are used correctly, then I believe we can get something done about the unduly high number of accidents there are involving falls from height. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to your initial information, I would say that the rapporteurs are clearly those with the greatest interest in being present at these debates, as one would, of course, expect. The absence of rapporteurs from debates is something that must be pointed out. It must at least be communicated to the Bureau sufficiently in advance, both out of common sense and for the smooth running of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say, ladies and gentlemen, that Mr Collins informed the Bureau that, since this debate would continue after 9 p.m., he would not be able to be here at this time. The Bureau was, therefore, aware of this fact. With regard to Mr Skinner, the Bureau was unfortunately not given any information or explanation. I think that, in future, the Bureau will have to inform rapporteurs that if they are for any reason unable to attend, they must proceed in accordance with the basic rules of courtesy and of respect for the Chamber. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As chairman of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I have supported the conciliation that has been achieved concerning a change to the scaffolding Directive. It provides more precise rules for health and safety in connection with the use of ladders and other work equipment on scaffolding, and I want to congratulate Mr Skinner on his work. It is therefore a question of revising existing rules, and it is clearly of practical significance in terms, for example, of its demands for training and the issue of including self-employed persons under the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike a number of other Members here in the Chamber, I have not, during the discussion of the proposal, felt any need to raise the issue of whether we should have this kind of directive at all. I do not think that that was on the agenda this time, but I should like, at the last moment, to say a little about the matter, for there is a lot of talk nowadays about lists of competencies and new forms of governance. What should the EU deal with? Which tasks must the national states carry out and in what ways are they to be carried out? I am absolutely in favour of common EU rules ensuring that free competition in the internal market does not become competition in a poor working environment. Is safety in relation to scaffolding really a matter for the EU, however? Would it not perhaps be better to take the decisions concerning safety on scaffolding closer to the building sites concerned? This might be at a national or local level. I started giving some thought to this in the middle of the very exciting and detailed discussions we had on, for example, the use of ladders on scaffolding around the old houses in Amsterdam. Another issue is that of how it is to be ensured that the rules are in actual fact implemented and that we do in actual fact see fewer accidents involving falls from height. While we have been discussing this Directive, I have in fact been paying more attention to the scaffolding in Brussels, and I believe, to be honest, that we shall have a serious problem implementing this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion we are also having in other contexts about new forms of governance must also deal with the way in which we are to regulate the working environment most effectively. Are we to continue issuing detailed laws and regulations, or should we focus more upon how these work in practice? Is there some other way in which we can oblige the two sides of industry and the national governments to ensure a good working environment? I think we need some new thinking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the Dutch newspapers this morning carried the headline, ‘Europe safeguards the window cleaner’s bread and butter’. That was a reference to the concern that it would no longer be possible to use a ladder for work. This directive has finally provided a solution. It means that a ladder can be used for work, provided the work is short-term and it poses a limited risk. That is precisely where the whole problem lies. This news is music to the ears of people in the Netherlands, at least the window cleaners, along with an entire professional sector of self-employed who carry ladders around in the Netherlands and the rest of Europe, such as maintenance people, painters and decorators, and so forth. But they are all getting excited about nothing. For the time being, anyway. For it may well be that, at national level, the measure will at some point be interpreted to mean that ‘short-term’ is not a full working day, in which case the work can, strictly speaking, not be carried out. I am only highlighting this issue. We have not solved the problem. The directive causes problems of enforceability. If we concern ourselves with working conditions in this House, we should do this effectively, and our efforts must be geared towards the relevant categories of people: employees, self-employed with no staff, self-employed with staff, etc. There is room for more clarity in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am delighted to see that he has finally arrived here so that he can hear me say that yet again.</p>
<p class="contents">My complaint was then, and still is now, that this was a matter best left to Member States or indeed to local authorities – a point already made most eloquently by my colleague, Mr Jensen, a few moments ago.</p>
<p class="contents">When the original Commission proposal on this subject was published, it said: "The difficulties of implementing the provisions on the ground should not be underestimated in the case of SMEs". Despite this comment the rapporteur put forward even more detailed amendments and then blithely stated in the September debate: "This is a small- to medium-sized business-friendly piece of legislation".</p>
<p class="contents">Coming straight after the report of Mr Hughes, earlier today, suggesting a number of amendments to the proposed extension of the working time directive to mobile workers, one thing is very clear. The people who believe that the EU should legislate in the finest detail, the people who are piling on more burdens on business without even understanding that is what they are doing, are not some unelected Brussels bureaucrats, they are Britain's very own Labour MEPs. I now understand what Tony Blair means by Labour leading in Europe. When it comes to extra red tape British Labour MEPs are way out in front. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This phenomenon is, unfortunately, all too common throughout the European Union. We cannot repeat often enough the huge number of accidents that occur: according to information supplied by the Commission, around 500 000 falls from a height occur every year, 300 000 of which cause more than three days’ absence from work. Furthermore, of this total number, around 40 000 serious accidents are recorded and around 1 000 deaths. In most cases, these accidents are caused by the improper use of scaffolding and ladders.</p>
<p class="contents">In this area, as in other areas in the social sphere, we need to encourage the adoption of measures and common legislation to encourage the setting of standards and a levelling upwards, which would represent added-value for all of the Member States. I am sure that, in my country, where this type of accident has reached frightening proportions, this directive will make a valuable contribution to preventing them. It will also provide an incentive to the competent national authorities to define stricter and more rigorous rules on the use of such work equipment. Lastly, I wish to emphasise the positive manner in which the Council has worked in close cooperation with Parliament on this matter. Although we sometimes tend to criticise the positions adopted by the Council, we should give praise where praise is due. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can thank the chauffeurs' service of Parliament. As wonderful as it is at ferrying us in every day, they seem to have left me behind some half-an-hour after I asked for them to be there.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from this complaint, I should like to thank all the services that have been a part of this very successful report. I see Simon Duffin, for example, from our secretariat in Parliament, who was instrumental in bringing about many of the compromises, agreements and consensus in our committee. We should be generous in our praise for people like Simon and others in the Commission who worked tirelessly in bringing about this particular report. It is a first. Through an informal process, it may beggar belief to Mr Bushill-Matthews- although I thank him for his original praise to begin with – that it is an employer-friendly report. There is nothing like this that has come through the processes of health and safety. That may stagger you, but it is true. It is true for various reasons. Perhaps we ought to start off by reminding ourselves of the very reason why this report came about in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">The report was lost as a scaffolding or works-at-height directive, as an annex to an original report. The reason why it was lost was because originally it was blocked for reasons I will not bother to go into now. But sense prevailed and now we have it back.</p>
<p class="contents">Five hundred thousand people each year fall from heights. That is quite a staggering amount across the European Union every year. Forty thousand – as you have probably already heard – are seriously injured; seriously enough for them to have three or more days off from work. A thousand, very sadly, die each year, with the consequent effects on administration, the burden to businesses of finding replacements, of training, finding the costs for compensating the relatives. That is quite a burden for business.</p>
<p class="contents">Across the European Union the costs are estimated as being in the region of EUR 28 billion every year. That is enough for a whole host of hospitals, schools, roads, or whatever you want, across the European Union. Yet we still persist in allowing accidents to happen in the workplace. Forgive me for being passionate about this, but if you can stop accidents in the workplace, I say you are doing a favour for the workers in the enterprise and for the businesses themselves. We should strive to do that in the most reasonable and practicable way. Those people who know me, know me for being a practical person, not somebody up there in the clouds wishing further ideology to descend on businesses, but somebody who sees the real advantages for the person in the workplace.</p>
<p class="contents">I worked at heights. I worked on scaffolding. I worked on ladders. I tried to carry things too large for people to be able to carry. I have seen it. Let me tell you these are not fly-by-night dreams of someone in Parliament. If I am a Labour MEP who has brought legislation in, I am very proud to do that because we may see a reduction of accidents in the workplace as a result of such legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only that, it is employer-friendly because it brings about a level playing-field. No longer will we have the competitive basis, on which some companies wish to compete, of people who prefer to miss out all these rules and regulations in favour of seeking the lowest cost, the lowest denominator in the workplace. That puts at risk the lives and livelihoods of those people who are the most vulnerable – the people who are working there.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has been incredibly successful in this process. It has been successful for many reasons. It has partly been successful because it has been able to include things which the Commission and the Council were not originally willing to consider. These are not burdens. I do not think that including self-employed people in this particular legislation is burdensome. When you look at the contracting industry – take electricians, for example – the vast majority are self-employed. The report has not only looked at contracting industries in the building sector but looked across a wide spectrum of people working at heights. It is not just people working on building sites that fall from buildings or scaffolding, it is across a range of different industries. It seems remarkable that this could be so misrepresented.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament also stood out in favour of maintaining a sensible balance between too much detail and that which needs to be regulated. We need regulation if we are to have the kind of standards which a civilised European Union wants to see.</p>
<p class="contents">This move was underlined by the fact that Parliament took a very mature interest in some of that detail and effectively helped people, for example, who have to carry huge weights on ladders, to consider the very serious problems that could happen to themselves and the very serious injuries. Not all the amendments came from the Socialists. It is not as if we were some devious clique involved in destroying businesses. Amendments came from the other side of the House as well. Let us not forget that. You are criticising your own colleagues as well.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very successfully arranged piece of legislation. It has been achieved through consensus and goodwill in our committee. I thank all the people who have been a part of that. I hope we will be able to enjoy the success for many years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The issue of self-employed workers still has to be dealt with, as has been pointed out, and the Council and the Commission plan to issue a joint declaration expressing their desire to find a valid solution for all those involved in preparing, carrying out and completing temporary work at height.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate everyone on their work, especially the rapporteur, and all the speakers, and say that when we are talking about health and safety at work we do not consider whether we are dealing with salaried workers or independent workers.
