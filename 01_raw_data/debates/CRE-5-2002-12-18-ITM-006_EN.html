<p class="contents">I believe that we all hoped that, following the <span class="italic">Erika</span> accident in 1999 – I myself was present at discussions on this here in Parliament – we had put an end to this kind of disaster in the heart of Europe. Unfortunately it has happened again, however, and thus maritime safety and the prevention of oil slick disasters is back on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the <span class="italic">Erika</span> accident, the Council and Parliament adopted a number of measures to improve safety and reduce oil pollution at sea. We still do not know what went wrong to cause the wreck off the Galician coast, but the fact that it could happen is, in itself, proof enough that further action is required. There is now a need for us to make whatever efforts are necessary to prevent this kind of accident in the future – and for us to send a strong political signal to the population, shipowners, captains, and everyone involved in transporting oil, in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">On 21 November, Parliament made a strong statement on the <span class="italic">Prestige accident</span>. I should like to say to Mrs de Palacio that the Commission, in my opinion, has shown great energy in acting on this difficult matter. Both institutions deserve praise for the Community’s swift action in initiating decisions promoting maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment. We now have a starting point from which to proceed with the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been the Presidency’s intention to treat the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident extremely seriously. The matter was placed on the agenda of the<span class="bold"> </span>Council of Transport Ministers on 6 December and at the Council meeting of Environment Ministers on 9 December, and I was present when it was also discussed in detail at the European Council meeting in Copenhagen<span class="bold"> </span>last week. This was one of the reasons why there was a delay, meaning that the ministers did not end up dining with the Queen of Denmark. It was important to the Presidency that the meeting produce tangible results, and we can now say that it did indeed produce results.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has declared that all the relevant measures will be taken to prevent this kind of accident: at international, EU and national level. I am happy that the Council Conclusions are fully in line with the views of the European Parliament. Both the Council and the Presidency hold the view that we have achieved a good result, one which sends out the strong political signal we need: a firm line against single-hull tankers in the EU and the political will to find solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my hope that Parliament will make an active contribution – and I am quite sure that it will – to the rapid achievement of the goals set. In particular, I am thinking of the measures that Parliament and the Council will be adopting together under the codecision procedure. These include accelerating the phasing-out of single-hull tankers. I have no doubt that we can agree on this, given the will and resolve that Parliament has shown in this matter. The Council is also looking forward to constructive cooperation with Parliament, so that there is no unnecessary delay in putting in place the tightening of regulations and the rules on liability that are needed for the purposes of prevention and in order to ensure that, if accidents should happen, it is the right people who are made to pay: that is, those responsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">de Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, only a few weeks ago, when the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> had just sunk, I made clear to Parliament my fury and disappointment that we had been unable to prevent this tragedy from occurring.</p>
<p class="contents">Unable to prevent a tragedy that was foreseen, that we knew could happen at any time and that we could not prevent because we lacked the political impetus, the will, the decisiveness required to move more swiftly and decisively in applying the measures proposed by the Commission at the time.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Today I must reiterate this. I would like to do so because we cannot allow a third disaster to take place. We cannot, following the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, allow another <span class="italic">Erika</span> or <span class="italic">Prestige</span> to sully our coasts. The result of this debate and your vote tomorrow, here in Parliament, must therefore be the same result as that of 6 December in the Council of Ministers, in other words, a clear, determined will to implement radical changes, to take decisions immediately, in all the Member States of the Union and to go further, at international level, because, I repeat, we need to protect European coastlines first of all, but Europe also has international leadership responsibilities, which mean that we need to respect and maintain clean seas throughout the world, not just along our own coastlines.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would first like to thank the Danish Presidency for the decisive support given by the Council of Ministers the other day to these measures, which specifically led to Council conclusions that are, if they are really put into practice – and that is the key – a genuine, decisive step forward for European maritime security.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to thank the Danish Presidency for its work, but I would then like to say that the statements made the other day must be put into practice, in each and every country in the European Union. Putting them into practice means that when decisions are taken to prohibit the entry into and exit from European ports of single-hulled vessels carrying oil, tar, bituminous products or heavy fuel oil, these decisions must be upheld.</p>
<p class="contents">It means asking the Commission to present a proposal to bring forward the deadline for banning single-hulled vessels, single-hulled oil tankers, for oil transportation, from our waters and then supporting this proposal when it is on the table at the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">It means that when we say we are going to increase controls in ports in the various States of the Union, we actually employ the necessary staff, provide them with the necessary means and carry out these controls.</p>
<p class="contents">It means that when we say we are going to promote progress in international maritime legislation at international level, adapting international maritime legislation to new challenges, new risks and new social demands, we really do promote this from now on, all together, all Fifteen of us, and, I hope, the ten new States and the other candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It means that when we say we are going to allow the Agency, which we are currently setting up and which will begin work, I hope, in January, to begin to monitor and indicate, where necessary, any deficiencies or shortcomings, we pay attention to the Agency when it does point any out and that we take the necessary steps to correct them.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the factors we need to promote. We have already seen the results of prolonged delays, paying more attention to certain problems. I do not deny that these problems existed but they prevented us from taking swift enough action. We cannot allow the tragic results of this to happen again along European coastlines.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stipulate that, following the <span class="italic">Erika</span> disaster, it has been extremely frustrating for me to see that we in Europe have been unable to do what the United States did after the <span class="italic">Exxon Valdez</span> incident. I refuse to believe that we in the European Union should be content with fewer laws and fewer powers than the citizens of the United States, for example. I repeat, therefore, that the European Union is not enough. We must also make progress at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Commission, and I shall end here, understands that there are various levels and timetables. We are now experiencing the impact of these coastlines destroyed by an oil slick, and having to deal with these people whose lives, homes and opportunities are affected. That is the issue we must address first of all. We must solve existing problems, and European solidarity has been demonstrated clearly here, in the Transport Council and the Environment Council, and, I would imagine, is currently being demonstrated in the Fisheries Council, in any case, in the Copenhagen European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">This solidarity has also been demonstrated with regard to funds; reprogramming funds; direct access to disaster funds; economic contributions, but also providing resources, people and efforts by the various countries of the Union which, in different ways, have helped to mitigate the disaster we are currently facing.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this must be our immediate concern, however, we also need to act immediately, urgently, to prevent any more disasters of this kind. We must act, as I have said, to implement bans within the Member States to ensure that the most contaminating products are transported in more secure vessels, to guarantee that these are monitored to the highest possible degree; but we also need to act immediately, while knowing that this will only bear fruit in the medium term, at international level, to promote change in international maritime law.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to say that the Commission, as well as setting up the Agency, as well as authorising and mobilising various funds, as well as making changes with regard to the use and allocation of certain existing funds, will now table a regulation with a European standard to speed up the timetable for banning single-hulled vessels in the field of oil transportation in European waters and ports. Immediately banning the use of all vessels but the most secure means banning single-hulled vessels in the transportation of the most contaminating products and therefore requiring the use of double-hulled vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to make progress in clarifying responsibilities, we need to create a penal classification at European level, in all the countries of the Union, to cover serious negligence, when this type of situation occurs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, by means of this and other measures, to further increase the security of our ports and our waters, internally and at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to end by saying that the Commission, just as it did in the case of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, is responding promptly, swiftly and decisively. We hope that the Council and Parliament will respond similarly and with the same political and practical commitment, so that we might avoid having to hold another debate such as this in years to come.</p>

<p class="contents">It is essential for Galicia in particular, but also Asturias, Cantabria, the Basque country, and the French and Portuguese regions affected, to see very clearly that we shall continue to support them, and that by no means should they feel alone.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to put forward a proposal that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is to table, for the Conference of Presidents to request a report from the European Commission and make the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism responsible for holding a public hearing on maritime transport safety in Europe and the consequences of this kind of accident.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is by far the worst ecological disaster that my country has suffered and it is a disaster of European proportions that no country has the means to tackle alone.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the sinking of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> was a nasty but salutary shock which, as we have seen, was insufficient, and the Vice-President of the Commission is right to express her indignation. I therefore believe that today we in Parliament should remember the measures she proposed at the time with the support of the European Parliament, which the Council did not support. That must be the basis for our work, in order to achieve a reasonable level of safety so that this kind of event does not occur again on our seas and along our coastlines.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this is not a natural disaster. There are guilty parties: not the wind or the sea, but people with names. This ecological, social and human disaster, however, requires us to mobilise all the financial means available to the European Union and also the recently created Solidarity Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we in Parliament are subject to the Rules of Procedure that all the groups approved, but the situation requires that we act generously and flexibly. Although this Fund did not exist when the <span class="italic">Erika</span> sank, I would also like to ask the European Commission, what means were authorised for recovery operations along the French coast?</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the Council to ask it to commit to the proposals to increase maritime safety, which have the backing of both the Commission and Parliament, and to fulfil the commitment given in Copenhagen to create a compensation fund for the damages caused by oil spills.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end, Mr President, by calling upon the Socialist Group in general, but more particularly my fellow Spanish Members. Two motions of censure have already been discussed against the government of the <span class="italic">Partido Popular</span> in Galicia, and the Galician Parliament has set up a committee of inquiry. Here we formally propose that we all work side by side to help those affected and increase maritime transport safety, but if you do not want to, if you do not have the heart, at least let us work towards this.</p>

We are now faced with a disaster of such magnitude that it is no longer just a transport issue, it is also an environmental, social and fishing issue, which is why my group believes a committee of inquiry is needed to ascertain what went wrong with the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group, I express to the people of Galicia our sadness at their tragedy and our solidarity and support in their battle against this modern-day black death that is threatening their livelihoods and damaging their shores.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament would be fully justified in saying to our own Council of Ministers and to the IMO: 'We told you so!' The parliamentary records are full of calls from this body for action on maritime safety. From the <span class="italic">Estonia</span> to the <span class="italic">Braer</span>, from the <span class="italic">Sea Empress</span> to the <span class="italic">Erika. </span>We have highlighted flags of convenience, inadequate port state control, single-hull tankers and deficient crews and yet, despite our best efforts and the support of the Commission, our own Council of Ministers has failed to heed the warnings and take decisive action and has been instrumental in ensuring that the IMO is one of the most ineffective bodies ever. I say to the people of Galicia that it should be our own Council of Ministers and the IMO, not them, with oil on their hands at this moment.</p>
<p class="contents">They have let the people of Galicia and all of us down on this issue of maritime safety. The Council of Ministers does not want a committee of inquiry, as there are probably too many skeletons in its cupboard for that.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is shocking that the PPE-DE Group opposes such a move. It is a clear snub to the people of Galicia. They seem to be more concerned about protecting political friends than protecting the people of Europe. This is the worst ecological disaster for years and the PPE-DE Group calls for a hearing – pathetic!</p>
<p class="contents">The time for talking is over. What we need is <span class="italic">action</span> – to ban the flags of convenience in our waters; to improve our port state control; to ensure that the ships of shame are detained; to ban all single-hull tankers; to ensure that those responsible for these disasters pay the full cost of the damage that they caused; and last, but not least, to ensure that the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> is the last tanker to spread its black death over our coastline.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Haarder, take the message back to the Council: <span class="italic">no more</span> blocking, delay, subsidiarity or hiding behind the IMO – <span class="italic">action</span> is what we demand!</p>

When I see how this event is destroying the livelihoods of so many people and of a whole region, we are all angry. On behalf of my group I can tell you that our hearts are with them all, and I believe that we must offer them help through all the channels we have. Here in Parliament we must do what a parliament must do, however, which is to make rules and reinforce existing rules. The first thing I would like to ask – and I am also addressing this request to my good friend Mr Bertel Haarder – is that we apply the existing rules and that we take Erika I and II in hand. There is still a document being debated in the Council, Mr Haarder, and I hope that you will do something about this. We must also tighten up a number of things that are contained in Erika I and II; I am thinking in particular of ports of refuge and safe anchorages. In order to prevent major catastrophes, we must make this system compulsory, so that ships that get into difficulties can get help there and are not turned away. We must draw up a rule for this. The Commission is supposed to be carrying out a study. We must have this. We must also have a compensation rule for ports or places of refuge that take in ships. We now have a ship lying at a depth of 3 500 metres with 50 000 tonnes of oil still on board, and this ship will be causing problems for years. We must avoid this kind of thing in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to comment on port state control, as mentioned by Mr Simpson. Let us tighten this up for hazardous ships. It is absolutely no use checking 25% of ships in good condition; you must focus the controls on hazardous ships and old ships. We must make sure that ships passing through sensitive shipping zones are better controlled. We ask that you enter into negotiations with third countries, including with Russia, with a view to possibly signing bilateral agreements in this regard. It is time to put an end to the quarrels between the Council, the IMO and the Commission. The Commission must negotiate and must be given the opportunity to talk about this; then we will have much stricter rules. International legislation – and this is clearly stated in the resolution we all agree on – cannot be a reason to destroy the environment and people’s lives. The one must not take priority over the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the debate on procedures; together with the Commission and the Council, we must act fast and get rules down on paper. We are therefore not in favour of a committee of enquiry, as this would take too long. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jové Peres (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the speed at which the European Union has taken certain decisions is a perfect illustration of what up till now has been Community inaction in the field of maritime safety. Clearly if these decisions had been taken earlier, if the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> had had an accident, it would not have occurred in Community waters.</p>
<p class="contents">Two points should be made in this regard: firstly, to determine the reason for this inaction and the delays in taking decisions, and secondly, to determine whether the measures adopted are sufficient. In this respect, my political group considers the decisions adopted in Copenhagen to be insufficient, even though they are a step forward, and by way of example, the matter of flags of convenience has not even been addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, and I am now going to refer to its previous management, who could have prevented the current situation from arising, considerably shortened the Commission’s proposal, thus allowing floating timebombs to continue sailing until 2005, instead of having taken them out of use in September 2002, which is what would have happened if attention had been paid to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The delays in transposing the legislation, or in applying the Erika I and Erika II packages, speak volumes, as do the failures to comply with this legislation, concerning inspections and controls of vessels, for example. The permissive attitude that allows flags of convenience to be entered in registers by the Member States is no more constructive, and there are other causes for concern. I think that the issues I have raised constitute grounds for investigating levels of infringement of Community law and poor administration and, consequently, for establishing a committee of inquiry.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Galeote, although you chose to address the Socialist Group, which is very large, and my group is tiny, I am going to speak sincerely, on behalf of a very small group, but one that on vital issues has been involved, modestly, side by side with all our Spanish colleagues. From this modest experience I am going to say, first of all, that you have forgotten that you prevented a committee of inquiry from being set up in the Spanish national Parliament. Secondly, it is one thing to take decisions that could be questionable and that, at best, have proved to be wrong, and it is another, more serious, matter to adopt a communication policy to deny the problem, failing to take preventative and corrective action.</p>
<p class="contents">The most serious aspect of your government’s management in Galicia is that the State had no plans or instruments to address the crisis immediately. This comes as no surprise, Mr Galeote, when Mr Aznar supports the idea that we need to reduce State public services to a minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue we must now address – as elected Members of Parliament – is the people’s feeling that they have to tackle a disaster with small-scale means and great sacrifice, while the State, to which they pay their taxes, remains either impotent or implacable, I am not sure which.</p>
<p class="contents">What is done is done. There is nothing more to do except think about compensating those affected until economic activity can be rebuilt. In order to do this, the Solidarity Fund and the Structural Funds need to be mobilised rapidly. In conclusion, allow me to make one point: at a time of enlargement, we need a large Europe, but not a Europe that is an empty shell, and what cannot go on is the current failure to implement serious processes to prevent those operating on the edge of the law, in search of speculative profits, reducing safety conditions and social protection, from continuing as if nothing had happened.</p>

The Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, has said it was an unnecessary incident<span class="bold"> </span>which could have been avoided. This means that both the Presidency of the Council and the Commission and even Mr Galeote feel that there is blame to be apportioned. This is why we are calling for Parliament to set up a committee of inquiry with the task of identifying where the different responsibilities for the incident and for the subsequent salvage and emergency operations lie, particularly where the Spanish Government is concerned, which, I would remind you, was amongst those who firmly supported the rejection and weakening of the ‘Erika package’ and which is now calling in major building and construction firms to clean up the beaches. We condemn the fact that the Council has only adopted part of the Commission’s proposals. Here, we would like to pay tribute to the Belgian Minister – who, moreover, is one of the few remaining Greens – who was one of the very few people to support the package proposed by the Commission and to fight for it to be adopted in its entirety.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs its own legislative framework because we are absolutely sure that the international community will not be able to produce adequate legislation. We feel that there are two supplementary measures which need to be taken in addition to those already adopted. Firstly, the port state control bodies must carry out inspections on at least 25% of the ships entering each of the ports of the individual Member States rather than an average calculation being carried out at national level. Secondly, there must be new standards ensuring that dangerous substances are transported in smaller container ships than at present with a maximum capacity of 10 000 tonnes. Moreover, we feel that the Commission proposal for a directive on environmental liability must also include marine pollution and that, in the event of oil spillage, the European Union must adopt the same financial responsibility system as that already applied in the United States, where ship owners have unlimited financial responsibility if blame for the incident can be attributed to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, the European Union must provide sufficient financial support through the Structural Funds and through the Solidarity Fund to meet the needs of Galicia and northern Spain and help them to recover from this disaster. Moreover, we must on no account disregard the fact that many Nature 2000 areas are affected by this disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like us to be able in future to discuss this matter once again, but in another context, completely different to that of 21 December and to that of today, to say in future, that this has never happened again or that, if a new unfortunate situation involving risks and threats should arise, this time, thanks to the measures that have been adopted and to the technical and political awareness that we have all gained, the management of the crisis has run smoothly.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, we are still in shock and this shock is at once good and bad for us. It is good in the sense that we will adopt firmer, more rigorous and tougher measures for the future; it is bad, however, if we undertake, or plan to undertake an investigation of crisis management in a highly emotional state or in one of biased shock. It is, furthermore, extremely important, in this regard too, that a technically rigorous and politically dispassionate investigation should be undertaken into how the crisis was managed, not primarily in order to judge anyone, but to prevent any mistakes being repeated in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group also wishes to draw attention to a new raft of preventive measures. We have heard about preventive measures concerning the technical risks facing vessels or the way in which voyages are undertaken. This is true, but it is not enough: we must also identify conditions of legal risk, if I may use that expression, in other words, issues of flags of convenience and seaworthiness certificates that are not worth the paper they are printed on. We must also define mechanisms that can be made requirements at international level and which disqualify these operations, these so-called off-shore maritime navigation operations. A doctrine has developed with regard to the misdeeds of off-shore operations in money laundering and we also need to develop a doctrine of combating off-shore operations for laundering responsibilities for the sailing conditions of ships. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we are to reduce this dependence, we will need to invest more in investigating the use of renewable energy sources. We should also be looking at the possibility of bringing in more oil in through pipelines. This does not, however, detract from the need to improve the general conditions for transporting oil by sea. Firstly, this means tightening up the present system of port state control. More stringent and more frequent inspections should result in unseaworthy ships or ships that are not in good enough condition to carry certain goods being placed under arrest at an earlier stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Council deserves support for its plans to speed up the phasing-out of single-hull tankers. It is, however, in everyone’s interest that we establish double-hull transportation capacity so as to avoid a shortage of supply.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Member States must offer tangible help to ships and areas that are in distress. By no means all Member States appreciate the need to designate ports of refuge and create rescue, assistance and cleaning facilities in them. Furthermore, we must also press ahead with the setting up of the COPE fund, which will reimburse affected areas for the damage they have suffered. Incidentally, our attention should not be directed solely at the cargo but also at the bunker oil used as fuel for the ships themselves. This can also cause significant damage to the environment and has thus far not formed part of the remit of the IMO.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, we have already experienced several major oil disasters. It is time we took a fundamental look at our position and our approach to these. I hope that everyone concerned realises this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem – and it is a huge problem – is that this legislation is not being applied, especially when it comes to port controls.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must not forget that shipping goes beyond national and European borders. So action is needed at international level. And that means giving the European Commission the necessary credentials, so that it can reach agreements right from the start with candidate countries and with our neighbours so that we can coordinate our action. And of course it needs proper credentials from the Council so that it has the necessary authority to negotiate correctly with the International Maritime Organisation, which really does drags its heels.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must not forget that there are numerous sides to this problem. There is a lot of talk, and rightly so, about old, single-hull tankers. But may I remind you that a fairly new double-hulled ship, the <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span>, which was about 10 years old, sank off the coast of France recently, about two years ago in fact, which just goes to show that double hulls are not necessarily the only answer. However, nor is focusing on flags of convenience the only answer, because problems are frequently caused by ships not sailing under flags of convenience.</p>
<p class="contents">So what exactly am I getting at? Obviously we need to address the question of single hulls, obviously we need to examine the question of flags of convenience, no doubt about it; but we must not overlook all the other questions which we often underestimate. Port controls are vitally important. The question of ports of refuge, maintenance of ships, all these questions need to be examined overall, globally, if we want results. So we need a package of measures to deal with the problem. As for the committee of inquiry, may I call on my honourable friends not to turn Parliament into a referee in order to resolve internal Spanish differences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Galician citizens – my fellow citizens – who are caught up in a titanic fight against the oil that has arrived on their doorsteps, have been the casual victims and have paid the price for all European citizens. Since day one, therefore I have insisted both here and there on the need to provide a clear and simple European response, as we did for the floods in Germany, which takes account of two aspects: prevention and mitigation.</p>
<p class="contents">Should we toughen and change transport legislation? Yes. Should we reprimand ministers? Yes. But we need to do more. We need to explain to the people who are currently collecting oil by hand why there are no resources and assure them that, if this were to happen again, these resources would be available. We need to tell them, at the very least, that we are sorry for the lack of resources and coordination that there have been in addressing this disaster from the very beginning. They are the ones who are enduring this, and their cries for help have reached this Parliament, and we cannot deny this fact.</p>
<p class="contents">The Galician, and therefore, European citizens need to feel supported in the long and difficult journey into which the negligence of their own ministers has thrown them. We therefore cannot understand why anyone in this Parliament would be opposed to knowing what has happened, where mistakes have been made and what we must do to ensure that this never happens again.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a disaster of European dimensions: it is a European disaster and we do not want it to be repeated anywhere. If it does happen again, however, we clearly cannot act as we have done here. The pathetic images that have been shown around the world – which have shown what I saw – make it unnecessary, Mr Galeote, for me to give any further explanation.</p>
<p class="contents">We Galicians are strong. We always have been, we have always been able to fight against adversity and we shall not let ourselves be beaten by this disaster. What my people in Galicia cannot understand is why, if all of Europe recognises the lesson that we as a people are giving, the PPE-DE Group in this Parliament continues to deny us the opportunity to clarify what has happened, assess the damage and propose emergency and crisis management programmes at European level that could serve all Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not the ones who can answer this question, we compatriots, as Mr Galeote says. Compatriots are not the same thing as accomplices, and we do not want to be accomplices. Do not insult us by asking us for complicity in the decisions of a government that for a whole month tried to minimise this disaster and has been incapable of mobilising the Community institutions. On the other hand, Mrs de Palacio, you should ask the Spanish Government a question. Nobody has been able to use and set in motion the abundant means available to Europe. Why not?</p>

As we all know, however, they may not be enough. If we want to avoid finding ourselves discussing the effects of another disaster in the near future, certain measures need to be taken without delay, with less lukewarm cooperation from the Council: port controls must be stepped up, crews must be given training, assistance must be provided to vessels in difficulty, and, above all, ‘old tubs’<span class="bold"> </span>must be banned<span class="bold"> </span>and single-hulled vessels rapidly replaced. I stress the need to speed up as fast as technologically possible the introduction of the obligation for oil tankers and other vessels with dangerous cargoes to be double-hulled.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are actually to make a difference in this area, we need practical measures. I therefore propose that access to certain ports located in sensitive areas should be restricted without delay to double-hulled vessels. These areas should be progressively defined and delimited at European level, with the introduction of similar measures to those currently in force, for instance, in Venice harbour. Moreover, the capacity for demolition of old vessels, which is currently inadequate in northern Europe, in particular, must be enhanced with the provision of incentives.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems ensuing from this drastic measure will only be temporary and will, in any case, be incomparably less than those which would arise should similar disasters take place in sensitive<span class="bold"> </span>areas, and I am thinking with horror of certain parts of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">Are the Commission and the Council prepared to subordinate the economic considerations which thus far have been given priority to the demands of environmental protection? The Commission’s response would appear to bode well. I call upon the Council to be equally courageous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although the tragedy has shown that underlying the ecological disaster are the profits that some shipowners and oil companies seek to make by any means possible, even at the cost of maritime safety and working conditions, specifically by flying flags of convenience, the fact is that governments have allowed them to undertake these activities through increasingly neoliberal practices, including the delay in applying the directives decided on following the <span class="italic">Erika</span> disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore determine the reasons for the current crisis, such as the persistence of the causes, the indecision we have seen and the delay in transposing laws. We must also go further, however, as my group has proposed in the proposal to which I have added my name: banning flags of convenience and the transport of oil products and other dangerous materials in single-hull tankers, establishing shipping lanes that are further from the coast and stepping up inspections are crucial measures for preventing further tragedies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is now clear that Galicia’s citizens are suffering the consequences of the serious political conflict which opposes the positive proposals put forward by the Commission and which has led to the selfishness and irresponsibility demonstrated by the Member States of the Council. The Copenhagen decisions have not answered the anguished questions of the citizens but instead the interests of the predatory capitalism of the oil companies which, taking advantage of the murky and primitive international situation, reject all and any attempt to establish European legislation to protect our seas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, as well as Mr Aznar, has shown contempt for the people of Galicia by having taken no rapid decision to help that region. It has shown contempt for the fact that Galicia suffers more disasters than any other part of the world.

<p class="contents">The Commission also quite rightly acknowledges that two elements, which are essential for guaranteeing safety at sea, do not fall within the competence of the Union. The first element is the protection of coastal waters against ships in transit which present a threat to the marine environment, as was the case of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>; in this regard, Article 220 of Part 12 of the Montego Bay Convention clearly enables coastal States to exert strict controls. This is what France and Spain, which share borders with Portugal and Italy, decided to do. The success encountered in this area is a result of the lasting political will of the States concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the question of liability. The <span class="italic">Prestige</span> affair is as complex and unclear as that involving the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and until the liability of the charterer has been clearly established, these areas will not be able to be clarified.

What do the conclusions say? The European Council merely expresses regret and its grave concern at the consequences of the sinking of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> and assures Galicia of its support. These statements are very revealing. Where are the concrete measures? Why do we still feel that the ministers are stalling?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my anger, as you did, Commissioner, as well as my extreme concern regarding the fact that no genuinely practical decisions have been taken. The Council reiterated its conclusions of December 2000 regarding the measures to take with regard to the <span class="italic">Erika</span>. How much progress has been made in implementing these measures? What is happening with port controls? What is being done to ensure the integrity of those who enforce these controls? How far have we come in banning flags of convenience? What is the status of the European list<span class="bold"> </span>of ports that are likely to receive doomed ships? The Council must deliver an opinion on this as soon as possible. Lastly, what is being done to establish the responsibilities of owners and charterers?</p>
<p class="contents">What we are waiting for is the Council to give us appropriate answers to these specific questions. How much longer are we going to wait? How many more disasters must happen?</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I congratulate the Commission on its determination and I pledge the European Parliament’s support. A committee of enquiry, however, will not help, as we already have a legislative package and a committee would be a waste of our time. The political will of the Fifteen Member States is essential. We must work quickly instead of spending more time talking. If the directives adopted by this House had been supported, if the Commission had been supported, we would not be in this situation. Europe could have and should have prevented the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we do need to pass more legislation; what we must do, at long last, is to apply existing legislation. We do not need to have one debate after another. We must take action. Subsidies will not help to repair the environmental damage. The environment must be preserved. What use are our directives on protection?</p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out that it is more profitable from an economic point of view to anticipate than to repair. Then the disastrous social consequences are so difficult to quantify. Whichever country is affected, how does one assess the distress of fishermen, of those working in the tourism industry and of those citizens who see the oil slick spread further every day? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of the people of Brittany in France, I would therefore like to pay tribute to the people of Galicia in Spain, whose lives have also been affected by an oil slick.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s work is dictated by one crisis after another. The attacks of 11 September produced a European arrest warrant; from the Sangatte centre emerged the right to asylum and substantial measures were drawn up as a result of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> disaster. The Commission has worked well, but what are we going to do now? We have the whole shebang: oil in the Atlantic and old bangers in the Pas-de-Calais. The only thing left to do is fill them up with petrol. Things just never change. We need to learn a lesson, so we will learn it. I am sure we will make the provisions on single-hull vessels more stringent, I am sure we will step up the measures on battered old boats, I am sure we will step up this, that and the other.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going to make a suggestion, Commissioner: you should start to explore the idea of a European coastal guard, which does not work in the same way as in the United States but uses our method. You will see – because this is not necessarily our last disaster – this request will become increasingly popular in coastal communities. The people will demand it and they will not understand why the seas remain in this state.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not telling you to do this in two minutes flat, but to start thinking about it, because, as usual, it will come to pass, as the result of the next disaster or the next crisis, in the same way that the European arrest warrant and many other measures have been introduced. This is the way Europe works. Since necessity is ultimately the mother of legislation, let us begin by adopting legislation where it is needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, however, we do not have an emergency response team, and we do not have a professional approach. I find this particularly regrettable. We must, however, stop simply passing the buck. Naturally it is important to have this discussion, but not now, and not here. It is much more important to pay attention to making sure that Europe’s coastline is protected. My colleague Mr Dirk Sterckx’s specific suggestions about ports of refuge are particularly appropriate. I would like to call upon the Commission and Council to avoid hot-air politics when it comes to the safety of shipping.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the Commission in respect of the agency and the exercising of controls, as Mrs de Palacio has just mentioned. A ban on single-hull tankers carrying crude oil is soap-box politics and avoids the actual structural problems of international shipping. A well-maintained single-hull tanker is safer than a badly maintained double-hull tanker. I am not a fan of the IMO, but it is absolutely necessary for coming to agreements and for honouring and implementing agreements that are already in place. It looks as if we are creating a more realistic policy than the one you are proposing.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion it is important to negotiate with Russia on the control of ships that are loaded there and travel along the European coast to Africa. I think that it is very important to check classification agencies so that we know the responsibilities of the skippers, captains and shipowners and in particular in order to plan clear shipping routes. I hope that this will result in a better policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They will not be enough for the traumatised and angry communities who must deal with several hundred kilometres of polluted beaches, with the destruction of ecosystems, job losses and the threats looming over the entire local economy. The main cause of these repeated disasters is the drastic reduction in sea transport costs, which have dropped by 30% in 10 years. This results in crew members being exploited outrageously, suffering conditions verging on slavery, fleets that are badly maintained and often obsolete still sailing our waters, and all this goes on whilst those responsible are being protected by a web of impenetrable procedures. In short, bold political decisions are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The IMO, which authorised the creation and the development of flags of convenience, must now place a ban on them, which will clarify the chain of responsibilities between boat owners, charterers and States, and will make it possible to hold polluters both financially and criminally responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, a plan must be drawn up to scrap 4 000 boats that you yourself deem to be at risk, Commissioner, which means ship yards must now focus on constructing and developing modern and safe ships. Lastly, under the responsibility of the ILO, binding legislation must be drawn up that is applicable to all crews the world over. A genuine European maritime safety agency, in which the trade unions would be represented, could and should use an adequate number of inspectors in order to monitor ships and crew working conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am therefore pleased that the two biggest groups here in Parliament support our proposals for a European coastguard and a European civil ‘rapid reaction force’.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly for prevention. We need a European coastguard to watch over European interests and to prevent ships in distress from being passed from pillar to post by Member States who put their own interests first and in doing so make the wrong decisions. The coastguard must be the strong arm of the agency for maritime safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European civil protection intervention corps must be able to turn out immediately in an emergency and arrive with its own equipment. These ‘Green Helmets’ will then be able to step in anywhere in the European Union, as not all Member States have the equipment and expertise needed to tackle disasters. I witnessed what was happening in Galicia a week after the disaster, and I saw what a difficult job our Belgian civil protection intervention corps had to do and how long an action of this kind takes to get under way. I have been told that big construction companies are now having to be called in. This is of course unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to ask the Council to urgently direct its attention to the liability directive, as this lies at the heart of the problem of maritime transport, both in Europe and worldwide.

I would like to say here – it has already been said, but I would like to repeat it – that the Galician Parliament has set up, today and with the agreement of all the political parties, a committee of inquiry. It is applying the principle of subsidiarity so that the closest politicians investigate the matter and therefore we, together with the Liberal Group and the UEN Group, have tabled an amendment for a comprehensive technical inquiry to be undertaken into this complex aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to ask for more European means to achieve better coordination and civil protection; however, Mr President, seeking to use the tragedy for electoral gain, as some politicians are doing, is simply repulsive. I believe this division is damaging to the politicians themselves as well to the victims, who are confused and stunned both from the effects of the disaster and from seeing politicians attacking each other with their partisan egotism.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end, Mr President, by thanking, as a Galician European, all of Parliament and the institutions present here today, for the solidarity they are showing us and which I know they will continue to show us over the coming days. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think this House would do well to agree to that today and tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Arriving in Santiago de Compostela, one is aware that it marks the end of the Way of St James, with which the Commissioner will be familiar. The Way of St James is the route taken by pilgrims and sinners in order to do penance for their sins. We know that this path ought to be trudged by a whole host of Heads of State and Government, along with their Transport Ministers, in order to do penance for their sins of omission. The sin recorded against their names is that of inadequate port State control.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If you sign up to 25%, but only manage to come up with 9%, as one Member State has done, then that amounts to a great sin. The charge sheet reads: lack of a decent system of European ports of refuge. Mr Haarder, that was decided on a considerable time ago, but the Council has not yet set it up. The charge sheet reads: absolute failure when it comes to a compensation fund for oil disasters. Parliament decided on this one and a half years ago, but until today the Council has had nothing to say on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Haarder, the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> sailed past Copenhagen. Let us remind ourselves of the route it took. Coming from Latvia, it passed through the Baltic, the Skaggerak, the Channel, the Bay of Biscay and past Galicia – it could have happened anywhere. In the Baltic, though, there are four candidate countries, which keep themselves well covered when it comes to safety at sea. Malta and Cyprus were always among the flags of convenience under critical discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, what we need from the Commission by April 2003 is a report deciding whether and, if so, how all these candidate countries should play their part in Europe's policy on safety at sea. The <span class="italic">Prestige</span> – as Mr Haarder will be aware – could also have broken up in the ‘Kadettrinne’, one of the most dangerous places in the Baltic Sea, the scene of innumerable accidents, near-accidents and ships being driven the wrong way. This is where we need to make pilots mandatory. The Council and the Commission must bring pressure to bear on Russia in order to get a general requirement for pilots introduced via the IMO. This is one of the most dangerous places in Europe for traffic at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is our intention to withdraw single-hulled tankers from circulation, then we need more double-hulled tankers. Perhaps you could have a word with your fellow-Commissioner Mr Monti about what we should do about future aid for Europe's shipyards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that we should praise the incredible efforts of the people of Galicia and Spain, as well as the voluntary workers who travelled from many different parts of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we are able to welcome the proposals made by the Commission, the same does not apply to the decisions reached by the Council. I also regret, like other fellow Members, the fact that they are lacking in ambition. After the <span class="italic">Erika</span> disaster, and given the extent of the damage caused by the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, it is now urgent, Commissioner, to bring forward the date for applying the measures adopted. I am, however, also of the opinion that they are still inadequate. Prevention also means demonstrating to charterers, ship-owners, cargo owners, even classification societies, that their criminal and financial responsibility will be fully engaged if legislation is not observed and if a disaster occurs. Prevention also means taking the swift and courageous decision to ban flags of convenience in the territorial waters of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This disaster once again highlights the harmful consequences of liberalisation of the maritime industry, which has led to rules on safety and social welfare being compromised. Europe should send a clear message to the maritime industry by proposing significant improvements to the social situation of sea-workers and by involving their organisations, as well as citizens’ associations, in drawing up and implementing specific and essential new measures to enhance safety at sea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was delighted to read the resolutions from the Transport Ministers' Council of 5 and 6 December on increased safety at sea, but – alas – I have no faith in them.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you two examples. Up until now, the Council has always done its utmost to defend the use of single-hulled tankers up to 2015, and suddenly the Transport Ministers in Council announce an immediate end to the use of single-hulled tankers for the transport of heavy oil. In addition, there is this wonderful question, Mr President-in-Office: by virtue of which law is this to come about? We cannot make it Community law within the next couple of weeks. Can you quote me any national regulations that will put the Member States in any sort of position to implement the ban on single-hulled tankers?</p>
<p class="contents">My second point, Mr President-in-Office, is that Mr Piecyk and others have already referred to the fact that a number of Member States are failing to meet the obligation imposed on them by the port state directive of controlling 25% of the vessels calling at EU ports. Now, acting through the Council of Transport Ministers, the Council has decided to increase its efforts to step up monitoring of controls, if at all possible by 1 January. Can you, in your capacity as President-in-Office, confirm how many posts have been newly created for inspectors, and in which countries, in the course of the last week or the last ten days, and how many qualified applicants there are for these positions as inspectors? You see, Mr President-in-Office, passing fine resolutions is no use at all. What we want you to tell us is how they are to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to refer back to Mr Sterckx, who wrote the report on ports of refuge. He is perfectly right, and here too, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the same questions arise. You have now said that the Member States should set up ports of refuge and register them more quickly, but I would like you to tell us how you propose to ensure that, once the individual states have designated the ports of refuge, they are actually set up. Let us remember that the <span class="italic">Erika</span> wanted to call at a port and was not allowed to, and the question is similar when it comes to the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>: if she had called at a port, might she not have avoided breaking up, might it not have been possible to pump out the crude oil more easily and to avoid a disaster of such a magnitude? Mr President-in-Office, how do you intend to make sure that the Member States do actually set up these ports of refuge so as to avoid greater calamities?</p>

<p class="contents">It is precisely the European public, shocked at this appalling event, and the upset and fury of all those affected – particularly the wonderful Galician coastline and its communities – that are demanding that such a situation must not be allowed to happen again on our common coastline. It is the citizens that are hoping that Galicia will be given appropriate assistance by the EU. A committee of inquiry is required, in order to shed light on all the circumstances of the disaster and to determine responsibility so that we can learn lessons for the future. Europe’s citizens are demanding that legislation be made tougher, and that it enter into force and be implemented earlier than planned, without further ado.</p>
<p class="contents">Protecting Europe’s maritime industry must increasingly be a common concern and therefore a common policy. Protecting the marine environment and the European coast are now major challenges for us all.</p>
<p class="contents">If the tragedy of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> serves to raise political consciousness and to stimulate action, the despair and the fury of the Galician people – and ours too – will not have been in vain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As time passes, the true scale of this disaster is becoming ever clearer. I hope that the investigation requested by Parliament will be undertaken in a thorough and timely manner. And, as I have already said in this Chamber, we must also clear up the mysterious change of direction taken by the ship which, after moving westwards, turned suddenly towards the South, until it sank, thirty miles outside Portuguese waters.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need to do now, however, is to talk more about the future and this is why I would like to address four issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the European Union must provide funds to compensate, as much as possible, for the damage caused by the oil slick. In this context, I believe we would be justified in mobilising the EU Solidarity Fund, which has not yet been done.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect is that since this has clearly had a terrible effect on fishing and shellfish farming, we must consider a more integrated and far-reaching package of measures that will provide practical responses for the communities that have been affected.</p>
<p class="contents">The third aspect is that a technically and scientifically justified decision must be taken on what to do with the ship, which is now lying on the ocean floor with its 60 000 tonnes of oil. Unless this is resolved, we will be condemned not only to an oil slick but to a succession of oil slicks for months and years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to emphasise that it is now time to properly establish the European Maritime Safety Agency, which means that the Council must agree on where it should be based. To conclude, I wish to say that we want there to be a rigorous inquiry, as Parliament has already called for. What we do not want is for Parliament to be used to debate a country’s domestic problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There has been talk of a temporary committee of inquiry, in accordance with Rule 150 of the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, which must be justified on the grounds of non-compliance with European legislation. What grounds have we heard here?</p>
<p class="contents">To know what has happened; clearly we all want to know what has happened, but we are not going to achieve this through a parliamentary committee. We will be told this in the reports of the experts and that is why the PPE-DE Group’s proposal is that it should be the Commission that informs the Council and Parliament by means of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">Assessing the damage; criticisms are being made, although the time limit for assessing damage ends on 23 January, but today, at the beginning of December, the Spanish State is being criticised for not having assessed the damage.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures to be adopted; Spain has adopted measures. Coordinating 10 000 volunteers, coordinating the work of the institutions, coordinating international aid; what is coordinating all of this are the measures that have been adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Mobilise the European institutions; yesterday we had a meeting with Commissioner Barnier, during which he acknowledged the talks and contacts he had had with the Spanish Government. The fishermen are being paid, aid is arriving. Therefore, what are the justified grounds? They do not exist. Simply a will to criticise for political reasons in view of the elections, and this is neither the forum nor the place, and you will not find us participating. You will find us helping the Galicians, you will find us helping the Spanish and saving these coasts. That is what we are working on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is not fair to say that the Council has done nothing, and therefore I would like to start by quoting from the Copenhagen conclusions, which state that ‘the conclusions of the meeting of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of 6 December 2002 and of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy of 9 December 2002 should be implemented straight away in every respect’. It then continues by expressing satisfaction with the Commission’s work in respect of the economic, social and environmental consequences of the loss of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. It also expresses satisfaction with the Commission’s intention to investigate the need for further specific measures, including in respect of liability and associated sanctions. There was thus complete support in Copenhagen for Mrs de Palacio and for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, was decided in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on 5-6 December? It was a series of paragraphs which approximately correspond to Parliament’s viewpoints, which are indeed vigorous on a great many points and which already meet nearly all the requirements put forward here in this House. Naturally, there is a certain justification in saying that if steps had been taken a long time ago the catastrophe might possibly have been avoided – yes, we must acknowledge that fact. But now something is being done, and what is being done is exactly what the honourable speakers have asked for, and the rapid action taken by the Commissioner has been applauded.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to Mr Simpson that one of the issues is, of course, that of the parties responsible having to pay. There are two types of liability. The first is to be met by the funds for covering expenditure on cleaning up beaches and providing compensation for fishermen – and there is nothing to suggest that these funds are insufficient to cover the expenses concerned. There is also, however, the liability for environmental damage, of course. The possibility of requiring greater liability to be accepted is open to discussion; and it is agreed that, if at all possible, there must be a requirement to accept such liability.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sterckx and others are right in saying that it is not the number of inspections which is crucial, but that inspection is carried out at the right points. It is a requirement that 25% are to be inspected; it is also correct that some countries are not meeting this requirement – and naturally that is wrong. The crucial thing, however, is that the right places be inspected and that they be inspected in the right way.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ramos was concerned by certain attacks on the Spanish Government. Having been present at the debate in Copenhagen, I would like to bear witness to the fact that the Spanish Government put these problems right at the top of the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of coastguards and agencies, I would refer to sections 7 and 9 of the Transport Ministers’ resolution of 5-6 December. With regard to the imposition of liability, I would refer to section 18. It must be conceded, however, that section 18 of the resolution is not particularly strong, and I believe there is a common hope that the Commission can come up with a stronger solution than that which is being prepared, and I believe that such a solution will have the Council’s blessing.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to ports of refuge, which I did not manage to mention, I refer to section 8 – where the issue of ports of refuge is expressly mentioned, and that is my reply to Mr Jarzembowski.</p>
<p class="contents">My final advice to Parliament is as follows: hold the Council to the right declarations that have been made. That applies to the European Council, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Hold the Council to the right things that have been decided. After all, Parliament and the Council are in agreement concerning what is to be done; the task now is to put it into practice, as many speakers have also said. I wish Parliament luck with this and with providing inspiration to forthcoming presidencies in the years ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having said this, however, I would also like to say to the honourable Members and to everybody, let there be no mistake, that out there in waters off our coasts and other coasts of the world, there are currently more than 400 <span class="italic">Erikas</span> or <span class="italic">Prestiges</span>. There are such vessels with more than 20 000 tonnes of oil or more than 30 000 tonnes of oil-based products. There are 258 of a lesser tonnage, with 10 000, 20 000 and 30 000 tonnes approximately, which are also quantities which can cause enormous pollution. And what we have to do is respond so that, as soon as possible, these vessels are no longer off our coasts or, if possible, anywhere in the world. This is what we have to do and we must do it now. That is what we are talking about. And this is the first issue we have to confront here.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Erika<span class="italic"> </span>I and Erika II packages must be implemented straight away. And what does this mean? Implementing them in terms of the controls of the port authorities, and several Members have mentioned this, and it is true that there are two countries which do not even comply with the current legislation which is much more lax and less complicated to implement. It is urgent that they do so and they have committed themselves politically to it. The Agency, which will soon be operational – its board of management has already met, because we have brought forward its implementation and although it does not yet have its final headquarters it is beginning to function already – will have to ensure that in all ports of the Union – and it must be in all of them, since there cannot be ports of convenience in the European Union – appropriate controls are carried out in the appropriate way.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, however, the Council must approve, by March, the regulations that the Commission will present by the end of the year on the accelerated withdrawal of single-hull vessels from European ports and the European prohibition of the use of single-hull vessels for the transport of heavy oil and bituminous products, tar and more polluting products.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make progress in the field of responsibilities and I hope that, in agreement with Commissioner Vitorino, we can quickly present this Parliament and the Council with a proposal for a criminal definition of serious negligence. And we must continue to make progress because, let us not beat about the bush, who is responsible here, who is responsible for the <span class="italic">Erika</span>? Firstly, we know very well, the shipowners, who have ships in bad condition. And those who charter ships at a low cost because it is cheaper and optimises certain profits and who do not care that there are risks, which are then suffered by coastal populations and society as a whole. This is what we have to prevent once and for all. And this means making progress in the field of responsibility and preventing this whole chain of companies involved from evading responsibility. But this means action on an international level as well as on a European Union level.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">And this means, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission must be a full member of the International Maritime Organisation in order to be able to promote its work. The fifteen States are already members and have acted in a coordinated fashion, but more is needed, the Commission must also be able to participate in this forum, in which it will be able to promote issues such as the responsibility of States with flags of convenience, that is, the system of obligatory audits which is being proposed within the context of the International Maritime Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">And we must make progress on the issue of flags of convenience. Ladies and gentlemen, we must distinguish between two types of flag of convenience: fiscal and financial convenience and the convenience of those States which give their flags to wrecks, to ecological time-bombs, to ships which under no circumstances deserve to sail the seas. We must combat both types and I am also prepared to combat those which simply become tax havens.</p>
<p class="contents">Also within the context of the IMO, the FIFG Funds, achieving the EUR 1 000 million we have proposed and if not, to promote the complementary European fund which is on the table in the Council of Ministers and which, of course, if in May there is no resolution within the IMO, will have to be approved quickly so that we may at least have that complementary fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, somebody spoke of the human factor: crews. Before the summer you will have proposals under the Greek Presidency which place great emphasis on promoting training and which furthermore – let us make this clear since there are many different opinions on this – clearly opts for a quality maritime sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that we must continue to make progress on international maritime law. We all know that it takes years, but we must do what is necessary so that it takes as little time as possible, and meanwhile we must talk to our neighbours. We must talk to Russia, we have the Baltic, which is an enclosed sea, where any accident, just as with the Mediterranean, would be much more tragic and would have much more dramatic consequences from an environmental point of view than in an open sea such as the Atlantic Ocean, which has greater capacity for regeneration.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore we have to speak not only to Russia, but to all the countries of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, that is, the Mediterranean in the broadest sense. Because we must manage to strengthen, guarantee and safeguard all our coasts and those of our neighbours and make progress in the international field.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Members say that there has been no progress at the Copenhagen European Council. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that I have the conclusions of the Council of Nice and, in fact, they ask for the Erika I and Erika II packages to be implemented as soon as possible, even before the dates for their entry into force, and this has not been done. Copenhagen has said the same thing, and I hope that this time it will be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is too horrendous that after the <span class="italic">Erika</span> we are now talking about the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. I am sure that this time the States of the Union will really honour what they have said. And if not, we will say it and remind them of it here; and if not, I hope that all the honourable Members with connections and with national parties will raise the issue by means of your colleagues in national Parliaments as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the Commission, by means of the Agency and the reports we will present here, will specifically monitor true compliance by the Member States with the issues agreed. Amongst other things, the entry into force of the Erika I and Erika II packages, without waiting for 30 June 2003 or February 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out, ladies and gentlemen, that this includes, for example, ports of refuge, which have until February 2004. I do not believe we can wait until February 2004. We have to get to work now and in January we are going to begin talking to the Member States in order to confront this.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us make it very clear that a port of refuge is not just any port. A port of refuge must be a port with special facilities, easily accessible, so that a vessel with manoeuvring difficulties can access it during difficult storms. Because that is when accidents take place. They take place when the sea is rough, with winds of more than 100 kilometres per hour, in situations where ships have problems with manoeuvrability, with waves of 8 or 10 metres as in the case of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> or the <span class="italic">Erika.</span> This means equipping these ports in a special way, providing them with access which is particularly easy and suitable. Providing them with material and human resources and action plans which allow them to deal with emergency situations. And that is what we have to deal with. Ladies and gentlemen, do not confuse a port of refuge with just any port, they are different things and this is a very complex issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to continue with the issue of funds, which the honourable Members have mentioned. Ladies and gentlemen, in the case of the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>I believe that European solidarity is clear. In the case of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, do you know how much support and contribution to funds Europe has provided? Well I will tell you: a reprogramming of EUR 10 million, of the Objective 2 funds, which Brittany benefited from.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, it is true that the disaster is even greater. But we are talking about a reprogramming of fisheries funds – FIFG Funds – of a supplement of other funds relating to fisheries which would be added to those FIFG Funds, we are talking about access to the Solidarity Fund to combat disasters which, it is true, is 2.5% of the amount for disasters, no more, but it is a European solidarity effort in any case. We are also talking about reprogramming the Cohesion Funds or Structural Funds allocated to Spain or to Galicia.</p>
<p class="contents">European solidarity is shown through funds and the Commission has been able to use them, as have the authorities, for example, of the Council, which has said yes clearly, and which has raised the possibility of adopting additional specific measures because, ladies and gentlemen, there are unfortunately still 50 000 tonnes of fuel oil on the sea bed.</p>
<p class="contents">50 000 tonnes of fuel oil in two wrecks which, unfortunately, are still leaking oil. The Commission is also participating in the Scientific Committee organised by the Spanish Government, which also includes French representatives and, if I am not mistaken, Portuguese representatives, and I hope that that scientific committee will tell us soon exactly how that fuel oil on the sea bed is developing. Because naturally what we cannot tolerate is that these two submerged sections of hull should continue giving out and expanding the oil slick. We must provide a solution. We will have to see what solutions are possible and we will also have to see how Europe can show solidarity, and I sure there will be no lack of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, coastguards have been mentioned. I believe we must make progress on this, but I would also like to say that while we are able to create coastguards and other European bodies, which I am sure we will create in the future, what we need, at least, is to improve the coordination of all the maritime services in the States of the Union. I hope that, following this tragedy, all of this will be strengthened and that we will be able to make further progress and prevent any more tragedies such as the <span class="italic">Erika</span> or the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>.</p>

<p class="contents">I really do not understand Mr Galeote. I do not understand why Mr Galeote is determined to turn a European debate into a Spanish debate. I do not understand why he provokes us, I do not understand this narrow nationalist attitude, trying to bring about a debate amongst Spaniards, when what we should do is resolve – as the Commissioner has said – a problem which is European and which should be resolved from a European perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr Galeote, from one Spaniard to another, I will define what I think of your attitude by means of two traditional sayings. The first is that ‘offence is not caused by those who want to but by those who can’, and the second, which is also very traditional and descriptive, because we all have memories and we all have history, Mr Galeote, is that ‘the thief believes that everybody is like him’. History has recorded what your attitudes have been and what our attitudes have been and still are, the attitudes of the Spanish Socialists here in this Parliament and those of the Spanish Socialists down there, in the Spanish Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
