<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes Mira,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, the Commission has today adopted three recommendations regarding three Council opinions on the updated stability programmes in Germany, the Netherlands and Finland; these are the first of the 2000-2001 round that have been updated and submitted.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will remember, the Stability and Growth Pact stipulates close, on-going supervision of the Member States’ budgetary position during the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union. The central elements in this supervision process are the stability programmes, which the Member States in the euro area have to present every year. The countries outside the euro area present their convergence programmes, which to a great extent resemble the stability programmes, although the objectives to be achieved are different.</p>
<p class="contents">The stability programmes include the public finance strategies for the medium term. How can they achieve a budgetary position in the medium term that is close to balance or in surplus? The aim of this initiative, as you will remember, is to try to create sufficient margin so that in a crisis situation the government deficit will not exceed the reference budget deficit set at 3% of GDP, which could obviously be reached in a crisis phase. This means we have to make the most of the growth phases of the cycle to bring the position back to balance or a surplus. In their updating of the programmes each year, the Member States include an extra year in the programme, analyse the budget policy implemented during the past year, explain and describe the budget policy measures they have adopted, and also revise their budget forecasts and objectives. This is the second time we have updated these programmes: we did it first in 1999, and now we are doing it again in 2000, thereby including one more year in the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The document presented by a Member State is assessed by the Commission and, on the basis of this assessment, the Council may adopt the recommendation that the Commission presents. In fact, in order to carry out this process, the Economic and Financial Committee first pays special attention to analysing the Commission recommendation and the programmes themselves. In this context, to keep Parliament informed, the Commission considers it indispensable to report to it on the current stage of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the regular annual budget assessment procedure, the Commission can also choose to make recommendations of a different kind from those mentioned previously, which may, if appropriate, highlight the non-compliance of certain Member States with the deficit position. As yet, it has not been necessary to use this instrument for coordinating economic policies; so far budgetary compliance has been working as laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact. More and more Member States are reaching balanced or even clearly positive budgetary positions. This has given us a different idea, making us wonder whether this Stability and Growth Pact has run its course, having achieved the quantitative objective of a particular final figure, or whether it is worth introducing other aspects relating to the quality of public finances in future programmes. The Commission has opted for this second possibility; hence, in our annual assessment, we shall now also review other aspects previously not considered in the past: first, the orientation of budget policy in each of the Member States according to the point in the cycle at which it finds itself, that is, whether these kinds of budgetary measures are procyclic or anticyclic in nature and to what extent they help the market situation or create tensions within it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we shall also try to assess to what extent budget cuts and tax cuts are consistent, according to a number of principles which may enable us to adopt a common position on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly – and this is a very important issue – we shall assess to what extent there is a restructuring of public expenditure to favour growth, production, and thus avoid inflationary tensions in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we shall assess to what extent the national budgets presented each year are compatible with more ambitious medium-term strategies for public finances. Thus, for instance, problems such as the ageing of the population are becoming increasingly more important. In this respect may I just remind you that the last Ecofin Council asked the Commission to include in the assessment of the stability programmes from next year precisely this long-term aspect of public finances in connection with the ageing of the population. Of the three programmes on which I am about to comment, one of them – the Netherlands programme – already includes an annex with a specific analysis of this particular problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I am now going to give a very brief mention of the three programmes that have recently been updated. First of all, the three Member States whose stability programmes have been examined by the Commission today have made highly significant progress towards the restructuring of their public exchequers since 1997, the year in which they made their decisions to join the single currency; in fact, Finland already had a budget surplus in 1998 and the Netherlands in 1999. In their new programmes, which cover up to 2004, Finland proposes to maintain a budget surplus of more than 4% of GDP. The Netherlands will achieve small surpluses, which might be larger depending on economic growth and certain decisions on economic policy that are waiting to be adopted. The case of Germany is different: it will gradually approach an overall balance. However, in all three cases, there is sufficient margin to absorb the effect of fluctuations in the economic cycle; in other words, all three countries will be able to face a crisis situation, if one comes about, without exceeding the 3% budget deficit limit.</p>
<p class="contents">The three countries plan to introduce major tax cuts in 2001 and in subsequent years, which will relieve the tax pressure on labour and stimulate employment and investment; they are therefore positive and necessary provided that the public finances are kept stable. Germany and the Netherlands both foresee a deterioration in their budget positions for the next year as a result of these tax cuts. This issue is particularly important in the case of Germany since it means the gradual reduction of the public deficit will be interrupted. One of our concerns with the German programme is clearly to insist that this dip in the trend must be a one-year exception arising from these tax cuts and must not affect future years. In the case of the Netherlands, the Commission has other concerns, such as the suitability of the policy mix and the risks associated with the fiscal incentive effects of the tax cuts in a situation of strong economic growth, which might lead to the Netherlands economy overheating. Our basic message is, therefore, that the margin for making tax cuts must be counterbalanced by strict public spending controls.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, Germany and the Netherlands have gained substantial revenue through the sale of third generation mobile telephony licences. In the case of Germany, for instance, this represents 2.5% of GDP, and in the Netherlands 0.7% of GDP. Both countries have very consistently made proper use of this revenue by using it to reduce the national debt.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of this factor and, more importantly, better budgetary positions and stronger economic growth, there will be a clear tendency for the proportions of national debt to fall over the coming years. This year, for instance, Germany hopes to bring this proportion down to the reference level of 60% of GDP, and the Netherlands hopes to bring it even lower than that this year. In the case of Finland, the national debt is already much lower than this target and is falling all the time. These trends in the national debt mean lower interest payments, which will, in turn, help provide the necessary framework for tax cuts, and in some cases for specific increases in public spending.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the positive characteristics of the Netherlands programme, as I have said before, is the special attention it gives to the impact of the ageing of the population on the exchequer over the coming years. This is a problem which will also have to be faced to a greater or lesser extent in other Member States, as was emphasised at the latest meetings of Eurogroup and the Ecofin Council. Bearing in mind that costs will increase in the future, certain decisions will soon have to be made in order to contain them and ensure they can be managed in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">Based on its own programme, the Netherlands Government is to make important decisions on the use of its budget margins, and it would be appropriate if it used these resources to bring the national debt down more quickly, which would give it greater margins to face these problems in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Finnish Government’s ambitious budgetary surplus targets are already motivated to a great extent by this ageing factor that I have mentioned. We also hope that the next updating of the German stability programme will pay more attention to this aspect, taking into account the impact of the pension reform that is now under way.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Commission is delighted by the speed with which Germany, the Netherlands and Finland have presented their updated programmes. In the last two countries, the programmes were adopted at the same time as the budget proposals for the coming year, which in the Commission’s opinion is a more suitable practice than used to happen, when we received these updates after each country’s budget had been presented. This ensures that the annual budget decisions are made within a multiannual strategic framework and gives the Community institutions an up-to-date, overall view of each country’s economic situation based on the most recent data.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore recommends that the remaining Member States that are still preparing their updates should follow this example, not this year, when unfortunately it can no longer happen, but in future years.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the basic comments that I wished to make on the three programmes we present today. I am at your disposal for any additional comment, to listen to your opinions and to answer any questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that, overall, the message here is a positive one. When the Maastricht Treaty was drawn up, it was assumed that maximum permissible net government borrowing would be 3%. Today, taking the average for the euro area, it has dropped back to around 1%, and we are moving towards balanced budgets, that is to say very much in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, does it not worry you that it appears that in Germany next year, instead of falling, net government borrowing will increase by a further 0.5%, despite the fact that income from UMTS licences this year has been like manna from heaven for Germany's finances? We have noted that this development is taking place in the largest country in the euro area, whereas the Netherlands and Finland have already achieved what we are seeking, that is budget surpluses which enable excessive debt to be repaid. So let me ask you once again: does this not worry you? I would like to stress once again that we in the Group of the European People's Party regard the independence of the European Central Bank, combined with consistent application of stability and growth factors, as being a fundamental requirement for price stability in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, the proceeds of the UMTS licences, as I said before, have been allocated to reducing the debt, so that the national debt is now practically down to the 60% level.</p>
<p class="contents">For accounting reasons, the revenue from the third generation mobile licences also has to be included for reducing the deficit. For this reason, the budget result for the year 2000 in the case of Germany will give a surplus of one and a half per cent of GDP. If we deduct the revenue from mobile licences from this one and a half per cent, we are left with a 1% budget deficit, which is the figure we can use for the stability programme. Therefore, to answer your question, we will have a situation of a 1.4% deficit in 1999, a 1% deficit in 2000, and – as you rightly say – in 2001 the deficit will rise again to 1.5% instead of falling.</p>
<p class="contents">Why does the Commission accept this increase in the deficit? Basically, because of the positive impact that the tax measures may have in Germany. Germany has a higher than average tax burden. The set of tax measures adopted by Germany affects the supply side of the economy more than the demand side but will also have some effect on demand, and we believe it will allow the growth potential of the German economy to increase in the medium term. We therefore consider these measures to be positive, even though they mean a step backwards compared with the previous situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless – and we left this very explicitly set out in the programme – we are especially concerned about this backward step, and we are aware that such backward steps have to be made up later. Hence we must insist on the German Government taking special care when drawing up the working programmes for 2002, on increasing revenue and on cutting costs in order to achieve a reduction in the budget deficit again.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the current programme, the budget deficit should drop to 1% in 2002 and 0.5% in 2003, and Germany should balance its budget in 2004. A little late and not quite as we would have liked, but in any case with enough margin not to have difficulties in the event of an economic crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They state that, in one of the largest countries – which is also one of the most important countries for the European economy, namely Germany – there is a risk of jumping into something resembling overheating. I should like to hear your assessment of inflationary development in Germany and ask whether you think that inflation in the EU generally is cause for concern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The overheating problem does not arise in Germany in the same way as it does in these other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt at all that inflation is a worry. We must not forget that we have had a double setback in the last year, as a result of oil prices trebling in little more than a year. If we add to that the fall in the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar, we have had an obvious setback in terms of inflation.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, at the moment we have an inflation figure of 2.8%, clearly higher than our target as defined by the Central Bank. Underlying inflation, however, is still only 1.4%, which means we can consider oil to be the basic and fundamental cause of this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">What are our inflation prospects? I shall be able to comment on this in more detail after the 22nd, when we present our economic perspective for the coming year, but according to our initial estimates, in 2000 we shall end up with an average level of inflation a little above the inflation target laid down by the Central Bank, but clearly higher than what we had forecast in our April perspective – we had talked of 1.8% then. In 2001 it will be higher than the forecast we had also made in the spring, which was also about 1.8 or 1.7%. The average will, however, be much closer to 2%, which, as I have said, is the target of the Central Bank’s monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">All this will, of course, happen if we do not have any new surprises with oil prices or the dollar exchange rate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In last July's publication, the European Central Bank indicated a way, in the social security plans reform – that is, moving from the current "Pay-as-you-go" system to a funded system for mandatory contributions as well – of freeing up resources and, in perspective, ensuring the sustainability of European social security plans.

The Commission brought up the issue at the time and the Lisbon European Council accepted the need to analyse in depth the problem of the ageing of the population in Europe. In fact, with the Commission’s cooperation, the Economic Policy Committee has been working on this topic for the last few months. At the last Ecofin council meeting, a report by the Economic Policy Committee was presented which, in general terms, highlighted the fact that there is a problem of ageing in general in Europe, but not exactly the same in all countries. There are very important differences in countries such as Ireland, for instance, which has a very young population and which still has room for an increase in the activity rate compared with countries with higher activity rates and older populations.</p>
<p class="contents">The report emphasises the fact that the reforms carried out so far in the social security systems are helping to improve the situation. It also emphasises that national debt reductions, insofar as they can reduce future deficits, may help to resolve the situation. In the medium term, I can tell you that the situation over the next twenty years will vary from country to country, but it will mean an extra 2% to 7% increase in government deficit, depending on the characteristics of each country. Nonetheless, these two elements will not be enough to deal with the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the solution that can be adopted, it will, of course, be a national decision to be made in each of the Member States; the Commission will not make any proposals in this regard. At the moment the impression I have is that the formulas being used in the various Member States are moving in three directions. First they are moving towards a search for some system for financing the pay-as-you-go schemes, which may mean some element of pre-funding; I mentioned the Dutch system before, which already has obvious pre-funding elements. They are also moving towards making a public pay-as-you-go scheme compatible with private pre-funding schemes, and of course they are also compatible with support for the setting up of specific investment funds, which may obtain long-term tax advantages and may help to deal with the ageing problem. But, in the end, it will be each Member State’s own decision that prevails, because, as I have said before, this matter is the responsibility of each one of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
