They were prepared to make many compromises, and I am particularly grateful to them for that fact. I should also like to thank the Commissioner responsible, who is present in the Chamber today, for his willingness to compromise on many points of detail that were of crucial significance for Parliament. This will make it a great deal easier for Members to vote in favour of a slightly amended version of the Common Position.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address five issues that we regard as being of paramount importance. The directive – which, it must be admitted in a spirit of self-criticism, is not immediately comprehensible to the general public – was aimed at establishing a clearer distinction between this and other directives. One problem has arisen in this regard, however, namely the Tractor Directive. Whereas tractors did not previously fall under the scope of the Machinery Directive as well as that of the Tractor Directive, they are now covered by both. This is a heavy double burden to impose on manufacturers, and one that we would have liked to avoid. The Tractor Seats Directive is of course a further issue, and Mr Verheugen cannot have failed to notice the reports in German newspapers claiming that this Directive is regarded, both in Germany and elsewhere, as nothing less than a bureaucratic monstrosity. It is for this reason that I am extremely grateful to him for working together with us towards our goal, even though the work is perhaps not progressing quite as quickly as we might all have liked. This goal is to achieve a solution whereby machinery falls under the scope of only one directive, or in other words whereby the Tractor Directive applies only to tractors, and the Machinery Directive applies to all other types of machinery.</p>
<p class="contents">Our task now is to ensure that we achieve this goal as soon as possible. My wish would of course be for the revision of the Tractor Directive, and the incorporation of all the risks not yet addressed, to be completed within the 18 months that the Member States will need to implement the Machinery Directive. I am aware that such wishes cannot always be granted immediately, but I should like to set a goal of 18 months, which would take us up to the deadline for implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that I would have liked to make more headway on certain issues in my capacity as rapporteur. An example of one such issue is the granting of exemptions for harmless types of machinery such as wristwatches. In the end, however, I withdrew my amendment to this effect in response to the serious concerns, most of which were voiced by the Commission, over the safety loopholes that could arise as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, Parliament has made a considerable step forward from the original Common Position as far as the confidentiality of trade secrets is concerned, and in my opinion the same also applies to the scrapping of machinery. We are of course all aware that sustainable production is crucially important for Europe, <span class="italic">inter alia </span>with a view to meeting the Lisbon goals, but there can be no question that we were right to avoid making manufacturers responsible across the board, as it were, for the scrapping of machinery, since it is genuinely impossible for them to know all the details of the scrapping process in advance. Furthermore, these manufacturers are often small and medium-sized enterprises. It is also my belief that we still have more work to do together on the matter of certification, and especially third-party certification, since the position outlined in the Common Position with regard to the CE marking was in no way acceptable for the Members of this House. Regardless of the number of meetings that were needed to draft this Common Position, in our opinion it is not enough for the Council to cater to the lowest common denominator, and to put forward formal compromises worded in such a way that it is hard for anyone to understand them, let alone a member of the public or an SME owner.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, we too are aware of the difficulties faced in this respect, for example with regard to translation. In spite of this, however, our goal must be to draft legislative texts that the general public can understand, and indeed this is a cause that Mr Verheugen has made his own.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that we have taken a small step forward on the issue of the CE marking. Although in my opinion we still need to do more, you did in fact make express reference to the ‘new approach’ to the CE marking in your 2006 work programme, so I do not want to spend too much time complaining about it now. I believe that the time has now come to take a broader and more coherent approach and to ensure that the regulations governing the use of the CE marking are the same in all sectors. Not only would this be advantageous in itself, but in my opinion it would also fall under the heading of better regulation. Nevertheless, when drafting this legislation we must once again give serious thought to the role of the CE marking in the European Union, to the quality and safety standards that we associate with it and to the bodies that are responsible for monitoring these standards. The reason I say this is because I believe that we still have work ahead of us in the Member States in terms of explaining and debating the issue of market surveillance. It must not be the case that the European Union is made responsible for any problems that arise, even when the Member States have shirked their duties with regard to the time spent on surveillance.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, I should like to reiterate my warm thanks. I believe that we have made a certain amount of progress in terms of achieving better regulation and reducing red tape, but that much remains for us to do. In this connection, I am counting on the Commission to make good headway with new proposals, in particular on the subject of tractors, in order to bring us closer to our goal of better regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The situation in which we find ourselves today could be aptly summed up by the famous proverb, ‘good things come to those who wait’. The history of the revision of the Machinery Directive is a very long one. It originally began with a recommendation by the ‘Molitor group’, which was a forerunner of the present Commission’s ‘better regulation’ initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Commission presented its proposal for a directive in early 2001, following lengthy discussions with all those involved, no one expected that it would take five years and a record-breaking 43 Council working group meetings to complete this revision, to say nothing of Parliament’s work. The length of these discussions was due to the considerable size and complexity of the sector affected by the directive, by which I mean the mechanical engineering sector, which covers a very diverse range of products, including machinery, mechanical appliances and their components. At the same time, however, it is also a sector that is of crucial importance to the EU economy, and one of the best-performing industrial sectors. In 2004, the mechanical engineering sector in the European Union produced goods worth EUR 402 billion and employed over 2.6 million engineers, technicians and other workers, most of whom were highly qualified. Mechanical engineering production in the EU exceeds that in Japan and the USA by a long way. The European Union is the world’s largest exporter of machinery and mechanical appliances with exports worth EUR 150 billion, which puts us ahead of the USA with EUR 62 billion and Japan with EUR 67 billion. This is proof that we are dealing with a sector which can rightly be called a jewel of European industry, and which therefore really does merit particular attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we have a recommendation concerning amendments to the Common Position, we are very close to completing the legislative process involved in drafting a new Machinery Directive. I am delighted to be able to tell you that the Commission can accept in full the compromise reached by Parliament and the Council. In actual fact, the outcome of this compromise represents a significant improvement over the Machinery Directive 98/37/EC that is currently in force, and, as Mr Schwab has already mentioned, it is an excellent example of better regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The scope has now been defined in more detail and ambiguities ironed out, which means that legal certainty has been improved. The Directive had previously been given a number of different interpretations, which will no longer be the case. A much clearer distinction has been made between this and other directives, such as the Lift Directive or the Low Voltage Directive. Implementation of the Directive, including market surveillance and the monitoring of bodies charged with the task of certification by the Member States and notified to the Commission as such, has been made more efficient as a result of Parliament’s far-reaching amendments at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">The manufacturers of certain types of machinery which the scope of the Directive has been extended to cover will now also reap the benefits of the internal market. Users and workers will benefit from improved health protection and consumer protection, with such improvements having been made on the basis of our experience with the present Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the highly contentious matter of the relation in which other markings stand to the CE marking, I should like to confirm that this issue will be resolved in the course of the revision of the ‘new approach’, as stated in the following Commission declaration. I shall read out the Commission’s formal declaration once again: </p>
<p class="contents">‘Without prejudice to respect for Community legislation, the Commission, within the context of the revision of the new approach planned for mid-2006, will clarify the conditions for the affixing of other markings, whether national, European or private, in relation to the CE marking.’ </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> As far as the equally contentious issue of tractors is concerned, I should like to make it known that the Commission is absolutely committed to the principles set out in the two declarations, which I should also like to read out again.</p>
<p class="contents">The first declaration reads: </p>
<p class="contents">‘Parliament, the Council and the Commission declare that, in order to cover all aspects related to the health and safety of agricultural and forestry tractors in one harmonising directive, Directive 2003/37/EC on type-approval of agricultural and forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units needs to be modified so as to address all the relevant risks of the Machinery Directive. Such a modification of Directive 2003/37/EC should include an amendment of the Machinery Directive, in order to delete the expression ‘for the risks’ in Article 1(2)(e), first indent.’</p>
<p class="contents">The second declaration is as follows: ‘The Commission recognises the need to include in the Agricultural and Forestry Tractors Directives further requirements for risks not yet covered by those directives. To that end, the Commission is considering appropriate measures that include references to the United Nations regulations, CN and ISO standards, and OECD codes.’ </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> I hope that that answers any remaining questions to everyone’s satisfaction. I should like to reiterate my thanks for the genuinely positive and constructive cooperation afforded by the House, and also to thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very pleased with what the Commissioner said and with the agreement that we have reached to secure a second reading confirmation with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pick up one or two of the policy issues. As the Commissioner indicated, it has been a long and sometimes bumpy road towards the final agreement on this very complex text. Looking forward, and in the light of his determined commitment to the better regulation agenda, we need to keep a close eye on the implementation and effectiveness of this directive. I fear that it may be extremely costly to implement and we need to make sure that his services are keeping an eye on it and that it is not being duplicated by the national regulation. I welcome what he said about different marks, but we need to give serious consideration to the cost of regulatory compliance.</p>
<p class="contents">In that connection, I want to make two other points. I am pleased that the Council has recognised that it has to speed through the issue of tractors, because the lack of a harmonised type-approval process for a very important sector is scandalous, and Member States should be ashamed of their foot-dragging on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to draw his attention to another crucial machinery category, which is also partly affected by this directive, which is the whole issue about road-going machinery. I recently went to a conference of construction equipment manufacturers. They told me that, on their estimates, 70% of their research and development costs are absorbed by complying with regulation. How can we run a competitive European economy when we saddle a major industry with those sorts of compliance costs? I think we may have problems with this machinery directive, but the Commissioner must address that. I want to bring a delegation from the construction equipment manufacturers to see him as soon as possible to address their issues as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet this is no time at all in comparison to the service lives of machinery. Speaking as someone who has worked in the field of mechanical engineering for 20 years, I am of course aware of the significance of this directive, <span class="italic">inter alia </span>in terms of making legislation more consistent. Although many users were initially sceptical, it is my belief that more or less all doubts have now been dispelled. The first letters have arrived from people expressing their approval, and since our aim is to focus on the user and not to ignore public opinion, this approval is important.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is not only important for users, however, but also for millions of consumers, since it contains legal provisions that are of crucial significance for their health and safety. As the Commissioner said, one of the reasons why this revision was necessary was because earlier directives did not go far enough. Further reasons included the need to improve the necessary legal certainty, to define the scope in more detail and to safeguard the free movement of goods at the same time as ensuring a high level of health and safety protection for consumers. This should also be a priority goal for European industrial policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the Members of this House and, above all, the Commission and the Council for their excellent cooperation. It was nonetheless necessary for the Social Democrats to incorporate a number of key considerations, and indeed this meant that we had more in common with the Council during most of the rounds of discussion. For example, we want the Commission to develop guidelines to help the Member States to increase their capacities. This would enable effective market surveillance with a view to the uniform application of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, the Social Democrats also believed that confidentiality and trade secrets must not have a negative impact on personal health and safety. Another of our goals, and one which we have now achieved, was to lighten the burden on SMEs, without affecting the substance of the Directive or imposing additional costs. A further important aim for us was to ensure that the standards for disabled people using lifts were not compromised as a result of the revision of the Directive. We have achieved all these goals. We were opposed to agricultural and forestry tractors not being included, but we accept the Commissioner’s explanation. We would have preferred him to set a date, and to set a date of 2008, but since we will all still be Members of this Parliament at that point we will be able to ensure that the necessary steps are taken.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to exclude small appliances, Mr Schwab, because it is not just wristwatches that we are talking about, but fire extinguishers and similar small appliances that are relatively dangerous. Nevertheless, I believe that we have achieved a good compromise. The Social Democrats will vote in favour of it, and for once this week I should like to praise the British – and such praise is not something that can be taken for granted – since our cooperation with the British Presidency on this matter has also been excellent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a highly technical subject, but it will have a major impact on the European engineering industry and on the European economy as a whole. I would like to remind you of the figures that Mr Verheugen has already quoted, which, in fact, are even better than the ones I had. I cannot resist reminding you that the annual turnover in the sector is EUR 402 billion, of which EUR 113 billion a year comes from exports to third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The first reading reflected a reasonable compromise reached after years of debates. I well remember that simply laying down the definitions of machinery and partly completed machinery took considerable commitment during the previous mandate. During the second reading, for my part, I paid particular attention to the provisions of that directive relating to CE marking, as I felt that the wording was insufficiently clear in legal terms.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to the Council for having accepted my amendment, but I am delighted that the Commission is working on this subject, which still needs to be looked into more deeply. I would like to thank the rapporteur for the way he led the negotiations. We were able to make considerable progress towards a common position thanks to the informal three-way talks he arranged, bringing together the chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the shadow rapporteurs, the representatives of the European Commission and those of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We have reached a consensus awaited by all those in the industry. There are still some points that need to be clarified, particularly with regard to tractors, but I remain optimistic and I hope that the problems will be resolved by the effective implementation of this directive. As a consequence of this, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will vote for the compromise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although this is the case throughout the European Union, there can be no question that it holds particularly true in my home country. An interesting point that should therefore be stressed in this connection is that this Directive was drafted, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, in response to calls from industry, which went to a great deal of effort to get this Directive on the table, with the slogan of ‘one product, one regulation for the internal market’. It goes without saying that this is a positive development, given that one of the advantages of this legislation is that the same type of machinery, with the same design, can be put into circulation anywhere in the internal market. Additional tests in the various EU Member States would of course be unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">On the occasion of this second reading, and with the debate on the Services Directive in mind, I should like to make the following comment. If we were always to take this approach as our starting point for debates on the Services Directive, we would doubtless also make progress with that dossier. In this connection, I cannot help but mention that mechanical engineering in Europe is in fact particularly dependent on the Services Directive, because services as well as products are sold with machinery.</p>
<p class="contents">While on the subject, I should like to make a second comment of a political nature. It has been reiterated during today’s debate that this Directive was a very long time – five years, to be precise – in the making. For most of this time, the European Union had only 15 Member States. As we are all aware, the EU is now operating with 25 Member States. In view of this fact, and also in view of the planned reduction in the number of regulations, it should be noted that it will probably take a great deal longer to reach agreement on similar regulations in the future, and both industry and the political bodies responsible for such matters should be aware of this fact. The principle of ‘less is sometimes more’ also applies in this instance. If I may, therefore, I should like to emphasise once again how much I welcome this Directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank Mrs Weiler and Mrs De Vits, who have shown a high level of commitment and involvement on behalf of my group, thus ensuring that a certain amount of progress has been made in the course of their work with Mr Schwab.</p>
<p class="contents">Previous speakers have already referred to such key considerations as health, safety and consumer protection. These considerations are the basis for the quality characteristics that ensure that products such as machinery are market leaders, and that mean that our manufacturers are able to capture a large global market for their products. This is very much to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I can only agree with Mrs Weiler, who said that legal certainty is crucial in this connection. What legal certainty means is that mechanical engineers know exactly what rules they have to follow and what regulations are actually in force, and that they are not left in the dark. This in turn would also make it possible for us to have a well-functioning market in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, legal certainty also means that we must avoid a situation in which several different directives apply to one product. It means that we should push forward measures to put in place a uniform regime, especially in the case of the tractor directives. It is far from ideal that manufacturers should have to juggle different regulations, and it is also highly regrettable that we were unable to gain approval for our proposal that this issue should finally be resolved by 2008 at the latest. This is a real shame. I have not forgotten that we were told, when we discussed this issue once before with the Commission and the Council at first reading, that the goal was to have everything settled within the next six months. That was eighteen months ago. We were told the same during this year’s debate on the issue, namely that it would all be sorted out within the next six months.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore call on all those involved to ensure that this problem really is resolved without delay. We should not leave people in the dark, and this includes mechanical engineers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It illustrates that we in the European Union can make social legislation, even though we like to give it an economic twist. The upshot of the negotiations illustrates that Parliament very much has what it takes to make the difference, and I am indebted to the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, and to Mrs Weiler for the way in which they have dealt with this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is thanks to Parliament that consumers can no longer be led up the garden path and that the administrative burden for our companies will, as a result of markings other than CE, no longer be excessive. Parliament also made sure that real inspection of the most dangerous machinery becomes possible and that this will not be a formality, but it is now up to the Member States to really make something of this directive and turn it into an ambitious working instrument. That is why all Member States must get down to effective market control, for without this market control, this directive remains a paper tiger, as was already the case with the previous directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to the Commissioner that the Commission should, in my view, closely monitor the Member States’ commitment, check whether they carry out this market inspection and if necessary in future, take an initiative if it were to transpire that they fail to deliver on their promises, in the interest of workers, consumers and manufacturers alike. Our work is done for now, and I think that we will therefore be able to approve this directive tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
