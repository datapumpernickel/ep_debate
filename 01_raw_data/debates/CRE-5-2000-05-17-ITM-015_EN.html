<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Smet (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, this initiative report is the European Parliament’s contribution to the special session of the United Nations General Assembly which will be held in New York in three weeks’ time and where the actions of the past five years will be assessed as a follow-up to the World Conference on Women in Beijing and where, at the same time, a declaration will be issued to re-establish the commitments made and to see what needs to be done in the next five years. As such, it is an important report, because it will be the only report from the European Parliament. I hope that we will be given the opportunity – and this is also a request to the Commission – to do some preparatory work with the Commission before we leave for New York to ensure that we are singing from the same hymn sheet. </p>
<p class="contents">I think it is useful to be on the same wavelength because, as regards women’s liberation, we could expect Europe to play some sort of a pioneering role. Europe has done this in the past and we must be able to continue to do this. But before I talk about this pioneering role, I would like to say a few words about the assessment itself. </p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, it is particularly difficult to carry out an assessment if there is no data available to check on the precise extent of progress made by the different European countries over the past few years. No statistical data exists. There are reports on the twelve topics which we need to discuss in New York for each country, which show exactly how much progress has been made with the assessment. I am therefore delighted that you announced in the discussion on the fifth action programme that you would like to set up a kind of observatory where an effort will be made to collate all possible gender-related data. After all, there is an enormous gap in this field. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to direct my second point to Parliament itself. The efforts we needed to make in order to finish this report suggest that the Secretariat of the Women’s Committee is heavily understaffed. There was very little in the way of cooperation, and had it not been for the fact that Mrs Gröner and myself had hard-working collaborators, then there would probably not have been a report now. It is a disgrace for Parliament that other committees can apparently acquire excellent secretariats and well-equipped secretariats with many staff, but that this is not possible for the Women’s Committee. It may be useful that we, together with the women involved, should take an initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">That is all I have to say as regards assessment and I will not touch on it any further. For the next five years, I believe that the action programme, the five-year programme which the Commission is presenting for discussion at the moment, is of huge importance. It obviously comprises the traditional themes, which is quite normal because, although the world moves on, these themes are still on the agenda. Admittedly, there are new emphases but, at the end of the day, they are the same recurring themes. </p>
<p class="contents">The first theme I would like to mention is the world of employment and the new emphases which should, in my view, be applied. These include the new technologies and the fact that there are too few women in this sector, if any. This was also said a moment ago. Other matters to be emphasised are the division between work and family, as is provided for in the employment guidelines, and equal pay for equal work, something which I find the Commission is not emphasising enough and which is receiving insufficient attention. There is still a chasm between men and women in terms of wages.</p>
<p class="contents">Another theme is decision making. The Commission has made efforts, as has Europe, but mainly in the political sphere. I think that efforts should also be made with regard to both sides of industry. Far more attention should be paid to them since they manage and control a large part of social life. </p>
<p class="contents">On the theme of violence, too little attention is being paid to violence within the family, in my opinion. Attention is being paid to violence in the work sphere, and so forth, but not so much within the family. </p>
<p class="contents">In my view, more attention should be paid to the media, which is such a determining factor in social life. Women are very much absent in the media. </p>
<p class="contents">As for women’s rights and human rights, I hope that some progress can be made at the Intergovernmental Conference. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I already said that Europe is expected to play a pioneering role. I would mention two areas, in particular. Firstly, if we grant development aid or if we have contacts with third countries, we should not just prescribe conditions with regard to the economic position of women. We are now familiar with this. We know that in many developing countries, the economy is carried by women, and we support this. This much we now know. </p>
<p class="contents">What we do not emphasise enough in our contacts with third countries is that human rights should be respected with regard to women, too. What is happening in Afghanistan is unjustifiable. It is unjustifiable that, in a number of countries, female circumcision is still practised and that we maintain the best relations with these countries as a matter of course. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the Union’s enlargement to include the former Eastern Bloc countries, it will be vital that the screening report to be compiled by the Commission should give a sound account of what is happening there, because there are signs of regress instead of progress in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities have formed a critical appraisal of the twelve critical areas of concern, which are: poverty; education and training; health; violence; armed conflict; the economy; power and decision making; institutional mechanisms; human rights; media; the environment and the girl child. It now all depends on how we use the political will to bring about improvement in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would emphasise that the cooperation between the two co-rapporteurs has been highly constructive and we have focused on the measures taken by the EU and its Member States in this report. We endeavour to highlight any shortcomings and to make a series of recommendations that will help to speed up implementation of the action platform. I also see this report as an action plan for the EU delegation that is to take up an excellent negotiating position in New York, in June, and that is to strengthen women’s rights, in close cooperation with the representatives of governmental and non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Belém, and the Commissioner, for the fact that we worked so well together during the preparation process for the conference held in Brussels in February, and I hope that things will run as smoothly in future preparation processes.</p>
<p class="contents">We can go to New York with a whole string of achievements to our credit. The incorporation of equal opportunities into all policy areas, i.e. gender mainstreaming, has now been adopted as the guiding principle in a wide cross-section of EU policy areas. The accompanying positive action measures will be followed up in the fourth action platform, and no doubt in the fifth platform as well.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Notwithstanding the considerable progress we have made, one of our main tasks will be to turn rights into practice at long last. The Treaty of Amsterdam will help us there; specifically Articles 2 and 3, in which equality is defined as a goal and task of the Community, or Article 141, relating as it does to employment policy, where there is room for improvement. However, we still need a completely secure legal basis. The Treaty must include a single, coherent legal basis for equality between men and women in all policy areas, and another directive on the implementation of the positive action measures in Article 141. The fifth action platform is of prime importance and is ultimately also a decision-making Women’s and Equal Opportunities’ Council.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I believe – and my co-rapporteur has already highlighted this – that the European Union should step up cooperation and emphasise the gender perspective principle in its foreign relations, in the context of the enlargement process and with developing countries. If the empowerment of women proves to play a major part in the Fourth World Conference on Women, it will also take precedence where the development of the information society is concerned. It is all about jobs – we have taken careful note of this – about future tasks, so as to ensure that women are not the losers in the globalisation competition.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We have also developed an impressive repertory of measures designed to boost employment. However, the situation with regard to equal pay still leaves a lot to be desired. For people to be able to combine family life with careers, consideration must be given to both fathers and mothers, and the image of the new man, who takes on domestic tasks, must be reinforced.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The situation is looking brighter for women as far as equality in political life is concerned. Women account for an average of 20% of members of the parliaments of the European Union. The figure for this Parliament is 30%. But there is still plenty of room for improvement in this regard as well, so as to reach the critical mass, as it were. I believe I can say, with the full support of my Group, that there is no getting away from the fact that we must introduce quotas. We must fix quotas at long last, if we do not want it to take another one hundred years before women achieve equal representation, and I mean in every single walk of life, in the economy, at social partner level, in universities and in science. We must also achieve a more gender-balanced participation within the mass media industry.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Violence against women is another major issue. Here in the European Parliament, we have called for there to be a European year against violence, and are supported by 350 delegates in this. Much still remains to be done, however. The important thing to come out of New York will be a decision on Beijing + 10, another World Conference on Women for the 21st Century.</p>

<p class="contents">The monitoring of the application of the Beijing Action Platform reveals that the greatest concerns, in relation to the proposed objectives, are still education and training, power and decision making, health, poverty and violence. The social changes of recent years have affected women in a special way. The increase in the elderly population has had a great effect on the lives of women who, in general, when they are no longer looking after their children, have to look after their parents.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite considerable progress in terms of the situation of women, there are still considerable differences, especially discrimination at work and different wages for the same job. The majority and, in many cases, all of the responsibility for domestic tasks falls to women.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation of women with family responsibilities, combined with the difficulties in the labour market, have led to a term which is explicit as well as unfair: the feminisation of poverty. We still require initiatives which help to give women access to the labour market and allow them full professional development, to which end we will need to facilitate women’s ‘other’ work through nurseries and financial aid. Men will have to take more family responsibilities and adapt to a society which is constantly changing and which has modified their traditional roles.</p>
<p class="contents">The information society requires increasing numbers of people with technological training, which women must get involved in, since this is an area for which they are particularly well-equipped. If the number of women involved in decision making were to increase, it would become easier to resolve the problems facing them. A lot of progress has been made, but there are still political and economic areas in which women are under-represented.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst the problems which women are unfortunately facing at the moment, we must mention the violence directed at them: domestic violence, armed conflict and trafficking in women, which has been increasing in recent years. This is a form of violence against their person, their fundamental rights and their dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam provides for the integration of the objectives of equality into Community policies and, especially in Article 141, positive actions in the field of employment. Employment is usually also a solution to other problems of marginalisation, economic dependence, lack of personal freedom, etc. The fifth Community Action Plan will have to deal with the problems still existing through a budgetary provision which will allow programmes to be implemented in the most urgent areas. The cooperation of the media is essential to achieving these objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the heavens are not enough. Women account for more than half the earth’s population and yet remain unheard and under-represented within most political, economic and social spheres. That is unacceptable. </p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the centuries, women have demanded their rights as full citizens. They have ranged from, in the northern hemisphere, female campaigners for the right to vote to, in the southern hemisphere, groups opposing genital mutilation. In the course of the Beijing Conference in 1995, a common action plan was decided upon for these different groups of women. This was a milestone in the recognition of women’s rights as being integral to human rights in general. Just about all the governments of the world endorsed the Beijing Conference’s action plan. </p>
<p class="contents">The Beijing Declaration distinguishes twelve critical areas and defines views and long-term objectives which should be adopted by governments, the United Nations, national movements and private industry in order to improve the conditions under which women live. Five years later, discrimination against women is still widespread, and violence against women is still a global phenomenon. A glass ceiling bars women from advancement in the professions, administration and politics. Women constitute the overwhelming majority of the one billion people who are illiterate and who live in the most extreme poverty, and decisions affecting women are still made by men. </p>
<p class="contents">It is high time that, in the course of the Beijing + 5 Conference in June, concrete decisions are taken which will actually result in the objectives of the Beijing Action Platform being realised. The report we are voting on tomorrow emphasises that progress within all twelve areas is necessary if women are fully to be able to obtain their share of human rights. A threefold strategy is needed if the Conference is not just to be another exercise in rhetoric. </p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the world’s governments must adopt a concrete action plan and again undertake to fulfil the Beijing objectives. Secondly, they must pledge financial resources with a view to implementing the decisions and, thirdly, supervisory tools must be created for the purpose of monitoring implementation. These three tools have so far been missing in implementing the Beijing Action Platform. The fact that the world’s governments refuse to acknowledge that, from the cradle to the grave, girls and women are exploited and persecuted has, throughout the ages, been the most flagrant and far-reaching violation of human rights. This is something which the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities wants to change. Women should not just bear half the sky on their shoulders, but also have the right to take responsibility for decisions affecting our entire earth. Is that not so, Commissioner? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Naturally, there is a need in the European Union, too, to improve the position of women in all walks of life, but we are now talking more about a worldwide conference. In my opinion, a worthwhile contribution to this event would be the concept that the empowerment of women can be regarded as a strategy for the development of society as a whole. By investing in women, we will be helping whole communities and societies on the road to development. The evidence in support of this is very convincing; many problems can be overcome by investing, for example, in the primary health care of women. In the eradication of poverty, supporting women, for example by ‘micro loans’ (negligible amounts from our point of view) has proved a very sound strategy for promoting economic activity. Education and training are, of course, the means for women to become members of full standing in society.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that if there is anything we in the European Union can contribute to this conference, it would relate to the fact that we have launched this ‘gender mainstreaming’ process, which entails trying to involve the gender viewpoint in all decision making. As all those present are well aware, this is not easy – we have a tremendous amount of work to do in this respect ourselves – but we can raise the issue that the role of women needs to be reassessed when it comes to questions of war and peace, for example. Women are, to a very great extent, the victims and those who suffer in wars now. Would it not be a good idea to debate what could be done by women to prevent or resolve these kind of present-day conflicts?</p>
<p class="contents">Five years ago, at the Beijing Conference, it was stated that women’s rights are human rights. We quite agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Smet. We cannot accept what is happening to women in Afghanistan and we must promote the human rights of women at the New York Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like, however, to point out a number of things. </p>
<p class="contents">We note that women’s and children’s rights form an indispensable and inseparable dimension of human rights generally. Economic independence for women is a necessity if it is to be possible to achieve true equality. Women both within and outside the European Union are especially vulnerable to poverty. </p>
<p class="contents">The 1995 action platform expressly mentions the freedom to take personal responsibility in questions affecting sexuality, as well as full respect for the individual’s integrity and equality in relations between women and men and in issues affecting sexual relations and reproduction. </p>
<p class="contents">These are points which religious fundamentalists of different kinds now refuse to accept. The <span class="italic">pro-life</span> movement and so-called family protection groups, the Vatican and Muslim fundamentalists are very active and have been so in a very well organised way during the conferences which, in the course of recent months, have been held in, among other places, New York. They are thereby sabotaging constructive dialogue between governments and voluntary organisations. I should like to appeal to this Parliament’s large Christian Democratic group to distance themselves from this sabotage of the United Nations’ follow-up conference. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also urge the governments of the Member States and the delegation from the European Parliament which is to go to New York in a few weeks’ time to do all they can to bring about the final document from the Beijing + 5 Conference which is, in fact, threatened by these groups. It is a question of producing a final document containing, still intact, the twelve points in the action plan which have been approved. In that way, we can all of us work to advance women’s rights and equality, and not to set them back. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission will once again, therefore, be conspicuous for its grand proposals and the failure to follow them up with tangible actions. </p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, on this occasion, it might be appropriate for the Union to adopt an initiative, a practical initiative which is a priority objective with set time frames. We feel that, out of the vast amount of issues to be considered, female circumcision warrants particular attention. We would like Mrs Diamantopoulou to inform us whether the clause on relations with third countries which deals with female circumcision is seen as particularly important and, in the interests of bringing the matter to a swift conclusion, we suggest that no further Union aid should be granted to any of those countries which permit or tolerate female circumcision.</p>

In view of the forthcoming UN conference in New York, I think it is opportune that we claim a more active and effective European and worldwide policy in all sectors, a policy which will reach as far as Afghanistan and the Gulf states, where women are still in a most unfortunate position and are denied fundamental human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not, of course, mean that we underestimate the progress achieved and the European Union’s contribution to the dynamic presence of women in all professional and scientific circles, the performance of women at all levels of education and their successes wherever equal opportunity policies and the principle of meritocracy are applied. However, despite the undisputed progress being made, serious problems of inequality and discrimination persist and have serious repercussions on the functioning of democracy and the failure to make full use of the valuable human resource which women represent comes at a huge economic and social cost.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we need to move forward with a specific vision and specific plan, with strategies and mechanisms, with a precise timetable and indicators, with quantifiable targets so that we can appraise the preceding decade and accurately evaluate the progress made at the new UN Conference in 2005. Today we need to extend our action to eradicate discrimination on the labour market, involve women in social dialogue and deal with violence against women. We need to guarantee a fair redistribution of responsibilities and obligations between the two sexes, both in public and private life. In short, we need to create a new institutional and social framework which reflects the changes which have taken place and which solves the problems and contradictions which arise from the new contract with the two sexes. The European Union and the Member States must be on the front line of this fight.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Apart from the 28 specific recommendations, which are particularly helpful, both for Beijing and the Commission’s fifth programme – and I should like to assure you that complete account will be taken of them – I must also highlight the fact that they are accompanied by a particularly interesting political analysis containing information and views which is an excellent tool and which I think the Member States would be well advised to reproduce.</p>
<p class="contents">Five years on from Beijing, we shall be assessing the past five years. As the speakers have said, a great deal has been done and a great deal remains to be done. And, of course, Afghanistan will have to be discussed and reported and voted on in New York because it is one of the worst disgraces of our century, one of the worst disgraces of mankind in the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">We made commitments in 1995; these commitments have been honoured up to a point and we shall be analysing them in full at the Beijing Conference. One question which arises is whether or not we have the information needed at European Union level. I should like to inform you that the Commission has been endeavouring for a long time now to collate information on all the Member States, to obtain answers to questionnaires sent out more than once, to obtain answers to individual issues of legislation, infrastructures, action and statistics. We have managed, after a great deal of trouble, I must admit, to collate a set of data and we shall be publishing a paper as quickly as possible – within a fortnight I hope – containing the data for 1999. That was the reason for the delay.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the report is concerned, I should like to refer to three points which, according to the questionnaires sent in from the countries of Europe, take priority there. The first is new changes in the information society. The new changes, which are changing the economy, society and the work model, are throwing up both huge challenges and huge problems, especially for the weaker groups, and huge problems for women, who are less involved in the new world of technologies and who, of course, have higher unemployment rates. We therefore need here to highlight the new objective of education, lifelong learning, retraining and special programmes to ensure that women participate in the new information society and, hence, in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns democracy and is linked to the information society, which is creating a new type of communication between citizens and politicians and opening up a new route, which you need to be aware of and for which you need the right vehicle. And, of course, there is the traditional problem of the representation of women, which all the speakers have already touched on.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point, which also proved to be the issue to which the Member States attach importance, is the issue of violence against women, the most important problem being trafficking in women, i.e. the modern version of the slave trade. Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, we must assume that the new era is bringing with it not only electronic commerce, as defined in the economy, but also electronic commerce in women and children. These are issues which call, of course, for innovative solutions and new approaches and cannot simply be seen as the price paid for the new era. I think that these are the basic points which need to be assessed and, more importantly, where we need to renew our commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress that Beijing will obviously give rise to negotiating problems. I agree that there will be centres of power and organised powers which will try to reverse all this progress and review the agenda which we have agreed on. How we organise ourselves at all levels and how our lobby operates at all levels are extremely important, because we want to prevent any review of the agenda or a return to the past, renew our commitments and create new momentum so that our commitments are implemented in the new era.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, since all negotiations depend on preparation and on being fully aware of one’s own situation and the situation of those sitting on the opposite side of the table, we at the Commission and the European Parliament need to cooperate very closely with the Portuguese Presidency. It is, I think, superfluous, to assure you that the Commission – and I personally – am at the disposal of the Portuguese Presidency so that we can prepare for these negotiations in the best possible way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
