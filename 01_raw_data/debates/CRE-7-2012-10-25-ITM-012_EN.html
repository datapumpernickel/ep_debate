Therefore, let me assure you that the financing of the Lifelong Learning Programme in 2012 and 2013 will not be put in danger.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning 2012, the Council has started analysing the Commission’s proposals as presented in draft amending budget No 6/2012 and will adopt its position on this draft amending budget as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the appropriations for 2013 are concerned, these will be decided jointly by the European Parliament and the Council during the ongoing budgetary negotiations. I am confident that the two arms of the budgetary authority will reach a balanced agreement on the 2013 budget in November, as foreseen by the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, concerning the future of the Lifelong Learning Programme, including Erasmus, you all know that the negotiations concerning the next multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020 are still in progress. The European Parliament is involved in these negotiations. The Presidency will make every effort to move the negotiations on the Programme along, but it would not be in order for me to say more than that at this stage, since we need to wait for the outcome of those negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Janusz Lewandowski, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. −</span> Madam President, recently there has been a lot of speculation and a lot of question marks and uncertainty regarding the fate of the Erasmus programme, including in the media. Therefore the Commission welcomes this opportunity to clarify the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is also my duty to place the problem of Erasmus, as one single programme, in the more panoramic view of what is really a shortage of funds in the European budget not only for Erasmus – this is only a part of the problem, one of the smallest but most visible parts of the problem, we are encountering in 2012. This is due to the systematic under-budgeting in the annual budget. The major deficiencies in 2012 are in the Social Fund and in regional policy and rural development, but also in our external obligations, which reflects on the credibility of the European Union vis-à-vis our partners around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we are coming forward with the amending budget for this year. There is a large amount of money is needed not only for cohesion and for rural development, but also for external obligations and especially for Heading 1a which concerns competitiveness, covering all sorts of research programmes including Lifelong Learning. Erasmus is part of Lifelong Learning which, as you know, is also about vocational training, possibilities for adults and for schools, and the most sensitive part of that concerns student mobility, namely Erasmus.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need in order to overcome the deficiencies for this year under this heading of research, training and education amounts to more than six million euros. For Lifelong Learning, which covers all sorts of programmes, our estimate is for EUR 180 million up to the end of the year, including Erasmus, which accounts for half this amount – more or less EUR 90 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Your commitment to vocational mobility around Europe is also very important because, alongside this year’s problem, what is at stake here is the future of these programmes, indeed the future of the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020. Education is very high on our common agenda due to the very high unemployment among the younger generation. Therefore, knowing how to acquire the right mix of skills is essential in order to place the younger generation in a decent European labour market; the future of what we call Erasmus for All is also at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">But to return to the issue of Erasmus 2012-2013. I think Parliament was right to ring the alarm bell for Erasmus for this year, and here is the brutal truth: 99 % of what we have in our pocket – the European budget – has already been delivered to the national agencies around Europe. Of course we are contacting not only the national agencies in the European Union but a total of 33 participating countries, including Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway, Turkey, Croatia and Switzerland. 99 % of what was available for 2012 has already been delivered to the 33 national agencies. We have already had claims for this year of around EUR 160 million, and we expect more claims for 2012. I think that it is easier to say who is not applying for additional money: Portugal, Finland, Luxembourg, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania. The other countries are applying and sending requests for additional money. Therefore, an amendment to this year’s budget is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to repeat that what we have estimated we need for all sorts of educational programmes for this year is EUR 180 million. What we need for Erasmus is half that: EUR 90 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Minister Mavroyiannis is right. It is our duty to ensure the smooth implementation of Erasmus in 2012 and early 2013, as we have already advanced a lot of money to the national agencies. But if there are no more funds coming in, we will really encounter a very serious accumulation of problems in 2013, as the universities are less likely to deliver to the students and are likely to reduce the expectations for student mobility in 2013. This is why I urge you to help us. This is also a kind request to the Presidency: to deliver a substantial increase for 2012 and not to have an accumulation of problems in this very valuable European Union programme in 2013. Together we can manage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why are we here today? It is an admission of incapacity by the governments responsible – not the Commission and not Parliament! We need to clearly state what this is about: it is not about an increase in resources because the Commission did not do its work properly, it is solely about the States not meeting the obligations they have made to young people </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">who want to study abroad because their parents, the economy, society and politicians tell them every Sunday how important education is and how important it is to gain experience abroad. Through the Bologna Process, a technical failure, Member States have unnecessarily made students’ lives more difficult. Now they are also setting about damaging the reputation of the flagship project of European educational policy, Erasmus, completely unnecessarily. Already, the year abroad is a financial balancing act for many young people on Erasmus. If the impression is now given that they cannot even rely on these commitments, this is a devastating signal, especially for those who desperately depend on support from Erasmus.</p>
<p class="contents">Education ministers have stated repeatedly − and re-stated now − that the goal for 2020, that many young people are able to go abroad and be mobile, must be achieved. What are we to think if, because of a lack of funding, not even 5 % of Erasmus students can go abroad now?</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I think that the budget reorganisers, that is, the Council representatives, should not reorganise the budget at the expense of students. In this matter, at least, they should be generous – it is also their own children’s future. </p>

Normally young people in Europe have the possibility – still have the possibility – but even that is now endangered for some of them. In Europe we speak about the necessity for excellence, for high qualifications, of knowing other languages – and the Erasmus programme is in danger. In Europe all the leaders speak about the necessity of mobility. We cannot stick to one place in one country in one city alone – and some of our nation states are endangering mobility. And we speak in Europe about the necessity of having a European identify in addition to the national or regional identity – and again, some of our leaders are endangering the European identity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also very interesting to see that some of the countries where most of the students want to enter the Erasmus programme are trying to cut the budget, and that is absolutely unacceptable. I fully agree with what the Commissioner said. Thank you very much for your engagement on that. Thank you, Mr Mavroyiannis. You are a very gentle and kind person, but sometimes I think you have to be less kind to your colleagues in the other governments because what they are doing is absolutely impossible. As my colleague said, they are endangering one of the biggest flagships of European unification, of European identity, of coming together, of being the most qualified Europe – and then we endanger this programme. This is absolutely unacceptable, especially at a time when euroscepticism is growing. We say to the young people who want to be real Europeans: sorry, we do not have the money. I think again you sometimes have to be very tough with your colleagues and tell them that the unanimous opinion here in this Parliament is that we need Erasmus and we need enough financing for our young people, because this is about Europe, not about national ambitions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wholeheartedly agree with them. I have two comments on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in connection with this. Firstly, there is of course the matter pertaining to unpaid bills. Where I come from, we pay our bills. This is not a matter that is up for discussion. I simply do not understand this discussion in connection with the consistent under-budgeting, which the Commission was also party to. I feel the time is absolutely right! We are in a situation where we discuss this every single time, and citizens simply do not understand the lack of logic in this consistent under-budgeting. Bills must be paid! We are in a situation where the work has been done and the money has been allocated, and now the bill must be paid. Naturally, our credibility as institutions will stand or fall based on whether or not these bills are paid. And of course, this also concerns the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this must be expected to affect students. We now face the obvious risk that students across the Member States will not receive a grant at all or at least not the grant they were expecting, or that their grants will be cut. This is the actual situation that we are faced with. It is not a trivial matter, and it is a cold, hard reality and not an abstract situation for the young people concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to strongly advise against taking this programme, which several speakers have emphasised as being one of the most popular specific programmes that we have in the EU, hostage in a situation where there is a tactical game between institutions as to whether this ‘budget loss’ should be assigned to one institution or another. I would like to strongly advise against taking young people and a popular programme hostage. This specifically also concerns the level of confidence in this project among citizens, and here at last is a project that people understand, one where we hear again and again, across political boundaries, that it is beneficial to the EU. This is one of the reasons why people understand that this project is something that is worth being united over. It is this that hangs in the balance. It is not simply a question of some incidental money in a budget; it is about confidence in the entire project. Therefore, I would strongly recommend that the Council and the Cyprus Presidency firmly encourage colleagues to come forward with the money. Thank you for the opportunity to speak! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have got a terrible situation with regard to the Erasmus programme: students no longer have the grant money that was promised to them. This runs absolutely counter to the aims − and here I direct myself to you, Sir, the representative of the Cyprus Presidency − which the Council and Parliament agreed, namely to do more for Erasmus, more for student mobility and more for the education and training of our young people. How can we be so short-sighted and irresponsible as to undermine one of the most successful programmes we have ever had in the European Union? Ms Pack was right to say that we already have an implementation rate of 99 % − and this was in October! What more do you want? We would do better to make cuts to, say, tobacco subsidies, which do a lot of damage, not to a programme from which, as we know, everyone involved can only benefit. </p>
<p class="contents">You have breached a contract. You promised money that you are now not supplying. This undermines the credibility of the European Council and, unfortunately, also that of the entire European Union. It is a serious political mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not only the Erasmus flagship programme that is under pressure: the European Social Fund, for example, has no more money either. Do you know what you are risking here? This year there is no more money for literacy courses or upskilling the long-term unemployed. This is totally contrary to what you are always saying at your summit meetings: that we must do more to counter youth unemployment, that we must encourage young people to get out and about in Europe, broaden their skills and get further training. Stop this irresponsible policy and let us approve a supplementary budget. Above all, let us approach the next multiannual financial framework boldly and make this money available for European education policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you can see, all four voices – Ms Pack, Mr Swoboda, Mr Løkkegaard and Ms Trüpel – are essentially expressing concern at the situation, and this concern is justified. In fact, these calculations that you have provided have not alleviated our concerns, because this is one of those programmes in which it is worth investing. The European Union hands out a great deal of money quite needlessly, and Ms Trüpel has drawn attention to one such area – that is the truth. It is very common for the European Union to waste money, but the money intended for the Erasmus programme is very much money not wasted. It is the best-invested money in the EU, and we should therefore make every effort – above all the Commission, but the Council too – to ensure that this money does not run short.</p>
<p class="contents">This is especially because the division into better and worse continues to prevail, as the size of grants unfortunately continues to reflect the division of Europe. They depend on which country one comes from. A Polish student studying in Germany or France is not, sadly, provided with the same conditions as a German or French student studying in Poland. This is an element we must overcome. The question of credits is also worthy of support, but the most important thing is to make sure this money does not run out. We cannot stand in shame before our citizens, and before our students, because the European Union has not found the money for one of the flagship, vanguard and best-implemented programmes. I must entreat you, Commissioner, to make every effort to prevent this situation from arising, and to make sure that European students have the money to enable them to study abroad. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the period 2007-2013 the EU has paid out grants worth EUR 3 billion on Erasmus. However, the economy has shrunk and youth unemployment has grown massively to 11.7 %. Furthermore, the grant gives an average EUR 300 per month, which is insufficient to cover the basic costs of living. If we add travel costs to this we can estimate that a family needs to pay at least EUR 5 000 per year on top of the grant to cover the total cost of one of its members doing Erasmus.</p>
<p class="contents">How many families can afford this in these times of crisis? Considering the lack of impact on employment and economic growth that the Erasmus programme has had over the last decade, and given that it can only be afforded by those that are well off, we should scrap it. There are many other priorities that need more urgent attention. Those who find it indispensable to have this development should pay out of their own pocket instead of imposing the burden on the taxpayer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We had that debate because the single market is one of the European Union’s main goals. If the single market were to fail, the entire European Union could fail.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is true of Erasmus: for many young people – and not only for them – it represents the image of the European Union. Without Erasmus, many people’s perception of European unity would disappear. This is more the case than with the single market because with the single market there is also, but not only, an economic advantage for businesses and for our countries. There is nothing wrong with this, but Erasmus is different, it is about students wanting to break out of their confines and discover the cultures of other countries, share the experience of studying with people who speak a different language and perhaps have different customs and traditions, and discover, renew and strengthen our common identity and our unity.</p>
<p class="contents">This is how Europe came into being, not through treaties or dreadful bureaucracy, but through genuine lived experiences. Perhaps without Erasmus, the single market would also mean something different, the spirit of it would be different and so weakening Erasmus could weaken our Union. The title of this debate is absolutely right: Erasmus is in danger, and the danger is that, without Erasmus, a different concept of Europe would develop.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Commissioner for his work and to tell the Council to make a real effort to find and authorise the funds, since the hole that exists is down to the Member States. The Europe of the future will depend on those who want to study and have experiences abroad now. Let us try not to let them down and let us be brave enough to show what Europe is really made of.

Today’s debate is essential in the attempt to reassure European citizens that the European institutions led by the European Parliament are actively cooperating, and the uncertainty surrounding the future of the EU budget in no way jeopardises the effectiveness of Erasmus, which is one of the most successful EU programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Using it as an example, we can highlight the challenges and risks of the austerity measures that several Member States would like to apply to the EU budget. When we speak today about the importance of ensuring adequate funding for Erasmus, we are also spreading the message that even in these times of crisis Europe is prepared to invest in education and training, and therefore in programmes that are key to its economic and social recovery. We must strive to ensure that a similar situation is not repeated in the future. It is a matter of trust in the European institutions; the solution that we are able to find will reflect the importance that Europe places on education, training and mobility in times of crisis.</p>

<p class="contents">The Council representatives present have underlined the many problems there are in 2012 and also concerning the future funding of Erasmus, but have not given any firm answers. The question being put to the Member States today, on which there is a consensus in Parliament, is this: are you going to increase your contributions to its funding to meet the commitments you have made? Quite apart from Erasmus, the issue of funding for education programmes and also for the Cohesion Fund is equally tragic.</p>

It is a measure that creates a Europe of sharing and cooperation, and not a Europe of competition, a dog-eat-dog Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European institutions were really bothered about the general interest of citizens, we would not be here now discussing restrictions and drastic cuts, but instead we would be working together to provide more scholarships to ensure that Erasmus does not only affect 3 % or 4 % of EU students, students already facing considerable financial hardship. Under these circumstances, the worst-case scenario would be the replacement of the current system with a system of loans, meaning that students would start their working lives saddled with an extra financial burden.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want Europe to get through the crisis, we need to be aiming for a considerably higher level of training, and for a colossal research effort. It is therefore our responsibility to ensure that the Erasmus programme is not only saved but also developed and is fit to meet the challenges of our times. Similarly, the programme should be extended to the continuing training of employees so that, EU-wide, we create security of jobs and training for all employees in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Some practical suggestions have been made by young people involved in Erasmus. During the Erasmus Day Live initiative, some suggestions were made to President Barroso such as exchanging homes, which could make it easier and less expensive for families, or introducing some working hours (young people want to work, and they could do so in libraries and archives, or in cultural institutions), and regionalisation. Some regions like my own, Piedmont, have suggested intervening along the lines of the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us expand the basis for participation in Erasmus, let us give young people the role of offering suggestions and taking action. Erasmus is important.

A mainstay of European policy success, as Mr Scurria rightly said, just as valuable as the single market and the euro, is being jeopardised here. This is unacceptable. We should never again – and I am hoping for a happy ending – have to hear sheepish statements from the Commission such as those in the press release of 15 October, which stated that the financial resources for Erasmus until the end of the year could not be guaranteed because the Council could not get its act together and accept its responsibility.</p>

<p class="contents">Today in this debate on Erasmus, we are not talking about what could happen next year but what is happening now, and the reality is that, because the position of the Commission and Parliament was not accepted last year, this year if this is not resolved a large number of programmes, including Erasmus, could find themselves in trouble.</p>

Soon we shall be hearing from these young people – and this does not surprise me in the least – the question: so what are we needed for anyway, at the end of the day? We are sorting out our own problems, but we are not sorting out the problems of the people of Europe. It is not only because of the crisis that Europe is in a situation where every day it has to prove to its citizens that they need it. With this signal that the Council is giving, we are proving that we are needed by ourselves. But we are not in any way needed by the people of Europe. I would like to express my sincere thanks to Commissioner Lewandowski and to Mr Lamassoure; were it not for their voices, Erasmus would be quietly dying and no one would be talking about it. I am surprised at Mr Migalski, with what seems to be his complaint against Commissioner Lewandowski – we are in a situation today where the Council and the Commission must speak with one voice in order to find a solution to this problem. I am pleased that the European Parliament is taking such a unified stance. </p>

After the free movement of people and goods, the Erasmus programme is regarded as one of the great achievements of the European Union. For that reason, Parliament supports an increase in the Union’s support for education and training over the 2014-2020 period in order to raise the level of citizens’ skills and help address the high levels of youth unemployment in many Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the importance of education for the future of the Union, we request not only an increase in the budget for the Erasmus programme over the future financial period, but also the following: an increase in the number of people aged over 35 who benefit from lifelong learning, one of the programme’s overall objectives, along with an increase in the mobility of persons for educational purposes in the field of entrepreneurship, and therefore the Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs programme; and making industrial policy one of the EU policies which are relevant to the Erasmus for All programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the sort of situation in which we find ourselves right now in the European Union, in the middle of this recession, what we need specifically is investment in education and mobility; everybody knows this. What does the market need? It needs a high-quality workforce; and we can only guarantee a high-quality workforce through education, and, as has been stated on many occasions already, Erasmus has been the success story here.</p>
<p class="contents">We are supposedly concerned about the trend towards exclusion; it is through education and investment that we oppose this trend, and therefore this is what is required. It will be very alarming if we now start to make cuts in this area. I do not believe that Cyprus, as Presidency, wishes its term of office to be remembered as one in which it had a Commissioner who was anti-education, and one which saw the start of a winding-down of the education programmes. This is not the way to go; we must invest in education, since only in this way will Europe have hopeful prospects for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a timely commitment on how to save Erasmus. This is the time to sound the alarm. (Thank you also for reminding us that Lewandowski was successful in scoring against Real Madrid yesterday for Borussia Dortmund!) But this is also very much an opportunity to see what is behind the figures. From time to time it is necessary to see what lies behind the budgetary figures. It is so easy to cut figures on paper, but when you see thousands of Erasmus students it is more difficult, or when you see the small or medium-sized companies behind the figures who are in desperate need of liquidity at a time of credit crunch, then it is less easy to cut the figures.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the case with Erasmus. It started with a modest allocation of EUR 18 million I think in 1998, but now more than 4 000 higher education institutions in 33 countries – also beyond the European Union – have signed up to the Erasmus University Charter. So this is really about visibility, about the utility of the European Union for the younger generation. Utility is what we really need now, the utility of our institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is as follows, as I have clarified. You have my assurance, and I think this will also be endorsed by Minister Mavroyiannis, that the students benefiting from Erasmus this year, and at the beginning of 2013, are not in danger. Everything should be implemented, because we have sent money to the national agencies in 33 countries. The danger is due to uncertainty – especially if we make an additional request to take advantage of the money allocated for 2013 to cover the needs of 2012 – and uncertainty affects most of all those students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, poorer students around Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore we need a solution, we need your commitment. Please do not forget that Erasmus is only a part of the Lifelong Learning programme. The very prestigious Marie Curie programme for young researchers is also in danger of being short of money if we do not have an additional EU 100 million for this year.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the overall picture at a time when we are starting the battle over the future until 2020. It is not true that the research programmes are to be affected, they are the part of the European budget with the biggest growth for the future, from EUR 50 to 80 billion, but I think what is vital now is to give assurances to the students that in 2013 they will not be affected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The arrival of Mr Swoboda is timely, and I will certainly follow up on his suggestion and, of course, on all the comments and concerns expressed. I have taken good note of all of these and will convey them to the Member States and the Council. Let me assure you that the Council shares the view that student mobility and Erasmus are key for young generations and form part of our vision of the future and relevance of our Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the situation of payment appropriations in 2012, the Council, as I was saying before, will pursue swiftly the examination of draft amending budget 6/2012 proposed by the Commission and will duly analyse with the Commission the shortage of appropriations identified in the current budget for all programmes, Lifelong Learning included, with Erasmus and Marie Curie being an essential part of this. Let me assure Members that we will do our utmost to avoid the situation they fear of not being able to honour our obligations and ensure the smooth running of the Erasmus programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning 2013, the European Parliament and the Council have just started a conciliation procedure with a view to reaching an agreement on the level of commitment and payment appropriations in next year’s budget which, of course, include the Lifelong Learning Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As I was saying before, the discussions on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 are ongoing and we cannot pre-empt their outcome. However, my feeling is that Erasmus is not in danger. In fact, we will not allow it to be endangered, as we are strongly committed to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, with the budgetary problems there are many students intending to undertake this programme in the coming months who are rightly very worried about this situation. Faced with the prospect of a shortage of funds, universities and colleges are likely to reduce the number of places available, or they will reduce the level of grants available. This will hit students from disadvantaged backgrounds hardest. I appreciate the efforts being made by the Commission and my colleagues in Parliament to address this situation, but the fact remains that the shortfall in the Erasmus programme amounts to EUR 90 million. If an agreement to increase payments cannot be reached, the Erasmus programme will be at risk, and students, adults and vocational training will all be affected.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that cuts have to come from somewhere, but the message that the EU sends in times of austerity cannot be that cuts to the EU budget will fall on the youth of Europe first – those on whom we are relying to be the foundation of future innovation, growth and development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the recent 2010/2011 academic year more than 200 000 students participated in this popular higher-education programme, proving that Erasmus is one of the most successful achievements of the European Union with a positive influence that stretches far and beyond higher education. However, it appears that the recent austerity measures in the EU have put the financing of the programme at risk. Although the European Commission will recommend that the 2012 budget be supplemented in this area with the funds necessary to run Erasmus, if the Member States and Parliament are unable to agree on further payments then there will be no funds in the coming academic year to finance the students’ studies. I know that the lengthy economic crisis and therefore the fiscal austerity measures affect more or less every country in the Union, but I still call upon the Member States to support the Commission’s proposal, because if we do not ensure that the professionals of the future are properly trained, we will have no chance of recovering from the crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, there is a risk that the programme will be affected by the inadequate financing of the Union’s budget. More than 1 500 foreign students come to Romania each year, and a further 4 500 young Romanians study in other EU Member States thanks to Erasmus scholarships. The large number of students bears witness to the programme’s success, and is further evidence that we need sufficient funds for the Union’s vital policies. We cannot sacrifice education policies when one of the main problems affecting the Union is high youth unemployment. We must encourage education and vocational training programmes to prepare young people to enter the labour market.</p>

In April of this year the EU education ministers again confirmed the objective by 2020 of allowing 20% of European students to spend a period studying abroad. Of course the necessary funds must be available for this purpose. For the Erasmus programme it is therefore absolutely essential that the EUR 90 million shortfall for 2012 be made up as soon as possible. This will avoid students receiving a small Erasmus grant or none at all. If an agreement is not made quickly it will be the least well-off students in particular who have to give up their foreign study experience. As a way out of the crisis the European Union must resolutely take action in respect of the education and employment of young people. Study abroad adds to the profile of students who have recently graduated. Year after year more students study abroad. Now that the Erasmus programme is fully underway it is not a good idea to put it on the back burner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present, Erasmus gives mobility scholarships to thousands of students, with emphasis laid on the academic recognition of studies. In this regard, it is worth pointing out that in October 2009 the European Commission celebrated the fact that the number of Erasmus students at European level had reached 2 000 000. The Erasmus experience is a unique and personal intercultural and university experience, not only for those who have participated in the programme, but also for those who are motivated to sign up. The problem of financing is critical, especially at a time of economic crisis. The European Union must endeavour to put in place the funds necessary for the Erasmus programme to continue over the 2014-2020 period. ‘Social criteria’ must become part of the Erasmus grant award process to enable students on low incomes to benefit from periods of mobility without having to worry about the lack of adequate financial resources. Young people are the foundation of Europe, and it needs qualified young people. To that end, we need to invest in education so that young people can benefit from jobs that are appropriate to their qualifications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is one of the most popular and successful of Europe’s programmes and it is extremely important that it should continue to exist. It is a symbol of the EU and, since it is under threat, it will be the very unity of the EU which could be weakened. It is essential to agree a level of financing to ensure that this programme continues, since all the money applied would never be wasted but would be invested. It is a matter of investment in qualification, in the intellectual and cultural training of young people who will be the future of Europe. That being the case, it is unacceptable that the Erasmus programme should be under threat, since it is one of the most effective weapons for combating unemployment in Europe. The future of Europe and the credibility of the European Union are at stake; it is essential to fight for Erasmus; the amounts due must be paid and grants must be made available; young people must be provided with qualifications and incorporated into the labour market. I call upon the three institutions to strive to reach a satisfactory solution as swiftly as possible and I call upon the Council to set an example of discipline.

It has worked very well to date, as proven by the fact that more than two million students have taken advantage of it so far. Above all it improves young people’s chances in the labour market, and provides an opportunity to spend time in a foreign country, get to know new people, gain new experience, study a language and raise one’s level of knowledge. Erasmus grant recipients become more tolerant, find out about their own abilities and also acquire the capacity to cope when far away from home. This programme can be a sort of introduction to adult life. It has the effect that those taking part become more self-assured, more mature and independent, and their plans for how they intend to spend their lives for the next few years become more focussed. The Erasmus programme is fulfilling its own objectives outstandingly well, as borne out in numerous statements and studies by its grant recipients and higher education institution authorities. Maintenance of its formula as hitherto applied along with the appropriate funding would appear to be a priority matter. We are currently looking at a new proposal from the Commission in this area. Its essential content is a matter for further discussion, but at this stage when it is being introduced, it is worth asking ourselves whether we should change something that is working so smoothly and to such benefit for all interested parties.

This budget reduction will only increase the inequalities between young people, and the Erasmus programme will become a privilege for students who are in a better financial situation, instead of being a right for all. In addition, I would like to propose an expansion of the programme. This initiative could serve as a mechanism to promote the Erasmus brand outside Europe, too.

Its success is acknowledged to such an extent that it has become a symbol of a united Europe for millions of young people. Even mentioning the possibility of not having enough resources to run it is a blow to our trust in the EU. On top of that, it becomes clear from Commissioner Lewandowski’s statement that those affected would most likely be students with the least financial means. Let us spare a thought for the deep disappointment of a young person who finds out that because of the unfulfilled financial obligations of the ‘officials in Brussels’, he will not be able to feel free, and will not be able to travel on a par with other people of his own age; that he cannot be a true European, because somewhere the money has run out. One more thing: for many this Chamber has been a place where concern has been expressed about the burden this crisis is placing on young people, youth employment, the need for new policies … However, let us not undermine what we already have. The Erasmus programme has been with us for 25 years now, and it has become part of the cultural and educational experience of an entire generation.

However, as a Member from an outermost region such as the Canary Islands, I am also concerned that our young people do not enjoy equal opportunities in the mobility measures financed by the EU. Young people from the Canary Islands cannot and should not be in a worse situation than other young people in the EU due to living in an outermost region. Youth unemployment figures in the outermost regions are really worrying and it is our duty to ensure that the additional cost of students travelling from their outermost region of origin is borne by the programme itself and not by the students, who often see this additional cost as an insurmountable obstacle that prevents them from accessing Erasmus grants. Yes there should be Erasmus for all, but that should include young people from the outermost regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The stable financing of Erasmus in next year’s budget also appears to be at risk, even though during the programme’s 25th anniversary we spoke about the need to provide additional funds for the programme in the next EU financing period 2014-2020. The youth unemployment level of recent years has clearly highlighted the importance of targeted measures that aim to reduce the division between education and the labour market, lower youth unemployment in the majority of Member States and encourage mobility and lifelong learning. It has to be noted that Erasmus is one of the most successfully implemented programmes and that it gives Europeans the opportunity to improve and strengthen bilateral cooperation in higher education. I am hoping that the concerns of the European Parliament regarding the funding of Erasmus and scientific research and innovation programmes will motivate the European Commission and the Member States, which undoubtedly understand the usefulness of these education and innovation policy instruments, to search for solutions regarding stable implementation of these programmes as well as regarding their security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the 25 years of its existence, Erasmus has enabled 2.5 million European students to travel, study in another country and get to know another European culture. Since 2000, they have included 35 000 Romanian students. I shall compare it with another European programme, which is the same age and has followed a similar development path: the EU Food Distribution programme, which was also established in 1987. This programme, from which 18 million citizens or more than 1 in 30 Europeans are currently benefiting, has been in danger over the last few years. I congratulate the European Commission on its initiative to create a fund to assist disadvantaged people in the European Union over the 2014-2020 period, which will replace the Food Distribution programme. Both programmes, Erasmus and the Food Distribution programme, which have now existed for a quarter of a century, are quintessential European programmes which must continue and develop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Erasmus programme is one of the milestones of the EU success story, and a further EUR 90 million is needed to ensure we continue these traditions. It means a lot to those who benefit: the opening of horizons, a unique opportunity to gain experience. Raising the funds for this in the EU budget is a justified endeavour because it is one of the projects that makes the benefits of the EU visible and tangible, and allows citizens to experience the specific advantages of the European Union. In essence, Erasmus signifies the transposition of European values into practice, just like the euro or the Schengen Area, or the unrestricted movement across borders. Interestingly, alongside the problems associated with the euro, some Member States are pressing for a reform of the Schengen Area, raising the notion of restricting free movement across borders at the very time when the financing of Erasmus is under threat. We have to concede that this is because it is insignificant compared to the stakes of the common budget or Europe’s debt crisis. It is quite unacceptable that we are jeopardising the most popular achievements of the Union with austerity measures, as we are only undermining the professional prospects of the coming generations and fostering euroscepticism among young people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It provides thousands of students with an opportunity to take up studies in a variety of European countries. It enables people to find out about different education systems, to extend their knowledge of a foreign language, but also – and this is the most important thing of all – it constitutes a sphere for intercultural exchange between people from all over Europe. Particularly now, when the EU is grappling with a high level of youth unemployment, we cannot allow the Erasmus programme and the idea of student exchanges to be threatened by a shortage of funds. Young people cannot be expected to pay for the crisis. It needs emphasising that it is precisely mobility for students and the opportunity for them to acquire international experience that gives them a chance to find their feet in the labour market. Erasmus is our European identity and a very important element of the common market. That is why it is very important for Member States to fulfil their obligations so that there is no shortage of money for planned exchanges, or for the continued functioning of this programme. Member States should also bear this in mind when budget expenditure for the longer-term financial future is being discussed. We must not take a short-sighted view of this and seek savings that are needed now at the cost of the Erasmus programme, which will bring tangible benefits in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At a time of serious financial difficulties for young people, it is fundamental to continue to support the mobility of thousands of students between various countries. During negotiations on the EU budget for 2012, the Council decided to reduce payment authorisations by EUR 3 billion, having also undertaken to release the budgetary funds if it became necessary. During the current year the Council and the European Commission approved many projects in different areas such as the National Strategic Reference Framework, the common agricultural policy, the Fisheries Fund, Research and Innovation (Seventh Framework Programme) or Erasmus programme projects. In order for the EU to meet all the financial requirements in the most varied areas of economic and social activity, the EU budget must be increased by approximately EUR 8.3 billion and the European Commission has already presented a proposal to that effect. I think it is fundamental to respect the commitments entered into with the beneficiaries and to finance the projects which were approved by the European institutions. We cannot put the Erasmus programme at risk – a programme it took years to consolidate and which is fundamental for the future of new generations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The scheme contributes to European integration but also to the personal integration of young Europeans. Anything that came in its way would be a step backwards at a time when citizens are having their doubts about the EU and our young people are having doubts about the future. The programme is now a victim of the short-term vision of some Member States that, in the name of defending liberal dogma, are endangering one of the EU’s tools for investing in the future, that of training and that of youth. Discussions on the 2012 and 2013 budgets are well on the way to overcoming this deadlock, but this should not be disconnected from the negotiations under way on the financial framework for 2014-2020. The proposal of a freeze on the EU’s budget is unacceptable when we are promoting education and qualifications as the main assets in the fight against unemployment, particularly of young people. On the contrary, a substantial increase in the EU budget is necessary to get through the crisis and prepare for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
