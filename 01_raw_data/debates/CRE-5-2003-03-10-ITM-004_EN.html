<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, services are one of the new areas of international trade that directly concern social preference and lifestyle and that, therefore, more than goods, are a source of concern to the citizens and their representatives. These concerns relate, in particular, to the transparency of international negotiations, preserving our public services and behaviour towards developing countries, if I am to go by the questions raised by a number of you. They are, moreover, reflected in the motions for resolutions tabled before this House. Before I present to you the European Union’s offers for opening up the services markets, I would briefly like to remind you what these negotiations involve.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, let us recall the spirit in which the Union is conducting these negotiations: we need to pursue our economic interests proactively while also defending our European social model and enabling developing countries to integrate more fully into the world economy. It is that balance which has inspired the Commission’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to clear up certain misunderstandings, let us also recall that our objectives with regard to opening up trade in services are completely unrelated to the liberalisation that seems to be taking place left, right and centre. What we are discussing is a combination of market access and rules. The two cannot be separated if we want to achieve our objectives in these international negotiations, which are to reinvigorate growth, integrate the developing countries into world trade and ensure that, in opening up the markets, we respect the various preferences and values of our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">We at the Commission believe that negotiations on services are in the interests of both the industrialised countries and the developing countries, for several reasons. First of all, from a general perspective, we can no longer separate trade in goods from trade in services. Without access to the high-quality systems provided by insurance, banking, accountancy services, telecommunications, transport and distribution, an economy is no longer competitive today. This applies equally to developed countries and developing countries. Secondly, the European Union has a great deal to gain from these negotiations. Services are the most dynamic sector of the European economy. They represent two-thirds of our gross domestic product and jobs. Lastly, services are often the Achilles’ heel of many developing countries whose export capacity is restricted by low productivity levels and the lack of competition in their service industries. Most of these countries, furthermore, are well aware of this, as is shown by the fact that more than half of the requests received by the Union relating to opening up trade in services come precisely from developing countries: Kenya, India, Mali, Gambia, Egypt, Mauritius and Brazil, amongst others.</p>
<p class="contents">Do these arguments therefore point to a need for the full liberalisation, or even deregulation or privatisation, of services? Certainly not: a significant number of services are already the subject of trade which is, quite rightly, strictly regulated, and encouragement given to trade in services must respect this regulatory framework which was established by the competent public authorities. That is why, in our opinion, the Union was right to choose the WTO as the main framework for opening up the services markets. Contrary to what is sometimes claimed, multilateral negotiations provide greater transparency and better conduct on the part of States since they are based on clear rules which are familiar to and accepted by all participants in the negotiations. Without organisation of trade at a world level, negotiations on services would take place on an entirely bilateral basis with no common rules of play, which would undoubtedly lead to pressure on the developing countries. From this perspective, the World Trade Organisation, which is a multilateral organisation if ever there was one, is thus a useful and necessary safeguard against uncontrolled liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">This framework having been established, the negotiations conform to certain principles that should be broadly recalled before this House, so that the debate is based on clear, accurate facts.</p>
<p class="contents">First principle: the negotiations concern trade in services and not the way in which it is regulated in each country. The States retain the freedom to impose any rules they wish and to entrust the management of these services to public or private undertakings. The WTO negotiations have no direct or indirect connection with the decisions on privatisation that particular States might take.</p>
<p class="contents">Second principle: each country is free to determine which sectors it intends to open up to international competition and which it wishes to keep closed. I would remind you that, in the WTO, decisions are taken by consensus, with each State having one vote. Agreement is not possible without the consent of the developing countries, in particular, the most advanced of which, such as China, India and Brazil, are fully able to make themselves heard.</p>
<p class="contents">Third principle: there is no sectoral reciprocity in these negotiations. The United States, for example, could very well decide to open up the education sector without obliging other States to follow suit in the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth principle: kingly services are excluded from the scope of the discussion. The General Agreement on Trade in Services does not cover services that are not provided on a commercial basis or in competition with other service providers. It is only when the States choose to subject their public services to market rules, therefore, that they become subject to the rules of this market and can enter the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth and final principle: with regard to major services of public interest – education, health, culture, water, energy and public transport – each country is free to choose between various formulas. They can organise the service as a public or private monopoly. They can open up the services market to competing suppliers but restrict access to national companies. They could also, for example, open up the services market to national and foreign suppliers, but without entering into any multilateral GATS commitment. Lastly, they can, for example, enter into GATS commitments relating to the right of foreign companies to supply services in addition to national suppliers, but have the choice of whether or not to grant them full national treatment. In any case, liberalisation, once accepted, only affects non-discrimination and in no way involves giving up regulatory power.</p>
<p class="contents">The General Agreement on Services does not, therefore, affect the definition of public service missions, their organisation or their funding. From this point of view, the member States of the WTO retain all their freedom. We consider these protective barriers to be the best guarantees for Europe to be able to continue to develop its own model of services of public interest while still benefiting from the advantages relating to opening up trade in services. This is a more effective way of preserving the European model than excluding services of public interest from the scope of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, a suggestion which I have often had cause to debate. I believe that such exclusion would be counterproductive, as it would lead to the multilateral definition of a comprehensive list of services considered to be of public interest and would open a multilateral debate on the desirable content of this list, a subject on which each Member State of the WTO might have a different view. I feel that, ultimately, we would run the risk of ending up with a more limited list than the Union itself would wish for.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now come to the negotiations themselves. What are our objectives? Eliminating or reducing a number of barriers to access to several sectors where the Union has world-class companies – telecoms, business services, professional services, financial services, construction, distribution, transport, energy and tourism. In order to be able to achieve these proactive objectives, the Union must present a substantial offer.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, our requests and offers are not just improvisation. They are the conversion into specific negotiation documents of political guidelines that were drawn up in December 2000, following discussions with the other European institutions – the Council and Parliament. Since then, the documents that set out our approach to the negotiations have been widely published, in particular on our website.</p>
<p class="contents">The requests made of the WTO partners, which were tabled last July, cover a number of sectors which have been made public. I may come back to them later. I would specify that these requests do not seek to dismantle public services or privatise public companies. No request has been made to any country by the Union with regard to health services or audiovisual services, and only the United States has received a request from us, restricted to privately funded higher education.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the offers, we at the Commission sent the proposed offer to the Council and to Parliament at the beginning of February, trying to respond to the requests of both developed countries and developing countries, with particular emphasis on the requests made to us by developing countries. In terms of sectors, we propose to respond to the requests we have received on financial services, information technology services, telecoms, transport, distribution, postal and courier services, professional services and tourism. In so doing, we would like to make a particular effort to take account of the requests of developing countries by proposing to improve the Union’s commitments in terms of the temporary movement of persons. This offer was designed to safeguard public services fully within the Union, and I shall come back to that before concluding. No new commitments have been proposed in the fields of education and health, and we are not proposing any commitments in the field of audiovisual services. I shall come back to that with my colleague, Mrs Reding.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s work has mainly been inspired by the comments received in response to a public consultation that began at the end of last autumn. I would specify that the details of our proposed offer are still confidential at present, so that the Member States have the necessary room for negotiation and those of you with access to the details of this offer can work on it. I know and I am well aware that the restricted classification under which this text was sent to you does not fully satisfy you, or in any case some of you, and that is why we have done our best to contribute to an informed parliamentary debate. Today’s sitting is proof of this, in addition to the appearances I have also made before the committee to which I report.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point on this matter of transparency: I have decided to make all our proposals public once they have been finalised. The European Union will be the first member of the World Trade Organisation to take this step. I did this in response to a number of requests, including, moreover, a significant number from this House. I did not do it with regard to the requests addressed to third countries. Indeed, if I were to make these requests public, a number of our partners in the negotiations would view this publicity as an attempt to put pressure on them, which would not be good for our negotiating position.</p>
<p class="contents">A quick word about two sectors for which the current proposal does not contain an offer. First of all, energy services. We are not proposing any improvement in our commitments at this stage, pending completion of the work underway within the WTO on the classification of energy services within the scope of the Agreement on Services.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, we are not proposing any commitments with regard to trade in water collection, purification and distribution either, both because we have only received one request in this sector, and because we would also like to clarify with our WTO partners what exactly the provision of services covers in this sector. Having said that, this is a field in which we have significant active interests, and some of our Member States have already pointed this out to us.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point before I talk about cultural diversity and the audiovisual sector: we are currently at the offer stage. It is the beginning of the negotiations and our opening offer would, of course, only become a commitment if, during the negotiations, others were also prepared to improve access to their services market for our European operators.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, let us talk about trade in cultural and audiovisual services and about cultural diversity. Culture and, more specifically, the audiovisual sector, are not excluded from the General Agreement on Trade in Services. Quite simply, at the end of the Uruguay Round, the Union fully preserved its current and future freedom of manoeuvre by not making any commitments in terms of market access or national treatment in this sector. Furthermore, at the time, we kept a long list of exemptions from the most-favoured-nation clause which allows us to discriminate between third countries with regard to the treatment given, within the Union, to their audiovisual works. It is this freedom of manoeuvre that we used commonly to call ‘cultural exception’ and which has been renamed ‘preservation of cultural diversity’.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s mandate for the negotiations underway consists of preserving political requests in terms of preserving and promoting cultural diversity. Entirely naturally, we are therefore sticking to our mandate and are not proposing any commitments in the field of audiovisual services in these negotiations. As the promotion of cultural diversity is included in the EC Treaty, it naturally forms part of our trade policy. Some WTO Member States have already made known their expectations in the audiovisual sector. These include the United States, Brazil and Japan. Others, such as India, have also announced active interests without, however, having tabled specific requests. It is therefore clear to us that developed countries and developing countries share the same interests and we must – and this is the position Mrs Reding and I want to put to you today – be fully aware that the promotion of cultural diversity cannot be reduced to the defence by each Member State of its own national industry. This is not about creating a new form of disguised protectionism which would not convince anyone. We believe we could convince countries, in particular the developing countries, more effectively of the legitimacy of our argument if we were able to show our genuine openness to diversity and, to that end, we need a proactive approach. The defensive role in this matter is my responsibility. My colleague, Mrs Reding, is responsible for the proactive part and will now update you on our progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our ambition is to unite the peoples, not just build a free trade area. In this regard, respect for cultural and linguistic diversity within the Union is a basic principle, a principle which the Union is under obligation to uphold in international trade negotiations, as my colleague, Mr Lamy, has just said, but also to promote with active, proactive policies which can influence our cultural policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union is also called upon to promote at international level both preservation of and respect for this diversity, which is the essential basis for intercultural dialogue and cultural exchange at world level. In this sense, the Union is one of the major players in a controlled globalisation which meets the expectations of the people. In terms of cultural matters, particularly, the European project is incompatible with a form of globalisation which would be liable to erode national, regional or local identities and threaten linguistic and cultural diversity. Moreover, the debates underway in the various international forums on cultural diversity clearly demonstrate that Europe is not alone. In this matter, we have allies.</p>
<p class="contents">I see the response of the Commission and the European Union in the area of cultural diversity as being structured around three main lines. Firstly, as Mr Lamy explained, a firm position in the WTO comprising no commitments in the area of the liberalisation of audiovisual and cultural services, in order to preserve the freedom necessary for the preservation and development of national and Community instruments seeking to achieve cultural diversity objectives. Secondly, the promotion of cultural exchanges which respect cultural diversity at world level, in particular by means of a debate on cooperation policies. In this regard, the enhancement or strengthening of the Union’s role in cultural cooperation with third countries would appear to be very important, for the Union is one of the leading players in North-South solidarity. Thirdly, the active participation of the Union in international discussions on cultural diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I personally am convinced that such a debate is appropriate and necessary, for globalisation raises a number of questions to which the liberalisation of trade cannot alone provide the answers. It is therefore important that we are present in international forums such as Unesco to discuss cultural diversity and to fight to preserve it. At this juncture, the Commission has not decided on the form and content of a possible future international instrument on cultural diversity, but I feel it is important for you to know that the Commission is present at the forums where these discussions take place. Moreover, I welcome the fact that the Greek Presidency wants to develop the debate at Community level on cultural diversity in general, including the aspects related to international law, with a view to the informal Culture Council at the end of May. I intend to contribute to the coordination of Member States’ deliberations desired by the Presidency by sending ministers information, particularly on the Unesco process, in order to stimulate the debate between the European nations on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect is education. The most important thing to remember is that public services are not under threat from GATS. Firstly, the agreement lays down a general provision protecting a large number of public services, specifically services which are provided on neither a commercial nor a competitive basis. Secondly, even where services which are not covered by this exemption are concerned, the States have the right to decide, according to a basis which can be very detailed, the bottom up approach, in which sectors and sub-sectors they will grant access to their markets or national treatment. Thirdly, even after opting for market access or national treatment, they can qualify their commitments with conditions stipulating the restrictions they will apply under their national legislation. Fourthly and lastly, GATS recognises the States’ right to preserve or introduce regulations, laws or other provisions providing for access to quality services at reasonable prices. This applies to universal service obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take as an example an area which concerns us and you particularly, the area of education. The commitments given by the Commission and its Member States at the Uruguay Round only relate to private education. Public services in the field of education are not affected by these commitments at all and the aim of the commitments given is to ensure that, insofar as and only insofar as a private services market exists, the nationals and operators of the partner countries can have access to them under the same conditions as the nationals of the country concerned. Moreover, even as regards the private sector covered by the commitments, the Member States have been able to specify the content through a whole series of conditions that they already apply and that they will be able to continue to apply. Thus, one country requires teachers to be employed from among its nationals, another that the majority of members of a board of governors must be nationals, and another that non-nationals have to have authorisation from the ministry before opening an establishment.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the current round, the Doha Round, we certainly do not intend to change the commitments we have given in the field of education to include any points relating to public systems. The public education system will therefore remain exactly the same. We examined the requests of the different countries with a view to changing our commitments relating to private education services. After consulting the Member States and the different parties concerned, we concluded that it is not appropriate to give new commitments increasing access to the Community market in this sector either.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the position is clear and precise. I would, however, like to say one more thing. Although we are not going to open up the market in the sense I have just described, we will subscribe to the offer on the provision of education to students from third countries. This is precisely the aim of the project ‘Erasmus World’. Indeed, although we are protecting our European system within Europe, this European system is open to students from all over the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Velzen (PPE-DE). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing the European Commission's offers on GATS, and these are very important offers, because we must remember that the service sector in the European Union is a key sector for our economy. The Commissioner rightly points out that this is the most dynamic sector. The European Union is also one of the biggest exporters of services in the world, so it is also an important matter of self-interest. We must provide access to the services markets. Not only in our own interest but also in the interest of developing countries. After all, the development agenda is what the Doha WTO round is about. I think that we must see the practical results in the light of the economies of the developing countries, so I am very pleased that 50% of the requests have come from developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Our experience in the EU also tells us that the liberalisation of services, both in the energy and telecom sector and in the financial services sector, should normally deliver a better quality and more efficient services market with a broader range of products and better prices, as long as it goes hand in hand with properly established rules and guarantees for citizens. I therefore think that the Commission is setting a great deal of store by the concept of general services, and I would like to call on it to take a closer look at the so-called universal service obligations that can also be delivered by private service providers instead of solely by the public sector.</p>
<p class="contents">My group can support the Commission's offer to exclude the health sector, the social sector and the education sector from an offer, but I would also like clarification on the situation with regard to universities. The Commissioner has mentioned the Erasmus project, but does this mean that only individual Member States can make an offer on this point and that nothing is happening at all with regard to universities throughout the whole of the EU? Commissioner Reding provided a very convincing argument for not making a new proposal for the audio-visual sector. I do not have to go into that in any more detail.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to say something about computer-related services. On the one hand, we must naturally ensure that we do not cause a massive brain drain towards the West from countries like India. We must also provide our own training. On the other hand, we must also avoid a situation in which people work under other conditions in the European Union, because this could result in social dumping. I therefore think that it is important to create a good balance, and since September 11 we have naturally also had to look at security aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of course a good thing that we are doing more to include the environment in this. Sustainability is not just a matter for the West, it is a matter for the whole world. I therefore think that it should also benefit developing countries. Excluding water treatment and distribution for the time being seems to me to be a wise policy. GATS directly affects the interests of many EU citizens, and I appreciate Commissioner Lamy’s efforts to broaden communication and provide more information. This is still a matter involving ambassadors, closed doors and a lack of transparency, and I am of the opinion that there should be much stronger parliamentary representation in this regard. Bearing Cancun in mind, I therefore also hope that the Commissioner will put forward new proposals to make this process even more transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot turn our backs on current events, however, and Iraq is of course putting us into a situation in which the world community is split right down the middle. How can we now prevent the Iraq question from resulting in serious trade conflicts between the European Union and the United States which may obstruct the results of Cancun? I would like to ask the Commissioner what initiatives she has taken in this area and what results they have produced. In this context, there are of course two essential problems with the United States that have not yet been resolved. On the one hand, the so-called FSC arrangement, the favourable tax legislation for American exporters which must now be reviewed thanks to the WTO statement, and on the other hand, the alarming reports that American draft legislation is being prepared that will limit the tax benefits of subsidiaries of non-US companies. I should like to ask the Commissioner what the situation is in this regard. Can we expect something like this from the Americans?</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the pressure we are under to agree to the American proposals regarding genetically modified food. I think that it is very important to set this issue right and to hear what is happening about it. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Commissioner Lamy speaks about the fact that 2003 will be the year in which the WTO must deliver. What does he mean by this, and what can we expect in this regard? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are also grateful for your support for the changes to the Treaty necessary to give us the powers we need in the trade area.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as you are responsive to us, we have to be responsive to those who elect us. You know as well as we do that there are genuine and widespread worries about GATS. You have mentioned some of them: transparency, the feeling that a lot of unsavoury things are being done secretly; threats to EU jobs, which have prompted, I suppose, the dock workers' demonstration we saw today; threats to public services, with particularly acute dangers to developing countries; threats to the ability of Member States to regulate, and particular fears in the culture area, on which others will speak. At the same time, the European public is well aware – since 60% of them or more work in service industries – that there are possibilities for EU firms in widespread trade in services. So they face the dual interest which you have delineated.</p>
<p class="contents">Developing countries have not rejected GATS completely. However, the fears about public services, regulation and extension and the fact that the developing countries do not have the capacity for the administration that an opening-up of service markets will require all mean that the implications of opening up trade in services need to be very fully assessed. I would put more emphasis on that than on anything else in our resolution. Before we go any further we want to know - not in a perfunctory exercise but in a detailed and comprehensive assessment - what this means. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not defensive to anyone outside Europe, but within an internal debate in which the Commission, and perhaps the EU generally, the position is defensive vis-à-vis campaign groups within the European Union which have decided, for some good reasons but also a lot of bad reasons, to criticise both the GATS agreement and the EU stance.</p>
<p class="contents">My group would like to focus on that point. If, in the future, we want to prevent European Union trade policy being shaped - and sometimes arbitrarily shaped - by both the press and specific campaign groups, we must reassert parliamentary prerogatives in this field to open up the debate to proper, accountable public scrutiny. That is why we urge colleagues in other groups not only to support greater transparency in the way in which these negotiations are conducted, but also, as Mrs McNally has already said, to give strong support to filling the current vacuum in the Convention and making sure that the European Parliament more generally gains the right of assent over all future GATS and WTO agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am speaking as a member of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, and I would like to attempt to pick up on what Commissioner Lamy said earlier. He said that he is responsible for defensive measures whereas Mrs Reding is responsible for proactive measures. I seem to remember, however, that your mandate for Seattle in 1999 included the promotion as well as the preservation of cultural diversity. In terms of the promotion of cultural diversity, which is the more difficult task, although I thank you for your efforts at preservation, I am astonished that, ultimately, only audiovisual services have been retained. What is being done to preserve cultural, leisure and sports services? That is my first question.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is to Commissioner Reding. Since your neighbour, Commissioner Lamy, has made you responsible for the proactive measures, how is that being addressed in the Treaty? We are worried, concerned about the future Treaty and what it holds for culture. The commitment to promote cultural diversity is an obligation, you both say, in the Treaty. Nevertheless, we would prefer it to be a more binding obligation, as you, of all people, are aware. We would like Article 151(4) to be respected and given due importance once again in the future Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We will now move on to another cause for concern on the proactive side of things which may also fall within Mr Lamy’s remit – the international instrument. You were both, like myself, at the professional meeting on the instrument for cultural diversity in France a month or so ago. I know that the issue interests you and I thank you for supporting this project. However, I am extremely disappointed to see that the majority of the Members have abandoned the question of the international instrument in the motions tabled today, even though it has the support of 50 or so countries and has been proposed by President Chirac and others to Unesco. The feasibility study has been carried out by a Franco-Canadian group. The matter is very important and a great deal of work has already been done. I am surprised at the lack of interest displayed by my fellow Members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner Lamy, you say that plenary debates like this are to fully inform Parliament about the progress of GATS negotiations but, in the absence of the document that would tell us precisely what is being demanded of whom, this exchange is almost entirely academic. If, in order to find that information, the majority of parliamentarians have to resort to leaks on NGO websites, then really we are a very long way from exercising parliamentary scrutiny. So, while I am grateful to you for speaking to us tonight, I would like to make clear that this does not constitute any kind of political scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">You have made it clear that you believe that you have gone as far as you can, as Commissioner, to make GATS texts available to us. You tell us that you are trying to be open but that you have limited room for manoeuvre. Well, as parliamentarians we are doing what we can to increase that room, but can I ask you specifically what you are doing to increase that room for manoeuvre?</p>
<p class="contents">In your letter last October to the Chair of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, you accused Parliamentarians of making false claims about what you called the alleged intransparency of the EU decision-making process. You went on to say, and I quote, 'the current rules of access allow the European Parliament to fully exercise its task of political control'. Can I ask you whether you still genuinely believe that the current rules are sufficient?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the mandate. Since the level of public awareness about the implications and complexities of the GATS process has grown enormously over the past few years, can you tell us why you believe it is still appropriate to negotiate within the WTO on the basis of a Council mandate granted back in 1999? Would it not be more appropriate to adopt a new mandate and in it make explicit the rights of public authorities and institutions at all levels to regulate public services in order to maintain social and environmental standards free from challenge under GATS?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, development. DG Trade's press release announcing the EU-GATS offers says they are all about helping developing countries. Let us look at the figures. The EU made 109 requests and received just 27 requests back. Only half of those were from developing countries and just one was from a least developed country. Let us not fool ourselves with the rhetoric that this is favouring the poorest. The figures show that it clearly is not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two great Europeans, Adam Smith and David Ricardo, have explained to us that the wealth of nations benefits greatly precisely from international trade, and that is how Europe’s wealth has increased.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Lamy has had occasion to point out on a number of occasions, further liberalisation of international trade in services is vital for the European economy, which, it is essential to note, both depends on services and can export them. That is why I feel that we should condemn the fact that the European Union, as Mr Clegg said just now, is in a defensive position with its back against the wall, not just as regards agriculture but where international negotiations on services are concerned too.</p>
<p class="contents">In saying that the European Union’s objective is to defend and promote the European social model more effectively, the Commission is almost apologising for giving consumers more choice. You, Commissioner, said that your aim is to establish negotiations in which the collective preferences and values of our society are respected. I believe that the best way to respect the preferences of the European citizens is to open up international trade in the audiovisual sector too. The European citizens must be the ones to decide whether cinema or other audiovisual products are better in Europe, whether they want those produced in Europe or those produced elsewhere, not to mention the fact that the large-scale distribution of music and films over the Internet is in danger of raising a question which is already longstanding, the question of protection of alleged<span class="bold"> </span>cultural diversity in the field of audiovisual services. We must let the citizens choose, as in the case of education.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President, by saying that, as regards public utilities, as regards water and other services, too little is being done. Europe has shown that liberalisation is not incompatible with regulating and guaranteeing the quality of the services provided to the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although we emphatically want borders to be opened up to international trade, there is a fundamental distinction to be drawn between cultural services and others, such as those in telecommunications, transport, or, indeed, finance. This makes it necessary to anchor this special role played by cultural and audiovisual services in the social and political cohesion of peoples in the relevant laws on contract. Culture must not be made subject to the rules of the market or to commercial law; instead, we need regulation that takes into consideration what is appropriate to each area, and so we have to find a global solution to enable Article 151(4) of our European Treaties to be the means whereby Europe's, and the world's, cultural diversity is secured and supported in the long term and in a sustainable way.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that we need a two-phase process in the future. The Commission is to be thanked for setting out the first phase in today's proposal that GATS should not cover the provision of cultural and audiovisual services. The second stage goes beyond that, and I want to say how grateful I am to Commissioner Reding, who, with this in mind, is representing the Commission's and Parliament's views – and, I hope, the Council's – in the international discussions and working parties on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for us to devise our own international convention, an international instrument of our own, if the future of cultural diversity is to be secured. Excellent work has already been done in this area by the Council of Europe, Unesco and, especially, the Francophone Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">I am quite sure that, by strengthening cultural diversity across the world in this way, we could effectively allay people's fears of globalisation, whilst at the same time enhancing and advancing worldwide intercultural dialogue – the need for which we are, in these times, more aware than ever.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Désir (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Commissioner Lamy, Commissioner Reding, as you have, indeed, noted, these GATS negotiations are giving rise to a great deal of concern in the countries of the European Union, and this trend is reminiscent in many respects of unrest at the time of the Multilateral Agreement on Investments (MAI).<span class="bold"> </span>Indeed, GATS does contain provisions on investments too. That said, more broadly speaking, the concern is due to the fact that the negotiations and their outcome will affect much more than trade rules, impacting on the internal rules of the countries belonging to the WTO as well. When we talk about water supply or the postal services sector, for example, not about cross-border postal services but the internal organisation of the postal services sector, it is clear that we are going beyond the bounds of international trade. Furthermore, that raises the question, with regard to both this agreement and the TRIPS agreement on intellectual property, that the WTO might be going beyond its remit.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem with this agreement is precisely that it lumps everything together: banking and insurance services but also water and energy supply, postal services, education and health, potentially. In this regard, it is Europe’s negotiating line that will allow us to make distinctions and ensure that some areas are not, indeed, placed under the authority of the WTO and its Dispute Settlement Body.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point I would like to raise concerns the protection of European public services, for we have witnessed a dangerous shift in recent months. At the beginning, the Commission’s position and statements declared that liberalisation offers would not be made in the field of European public services. Then we said that liberalisation offers would not be made in the areas of health, education and audiovisual services. However, European services, public services, are much more wide-ranging than that. In actual fact, we can see that offers have been made in the field of postal services and that, subject to clarification and classification in the WTO, offers could be made in the field of energy and water. We therefore call upon the Commission to take a clear line and to exclude European public services from all liberalisation offers, which must be the competence of the Member States, the Council and the European Parliament, not the competence of the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, reciprocity is not automatic, but there must be consistency, and the Union cannot ask others to liberalise public service sectors and then expect not to be asked to do the same. We have already requested that countries such as Tanzania, Mozambique and Bangladesh liberalise their water sectors, for example. I believe we must not put that kind of pressure on the developing countries. Quite the opposite: we must promote cooperation, we must promote investment in sectors where these countries need it but within the framework of cooperation, letting them decide what environmental, social or other rules to impose on foreign investors.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and lastly, I believe, Mr Lamy, that what you have said about excluding public services by revising the agreement and Article 1(3) thereof is not right. It would be sufficient to amend the subparagraph which restricts the definition of governmental services to services which are not provided on a commercial or competitive basis and stipulate that the States belonging to the WTO are free to exclude their public services from this negotiation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These negotiations are certainly more than crucial for Europe. First of all, the fact is that services are forming an ever more significant part of world trade, 24% of which, as we know, is accounted for by the European Union. Furthermore, the European Union is currently the biggest importer and the biggest exporter of services in the world. Another reason to take these GATS negotiations in hand is naturally – or unfortunately, I should say – the continuing slowdown of economic growth. We must therefore concentrate more than ever before on the trade in services, and this once again applies in particular to the European Union where services represent more than two-thirds of the total gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not, however, negotiate solely on the basis of our own interests but also on the basis of the interests of other countries and other parts of the world. Liberalisation means we must also open our borders more to services from third countries and thus contribute to their further development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A moratorium is not a good idea. Bilateral liberalisation is very successful and, most importantly, developing countries frequently request it. Progress has been made in transparency but there is no WTO forum and the European Parliament has only a very limited power of consultation. The battle to defend public services is falling far short of expectations. The threats of disintegration lie within the European Union, where competition policy is inappropriately applied and the specific rules much too weak. Examining Mr Lamy’s offers, we see that they are strictly confined to the internal choices of the Member States and the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget the priority of development, and we must not speak in place of the South. That said, I would like to see whether our demands for liberalisation take into account the need of the countries of the southern hemisphere for services of general interest, and I would point out that there is no framework for the activity of multinational firms. Lastly, there is a dreadful imbalance between the rapid rate of liberalisation and the lack of public goods at regional and world level. When will there be an action strategy for the European Union? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With all due respect, Commissioner, there are still, between confidentiality and absolute transparency, many practicable ways ahead. This is a reproach directed at the Member States and also at the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than providing elucidation about the various demands or the degree of willingness to deregulate, the documents available tend to be more of a playground for those who interpret these things.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Lamy, you began with a report full of atmosphere, propagandising for the European model, and referring to the interest of developing countries. I would have liked it if Parliament, in its resolution, were to have more to say about the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">What you said at the outset about privatisation, though, is not something that this House should accept without demur. A chain of consequences follows if you give people what they want. I do not want Brussels to be the venue for a debate on a liberalisation introduced to Europe through a back door called GATS.</p>
<p class="contents">Both my esteemed colleague Mrs Fraisse and Mrs Hieronymi have already voiced the most important things about art and culture, matters which are of political concern to me as well. It is perhaps enough for me to say that it is to you that we owe the distinction between working defensively and working offensively.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much for the report you have put before us today. It is now for us to move into the second stage, taking the offensive in the same way and joining as one in this debate, using every possible means of action available to us in order to create an international and binding instrument to protect and promote cultural diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not all the cards are on the table and the initial contacts have, for the most part<span class="bold">,</span> not been transparent. The Commission prides itself on a negotiating mandate dating from 1999, before Seattle, which is now completely obsolete. The national parliaments have not debated the matter transparently and the European Parliament is being called upon to endorse everything on the basis of a brief statement from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not against all liberalisation in principle, but it must at all times be controlled by the peoples concerned. The people must never be in a position where their hands are tied. If we follow the Commission in this matter, we will find ourselves caught up in ill-defined negotiations which could have a serious effect on the people’s control over their public services and all the rules safeguarding their societies.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the Commission assures us that no liberalisation offer will be made by the Union in the fields of health or education or the audiovisual sector and that it will negotiate to preserve cultural diversity, but these declarations are not enough for us. Why these fields and not others? We have too much experience not to be familiar with the wheels within wheels and traps hidden in this kind of agreement, which only come to light after the event, when we have already signed on the dotted line.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, on Thursday, in this hemicycle, we are going to debate the closure of major firms due to relocation and the resulting human tragedies. If we want to avoid further human tragedies in the future, we must address problems earlier on in the process. We must start by refraining now from signing agreements such as the GATS agreement which would tie our hands in the future. That is why we call for these negotiations to be postponed until a genuinely public, democratic debate has taken place, until we have clearly assessed all the implications of GATS.</p>

<p class="contents">The whole question about the importance of services and opening up service markets is one we are about to address seriously within our own internal market. We do not yet have an internal market for services. I expect we will hear some of the concerns in the debates tonight when we look at our own market. However, it is absolutely right to address broader issues. After all, as Mr Lamy has said on a number of occasions, within the European Union we have the best-developed single market technologies of any trading bloc in the world. It is right that we should be leading in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important proposals we have worked on here is the liberalisation of electronic communications, a single framework for a converging sector. It is those electronic communications that are really opening up the way to a global trade in services that we have never seen before. It is right to anticipate that. Liberalisation is always going to be difficult. If you accept market disciplines and the opening-up of a market, you must expect reconstruction; you must expect firms to close and look for new possibilities. Surely we are not saying here that we should go back to the days of protectionism? Far from it! We want to look at how markets will evolve.</p>
<p class="contents">That includes the developing world as well. A couple of months ago I was at an important meeting in Brussels, with representatives from the developing world talking about electronic communications and how they want to build their infrastructures. They realise that having the infrastructure in place is going to open up great opportunities for their own economies and for trade globally. That is what we want to encourage. Let us be positive about it. I urge you, Commissioner, to continue your work on this and not listen to the siren voices in this Chamber tonight that are urging you to stop or slow down. Let us move ahead! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I might add that the extent of the disquiet and the size of the information gap are also demonstrated by the day of action and protest against GATS to be mounted this coming Thursday in many European capital cities – in Rome, Paris, London and Vienna – by school and higher education students and trade unionists, which will be a day of European education and action.</p>
<p class="contents">The concept of a cultural industry makes this development more marked. Critics are concerned that, in this field, countries are seen as growth areas subject to market mechanisms and capable of developing their own dynamics going far beyond what was originally laid down. One example of this is the American proposal for promoting the import of virtual goods, at the same time as removing such things as audiovisual programmes via the Internet from the GATS safeguard clauses, something that must be firmly rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only is cultural diversity to be respected; it must also be safeguarded. Although what is termed the cultural exception in the GATS negotiations is meant to be an exception from the usual rules of competition, the fact that the concept has never acquired legal force justifies the questions that are being asked and the concern that is felt as to whether that is sufficient to maintain our values. Or do we not need an international legal instrument whereby it is acknowledged that states have the right to determine cultural policy on the basis of their own needs, and to take measures of their own to promote artistic endeavour and public audiovisual services?</p>
<p class="contents">Cultural diversity does not mean limiting oneself to one's own borders and cutting the industry back; it is about being open to diversity, and that means giving it a chance to survive.</p>

The European Union is the biggest exporter of commercial services in the world, accounting for 26% of worldwide trade in services, as opposed to 22% in the United States and 7% in Japan. The trade in services in the European Union therefore accounts for more than two-thirds of our gross foreign product and jobs. So trade in services far exceeds trade in goods. Further liberalisation also benefits developing countries, because trade in services promotes the infrastructure, such as telecommunications, and also the financial infrastructure for the trade in goods. Thus GATS also contributes to the Doha round. In my view we must therefore stand four-square behind liberalisation and in particular avoid focusing too much on the exceptions that some of the Member States want to implement. The most important sectors are the transport, tourism, financial and telecommunications service sectors. Audio-visual services form a relatively small part of the offer. It is therefore ridiculous that Member States who do not want this are denying this Parliament any say because they are afraid of changes to the audio-visual sector.

The right of EU and third-country citizens, including those of developing countries, of access to essential goods and services including water, education, health, culture, energy, transport and telecommunications, is in danger of being undermined. We are all familiar with disastrous examples of the privatisation of services in many countries, including transport in the United Kingdom, electricity in the United States and in Portugal, and water distribution and healthcare services in many developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore concerned to learn of the Commission’s proposals, which overlook the importance of public services in areas such as energy, transport, postal services and telecommunications, in terms of social cohesion, the public’s well-being and social inclusion. The proposals also fail to take due account of the way in which social movements have been mobilised on a major scale to protect high-quality public services. A moratorium must therefore be declared on the liberalisation of services and the Commission must draw up a detailed report on the foreseeable economic, social and environmental consequences of the policies of liberalisation emanating from the World Trade Organization, both in the European Union and in the developing countries. The essential role of public services in every country’s development and social cohesion must also be respected, with no proposals put forward that provide for further liberalisations in third countries or for European Union bids in the field of public services. The Commission must also call for cultural diversity not only to be preserved, but also promoted, as has already been stressed here on more than one occasion. Furthermore, deepening democracy, exerting greater control over the multinationals and protecting the development of the least developed countries and regions and the citizens’ interests requires a democratic debate, requires national parliaments and the European Parliament to be consulted and the rule of unanimity to be upheld in negotiations in all of these areas. The role of the World Trade Organization must also be reduced and the United Nations General Assembly must be given a more active role in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Lamy, you think that more competition will provide the poor with high quality drinking water. I personally dispute your view and I believe that there are more and more of us who do so. Any commercialisation of water will automatically lead to an increase in consumption, for that is precisely how the system works.</p>
<p class="contents">You say that there is no mention of liberalising the resource in the requests the Union makes to the developing countries.

According to Unesco, culture comprises all the distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features which characterise a society or social group. In addition to the arts and literature, it encompasses ways of life, fundamental human rights, sets of values, traditions and beliefs. The right to culture is a fundamental human right. It is enshrined as such in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. Cultural diversity must not just be safeguarded: it must be furthered and promoted as well. Of course, this applies to all the Member States of the Union, but it also applies to the developing countries, for cultural diversity is an integral part of our human heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to avoid running the risk of culture being seen as just another product one day in the future, we must provide it with a new legal framework so that it does not have to be part of the negotiations on world trade. Culture is not just another commodity. The WTO cannot and must not be the forum for the debate on culture, as, moreover, Commissioner Reding said recently, stating that: ‘… we must strongly oppose holding any general conceptual discussion on cultural diversity or cultural policies within the WTO … The WTO is not the competent organisation to address this issue, nor has it been given a mandate to do so.’</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore create a new binding international legal instrument, not just to further and promote cultural diversity but to establish trade rules for cultural goods and services too. A number of Ministers for Culture have agreed to draft this instrument, in order to provide the States in the future with the necessary means to be able to identify, from a cultural point of view and according to their specific situations, the policies they need to ensure the preservation and promotion of cultural diversity. Unesco is the body which is best suited for the task. I therefore call for this process to be brought to an end as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is for that reason that I appeal to you, Commissioner Lamy, not to abandon the opt-out clause for public provision of services of general interest under any circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless, though, majority decisions are legitimised by democratic politics, the decision-making process in the countries – and there above all – is called into question by this discussion of fundamentals. The main problem with GATS is that negotiations focus on the market conditions under which services are provided across borders, to the exclusion, though, of the social conditions under which services are provided. If the result is the same as with the WTO on trading in goods hazardous to the environment, and if child and slave labour is not a reason to bar goods from entering the market, then I can see big problems heading towards us.</p>
<p class="contents">For as long as not even the International Labour Organisation's core labour standards are anchored in GATS, for as long as there is no fundamental clarification of the minimum conditions in labour and social security law under which migratory workers are to work on a temporary basis, I cannot imagine that a social consensus will be achieved in the EU in favour of opening up our market for services under module 4. If it is achieved, it will be only in the teeth of the greatest resistance.</p>

It is precisely because this set of problems leads to another – the problem of what is known as ‘cultural exception’, that it must be made clear that the Commission cannot allow itself to blunder into the issue of cultural exception. This is an extremely controversial issue, primarily due to its own assumptions. In an open world in which we are increasingly committed to the free interaction of cultures, cultural diversity must clearly be protected, preserved and valued, but not at the expense of hindering the free movement of values of exactly the same nature. It is increasingly senseless, treating some cultural products as if they were industrial products, to establish forms of protection that limit their access to certain locations, such as cinemas.</p>
<p class="contents">With television, video, DVD and other new technologies of the digital, online and Internet age, any spectator, any consumer who wishes to do so, can choose to view whatever they wish without any real barriers being able to hinder this consumption. I do not believe – or rather I must at least express my scepticism – that 50 Ministers for Culture can resolve this matter beyond the only point that will then be accepted, which is that every Member State can do whatever it feels is most appropriate to protect its interests and its own specific cultural diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Having made these observations, Madam President, I shall simply add that items 7, 8 and 9 of the report to which I have referred address the problem in a very sensible way in terms of prudence and balance and they deserve our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If, in addition to that, we can purchase at advantageous prices, we become more competitive, and that is in line with the Commission's objective of making us world leaders within ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my belief that, when talking about GATS and the WTO, we must, as a matter of priority, talk about the chances involved as well – about markets being opened up, prosperity increased, competitiveness and the possibility of increased wages. If we put markets under a sort of bell jar, if we suffocate a market, the end result is bankruptcies and unemployment, and let me say that these days, of course, decisions to do this are taken mainly at national level. Such decisions, of course, are party political in nature.</p>
<p class="contents">I travelled here today by rail from Wels in Austria; this took over seven hours in journey time alone and I was very late arriving here. Last Monday, I sent a letter from Brussels to Austria, and it has still not arrived there. When I travel back to Brussels, I remember that the sewage treatment plant<span class="italic"> </span>there is still not working despite public provision of services of general interest, and that Brussels is currently pumping sewage, quite untreated, into the sea. When I think of the universities, where the students have to sit on the floor, and where many of the professors' knowledge is not up to modern-day requirements, then I say that, yes, these are party political decisions that have to be taken by the voters in the various countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also, though, be thinking of the future; rather than seeing only the WTO's multilateral dimension, we should also be seeking out bilateral ways forward, especially with the USA, Russia and China.

Does that mean we are stupid, deaf or stuck in a rut? No, I think it is just that the time has come to admit that, quite simply, we do not want the same European project for our citizens. Thus, GATS has served to highlight this difference in the way we see the world and has prompted a debate involving more participants than the limited circle of specialists and decision-makers usually consulted on matters of international trade. We can say that we have learned from experience – and I believe that the dock workers outside can bear witness to that – how great the desire of some countries is to dominate in the market place where production is concerned.<span class="bold"> </span>We witness the fight to preserve public services daily.</p>

<p class="contents">Is cultural exception really sufficient if we only exclude the audiovisual sector? No, for we can identify sectors related to education and culture which could prove to be veritable Trojan horses and sabotage our efforts to preserve education and culture.

I would like to make two comments in this regard: firstly, Commissioner Lamy, you say that health, education, media and culture are not being liberalised. That is correct, but there are other sectors that fall under services of general interest. You do not rule out the liberalisation of energy and water, and the postal, port and pilotage sectors are already ready for liberalisation. My group therefore wants clear guarantees that Member States can now regulate their services of general interest in their own way and that these services will not be subject to the GATS. Naturally we do not need a WHO list for this; subsidiarity will apply as usual.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Commissioner Lamy, I find it shocking that there is such an imbalance between the questions from the northern and southern Member States regarding market liberalisation. In exchange for a limited number of questions, particularly concerning the mobility of labour from southern Member States, Europe wants to liberalise a number of sectors including some that we do not want to liberalise. Commissioner Lamy, I am of the opinion that liberalising water is not the right way to achieve the millennium targets and to halve the number of people who have no access to water. To do this we need relief funds and development cooperation. Anyway, I am convinced that this has nothing to do with genuine concern for the southern Member States but everything to do with the interests of the water industry. My group therefore requests that we do not adopt the liberalisation of sectors that we do not want to liberalise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is one-sided in being guided by economic interests, which is actually out of the question. The Treaties require us to make sustainable development the model for all our policies, which means that we cannot carry out liberalisation without at the same time negotiating social standards and environmental norms. This leads me to form the impression in my mind that you are actually in violation of Article 6 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">It is especially when one is presenting demands for liberalisation of water to seventy-two of this planet's states that one is negating the very social and ecological conditions that prevail locally. It is here that the principle of sustainable development must hold undoubted sway, rather than the economic considerations inherent in the ability to provide water if at all possible in the interests of shareholders. Decisions as to how to organise the water supply have to be taken on a local basis; they must remain with local politicians and must not be taken in response to external pressure.

<p class="contents">Briefly, I will turn to Mr van Velzen’s question on universities. No commitments concerning this sector will be given on this occasion. At the Uruguay Round ten years ago, we rashly gave a number of commitments on opening up private universities in certain Member States. This time, we will stand firm.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to consider the issue of bilateral relations with the United States, which I discussed with my American counterparts in Washington on Monday and Tuesday of last week. There are, indeed, a number of problems concerning implementation of WTO decisions on settling differences. The United States is not moving very quickly to implement these decisions. I visited the country to speed things up and I made sure our point of view on this was very clear, particularly to Congress, so that it would move forward with the necessary legislation. At this stage, the problem lies with Congress, not with the Administration. Congress has not said it will not proceed with the necessary legislation on this issue. Should it fail to do so however, the WTO has endowed us with the means to focus our minds, to use an English expression.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs McNally, with regard to the part of these negotiations on access to trade in services that concerns public services within the European Union, I have made my position on the content very clear: nothing we offer in these negotiations will undermine the current status of public services within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to the other issue, as outlined by Mrs van Lancker. This is the question of whether we might just be asking too much of certain developing countries on the issue of opening up the services sector. In the first place, I am aware that many developing countries need a competitive services sector. I know that while, in our part of the world, the services sector accounts for 60% of the economy, in most developing countries the services sector makes up between 40% and 50% of the economy. This is a considerable percentage. I am aware that developing countries themselves are calling for the liberalisation of the services sector, particularly in relation to the European Union. Lastly, I do not want us to fall headlong into the trap of what I would call ‘euromorphism’ over the issue of public services. In Europe we have an extremely well-developed public services structure. I am one of those who value it highly, although some may disagree with me. I must state clearly that other countries throughout the world, especially some developing countries, do not have the same type of public services provision. At present, these developing countries do not intend and frequently cannot afford to establish public services that, if I may say so, mirror our own. In this case, opening up the services market is the best way to improve the management of the economies of developing countries, make them more competitive and integrate them more effectively into world trade.</p>
<p class="contents">I will let my colleague, Mrs Reding, respond to Mrs Fraisse’s comments. I would, however, like to remind Mrs Fraisse that the secret of a successful team, especially a sports team, is to have a strong defence and a strong attack. In this regard, I think the distribution of roles is appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reply specifically to the question concerning sport raised by Mrs Fraisse. At this stage, there is no European Union offer relating in any way to sport or leisure, for the very simple reason that we have not received any requests to this effect.</p>
<p class="contents">In her contribution, Mrs Lucas focused on questions of transparency. Let us be very clear on this issue. The whole House has heard an account of the principles on which the Commission’s approach to these negotiations is based. I have explained these principles on numerous occasions. A number of Members (one Member for each group and the coordinators, in particular) have been able to study the details of my proposal by virtue of the institutional agreement between the institutions. I can well understand that you may have doubts about how the details of my proposals compare with the broad lines put forward. I can well understand also that you may wish to challenge me on my intentions. That is perfectly normal. Each and every one of you can ask your coordinator whether or not the details of my proposals correspond to what I previously announced. To my knowledge, the coordinators have had this information at their disposal for almost three weeks. Nobody, however, has approached me to say that the detailed proposals do not correspond with what I had previously announced. I am very much relieved as I am not in the habit of acting otherwise. Mrs Lucas, there is, indeed, transparency on this subject. If I do not make all the offers completely public, it is because it is sometimes better to keep matters confidential, in the best interests of either consultation or negotiation. Moreover, this is something the European Parliament itself understands well. For example, Parliament reserves the right to confidentiality in the case of conciliation procedure when negotiations would be at risk. I believe it is right for Parliament to retain this option. As in all negotiations, there is a time for informing the public and a time for discretion.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the substance, I would refer to Mr Clegg’s comments where the main points are concerned. He is quite right in what he says. Unless and until the Convention grants the European Parliament real constitutional power in trade affairs, denied it by the earlier Intergovernmental Conference, where this type of procedure – which I endeavour to manage to the best of my ability – is concerned, you will indeed, in theory, be without any power in this area. We have gone well beyond the current provisions on information and transparency of the EC Treaty. If you want to move further ahead, as the Commission does, please support us. I trust that Members’ interventions at the Convention will be as emphatic as those sometimes directed against the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Abitbol and Mr Berthu, I would hope, when it comes down it, that people will not cry wolf too often. If we cry wolf when there is no wolf, we only end up frightening people. There is no wolf here. Whatever your views on this issue and whatever you can establish about it, those of you who understand it and have access to the information know that there is no wolf. There is no question of opening a Pandora’s box of any kind. It has not been opened and remains closed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Désir, I completely understand all your reservations. I share a number of them. Once again, however, we should not act as if the Pandora’s box of deregulation had been opened. It remains closed. We are not considering the liberalisation of services. We are considering proceeding with opening up trade in services. This has nothing to do with deregulation, liberalisation or privatisation. We should not confuse two completely different debates. On the one hand, we have the debate amongst ourselves within the European Union on the extent of liberalisation of certain sectors that have hitherto been protected. These include energy, transport and postal services. This debate concerns the way we organise our own society. It involves a number of my colleagues within the Commission as well as Parliament and the Council. On the other hand, we have the debate on issues relating to external negotiations. Please do not bring the dock workers into it. To the best of my knowledge, unless I am very much mistaken, the dock workers’ presence relates to a draft directive on the internal market. The dock workers sector is not on the list. They are concerned about the internal market. If we open up transport services, or ask others to do so, then our control over those services, and over those we are asking to open up their markets, will not be affected in any way by negotiations of this kind. Allow me to repeat: in no way will it be affected. We will retain our sovereign right to regulate these sectors as we see fit. This matter therefore has nothing to do with the draft directive at issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment briefly on what Mr Herzog had to say. Overall, I agree with him. The real debate, underlying the present one, the anxiety, fears and reservations concern what is happening within the European Union, or what will happen in the coming years. I understand all the feelings expressed. I therefore agree with Mr Herzog that, in this debate, in the Commission’s work and in future debates with the Council and Parliament, we should focus on the organisation of public services, of the universal service, of services of general interest within the European Union. If we had more direction and if the agreement between us on what exactly constitutes services of public interest were more clearly defined, then some of the fears expressed in this debate would be dispelled, and rightly so.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to the questions concerning the water sector. I recognise these are sensitive issues. I appreciate that Mr Turmes, Mrs Figueiredo and Mr Karlsson wish to point out to me that, thus far, GATS has failed to produce noteworthy results as far as water is concerned. I would simply respond by saying that water is outside the remit of GATS. Thus far, no country has given even a minimal commitment concerning the water distribution sector under the General Agreement on Trade in Services. Not a single one! No such commitment has been given by any country. What has happened, or what is happening in a number of countries stems from sovereign decisions that countries have taken on liberalisation or on privatisation. This has nothing to do with international negotiations on services. If many countries, particularly developing ones, have proceeded with cases of independent liberalisation or privatisation, it is for the most part because they needed foreign direct investment. In my opinion, GATS and other similar negotiations allow such countries to attract investment without surrendering their right to regulate. There have been occasions when they have been forced to do so as the result of a reckless approach. In a sense, therefore, this amounts to a form of protection. I would remind the House once again that our proposals for this area relate only to distribution. They do not relate to access to water, as Mr Turmes recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, before I give Mrs Reding the floor, I would like to respond to those Members who have urged me to be more proactive, namely Mr De Clercq, Mr Harbour, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel and Mr Rübig. I am not surprised by their statements. I do wish to take a harder line on this matter but I believe I should take account of the misgivings expressed in different quarters. In general, these concerns stem from confusing international negotiations on trade in services, on the one hand, with the attitudes and negotiations within the European Union on the control, regulation and deregulation of services, on the other hand. In my opinion, these two debates are quite different. Given that these misgivings and concerns do exist, however, we must respond to them patiently and as clearly as possible. The Commission is ready to do just this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, we want to maintain our ability to protect cultural creativity on a regional, national and international level. To this end, we need to have the freedom to support all kinds of cultural products, if that is what we want to call them. Secondly, cultural products are not the same as commercial products. Culture has another dimension. It is linked to our roots and our diversity. As Mrs De Sarnez rightly said, and as I have clearly stated, neither GATS nor the WTO is an appropriate forum in which to debate culture. I therefore agree with all those in this House who have stated that we need an international body like Unesco.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, we need to be aware that, at present, there is no international legal reference standard for culture. I agree with all the Members who stated that one is called for. We need one to pre-empt this never-ending series of debates on culture. Even if Mr Lamy and I do not open the Pandora’s box on this issue, there is a deep-rooted fear in the Member States and amongst the people of Europe that this could nonetheless happen one day. We therefore need an international legal reference standard in the interests of cultural diversity and cultural exchange. It is an idea we should work on. It follows logically from the Unesco declaration and we are studying it with interest.</p>
<p class="contents">My own feeling is that the viability of an international instrument would depend, in particular, on its capacity to develop reference standards on cultural diversity at an international level. Initially, it should foster reflection on indicators of cultural diversity</p>
<p class="contents">That said, preserving our ability to support cultural diversity entails, in the first place, action within the European Union. Nevertheless, many Members of this House who have indicated that we need to go further are right. We do have an international responsibility which goes beyond the Europe of Fifteen or Twenty-five. The Treaty now provides for this. Article 151(4) allows international action where culture is concerned and we regularly engage in this. I can assure you that a film director from a third country could not show his or her film in Europe without an invitation to a European cinema festival. We are most certainly opening up to others. I would like to tell Mr van Velzen that our Erasmus World project is only possible because the Treaty allows us to go beyond the borders of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this must certainly be preserved in the European Convention and in the next Treaty. In the forthcoming Treaty, we must be allowed to retain our ability to protect cultural diversity of all kinds within the Union. We must also be able to retain our ability to act beyond the borders of the Union at international level. This could involve the creation of a Unesco type of international agreement to protect culture, or projects like Erasmus World<span class="italic">. </span>It could also involve helping creative people from third countries express themselves in the forums made available to them.</p>
<p class="contents">You will appreciate that culture necessarily entails opening up. Clearly, this opening up is not merely for the benefit of Europeans; it also involves welcoming creative artists and others from third countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are unable to exercise parliamentary control. What value do meetings involving confidential documents held behind closed doors have? How can we accept this lack of democratic debate where neither national parliaments nor the European Parliament are involved? The Commission is relying on a general mandate pre-dating Seattle that has been rendered null and void. It therefore has no legitimate right to impose its decisions. Through aggressive demands directed at third countries, concerning the water sector, in particular, the Commission is undermining any genuine efforts to address the needs of the people of the countries involved. Other values must be promoted over the profits of multinationals, trade for its own sake and the rationale of privatisation: particularly the need for strong public services, which are essential to social cohesion and equality. We must ask ourselves why it is so difficult to assess the consequences of liberalisation. Modernity lies in the ability of governments to guarantee fundamental rights and not in a determination to satisfy the financial markets. I join with more than 150 other French elected representatives in demanding transparency and the suspension of the negotiations in order to prevent an irreversible GATS. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
