Parliament contributed to the observation mission conducted in Georgia by OSCE-ODIHR, and to the balanced and highly pertinent statement of preliminary findings which was released on 2 October. I want to signal my appreciation for that work, and for the ongoing commitment of all Members to Georgia’s long-term democratic development.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only support the assessment made by President Schulz: these elections were, in the main, competitive, free and peaceful. They indicate growing democratic maturity and underscore Georgia’s commitment to its democratic path.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there will be important lessons to learn from these elections, and we will await the final report of OSCE-ODIHR with great interest. We should not forget the key issues that preoccupied us in the run-up to the polls – freedom of assembly, access to the media, campaign financing, and the use of administrative resources. It is important to remain vigilant on all these issues. I am glad that the European Union was able to contribute to the quality of these elections through media monitoring, parallel voter tabulation, and other forms of assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a change of government, but it is important to stress continuity in some critical areas. Georgia’s foreign policy continues to be oriented towards European and Euro-Atlantic integration. It is important to underline that clearly, and from the start. The new government has also already very clearly expressed its ambition to move forward at speed with critical processes such as the Association Agreement, the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area negotiations, and the visa liberalisation process. In return, we have assured it of the European Union’s ongoing commitment to support those ambitions, in terms of technical support, policy dialogue, and the effective targeting of financial assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, I had the opportunity to visit Tbilisi with the Deputy Secretary General of the European External Action Service, both of us representing High Representative and Vice-President Ashton. We met with Prime Minister Ivanishvili, the new Minister of Defence, Irakli Alasania, the new Foreign Minister, Maia Panjikidze, and the new Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, Aleksi Petriashvili. Obviously, these will be key relationships for the European Union in the coming months and years. We also met President Saakashvili; we underlined our appreciation of his statesmanlike conduct, emphasised our full support for the constitutional rights of the Presidency, and recalled the need for effective political opposition in any democracy. We also met representatives of civil society to listen to their impressions of the election and its aftermath.</p>
<p class="contents">This visit was an opportunity to get to know our new interlocutors, and to stress three main points. Firstly, that all European Union ‘offers’ are still on the table, and we are ready to work with the new administration as quickly and as energetically as they wish. Secondly, that we expect both the cohabiting partners – Presidency and government – to build on the commitments they have made to a smooth and professional handover, and to support the long-term interests of Georgia and its people. Finally, we have of course reminded our hosts that the European Union is committed to Georgia’s territorial integrity. Through the Geneva International Discussions and the European Union Monitoring Mission, we are the guarantors of Georgia’s security. We will not step away from these responsibilities, but at the same time we expect Georgia to shoulder its responsibilities too.</p>
<p class="contents">I came away reassured that Georgia’s democracy is in good health, and that both Prime Minister Ivanishvili and President Saakashvili are committed to working together and to the continuation of a smooth transfer of power in their country’s best interest. They will face significant challenges during their cohabitation, and we should not be complacent, but I believe we should lend both sides our impartial support and focus on values rather than personalities.</p>

Discussions took place prior to the elections and I think that this dialogue will be continued, because Georgia needs it. Congratulations are of course due to the winning side, but above all, Georgian society deserves to be congratulated on passing the democratic test. One could go so far as to say that, despite various tensions, those elections were the best to have ever taken place in that part of Europe. I think that President Saakashvili deserves recognition for having recognised his party’s defeat and for transferring power peacefully, something that is unprecedented in the Caucasus region. We can but hope that the new government will maintain the direction of the country’s foreign policy and the pro-Western tendency embraced by Georgia a few years ago. We must, of course, monitor the situation to ensure that all is well, that democracy is working as it should, and that the President, the Government, the majority party and the opposition are all cooperating for the good of Georgia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the first time in modern Georgian history we have seen a peaceful transition of power. It is a great achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in a democracy this is not the end: there are huge tasks facing the political class in Georgia and the people of Georgia. The reforms have to continue. There must be cooperation between the winners and the losers, between the President and the new government. The tasks include internal reforms, both political and economic. As social democrats, we would also like to see social inequality being tackled, to see workers’ and social rights bolstered, to see assurances for the trade unions on free and independent movement and free and independent work, so that the rights of the Georgian people are guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been talk about foreign-policy orientation. The new government has stressed that it will continue on the Euro-Atlantic path, and we welcome that. But there is also a chance to normalise – or at least attempt to normalise – Georgia’s relations with its big northern neighbour, Russia. There is a chance to move forward with the situation in the occupied territories, and I think we will support that.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner mentioned the association agreement and the deep and comprehensive free trade agreement. We should pay attention to these matters, and try to speed up the process. In the same way, we would like to see a speeding-up of the visa liberalisation process so that the Georgian people, especially young people, have a chance to come to the countries of the European Union, to engage in exchanges with us, and to move closer to European values and to the nations and people of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They were model elections given the democratic challenges that the country has faced in the past. With these free, competitive and fair elections, Georgia has proven that it can build its new democracy on European values, which it cherishes. </p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, much more needs to be done to ensure a stable, undiluted democracy, particularly in the context of its conflicts with its larger neighbour, as one of my colleagues pointed out. We must support Georgia, however, in particular by opening up the visa regime for Georgian citizens, which will help to bring them closer to European values, and by completing the two agreements. I am certain that the current government, dominated by Liberals, will continue to build on Georgia’s European and Euro-Atlantic ambitions. It is a government that will attempt to stabilise and modernise the institutional framework, and will certainly not repeat Georgia’s totalitarian mistakes of the past. I believe that Georgia is now a model for other countries of the Caucasus, and it needs our continued support. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Commissioner, that what you are doing for Georgia is a successful initiative of the current Commission and we should all be proud of the way in which we have supported Georgia in its development and in bringing it closer to the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to follow up on what my colleagues have already said and congratulate Georgian citizens on a really democratic election and a peaceful transition of power. This is the first time that a change of government has been carried out by vote in the Southern Caucasus since the end of the Soviet Union, so this was really a good step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Some things do still need to be improved in the electoral law, but I also hope that both sides, President Saakashvili and Prime Minister Ivanishvili, will work in a concerted effort seeking consensus and compromise in the time of cohabitation. I would like to remind them that cooperation and not confrontation is one of the principles of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, two issues which I would like to mention which I think it is important to tackle quickly and thoroughly in the short term. Firstly, Georgia needs a stringent and effective law on party financing and also a law on potential and actual conflicts of interest, to draw a clear line of separation between private and public interests for persons holding office. I think it is essential in a democracy that you know where parties get money from, and how campaigning is done. This needs to be transparent and a law on this matter needs to be enacted as soon as possible in the Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">A second thing: I would like to remind ourselves and everyone else who is listening about the shocking images of torture in Georgian prisons which we saw before the elections. It is necessary to hold a thorough investigation into that and to undertake an in-depth reform of the penitentiary system in Georgia so citizens in Georgia can enjoy life without violation of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The presence of the European Parliament election observation mission and national parliament missions from countries including Poland undoubtedly contributed to this. The individuals directly involved deserve to be commended and thanked. Georgia is one of the founding members of the Eastern Partnership and has proved eager for wide-ranging cooperation with Europe from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">The assurances given by the winning coalition after the election must therefore be welcomed. It stated that Tbilisi would continue to aim at accession to the European Union and NATO, and that the country would never return to the Russian sphere of influence, nor would it seek to accede to the post-Soviet Community of Independent States. In this context, confirmation of the stance to date regarding the Georgian provinces under Russian occupation is particularly significant. Our diplomatic offensive on this issue is vital. Continually strengthening relations with Georgia must be one of the aims of Europe’s foreign policy. The new government under Mr Ivanishvili has announced its intention to continue economic reforms and the fight against corruption. Brussels should therefore increase its efforts to support and promote development. I trust that the current excellent cooperation with Tbilisi will continue and that the actions announced by the new Prime Minister will be implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Judging by the motions for resolutions so far discussed in the European Parliament, including the one being discussed right now, most of my colleagues clearly do not understand that this involves relationships that are different from those in Western Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact that Bertha von Suttner, a great campaigner for world peace and the peaceful resolution of conflicts, found asylum in that country in the second half of the 19th century. It is also a fact that the infamous Joseph Stalin came from there. The south Caucasus is noted for its long-standing huge tangle of peoples and ethnicities. The great powers have always been involved there, whether it be Russia, Persia, Turkey or some of the present-day states of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Georgian brandy is renowned for its quality and Georgians for their warmth, and they are to be congratulated on their democratic elections. However, it has to be borne in mind that we are a long way to the east. Families stay together more than in Western Europe and family clans are far more involved in the political scene.</p>
<p class="contents">I take some of the injudicious wording of the motion for a European Parliament resolution to be a continuation of pronounced anti-Russian feelings. Indeed, this is nothing new in European Union policies relating to the Caucasus. I believe that the sentence ‘...territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia are still <span class="italic">de facto</span> occupied’ is quite unacceptable. The authors are also pushing for an ‘independent’ Kosovo, which is not a good calling card for these giants of European Union foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to stop the self-righteousness and double standards, and to promote normal bilateral relations with the new Georgian Government. This resolution certainly raises questions as to the seriousness of attempts at cooperation with the Russian Federation to resolve the situation not only in Georgia, but throughout the south Caucasus. It is time to get rid of colonial nostalgia and to begin to regard neighbours of the European Union as proper partners.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left cannot support this resolution.</p>

Nine years after the non-violent Rose Revolution of 2003, President Saakashvili’s monopoly on power has been broken. The hero of the revolution has had to pay in this election for his transformation into authoritarian leader during his anti-corruption crusade.</p>
<p class="contents">The mere fact that there is a strong opposition is undoubtedly a democratic achievement. It will soon become apparent whether and how this cooperation will work. It is to be hoped, in any case, that work will begin on the planned reforms, including that of the legal system, and, above all, that the country will continue to follow its pro-Western course, pursuing its goals of NATO and European Union membership or at least not losing momentum. </p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, a great deal will hinge on whether Bidzina Ivanishvili, Georgia’s next great hope for democracy and prosperity, can live up to the expectations placed on him. The first test for the new party, Georgian Dream, will surely be how it deals with the abuse of power committed by former Rose Revolutionaries. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is to be hoped that the political clean-up that is certain to take place will not see the fundamental principles of the rule of law and democracy discarded, as was the case in Ukraine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The key positions in it have been entrusted to people with a clear political and professional background and that, on its own, is a positive sign for both the people of Georgia and its foreign partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out something that is seemingly paradoxical at first glance: President Saakashvili’s defeat and the peaceful shift of power are the strongest evidence that the Rose Revolution achieved its objectives. Georgia has proved that it is a functioning democracy. The welcome outcome, however, should not blind us to the worrying signs that were evident during the election campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the elections were very close to being discredited and I am convinced that the EU’s strong presence acted as a deterrent. I therefore want to express my gratitude to Catherine Ashton and Stefan Füle for the excellent work that they and their teams carried out on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to implement rapidly the recommendations of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe for the elections and to remedy any legislative shortcomings so that the presidential elections next year reaffirm the positive tendencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The current cohabitation of Prime Minister and a President come from different parties would pose a great challenge even to established democracies. I believe, however, that the shared long-term goals will help to overcome any conflict on a personal or party level, which, in my opinion, is the most serious threat facing Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for Georgia to continue its efforts to ensure good relations with the EU for the success of the negotiations on the EU-Georgia Association Agreement. Furthermore, we expect the new government to do more to help the poor sections of society, strengthening labour rights, and remedying the shortcomings and inequalities inherited from the recent ultraliberal economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I look forward to the formation of the new Georgian delegation in the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly. I hope that its composition will allow Georgian Members of Parliament to be included in the groups of the main political families, such as the People’s Party, the Socialists and the Liberals.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to thank the current members of the delegation and I hope that we will continue to work with some of them in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It happened, we should welcome it, and we should congratulate Mr Ivanishvili and his government on assuming office. His commitment to an early visit to Brussels, and his appointment of Alex Petriashvili as European Affairs Minister, suggests we can be confident in the government’s European intentions and must look forward to progress towards an association agreement, a free trade agreement and visa-free travel, and new efforts in the Geneva international discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us not underestimate or forget how bad things had become: the reports of the international election observers about harassment and intimidation during the campaign; the regular reports from Amnesty International about the situation in Georgia; and those horrific prison torture videos that came out. Only time will tell whether Mr Saakashvili’s acceptance of defeat was a virtuous bow to democratic values, or a tactical retreat under international pressure, as Tedo Japaridze has suggested. The Foreign Affairs Council stressed the importance of an effective political opposition and a vibrant civil society and of supporting capacity-building. I think they might start by deploring the tone and the language of the speech by the Member of the Georgian Parliament Giorgi Gabashvili in the debate yesterday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hence I am more than happy with today’s result, which is balanced and objective. I would like to applaud the Greens, Liberals and Social Democrats for their appreciation of statements made by, and the behaviour of, President Saakashvili after the elections, despite the frequently justified criticisms that have been directed at this President of Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents">The same praise goes to our Conservative colleagues for giving the winning former opposition the benefit of the doubt. We agree that the de facto occupation of Georgian territories by Russia should be stopped, but we should also try to behave according to the spirit of our texts, and it is not only for this Parliament’s delegation to raise this issue with Russia: Baroness Ashton, Commissioner Füle and every Commission official at every meeting with Russian colleagues should bring the issue to the table. Perhaps the business leaders of Europe should also talk about it until the Russian Government understands.</p>
<p class="contents">In paragraph 10 of the motion for a resolution, we refer to the need for better rules on party financing in Georgia. It is true that such rules are needed, and I agree with my colleague Ulrike Lunacek there. But we should also focus on our own rules, in the context of a new set of rules for political parties and their financing at European level as well as party financing in the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am ashamed to report to this Chamber that the former Communists governing Estonia – important players in the old totalitarian Soviet system – are mismanaging public and private funds in the most cynical ways in order to reinforce their vertical power structure. We should demand that former Communists, who nowadays have the unfortunate habit of calling themselves Liberals, apply the same financing rules that we expect our Georgian friends to apply to their political parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On a technical level, the elections were fair; that is a great achievement and I congratulate the former government that organised them. I believe, however, that the Georgian Dream coalition used huge media and financial resources (the latter of dubious origin) to buy favours and votes, which is a common trend in the region. This type of politics creates major distortions in young democracies because it discourages hard work and fairness, and promotes a quick win. </p>
<p class="contents">The elections and transfer of power are a step in the right direction but they must be complemented by an efficient political system with the appropriate institutions. Unfortunately, in the excitement of the victory, the winners conveyed the wrong message by calling for the resignation of a President elected by popular vote. For a government that, hypothetically at least, intends to continue with the Association Agreement and move closer to Europe, its pressure and threats against its opponents are unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a historical step for Georgia; however, more such transfers of power are necessary in order for us to be able to say with any certainty that democracy and free elections are here to stay in Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents">During the transition period, all political parties must demonstrate that they are able to cooperate and take responsibility for Georgia’s future and the country’s route towards Europe. Cooperation and the ability to compromise will determine whether or not the period of constitutional coexistence is successful.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with this, both Mr Saakashvili’s quick acknowledgement of the defeat of his party and also Mr Ivanishvili’s retraction of the demand for Mr Saakashvili to step down give me hope that this cooperation and willingness to compromise does exist. I urge these two gentlemen to work together for the well-being of Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also pleasing that the new government has expressed a desire to continue along the road to Europe, and that Ivanishvili intends to make his first trip to Brussels. However, it is just as important to continue the cooperation with NATO and the development of Euro-Atlantic integration. The EU intends to continue to develop its relations with Georgia.

They did a good job. We may, of course, have some concerns about the financing of the election campaign and about its conduct. Not everyone is delighted with everything, but the Georgians did what they were called upon to do: they ran a democratic election. For a post-Soviet region, that in itself is an achievement and a success. If we do have certain concerns about the state of affairs, we should look first at our own actions, because our time has now come. We in the European Union have to work to create a scenario in which Georgia can be integrated into Western structures. We must fulfil the obligations we entered into, that is, ensuring the withdrawal of Russian forces from Georgian soil. After all, we are responsible for the implementation of that six-point plan. The people of Georgia have done what they had to do, and now it is our turn.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am counting on close cooperation and I believe that, if we want to, we will understand that we now have a moral and political duty to fulfil. I urge you to make every effort and I know that you are capable of doing so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Georgia is an unrecognisable place from the dictatorship which oppressed its people until just nine years ago. It has now demonstrated that it is a mature democracy. While we note the fact that the Georgian state still has some work to do on other fronts, the preliminary cohabitation signals from President Saakashvili and Prime Minister Ivanishvili are extremely encouraging, with a very smooth handover of democratic powers.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome improved Georgia-Russia relations, but of course Tbilisi should not compromise over its territorial integrity or European westward leanings.

I said we would either have, for the first time in Georgian history, a transfer of power through democratic means, or we would have a strong and constructive opposition. I did not know at that time that we might end up with both of those at the same time – a change of power and a strong opposition. I take it as a major sign of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank all those Members who have contributed to this useful and interesting discussion. I want to reassure you of my personal commitment to following through on our promises to Georgia, including the one which you have stressed a number of times – the one related to the territorial integrity of Georgia. Maintaining the pace of our political association with Georgia is vital to the credibility of the Eastern Partnership and to the prospects for stability and peaceful development in the Southern Caucasus.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to underline the valuable role of this House in supporting Georgia’s democratic development so far. I am confident that you will continue in this work, helping Georgia to build stronger democratic institutions, to implement all the lessons learned from the October elections, and to encourage an effective parliamentary dialogue between government and opposition, in the service of long-term policy continuity, accountability and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, I would add the two following remarks. Mr Danjean raised an important point, and I wanted to make it absolutely clear that I did not miss the opportunity to make a strong call on the EU authorities to resist the temptation for political retribution. I have to say that I found in Prime Minister Ivanishvili a committed partner, interested in strengthening democracy and continuing to make the best use of the deepening of political association and economic integration.</p>
<p class="contents">What I think was the most impressive element of my recent trip last week to Georgia was my individual conversation with Prime Minister Ivanishvili and President Saakashvili, both of them having a positive assessment of the transfer of power so far. I called on them to build on that positive experience and to create a strong basis for being able to address the many challenges this cohabitation will bring – and, make no mistake, there will be many.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may also continue a thought Mr Tarand expressed – let me use the Georgia case but I think it is actually an issue which covers more countries – when we face the election in our partner countries, the time before the elections and after the elections is sometimes also an opportunity for the political families in this House to shadow, to a certain extent, the competition of the main political parties in those elections. I believe that this is a normal political reaction of this noble House.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make the following plea. The stronger the bipartisan support for strengthening democracy that comes from this House, the more opportunity the High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission and all of us will have to actually deliver our assistance to strengthen democracy in those countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also welcome the fact that, in addition, Mr Ivanishvili would like to make NATO membership and closer EU integration a reality for Georgia.
