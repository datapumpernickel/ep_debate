All of us in the European Union who supposedly have a position of responsibility face a huge challenge. I think we have an historic chance today to prove that our acts are tantamount to a declaration of good intentions towards the western Balkans. The sums budgeted for the Balkans should put us in mind, in terms of quality and quantity, of a new Marshall plan and should act as a springboard to a new beginning in the countries of the western Balkans. Nor should we forget that the countries of the western Balkans are not third countries, they are candidate countries for membership of the European Union and we must treat them as such.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the European Union is often accused of promising aid to countries struck by disaster or catastrophe and then taking so long to pay it, so long to keep its financial promises that either it creates the impression that it regrets having promised it in the first place or, when it finally does pay, it is already too late. Luckily, there is a shining exception to this rule, and it really is a rule. The exception is the Reconstruction Agency which has its headquarters in Thessaloniki and an operational centre in Kosovo. This agency complies with the Commission's decision on decentralisation and is exceptionally efficient in managing the project for which it is responsible. It has already signed contracts for 90% of the budget for 2000, which is truly amazing. It has already disbursed approximately 30% of the appropriations for 2000. Plus, and this is unprecedented, it has requested a reduction in wage costs. I therefore propose, that not only should we leave these people in peace to get on with their job with the gusto and enthusiasm which they have shown so far, not only should we refrain from upsetting the <span class="italic">modus operandi </span>of the agency, although we should, of course, make it responsible for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and anywhere else it is needed, but we should also ask them to pass their know-how on to other committees whose work, as we all know, is so abysmal, so inefficient and brings in such poor results. I trust that we can use these opinions to do more for this region in which hardship and suffering abound. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The previous speaker spoke of a sort of Marshall plan for this region and rightly so, I think. It is the prerogative of those handing out money to stipulate the political objectives and the Commissioner has done so on several occasions. Nonetheless, I should like briefly to outline them once again today on behalf of my group.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we still have a situation in this region, more's the pity, in which human rights and minority rights are not properly respected. That is now a fact. Our first objective, therefore, must be to help where we can and where we see that there is the will to take better account of minority and human rights in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, international agreements are being challenged in this region over and over again, including recently the Dayton agreement. If I think back to the election campaign in Bosnia-Herzegovina, one of the saddest side-effects of the election process was that leading politicians distanced themselves from Dayton, not in the sense of saying they wanted to go further and wanted more stability, but in the sense of destabilisation. Here we must say an unequivocal ‘no’. Respect for international agreements – including in connection with Dayton – obviously includes cooperation with the War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague. We must act decisively – albeit with a certain degree of tolerance – both towards Kostunica, whom we shall be receiving here tomorrow, and the new Yugoslav authorities. There are a few positive signs, but certainly not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there must be no unilateral changes to borders. That applies to both Montenegro and Kosovo. Here too, we must be clear and unequivocal. We must give the new Yugoslavia a chance. I hope it will grab that chance. I am not excluding border changes, but I am quite definitely excluding unilateral border changes, whichever side makes them. Any such changes must be set out in an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, and most importantly for us, new borders are being erected but they are no obstacle to the activities of criminal organisations, which know no borders. We must combat illegal cross-border activities, be they in connection with the drug trade, cross-border cooperation or trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">Borders are there to be dismantled, but not by criminals and, unfortunately, they are more active here than in other regions. These are the objectives we need to achieve with the funds and instruments which we are now creating. I think that the Commission and Council are also keen for us to work consistently with the means at our disposal over coming years to achieve these objectives. But where there is no will, nor should there be money from us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Souladakis (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Mr Kostunica, the new President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, will be addressing the House tomorrow. His symbolic presence here could open up prospects for the overall policy which we are pursuing. My second comment is that the previous speakers complained that the European Union pays, but the US is listened to. That is only logical because the US has engaged in political acts in Bosnia with the Dayton agreement and the US has again engaged in political acts in Kosovo with the initiative which it took on the bombings and much else besides.</p>
<p class="contents">What does that mean for us? That policy must come first or must at least move in parallel if it is to have political objectives. What should these political objectives be? Obviously, institutional aspects and the proper working of democracy take priority in the region as a whole. If democracy is working properly it will create the preconditions to respect for minorities in the various regions. If democracy is working properly, it will help the region to run smoothly. However, it must also be based on individuals. We must admit that, on numerous occasions, the individuals serving a number of purposes during the transitional phase were not a healthy expression of political life in the region. In this sense, we need to review our perception of individuals, facts and situations.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue which I would like to touch on concerns the strategy in the region. Quite clearly, uniting political prospects with economic and institutional prospects is a positive development. However, if positive developments are to have good results, they need a strategic framework and a strategic aspect. From this point of view, I think that resurrecting an issue which was resolved about a year ago with the Pack report as far as the headquarters of the Reconstruction Agency is concerned is a disservice. It would be a good idea for Commissioner Patten, who has a great deal of experience – not to say wisdom – in managing international crises, to add to the visits which he has made to various regions of the Balkans by going to the headquarters of the Reconstruction Agency in Thessaloniki in order to see how this department works. In this sense, I endorse and repeat everything which Mr Folias just said.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyway, enough of the bad news, now to the good news. The Lagendijk report, apart from the criticism which I may have levied at one point, is an excellent text, as is the Commission proposal. They create a framework for political initiatives which must be built up into new perceptions. We must look on this region as a region of Europe and not as a region of antagonism between the countries and the national policies of Europe or America. If we treat the area as a region of political antagonism we shall be making a big mistake. In all events, I think that we are on the right track. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The message sent by Parliament through these documents comes across loud and clear. It is my hope that the Commission and the Council will accept it with due interest and amend the two regulations accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware of the importance of European Union aid for the Balkan region. The re-establishment of a democratic political system in Serbia is the start of a new chapter in history, but the Union must be the protagonist of this new phase rather than the passive, slothful observer which it has been thus far. Our technical and economic intervention must be large-scale and effective, for this is the very least the Union can do to give the region and the continent as a whole a stable future. We must bear in mind that there is still a long way to go along the road to peace in the Balkans and that potential friction points still exist which could well set the whole process back again. But this region, the most troubled region of Europe, has never held such hope as it does now. The virtually despotic Croatian system has been replaced with a pro-West democratic system. The vulnerable countries surrounding the remains of Yugoslavia have weathered the crisis, and, what is more, Bulgaria, Albania and Macedonia have even made economic progress.</p>
<p class="contents">In the fine changes of balance currently governing the Balkan region, the responsibility of the European Union is great, enormous, and when we say the Union we mean the Member States but also the European and Parliament. The Member States make grandiose declarations of their intentions but these must be followed by a concrete financial undertaking. The European Commission must assume responsibility for the smooth running of these programmes, and this is the primary objective of the two reports which are to be put to the vote tomorrow. Parliament must be regularly consulted and updated on progress, and it is this, the second of the rapporteurs' requests, which we must all support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

NATO professes to have intervened in order to prevent further suffering, and yet there were far more exiles, dead and wounded as a result of this war than there had been in the 12 allegedly decisive months before NATO intervened militarily. Surely the region was not effectively destabilised until NATO waged war on it? In the end, the intervention by NATO in the Balkans served to legitimise the NATO strategy and its so-called self-imposed mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">In recognition of the war damage caused and the fact that the situation was escalated by NATO, payments should be equal to not half but all the quantified war damage. More importantly, instead of lending money, the EU – and in particular the Member States which belong to NATO – should pay reparation for the damage which they caused. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it is good to see some familiar faces in the Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to traverse the ground that was covered by the Minister earlier in his remarks about the Zagreb Summit. I totally endorse all the objectives which he set out. That summit is taking place in rather happier conditions than we perhaps imagined when the presidency first conceived of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to focus on the regulations. I should like, first of all, to thank the House for its excellent and speedy work during its examination of these two draft regulations. I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs of the relevant committees: firstly, Mr Westendorp y Cabeza, who has considerable on-the-ground experience of these matters in Bosnia, and also Mr Lagendijk, with whom we have a regular dialogue on southeast Europe. He is at least one other human being with whom I can share the distinction of having read Misha Glenny on the Balkans. I should also like to thank the following Members: Mr Staes, Mr Färm and Mr Gargani for the quality of their reports and opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">These two proposals respond to two key Union priorities: providing assistance to southeastern Europe and providing it as rapidly and as efficiently as possible. The European Councils of Lisbon and Feira underlined the importance that the Union gives to the integration of this region into the economic and political mainstream of Europe. Our policy for achieving that is the stabilisation and association process. Of course the European Union is making a leading contribution through that process to the work of the Stability Pact. The heads of government have also confirmed the Union's determination to back this process with technical and economic assistance. The return of democracy to Serbia, thanks to the determination and courage of the Serb people and the democratic forces there, offers the chance now of building prosperity across the whole region.</p>
<p class="contents">More than ever the European Union has to live up to the commitments it has made. To do that we must have the right legal instruments, flexible procedures and efficient management. The reform of external assistance which the Commission adopted on 16 May demonstrates our determination to improve radically the speed, quality and visibility of external assistance. In southeast Europe this determination has already brought concrete results.</p>
<p class="contents">In Kosovo the taskforce which we deployed within days of the end of the conflict and, in the last six months, the European Agency for Reconstruction have achieved a track record of delivering help on time and efficiently. The figures bear this out: 84% of the funds allocated for reconstruction under Obnova – in 1998 to 2000 EUR 444.5 million – had been committed by the end of October 2000. Seventy percent of the funds committed had been contracted and 43% of the contracted funds had been paid.</p>
<p class="contents">We have achieved rapid results in Serbia too, where the Commission, in the space of just over four weeks, has drawn up an emergency assistance programme worth in total EUR 200 million. It was agreed by the Commission last week and the first trucks of heating fuel started rolling into Serbia at the weekend, ahead of schedule and ahead of most other donors. This programme is going to ratchet up every day from now on: a contract for imports of EUR 30 million in electricity was signed today with the Serbian Electricity Company and should come on-stream within days. Every day counts in this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our reforms have started to bring results too in Bosnia, where the implementation of assistance, in terms of amounts contracted and disbursed has improved dramatically since our delegation in Sarajevo was reinforced last year and authority was delegated to it. The results that have been achieved are extremely encouraging.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the results of which the European Parliament too can be proud. It was the European Parliament that sounded the alarm about weak management in Bosnia. It was Parliament which supported the Commission's proposal to create the European Agency for Reconstruction. It was Parliament which insisted on a single regulatory framework for assistance to the region and it was Parliament, in its role as budgetary authority, which made sure that funds were made available for emergency assistance for Serbia, without delay. This is good progress but we need to build on it. There is still plenty of room for improvement. That is the purpose of these two proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of Parliament have tabled a significant number of amendments. I want to comment on them as they relate to our twin proposals on the agency and the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed an assistance regulation which is deliberately simple and clear. It sets out the over-arching objectives for assistance for the main principles governing programming, comitology for programmes, but not for individual projects. And it also proposes simple decision arrangements for programmes run by the European Reconstruction Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take up a number of the broad points that have been raised by Parliament, first the role of the Commission and its financial responsibilities in relation to the running of the agency. The Commission takes very seriously its responsibilities for the implementation of the Community budget. A number of new amendments underline this responsibility by referring to Article 274 of the Treaty. But in order to exercise this responsibility we need legal instruments which allow us to act quickly and flexibly.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, Parliament wants us to refer more specifically to sectoral priorities. We want, in the light of experience, to retain as much flexibility as possible. But we can accept several of Parliament's amendments which urge us to include mention of key sectoral priorities such as assistance for education, vocational training, environment, civil society and NGOs, ethnic reconciliation and the return of displaced persons. In the same spirit we can accept the proposal to include a reference to the Feira European Council conclusions in the preamble to the regulation. Parliament's resolution on the Commission's communication on the stabilisation and association process also deserves to be mentioned in the preamble. We think it makes more sense to do it there than to build it into the article on conditionality.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally we can also accept the proposal that the guidelines which the Commission will adopt should reflect the search for greater efficiency that underlines our reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to add the point that it is important, having put forward a regulation which attempts to simplify things, not to allow the regulations now to be hung about with caveats and qualifications and spectacular quantities of red tape.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Staes said: We do not want people throwing spanners in the works. If we cannot have a clear and simple regulation then, frankly, we would be better off with no regulation at all. To be clear: we can accept the spirit, provided changes can be made in certain cases to the wording, of Amendments Nos 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, the first part of 11, the first part of 13, 16 partially, 17, 18, 19 partially and 20, 21, 24, 28 in the first part, 31 and partially 37.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's position on the overall sum we estimated was necessary for the region, the so-called financial reference amount and its compatibility with the financial perspectives, is well-known. We do not think, as the House knows, that it is necessary to make an explicit reference to this in the regulation. Despite Mr Lagendijk's eloquence, I do not think it is necessary, but he made one point which is fundamentally true and it was made, in another sense, by Mr Westendorp when both of them argued that these regulations are all very well but if there is not an adequate budget to cover the political priorities of the European Union then we are wasting our time.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Westendorp, said that the Council could not – I think this was the implication of his remarks – replicate the New Testament and perform miracles with loaves and fishes. That may be regarded by some Members of some Councils as being a touch brutal in its assessment of the powers of the Council but it is entirely true. We have to deal with finite budgets but I very much hope that the budget which is available for the external actions of the European Union reflects the political priorities of the European Union. That is the discussion which we have been having with the Council in recent weeks and months and the Commission or Parliament do not come badly out of that discussion. I should have thought, in particular, that the experience of the last two months has shown that the Commission's proposal on financing was not as eccentric as some people suggested at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the second proposal on the table, the European Agency for Reconstruction and, in doing so, I want to pay warm tribute, as Mr Lagendijk did during his own remarks, to the excellent job that the board, the director and the staff have done on the ground in Kosovo. They are a terrific team and I am not surprised that the results they have achieved are extremely impressive. They have earned their good reputation for delivering results and I know that Parliament's own delegation to Kosovo in May was as impressed by them as I have been.</p>
<p class="contents">It clearly makes sense to learn lessons from the past six months of the Agency's operations and to see how we can help it to work more effectively. This is essential now that the Agency will be responsible for the whole of the FRY.</p>
<p class="contents">Our main aim is to clarify the role of the governing board. It has to take on responsibility for the examination and the approval of reconstruction programmes which will be submitted to the Commission for decision. We also want to simplify decision-making. According to the new regulation the Commission will be permitted to adopt programmes proposed by the Agency without having to consult the management committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make it clear that responsibility for the formal adoption of the programmes remains with the Commission. It is the Commission that decides on the desirability of these programmes; it is the Commission which is responsible for the implementation of the budget; it is the Commission which adopts the programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of amendments seek to ensure that the Agency acts under the direct and sole responsibility of the Commission and thereby to ensure that the Commission is solely responsible for the Agency's management before the European Parliament, the Court of Auditors and OLAF. I want to clarify this. The Agency has a certain degree of autonomy, like all European agencies. This is the position under the current institutional set-up and the autonomy, which the Agency now has, must be respected unless the institutional structure of the Agency is modified. That does not detract from the full responsibility that the Commission assumes, as the Treaty requires, for the execution of the Community budget. I would like to thank Parliament for the sensible and pragmatic way it has accepted the current structure of the Agency. I know Parliament's views on this issue and the Commission will take these into account in the design of any future executive agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The language regime is a further sensitive issue. I hope that Parliament will understand the sense of the proposals that I put forward in May and will continue to work constructively with others on this very difficult issue but I cannot offer to support Parliament's amendment to remove the unanimity requirement which would contradict the view of the College.</p>
<p class="contents">We can accept those amendments which are designed to remove the requirement for a further Council decision to extend the mandate of the Agency to the whole of the FRY. I can accept, too, those amendments which refer to the General Affairs decision of 9 October, to cooperation with NGOs, to the restoration of civil society and the rule of law, to the payment for services provided by the Agency, to third parties, to the possibility of creating further operational centres, to the responsibility of the director for the implementation of the work programme and the structure of the Agency's budget.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that we can accept the spirit, provided changes can be made in certain cases to the wording, of Amendment Nos 1, 2, 6, 8, 10 in part, 11, 37, 16, 27 and 33. We will look carefully at the desirability of producing an explicit list of issues which the governing board should examine. We will do this in the interest of clarifying its role; that concerns Amendments Nos 21 and 22. We will also examine the timetable which you propose for the adoption of the Agency's budget while respecting the principle of good budgetary programming and compatibility with the Community's budgetary procedures. This concerns Amendments Nos 29 and 30.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me reiterate my thanks to Parliament for its hard work on these issues. We have made real headway in south east Europe. This proposal should allow us to take advantage of the new opportunity we have, to make a decisive contribution as the European Union to lasting peace and prosperity across the whole region.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that the European Union did not come frightfully well out of the history of south east Europe during the 1990s. I hope we make a better fist of things during the next decade and this regulation will provide us with some of the prosaic means of doing so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
