I would remind you that the European Commission has already taken account of the age factor in the directive which was tabled and accepted by the Council in 2000 on dealing with all forms of discrimination in the workplace on the basis of age. Similarly, I would remind you that, in Article 25 of the Charter on Fundamental Rights, there is a clear reference which recognises the right of the elderly to a dignified life and their right to participate in economic and political life.</p>
<p class="contents">When we come to the more specific matter of violence against the elderly, something which is now a fact of life in several European countries and has to do to a great extent with the change in the family model and with the population of elderly people, which is constantly increasing, I would say that it is very difficult for us to find a legal basis on which to proceed with legislation. I should like to remind you that, during the course of discussions in the Constitutional Convention, a huge effort was made to integrate a legal basis into the new Treaty which would give the European Union the possibility to legislate on questions of violence overall, be it against women, children or the elderly. In the end no agreement was reached and there is at present no reference even in the Convention proposal for a legal basis for violence.</p>
<p class="contents">So as far as the legal question is concerned, this comes within the jurisdiction of the Member States. As far as policies and programmes are concerned, the Commission has the Daphne programme, with a more global approach to questions of violence, and we have a number of important initiatives in the Member States which relate to violence against the elderly. The Commission's intention is to fund the Daphne programme as much as it can. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You are right, of course: it is indeed the Member States that are primarily responsible here. As a member of the board of the European Senior Citizens Union (ESCU), I have focussed very intensively on these issues recently, and it has emerged – for our organisation now has members in twenty European states – that there is a growing debate in all the European countries about the situation in homes for the elderly. Our question is this: would it not be possible to produce some kind of recommendation on how contracts should be concluded with these homes? We are aware of homes where residents are very often treated with very little respect, are even confined to cots against their will, are prevented from going out, are served their evening meal so early that they very soon feel hungry again but have no chance of getting anything to eat after 8 or 9 p.m., and where if they soil themselves with or without an incontinence pad, they are often left to lie in their own filth for hours at a time, or are treated in an unfriendly manner by staff, are abused verbally and even subjected to violence. I believe that guidelines for contracts for homes are essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a sphere of competence within the European Union and it is that of health promotion and illness prevention, which includes the illnesses and suffering that can be caused by elder abuse. I suggest we take a look at this.</p>
<p class="contents">When I was responsible for this policy area in my home country, we did a lot of research, and a lot of research was done in the USA and other countries, to see how elder abuse could be prevented. Very often elder abuse is committed by evil people who are perpetrating crimes, but very often too it is committed by people within families, carers and professional helpers who reach the end of their tether because they do not feel supported. People who would never have believed themselves capable of elder abuse suddenly find that the explosion has taken place, and that they have struck out and hurt someone they love.</p>
<p class="contents">I suggest therefore that we look to pool the experience we have in the different Member States in order to establish good practices in this field within the sphere of competence to which I have referred. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Monitoring of spam prevention</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Member States were supposed to bring the Directive concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector into force by the end of October 2003. On 5 December 2003 the Commission announced that it was initiating proceedings against 11 Member States for delays in bringing the directive into force. The majority of e-mails are now spam. What other concrete measures does the Commission propose to take to ensure that the objectives of the directive are implemented? The reliability of e-mail is impaired and its development has stagnated. How will the Commission ensure that the Member States also take the most urgent measures to put pressure on service providers (for example) so that the basic requirement of electronic communications – their free flow – may be guaranteed? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission also agrees that 'spam' undermines not only privacy and consumer protection, but also productivity at work and overall productivity growth. Consumer confidence in e-mail is falling, according to some studies. It is, however, a prerequisite for the successful development of e-commerce and the information society in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is reacting on several fronts. Firstly, the European Union has acted on the legislative front by adopting, in 2002, the directive on privacy and electronic communications – as Mr Paasilinna will know because he made a considerable contribution to the discussion. Infringement proceedings were launched in November 2003 against a number of Member States that had failed to take the necessary transposition measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission knows that legislation is only part of the answer. The Commission has discussed with interested parties a series of actions for Member States, industry and consumers to take. These actions will complement legislation and seek to make the ban on 'spam' as effective as possible. They focus on effective enforcement by Member States, self-regulatory efforts by industry, technical solutions such as filtering and security, and consumer awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">On enforcement in particular, Member States must not only put in place adequate complaint mechanisms, remedies and penalties, but also prosecute 'spammers' effectively and monitor 'spam'. Cooperation between industry and public authorities is important in this regard. The Commission is also taking steps to improve cross-border cooperation inside the Union by meeting relevant authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Since a large volume of 'spam' originates outside the European Union, international cooperation will also be essential. Several actions are under way in this regard. Let me mention some of them. Firstly the declaration and action plan agreed at the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society call for appropriate action on 'spam' to be taken at national and international level. Secondly the Commission will be hosting an OECD seminar on 'spam' on 2 and 3 February 2004 in Brussels. Thirdly, bilateral contacts are ongoing with third countries, including the competent authorities in the United States, since a large volume of 'spam' seems to come from US-based companies.</p>
<p class="contents">These actions are the subject of a communication on 'spam' which the Commission will adopt in the next few days. Finally, the Safer Internet Action Plan and, to a greater extent, its likely successor, Safe Internet Plus, will also fund activities relating to 'spam', including 'spam' sent to children.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, however, let me stress one element: no one party acting in isolation will be able to solve the problem; success will depend on the firm commitment of all interested parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 14 by Avril Doyle (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2003-0832_EN.html">H-0832/03</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Fluoride in drinking water</span></p>
<p class="contents">Given the Commission’s failure to investigate new scientific and other evidence on fluoride in drinking water via the Commission’s Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE) as promised in May 2000, this failure now threatens the credibility of the new Drinking Water Directive (DWD).</p>
<p class="contents">In order to protect the credibility of the new DWD and the process whereby it was developed, I ask the Commission to make the review of the proposed parametric values for ‘Fluoride’ more transparent. This is necessary to allow belated but proper scrutiny of the reasoning which permits the addition of a priority hazardous chemical in artificial fluoridation schemes in the Drinking Water Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, that pending the availability of a proper and comprehensive scientific review of fluorides artificially added to drinking water within the EU, the Directive should adopt the Precautionary Principle and prohibit outright their use in drinking water intended for human consumption in the Member States.</p>

The Drinking Water Directive of 1998 sets quality standards for a range of chemical parameters, including fluoride. The parametric value for fluoride in the directive is based on available scientific evidence and is in line with the values recommended by the World Health Organization.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is general agreement in the scientific community that fluoride in drinking water may have positive or negative effects depending on the concentration. The maximum permitted value of 1.5 mg/litre maintains a good balance between positive and negative effects, according to the World Health Organization. The Commission feels supported in this assessment by the most recent documents of the World Health Organization from 2003, that is, in a new draft edition of the World Health Organization's 'Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality'. These documents maintain the same value for fluoride. At the same time, the issue of artificial fluoridisation of drinking water is the responsibility of Member States and, indeed, the approaches vary from country to country. In some countries it is banned and in others it is left to the local authorities to decide. However, in any case the maximum permitted value has to be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in order to assemble most recent knowledge and experience, the Commission organised a seminar on drinking water in October 2003. It brought together experts from across the European Union, including those from new Member States and from the World Health Organization, and addressed <span class="italic">inter alia</span> the issue of fluorides and fluoridisation. For fluoride values it has been recognised that the current value of 1.5 mg/litre reflects current scientific knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, following a request from the Commission, the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment evaluated a study concerning the quality of drinking water in selected European cities. In its evaluation of 2003 it referred, in line with the scientific position adopted <span class="italic">inter alia</span> by the World Health Organization, to both the protective and detrimental effects of fluoride, but did not suggest making a change to the value for fluoride in the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am still not satisfied, however. In answer to a parliamentary question – PQ 1434/00 – put in May 2000, you said, Commissioner, that you would examine whether there was any significant new evidence on artificial fluoridation. This would, you said, include 'obtaining an appropriate update by consulting the Commission's Scientific Committee for Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment'. Apparently, you did not consult that committee, you went immediately to the WHO and you are still quoting what it considers to be desirable levels.</p>
<p class="contents">The evidence is extremely shaky in this area. Yes, the scientific jury is out, but 13 out of 23 developing countries working under the WHO guidelines have serious problems with fluoride poisoning, or fluorosis, in the dental care of their people. In my own country fluorosis is becoming an increasing dental problem, particularly in teenagers.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you to look particularly at the problem of neonates and infants, who are being fed milk formula from reconstituted, fluoridated tap water. Given that it constitutes a huge proportion of their diet, fluoridated tap water that is not inspected, in which the levels of fluoride are not regularly checked, is a serious health risk to our neonates and infants in Ireland and in parts of the UK where they still fluoridate tap water.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as the ethical question of mass-medicating members of the public, who do not want fluoridation in their tap water, could you comment on the ethical and infant-related issues? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also ask the committee you mentioned. It gave us its opinion on fluoride as recently as 2003. It said that the concentrations of fluoride normally present in fluoridated drinking water do not present a health risk according to a large number of animal studies and human epidemiology.</p>
<p class="contents">The World Health Organization drinking water guideline is the same as in the EU Directive – 1.5 mg per litre. Dental fluorosis occurs at concentrations above 1.5 mg and 2 mg per litre. Skeleton fluorosis occurs at higher concentrations – between 3 mg and 6 mg. In Dublin, for example, the water is fluoridated but the parametric value of 1.5 mg per litre was not exceeded and, according to this report, the highest concentration recorded was 0.9 mg.</p>
<p class="contents">We ask every Member State to comply with the existing legislation, which was drawn up in the light of the scientific advice. There has been no reason to re-evaluate that advice. We have brought together a group from both new and old Member States – all the experts we could call on – and they concluded that they saw no reason to change the directive in this regard. It is also a matter for Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">So, in your case Mrs Doyle, it is a matter of trying to change Ireland's policy on this if you think it is wrong and if you think your country is not following the values laid down in the directive. We have no reason, from the advice we have sought, to change the parameters that are established in the directive on fluoride in drinking water. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In relation to mass-medication, it is completely unacceptable in terms of freedom of choice that 9 million UK citizens and 2.7 million Irish citizens are being forcibly mass-medicated. In Ireland, 91% of submissions were actually against the fluoridation of water. Clearly there is a lack of public consent here.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is not adhering to the precautionary principle, as it is supposed to. I would like to see the Commission push for fluoridation of drinking water throughout the EU to be discontinued until there is a proper, adequate assessment of the situation. For example, the fact there is a big difference in water consumption between hot countries and cold countries is not taken into account when discussing how much water people drink. In hotter countries a lot of people drink a lot more water and therefore they are consuming a lot more, and in some of the new Member States there is fluoride in hot water as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Doyle's point on infants is a really serious question because infant formula is being mixed with water that has been fluoridated, and I believe that there are serious consequences for children here. My opinion is that we should not be using formula anyway. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fluoride can occur naturally. The water in the well in our own backyard, for example, had a very high concentration of fluoride. It can occur naturally to such an extent that you are recommended not to use it for your children because it could affect their teeth.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is up to each Member State to set the rules, as long as they follow the recommendations and the limit values set in the directive. We have asked for scientific advice, which we follow very closely. We ensure that we are kept up to date with the latest scientific advice. As I said, as a result of the findings and the work done in the various working groups, and after calling together all the experts, we have no reason to change – at least for the time being – the recommendations on the limit values in the directive. If we receive new scientific evidence or see any reason to change, we will do so.

The question is very timely since we are coming to the end of the first phase of the development of these policies, as detailed in the Tampere agenda. Moreover, the five-year deadline set out in the Amsterdam Treaty for the realisation of certain objectives, notably with respect to asylum policy, will be reached on 1 May 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The annual parliamentary debate on the development of an area of freedom, security and justice, which will take place during the February part-session, will be the first opportunity to discuss with Parliament the assessment of our policies in these fields. In June 2004, the Commission intends to present to the European Parliament and to the Council a communication which will evaluate the progress made in implementing the Tampere objectives. This communication will include an evaluation of all aspects concerning immigration, asylum, the integration of immigrants in our societies and the development of relations with third countries. I hope that this communication will also be able to include some guidelines for what could, in the near future, become a 'Tampere II' agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The second strand will be a report – which the Commission will present to the Council in April – concerning links between legal and illegal migration, which will above all set out the conclusions of the study currently being undertaken by the Commission into the possibility of establishing some kind of system for coordinating legal migration in the Member States. Such a system could be helpful to third countries in their partnerships aiming to combat trafficking in human beings and illegal migration.</p>
<p class="contents">The third strand will be the report that the Commission will present to the Council by June 2005, in which it will consider new ways of enhancing international protection and, above all, the possibility of establishing Europe-wide resettlement schemes and providing improved protection in the region for refugees.

<p class="contents">In real terms, our assessment is that joining the Union presents such a huge opportunity for economic development in those countries that join the Union that migratory fluxes are limited.

<p class="contents">These agreements were negotiated by the Council Presidency, assisted at all times by the Commission, pursuant to Articles 38 and 24 of the Treaty. The extradition agreement does not contain any specific provision that gives the US the right to request the extradition by a Member State of a person having committed a crime in that Member State that is statute-barred by its legislation. Member States may, however, invoke grounds for refusal based on matters not covered by the agreement that may be applicable pursuant to bilateral treaties in force between a Member State and the US.

<p class="contents">The same criterion applies to your second question; that is, when extradition by a Member State is requested of a person for a crime of which he has already been convicted by that Member State. Neither of the two agreements between the EU and the US has yet come into force, with some Member States having stated that they are obliged to abide by national constitutional procedure for such agreements to come into force and that written bilateral instruments are required between each Member State and the US for agreements to apply between the EU and the US.</p>
<p class="contents">These complementary bilateral instruments are currently at the negotiation stage. Once all of the bilateral instruments have been agreed they will have to be ratified by the US Congress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Greyhounds raised for racing in Ireland are frequently exported to Spain once they have come to the end of their racing career, where they are treated appallingly and with scant regard for their welfare from the Spanish authorities.

The Commission is very concerned about the welfare of animals and gives it very high priority. Community rules exist in respect of animals, including dogs, for their protection during transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the protocol on the protection and welfare of animals annexed to the EC Treaty, the Community and Member States must pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals in formulating and implementing the Community’s agriculture, transport, internal market and research policies, while respecting the legislative or administrative provisions and customs of the Member States relating, in particular, to religious rites, cultural traditions and regional heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">As a consequence of this, the conditions under which dogs such as greyhounds are kept and raced or used for hunting within the Member States are not regulated by Community law. These are matters coming solely within the jurisdiction of the Member State concerned. As it is the duty of the individual Member States to find a solution to this problem, the Commission can only call upon responsible authorities to eliminate the ill-treatment to which the honourable Member refers. In this context it is significant that last year the largest Spanish animal welfare organisation recognised that progress towards improving the welfare of these animals is being achieved, including through the updating of legislation by the autonomous regions. In addition, police action has curtailed the cruel methods of killing these dogs at the end of the hunting season.</p>
<p class="contents">While general cruelty to dogs or the use of these animals for racing or hunting comes within the sole competence of the Member States, commercial transport of these animals over distances of more than 50 kilometres falls within the scope of Council Directive 91/628/EEC as amended by Directive 95/29/EC.</p>
<p class="contents">Complaints have been formally brought to the attention of the Irish, Spanish and UK authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish authorities provided a comprehensive reply on 5 March 2002 outlining the various actions taken to protect greyhounds transported to other Member States and also providing other information on the aspects of greyhound rearing and racing which are outside the scope of Community legislation. No basis for infringement proceedings was apparent from the reply from Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as matters falling within Community competence are concerned, namely the commercial transport of animals, the Spanish authorities indicated that they were not able to trace particular shipments of greyhounds transported from Ireland. The Commission continues to make further enquiries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission confirms that no Community aid is now available for investment in greyhound rearing or racing. While previous operational programmes allowed for aid for investment in greyhound housing and rearing facilities, no Community aid has been paid since 1993. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If that is the case, the Commission should be concerned about animals whose breeding was partially funded by the EU. In Spain the situation has not changed. I was talking to someone a few days ago who had been to one of these illegal race tracks in Spain, where they found nine greyhounds from Ireland racing on a course in appalling conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards animals not being traced, I would like the Commission to see if it could look at some sort of strict regulation on greyhound breeding and the export of greyhounds. As regards correct identification, a microchip would be very useful in tracing the animal's place of origin. The Commission could take an initiative here in passing some sort of law on this, and also making greyhound owners responsible for the animal, not just for the two-and-a-half years in Ireland where the dogs are economically of benefit to the owners, but for the whole of their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable that these animals are raced to death in places such as Spain and kept in appalling conditions. We have to take responsibility for that. That is why the Commission must take some sort of initiative to bring in legislation to ensure that this issue is wiped out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That ceased, as I said earlier, in 1993 for a number of reasons, partly due to concerns at EU level and in the Commission relating to animal welfare considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat that this is a competence issue. It is not within the competence of the Commission or the European Union to engage in inquiries in Member States relating to issues that are strictly outside the competence of the European Union. To seek to try and make a competence for the EU for such an endeavour merely because there was funding prior to 1992 – which has now ceased – is impossible to achieve. That means that there is very little that can be done. Nonetheless, as I have indicated, in response to enquiries from the Commission, the authorities in both Ireland and Spain, and the major animal welfare organisation in Spain, have indicated that the situation has considerably improved, not least, in Spain, as a result of the introduction of legislation in the areas of the autonomous regions and also because of the greater vigilance of the police authorities in prosecuting infringements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission is not aware of specific breaches of the EU Plant Health Directive by the Netherlands. Indeed, Council Directive 2000/29/EC, which is the basis of the Community plant health regime, has been fully transposed by the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">I assume that the honourable Member’s question is motivated by the finding of potato ring rot in seed potatoes in Wales, as his question was not directed to any specific issue. These potatoes are grown from seeds imported from the Netherlands, as occurred in 2002. I can confirm that Directive 93/85/EC on the control of ring rot has also been transposed by the Dutch authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">When notified by the UK authorities of this outbreak, the Commission immediately examined the information supplied by UK with great attention. The Commission gave the UK the opportunity to inform other Member States in the latest meetings of the Standing Committee on Plant Health in November and December 2003. The origin of the outbreak is, however, still being investigated and it is too early to draw any firm conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to underline that the Food and Veterinary Office of the Commission has carried out a series of audit missions in the Member States in recent years in order to clearly assess the situation of potato production in the Community. I can assure the honourable Member that the Commission will continue to follow the situation very closely. The Commission is at this stage satisfied with the preventive actions taken by the United Kingdom, as a follow-up of the outbreak, as well as with the current investigations launched by both the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in order to identify the possible origins and pathways of the disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the question on compensation, under existing Community legislation there is a possibility for a financial contribution referred to as 'solidarity' to be granted to Member States. It is intended to cover expenditure for the necessary measures to combat organisms harmful to plants introduced from other areas in the Community. The Commission has informed the Welsh representation in Brussels of the existence of this contribution and of the practical procedures to follow should it wish to make an application for such compensation. Upon receipt of any file, the Commission will verify if Community requirements to grant such a contribution have been met. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to extend the question – and my apologies for not making it clear to him earlier – that this is not just about potato ring rot but also about a disease called ramorum dieback or sudden oak death, which was first seen in the EU in the Netherlands in 1997, but has now reached the UK. It is found in rhododendrons, camellias and native tree species and, last month, it was found in wild woodland in the UK. It is clearly a major problem for our country. The biggest exporters of such products are the Dutch plant auctions. It has also been alleged that some operators there have been spraying such plants with fungicide in order to mask traces of that particular disease, meaning that the disease shows itself at a later stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be grateful if the Commission could look into these allegations, in particular to see whether this breaches the plant health directive, because, clearly, the disease has now crossed the border. We wish it to be eradicated where it is and certainly wish too that no other country should suffer as some of our plants and woods are already suffering. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the responsibility for such surveillance – for cancer screening tests – rests with the Member States. The Community’s role is to provide the appropriate framework for coordination of these activities, to facilitate the sharing and spread of good practice and to promote the development of common methodologies and procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the Commission provides funding for the setting-up of networks that deliver standardised methods of collection and processing of information on diseases such as AIDS, TB and cancer at Community level. Once networks have been developed in this way, their participating structures should be in a position to continue routine network activities. The Community should concentrate on the development of networking and the Commission will continue to do so, within the present budgetary possibilities, until the proposed European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is established.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States must provide the resources to ensure that surveillance activities are properly pursued in their territory. The Commission will continue to promote cooperation and coordination between the Member States through the Communicable Diseases Network. The funding decisions referred to by the honourable Member will not therefore lead to a gap in surveillance.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not to say that the Community is not contributing to actions on cancer, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. We are already funding 15 projects on AIDS, amounting to a total contribution of over EUR 4.2 million. We also plan to support a project under the 2003 budget to strengthen coordination of surveillance of infections in the northern region, including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. This will include Russia, Ukraine and Belarus – all areas with worrying infection rates for HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, and areas where improved surveillance must be a high priority, especially in the context of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">On cancer, we plan to fund three projects from the 2003 budget, two on smoking prevention and one on cancer information, to a total of about EUR 4.4 million. This is on top of the massive investment that has been made over the last 15 years in cancer prevention, which has already helped to make cancer epidemiology one of the most developed areas of health statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">There were many valuable proposals made for the public health programme in 2003, which the budget available did not allow us to fund. I understand the problems faced by those that have been involved in the surveillance networks, the development of which the Commission has financed since 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has taken several steps to improve the situation. First, we have mobilised experts to provide advice on funding priorities for disease surveillance under the work plan for 2004 and for future funding rounds under the public health programme. Secondly, we have disseminated guidance on projects concerning disease-specific surveillance networks to enhance quality and their potential for funding. Thirdly, we are giving urgent consideration to the possibilities this year under other funding mechanisms, including under the research programme, for data compilation and processing on HIV/AIDS and TB, as well as on cancer screening.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also remember that the 2003 budget is not the end of the story. Future work plans under the public health programme, starting with that of 2004, will have the scope and potential to finance projects on cancer, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. The importance of ensuring continuity of support for key networks in the field of communicable diseases until the proposed European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is established will be particularly stressed. My services are working to ensure that this will be reflected in future funding rounds. I hope that this provision, together with the many projects I have described and the coordination of surveillance activities we continue to provide will respond to the question put by the honourable Member. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As rapporteur for the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, I know we are not going to have this up and running before 2005 at the most optimistic estimate, so it is the gap between now and then that I am concerned about.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the centre will not deal with cancer as it is not a communicable disease. It will deal with the other two mentioned. I know the Commissioner has been looking for solutions to cancer, because he has discussed that with our committee in the past. Nevertheless, I ask him to look very carefully at the organisations who have been doing the surveillance – particularly on tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS – and see how they can be supported over the coming two years. We are faced with a double problem in this area: one, as the Commissioner mentioned, is the exponential rise in cases in Eastern Europe, and the second is the fearsome rise we are now seeing, here and across the Atlantic, in a number of newly-diagnosed cases which are multi-drug resistant. Potentially, there is thus a dual crisis attacking us from both sides. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The problem of 20 000 tonnes of obsolete pesticides, spread over more than 5000 locations in Ukraine, need to be tackled with environmentally sound modern technologies, which will need a total budget varying from 60 to 100 million US dollars.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission able to set up a concrete programme to solve the Ukrainian problem within its existing financial system?</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Obsolete pesticides</span></p>
<p class="contents">The problem of obsolete pesticides aggravates the situation in Ukraine, where 20 000 tonnes are present at more than 5 000 locations, threatening the drinking water and health of the local population. In spite of the adoption of the 6th Environmental Framework in June 2001, containing a specific paragraph on pesticides which includes specific action for the elimination of dangers due to obsolete pesticides, now three and a half years have been passed without any substantial improvement of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission able to come forward with a constructive financial solution or instrument for Ukraine?</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Obsolete pesticides</span></p>
<p class="contents">The huge problem of obsolete pesticides in the Ukraine affects health and the environment, and more than 20 000 tonnes spread all over the country at at least 5000 locations need to be tackled urgently.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the EU Parliament resolution of 23 October on the draft general budget of the EU for the financial year 2004, where paragraph 74 notes the dangers to the environment from POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutants) and in particular obsolete pesticides, and urges the Commission to make the extra effort needed to find sufficient financial funds under the existing instruments for their elimination in Ukraine, is the Commission able to take steps which will lead to an appropriate solution? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ukraine has taken a positive step concerning the elimination of some of the obsolete pesticides, in particular those that are persistent organic pollutants, by signing the Stockholm Convention regarding the elimination and reduction of those pollutants. The ratification of the Convention is still pending. The Commission urges Ukraine to ratify the Convention and to cooperate with the international community to work on this difficult problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Responsibility for dealing with obsolete pesticides is primarily for the country itself. While the Commission is prepared to assist Ukraine to the extent possible – and I should just note that our assistance to Ukraine amounts to EUR 126 million a year – current EU assistance programmes do not provide funding for the elimination of obsolete pesticides in Ukraine. In fact, environmental issues have not been selected by the Government of Ukraine as a key cooperation area with the European Union. However, Tacis small project programmes could accommodate project proposals linked to the elimination of obsolete pesticides. Taking into account the amount of pesticides to be eliminated, an EU contribution could only partially alleviate the vast problem. As a signatory to the Stockholm Convention, Ukraine is eligible for funding from the interim Global Environmental Facility, which is the financing mechanism of the Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The estimate is that in Ukraine there are perhaps up to 20 000 tonnes of these pesticides in 5000 locations and, as the honourable Member knows, they can affect human health because of the contamination of groundwaters, soil, food and even air.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member mentioned Chernobyl: I was there recently. We have dedicated a lot of time and a great deal of money to that extraordinarily difficult and dangerous environmental issue. There we are working with the government of Ukraine, which wishes to take that as a priority. It has not been easy even in those circumstances. What is more difficult for us, is to insist on our priorities through a programme such as Tacis, in which the partner country is supposed to take ownership of the programme we are helping to support.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure the honourable Member that we will continue to raise this issue and other environmental issues in the relevant subcommittee of the partnership and cooperation agreement. We will raise this issue during those meetings and if the government in Ukraine says it would like us to focus some of our spending on this issue, we would be delighted to look at that. But the figures involved are very substantial. It is reckoned that it would cost at least EUR 100 million for the elimination of the problem I described earlier, and that is why, in our judgment, it is probably more helpful to turn to the global environmental facility in order to secure an objective which the honourable Member is quite right to highlight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I can only repeat that we will raise this issue with the Ukrainian authorities.

One of the key challenges faced by the European Union is to make better use of all the resources at our disposal in the external relations field. This was recognised as one of the major tasks of the European Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The goal of ensuring greater coherence implies a seamless and coordinated use of the common foreign and security policy and of all other external relations instruments, including the annual Community budget for external actions of approximately EUR 10 billion, of which EUR 6 billion is official development assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">We recognised long ago that development policy and other cooperation programmes provide the most powerful instruments at the Community's disposal for treating the root causes of conflict. That is a fact that has been reflected in the recently adopted European Union security strategy. The logic is simple, the logic is straightforward: one of the underlying causes of the disastrous conditions in which people in Afghanistan and southern Sudan live, for example, is conflict. If we are serious about tackling poverty then we must tackle conflict. There is no development without peace. That is why, at the request of our African partners, my colleague Mr Nielson and I have recently presented an ambitious proposal for an African peace facility to the tune of about EUR 250 million to support the African Union in its efforts to contribute to peace keeping. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You mentioned the peace facility, which, as an initiative from the European Union, we of course welcome very much indeed, but it is my understanding that certain Member States of the Union are suggesting that funding should go through regional and subregional organisations such as ECOWAS, and I wondered whether you would agree with me that our view should be shared with the African heads of states, who say that finance, organisation, management and decision-making should come through the African Union itself and not be devolved to various other regional organisations?</p>

Therefore I agree with honourable Member on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the question of overall coherence, conceivably, things have changed since I was a British development minister many years ago. But I must say that I find that there is more coherence in the Community's programmes than there was when I was a British minister. That does not mean that we are perfect: we still have a long way to go, not least in relation to the overall field of external actions. I am not just talking about CFSP and official development assistance. I hope in the next Commission that there will be two former development ministers doing the job that Mr Nielson and I are currently doing – it would be a help.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the question of a foreign minister is concerned and the temporary abeyance of the moves towards creating one following the Convention, I still believe that if this person – woman or man – is to emerge in the next few years from the IGC, it is absolutely imperative that we draw on the strengths provided by both the Council and the Commission. It does not make very much sense to have a foreign minister who is somehow cauterised from the Commission on the ridiculous argument that her/his activities may be polluted by too much contact with the Commission. It is perfectly possible to retain the integrity of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and the relationship with the Council and Member States while, at the same time, drawing on all the competences for which the Commission is responsible and which, taken together, should give us a real possibility to shape an external actions strategy which meets the demand of the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">Foreign and security policy is no longer – if it ever was – the sort of agenda which is simply decided in the chancelleries of European capitals. Foreign and security policy, development policy, trade policy, agriculture policy and external policy in the justice and home affairs fields, are all relevant to Europe's impact on the rest of the world and the real positive contribution we can make there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Syria-EU Association Agreement</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 9 December 2003, the Commission and Syria reached an accord on an Association Agreement between Syria and the EU modelled on the agreements with the other Mediterranean partnerships, including a political chapter, an economic and financial chapter, and a social and cultural chapter.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission's view, what prospects does the agreement hold out for the two parties? Does the Commission believe that the signing of this agreement in the near future will facilitate regional integration, the creation of a positive climate in which to resolve the political problem of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the democratisation of Syria?</p>
<p class="contents">What is its view of the diametrically opposed positions of the USA which saw Congress and President Bush (only a few days ago) pass a law which provides for economic and diplomatic sanctions and restrictions on Syria, and does the Commission sympathise with the reasons adduced by the USA for adopting this policy against Syria? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The dismantlement of tariffs and the opening of markets will be an important incentive for Syria to undertake legal and institutional reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement would also help Syria to integrate into the world economy and could be a stepping stone towards other initiatives, such as Syrian membership of the World Trade Organization.</p>
<p class="contents">The provisions on the respect for human rights, on non-proliferation and on cooperation against terrorism would, I trust, strengthen our ability to engage with Syria on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the facilitation of regional integration, the agreement would complete the network of Euro-Mediterranean association agreements with our Mediterranean partners. It constitutes the final step for the Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area envisaged by the Barcelona Declaration. We should now continue working together to ensure trade liberalisation between the Mediterranean partner countries themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement would be the most important element in our policy of constructive engagement with Syria. It is our belief that the agreement should strengthen the incentives for reform in Syria, both by creating a more open economy and society and by establishing a political dialogue on issues such as respect for democratic principles and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the United States shares our fundamental objective of integrating Syria into the international community as a country that abides by international law and cooperates, we hope, on non-proliferation and against terrorism. The association agreement should be seen as a framework for a long-term engagement with Syria in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I wanted to ask you to clarify the last part of my question: do you share the opinions expressed by the United States on relations with Syria and its role in the region and in achieving peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The methodology followed by the European Union is different from that followed by the United States. It may be that the objective is the same within the more general framework, but that the methodology differs. Do you share the fears which the United States have specifically expressed? Do these fears have any bearing on the policy of the European Union? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has always been a powerful exponent of constructive and hard-headed engagement. I am not saying that he would necessarily agree with us on Syria, but I think that is what we have been trying to do on Syria just as we have been trying to do it on Iran. It does not mean that we are simple-witted; it does not mean that there is not a spine to what we are trying to do, but, provided people will engage with us on issues like human rights, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and trade liberalisation, then we should be prepared to hold out a hand and try to encourage them.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had a series of extremely useful negotiations with Syria over the past few months. The Commission has put a great deal of energy and effort into this process, as have the Syrians. The Syrians, on issues like tariff dismantling, have moved further and faster in the last few months than most of us thought possible. I negotiated, or virtually negotiated, the clause on human rights when I was in Damascus a few months ago, and my excellent officials have been carrying through the negotiations on other things, including weapons of mass destruction. Now the proposals that we discussed with the Syrians <span class="italic">ad referendum</span> the Council are being discussed by the Council. The Council will have to decide whether we should go back to the Syrians and try to secure more from them than we have done so far.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no doubt that if we can come off with a strong and sensible agreement with Syria – the last piece in the jigsaw puzzle of our Euro-Mediterranean partnership – then everybody will benefit from that: everybody who wants to see a more prosperous future in the region, everybody who wants to avoid a clash of civilisations between the European, North American and Islamic worlds and everybody who wants to see terrorism and insecurity tackled in the most effective and sustainable way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That includes the situations in southern Lebanon, Palestine and Israel, and the situation on the Golan Heights. I expressed hope because – and I hope I am not entirely fatuous in my geo-strategic observations – we want to see more movement from Syria on a number of issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I much prefer talking and trying to secure agreement, to reading what the Syrians' positions are in the newspapers. So when I say 'hope', it is a small and fragile word. Perhaps it carries too much baggage, but before I leave the European Commission I would very much like to see the signing of an agreement with the Syrians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
