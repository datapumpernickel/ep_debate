<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">de Miguel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in June 1999 the first Summit of Heads of State and Government between the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean took place in Río de Janeiro on the initiative of France and Spain. During this Summit, Spain offered to host a second one which was agreed at the time, and which furthermore would coincide with the Spanish Presidency of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as planned, the Summit will take place in Madrid on the 17th and 18th of this month, that is, on Friday and Saturday of this week.</p>
<p class="contents">The profound changes which took place in European and in the Americas during the 90s and the mutual desire to establish a general framework for bi-regional relations were the prime motives for staging the Río Summit. At the end of that Summit, the Heads of State and Government adopted two important documents: the Río Declaration, which established the general principles to be applied to relations between Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean and a second document, designated as an Action Plan, which identified the 55 priority areas in the political, economic, cultural, educational and social fields, amongst others, which should form the basis for a strategic bi-regional partnership between the two sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="contents">Through this Madrid Summit, the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean are committing themselves to deepening this partnership so that both regions can together confront the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities offered by the new 21st Century.</p>
<p class="contents">In Madrid, the Heads of State and Government propose to adopt three documents: an evaluation report recording what has been achieved since the Rio Summit, a document presenting the increasingly numerous common positions and values we share, and, finally, a political declaration which, as well as announcing the consolidation of our strategic bi-regional partnership, will list the firm commitments made at the highest level by both regions in the political, economic and cooperation fields and which go further than the measures adopted at the first Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Until 1999, relations between the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean had been based on a mainly sub-regional approach. Political dialogue and cooperation were designed for the various sub-regional realities, in other words, dialogue was subdivided. We established the San José dialogue for Central America, the dialogue with the Andean Community, Mercosur, Icaricom, and apart from certain exceptions, such as Mexico and Chile, which had a particular specific relationship, practically all the dialogue centred on differing sub-regional units.</p>
<p class="contents">The Rio Summit had the merit of introducing this new bi-regional approach, which has undoubtedly added weight to relations between the European Union and the sub-regions and individual countries.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to this second Summit, the Spanish Presidency has worked intensively to make substantial progress on the three strategic dimensions I have mentioned. Furthermore, we must stress that we have wanted this strategic relationship between the European Union and Latin America and the Caribbean from now on to be the framework or benchmark on which the European Union’s relations with each of the subregional areas or individual countries of Latin America and the Caribbean will be built.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of political dialogue, the European Union’s priorities in relation to Latin America and the Caribbean, during the short period between the Rio Summit and today, have essentially been the strengthening of democracy and the Rule of Law, the defence of human rights, the fight against drug-trafficking, as well as the promotion of regional integration and coordination between the different positions of both regions in relation to the international agenda within the framework of international organisations and conferences.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Madrid Summit, both regions wish to take a further step, in not only a quantitative but also a qualitative sense, which would consist of a better structuring of political dialogue and a broader range of issues for discussion, which would also cover those not relating to regional problems. We hope that this step forward will lead to the development of a common approach to world issues.</p>
<p class="contents">From an economic point of view we should begin by stressing that the European Union is very different from Latin America and the Caribbean in economic and social terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The population of Latin America and the Caribbean is greater than that of the Europe of the Fifteen – I am not talking about the enlarged Europe, since that will clearly have a larger population – and on the whole it is very young, that is to say it comprises very low age ranges.</p>
<p class="contents">Average per capita income in Latin America and the Caribbean is little over EUR 3 000 per year, while the average in the Union is seven times greater.</p>
<p class="contents">The bi-regional market continues to offer many opportunities for trade. Between 1990 and 2000 European exports have increased from approximately EUR 17 billion to EUR 54 billion, in other words they have almost trebled.</p>
<p class="contents">European imports from Latin American and Caribbean countries during that same period have increased from approximately EUR 27 billion to EUR 58 billion. In other words, they have doubled. Despite this spectacular increase in volume, imports originating from Latin America and the Caribbean have gone from 24% of the total in 1990 to just 12% of the total in 2000. In relative terms, trade between the two sides of the Atlantic is decreasing, but it is increasing within the American continent.</p>
<p class="contents">There has also been a considerable increase in direct European investment in Latin America and the Caribbean. The European Union is currently the biggest investor in the region. Investments have risen from EUR 66 billion in 1997 to EUR 122 billion in 1999, which represents almost 11% of all European foreign investment and almost two-thirds of European investments in non-OECD countries. This investment, Mr President, is a great reflection of the European Union’s confidence in and commitment to the whole Latin American and Caribbean region and without doubt makes a great contribution to the growth of economic activity and the creation of employment in that region.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, and above all, the Europe of the Fifteen shares deep historical, political and cultural roots with Latin America and the Caribbean, which help in the development of a genuine identity and a genuine strategic partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">These common positions and values are creating important ties in terms of identity and solidarity and are encouraging both regions to exchange more and more of their own experiences and to combine their resources in order to resolve common problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst the challenges which the European Union and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean must face is the need to modernise education systems, to create an economic and social climate favourable to sustainable development and to establish mechanisms for good governance.</p>
<p class="contents">The promotion of a strategic partnership cannot be based purely on a common identity, whether this be historical, cultural or political, but must be the result of a shared interest in order to turn principles, values and objectives into practical mechanisms for dialogue and cooperation, so that the two regions can confront all the great challenges of this new millennium in a united fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">On the 17th and 18th in Madrid, the Heads of State and Government of the 48 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean and the European Union who will attend the Summit – let us remember that this Summit of Heads of State and Government is the largest and broadest to be held in the Union, since we are talking about 48 Heads of State and Government – are going to try to give significant impetus to the strategic bi-regional partnership, which, as I said earlier, began in Río de Janeiro in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">In each of the strategic pillars on which this partnership is based, the political, the economic and cooperation in the social, educational and cultural fields, both regions have wanted to take a significant step forward. I would like to make a special mention of the joint fight against terrorism, through compliance with all the international conventions in this field, as well as the application of all the relevant United Nations resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Efforts will continue to strengthen democratic institutions and the Rule of Law, paying particular attention to human rights and the strengthening of judicial systems, with a view to guaranteeing the equal treatment of all people before the law. Equally, account will be taken of the entry into force of the Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court which, as the honourable Members are aware, has been ratified by many Latin American and Caribbean countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The intention is to strengthen political dialogue and consultation within the United Nations system, as well as other international fora, on the most important issues on the international agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of economic and commercial issues we must stress that on 25 April we were able to successfully complete the process of negotiating an association agreement between the European Union and Chile. This is a free trade agreement between the two parties. It is truly innovative in economic terms, unquestionably the most advanced of all those reached between the European Union and other third countries and there has been no hesitation in describing it as a fourth-generation agreement. It is perhaps the free trade agreement that has dealt with the highest number of issues and included the highest number of considerations and there is no doubt that this opens the way for other agreements of this type, both in that region and in other parts of the world. We should remember, however, that in that region we are trying to establish a free trade agreement between two regions of economic integration – the European Union and Mercosur – and therefore the agreement reached with Chile sets a precedent for something truly historic; the establishment of a free trade agreement between two common markets or between two regions of economic integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Since it is relevant here, I would also like to mention the recent approval by the General Affairs Council of a proposal for future European Union relations with the Andean Community and with Central America which opens the way for the consideration of the creation of free trade areas between the European Union and both regions and in order to intensify not only cooperation but also political dialogue, which is an added value which did not exist previously in the agreements with these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the difficult internal situation being experienced by certain South American countries is hindering the complex negotiations for a partnership agreement between the European Union and Mercosur which I referred to earlier. The truth is that the Summit wishes to acknowledge the results of the negotiation, in which the political, institutional and cooperation chapters have been completed and the small amount of progress which has been made in the fields of commerce and the measures for facilitating commerce so that we do not abandon this important project of a future free trade agreement between Mercosur and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Both regions – I am referring to the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean in general – have committed themselves to working together to ensure the success of the World Conference on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in August, as well as adopting a mutual commitment to succeed in something very important on which the Latin American countries have a great deal to say, that is the Millennium Round, with the commercial issues recently launched in Doha.</p>
<p class="contents">Education, culture and access to knowledge are undoubtedly important keys to success in the 21st Century. I would like to highlight the launch of the @lis Programme for cooperation with Latin America in relation to the information society, recently approved at the meeting of science and technology Ministers in Seville and the ALCUE programme in the field of scientific and technological cooperation and a new programme of post-graduate grants intended to help 4 000 students from the other side of the Atlantic to benefit from the advantages of studying at European universities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would like to repeat that at this Madrid Summit, which, as I have said, we expect to be attended by 48 Heads of State and Government, a bi-regional process based on a strategic partnership will be consolidated. I am convinced that at the end of the Summit we will be able to celebrate the progress made on a process which begun just three years ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fundamental aims of this Summit are: to reinforce the bi-regional strategic partnership that was launched nearly three years ago at the first Summit in Río de Janeiro, and to set out new objectives for the next two years.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not repeat all the reasons for the importance of this relationship, which was set out so cogently by the presidency – economic, political and cultural – but we all know how important it is. Rather than repeat what has been said so eloquently already, I would like to address two main questions regarding the Summit. Firstly, what has the Commission done to ensure the success of Madrid? And secondly, what results do we expect from the Summit?</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that the Commission is strongly committed to ensuring the success of the meeting in Madrid. And, we are equally committed to ensuring that the bi-regional process initiated at Rio succeeds. Indeed, what is at stake in Madrid is the fundamental credibility of this whole process.</p>
<p class="contents">As Parliament knows, public opinion has been increasingly critical of summits in recent years. We look back to the controversy surrounding the G8 meetings last year. These summits are frequently derided as high-level talking shops that too often produce little more than hot air. The summits’ grandiloquent final declarations are frequently, and perhaps rather embarrassingly, contrasted with the paucity of the results they actually achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission has repeatedly emphasised, we are determined that Madrid will not just be a talking shop like that. It has to be credible, and in order for it to be so, we need to demonstrate clearly that the ambitious objectives defined at Rio have been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to launch into a long-winded overview of everything that has stemmed from Rio. Nor am I the right person to outline everything that others have achieved since then. Instead, I shall concentrate on the Commission’s accomplishments in the priority areas of cooperation that it committed itself to work on.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that we have fulfilled our part of the bargain and we can go to Madrid with our heads held high.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission has launched several programmes aimed at supporting and strengthening those institutions that explicitly defend human rights. These include a regional programme in support of ombudsmen in Latin America and two multi-annual programmes on democracy and human rights. In addition, the Commission has co-financed a bi-regional conference on the work and cooperation of ombudsmen and national human rights institutions, as well as an inter-continental conference on human rights protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to information society, which the presidency referred to, our most notable achievement has been the adoption of the @LIS programme. Aimed at reinforcing cooperation between the European Union and Latin America, it was officially launched at the EU-Latin America and Caribbean ministerial meeting in Seville a few weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">In the social sphere, the Commission also goes to Madrid with a positive balance sheet. We have promoted the participation of different civil society groups and have financed a series of meetings that will submit their conclusions to the Summit. We have co-financed an academic seminar on social equity, an NGOs forum as well as a civil society meeting. This is on top of the recent business forum held last month in Mexico. As evidence of our ongoing commitment in this area, it is worth noting that in programming cooperation for the period 2000-2006 the Commission has allocated a substantial part of its existing financial resources to the social area.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission is currently working on all initiatives aimed at increasing public administration capacity in social policies, through exchanges of experience, best practice and know-how.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the field of education, the Commission has approved an ambitious scholarship programme under the name of ALBAN. Over a period of nine years, 4 000 scholarships will be awarded to Latin American graduates wishing to complete their studies at European universities.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise to Parliament how much importance I personally attach to this programme. As we all know, too often Latin American students feel that they have no choice other than to head directly north to continue their studies. We have to give them another option: the option of coming to study at European universities. That would be good for us, and I hope it would be good for the next generation of leaders in Latin America. These are scholarships which will be generous – worth about EUR 19 000 each year. They will be managed by, I hope, a network of higher education institutions. If we can make a success of this scholarship scheme, we can look at developing similar schemes in other areas, because I believe profoundly – a point made by Mr Iglesias on a number of occasions – that one of the most important ways in which we can help our partners around the world is by opening our own universities to as many of them as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me move on to my second main question: what does the Commission expect from the Summit?</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, Madrid should be an opportunity to enhance the political dimension of our bi-regional strategic partnership. This partnership is about more than just developing cooperation projects: indeed, 48 heads of state and government have not come together simply to endorse a new list of projects. I am convinced that what is really important is the opportunity that Madrid presents us with to give political weight to fresh and bold initiatives. In particular, we need to bring our political dialogue into sharper focus. By doing so, we will come closer together on issues of common concern, such as climate change, the development agenda agreed at Doha, the International Criminal Court and human rights. We must also commit ourselves increasingly to assert these convergent positions in international fora. This will result in the strengthening of the multilateral system.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has a particular responsibility, through our actions and cooperation with others, to make it clear that, in our judgment, the only way in which we can tackle international problems is through international cooperation. We should look in particular for partners in making multilateralism work in Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission expects the Summit to address what is one of the most important questions for the people of Latin America and the Caribbean: the fight against social inequities and the search for social cohesion. We know – some of the figures were given by the presidency – that Latin America faces a potential problem of political instability because of social inequity. This issue needs to be addressed, and the Summit should concentrate on the search for solutions to this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we expect Madrid to represent a milestone in a number of sub-regional negotiation processes – again, as the presidency pointed out. Perhaps most significantly, the Summit will mark the conclusions of our negotiations with Chile. This is indeed a considerable achievement. It constitutes a major strengthening of bilateral relations and I endorse everything that the presidency said about the extraordinary depth and breadth of the agreement we have concluded with Chile. It is one of the most important agreements we have ever concluded with any country. Elsewhere, the Summit should welcome the fact that the negotiation of the political, institutional and cooperation chapters with Mercosur is practically finished. I hope it also encourages the efforts being made to conclude the outstanding negotiations in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Central America and the Andean Community, the European Union has been particularly sensitive to the requests of these two regions significantly to enhance their relations with us. The General Affairs Council conclusions of 15 April have paved the way for the negotiation of a political dialogue and cooperation <span class="italic">agreement</span> with both regions. These negotiated agreements will seek to enhance our trade and investment relations and prepare the ground for still closer cooperation in the future. By doing this, the European Union has satisfactorily responded to the legitimate aspirations of these countries, and I hope the Madrid Summit will wholeheartedly support this move.</p>
<p class="contents">Before concluding, I would like to extend my congratulations to the Spanish presidency for the excellent work it has carried out regarding the preparation of the Summit. I would also like to pay tribute to the European Parliament’s extraordinary commitment to the future of our relations with Latin America, and to one or two individual Members who have played a particularly constructive role, one of whom is going to speak as soon as I have sat down. I should like to congratulate Parliament in particular on the ambitious and far-reaching initiatives contained in the resolution of 15 November 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Commission have been working hard with the Spanish government and others to make this Summit a success. We have been working for almost 18 months with that objective in mind. We have been able, not without some difficulty, to bring to fruition schemes like the scholarship programme and the programme on the information society. We have concluded negotiations with Chile on an extremely wide-ranging agreement, as we said, which many faint hearts thought impossible. We have made more progress with Mercosur than most would have predicted. Now we want to raise the level of our relations with the other subregional groupings as well. This provides the basis for a good Summit, which will further strengthen our bi-regional relationship and prepare us to take things forward even further when we next meet – probably in two years' time – almost certainly with a larger European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Patten’s view that this type of meeting has been criticised because the great declarations they lead to are often not turned into concrete objectives, and I believe that in reality summits should be the ritualistic embodiment of an underlying political will which will generate the political energy necessary for the machinery to function.</p>
<p class="contents">Our task now is to give substance to this ambitious objective of the strategic and regional partnership which the Heads of State and Government drew up in Río de Janeiro. And I agree with Mr Patten that the European Union is approaching this Summit with a series of very positive messages.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly – and I believe this does credit to all the political groups in this Parliament – it has a clear and ambitious report aimed at the constitution of a bi-regional partnership which attempts to create a common European Union strategy for Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it has a will which is reflected in budgetary terms, which will allow the European Union to go to Madrid with respectable sums within the 2002 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">And thirdly, the EU has an ambitious association agreement, negotiated with Chile – for which we must thank the European Commission for its negotiation efforts and the Presidency-in-Office for its support – and is holding negotiations with Mercosur which must also be given new impetus, because it is at moments of crisis that this type of agreement can be more necessary than ever. The European Community must also present, through the Commission, guidelines for negotiation, for new agreements with the Andean Community and Central America which, in the opinion of this House, must provide – I am not saying at this moment – the prospect of a partnership, as the President of the European Parliament has said in a recent letter to the President of the Commission; and also an ambitious Commission programme which includes a whole series of initiatives which, although they do not imply a single euro more, are very important in relation to the creation of this bi-regional association.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst all this praise, Commissioner, please allow me to make a small critical point: you will understand that we consider the reduction of EUR 30 million which the Commission has proposed in its preliminary draft budget for 2003 not to be the best calling card to present to the Summit at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I believe it is important that the Summit should take account of the fact that the great and profound social inequalities in Latin America may jeopardise the progress made through so much effort in the fields of co-existence and democratisation and that therefore we must send a very clear message of support for normalisation and democratic consolidation in countries such as Venezuela and Argentina, the inclusion of FARC and the LN on the list of terrorist organisations, also the will to normalise relations with Cuba, on the basis of the principles of the democratic clause, and its gradual incorporation into the Cotonou Agreement. And I believe it is essential for the European Union enthusiastically to create an ambitious global relationship with Latin America so that the United States is not the only protagonist, since they do not ask too many questions about the degree of regional integration in Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, I hope that this Summit will send a clear message, at a clearly-defined level, that we want to create a common area which will take the form of a great transatlantic axis to provide a direction for relations between the European Union and Latin America for the coming millennium.</p>

But may I take this opportunity to point out in all modesty that the European Parliament has cultivated very close relations with Latin American parliamentarians for years now; in fact, the longest-standing relations between the European Parliament and other parliaments are with Latin America and date back to the early 1970s.</p>
<p class="contents">How Latin America develops over the coming years and decades will also depend to a very considerable degree on its relations with Europe. I think that we underestimate our potential. I should like to make the point here that relations with Latin America must, above all, include a scientific and technical dimension, an industrial dimension, as we have with the United States –why not with Latin America as well?</p>
<p class="contents">May I remind you that Europe's two biggest scientific institutes are in Latin America: the ESO or European Southern Observatory in Chile, which has done a great deal for astrophysics in Chile, and our space centre in Kourou, because French Guyana is also on Latin American soil. I also advocate intensive dialogue involving industry in Europe and Latin America. Something along these lines began with Mercosur and could be extended to the whole of Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Patten rightly referred to Kyoto and climate policy. If I had the time, I could work out what emissions trading might mean in the future for Latin America. The President has signalled to me that I do not have the time. If I did, I would work it out for you and you would be astounded at the possibilities it encompasses. In short, we have a great many opportunities for relations with Latin America. We must use them, not just talk about them!</p>

<p class="contents">This situation affects Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean. We must therefore take advantage of this Summit in Madrid to consider the situation frankly and achieve pragmatic conclusions and convince ourselves of the need amongst all of us to ensure that the whole of society functions correctly and its quality of life is improved, and we must seek a road towards peace and stability on the planet, particularly in these two geographical blocks – the European Union and Latin America and the Caribbean – which are united by history. In this regard, respect for human rights and the rejection of political impunity and intolerance, as well as the strengthening of democracy and the incorporation of civil society into political decision making must be the key priorities of our future joint action, within the framework of respect for the sovereignty and independence of peoples.</p>

<p class="contents">Moving beyond words, for us the challenge of the Madrid Summit and the initiative of a global strategic partnership consists of offering an option which is fundamentally different to that of the United States. I believe we will have been too unambitious if all we do is repeat that our priority is the establishment of free trade areas in countries such as Mexico or Chile. Or if we say how good the policies of the International Monetary Fund in Argentina are, while ignoring the data indicating that 41% if the population in Latin America is still living in poverty, that 56% of the income they derive from exports is used to pay debts, and that in countries with which Europe has agreements that are seen as models – such as Mexico –extremely serious violations of human rights are still taking place. We will also have been too unambitious if we allow our multinationals to treat their workers in a way which would be considered unacceptable in Europe, as is the case with the German company <span class="italic">Continental Tyres </span>in Mexico, or if we intend to intervene in the Colombian conflict simply by producing prescription lists to try to define who is a terrorist and who is not.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, we do not want to forget that the Spanish Presidency was very careful about accepting the attempted <span class="italic">coup d’état</span> in Venezuela – I do not know how else to describe this acceptance – and that this had a very negative effect in Latin America, whose governments, in contrast, recognised the democratic value of the Chávez Government.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the resolution, we ask – and I will end here, Mr President – that we stick to the compromise agreed by the groups and that we do not vote for an amendment which could seriously complicate the situation of the hostages in Colombia, by introducing the idea that we have to close the door to all types of dialogue. We therefore sincerely hope that this House will not approve the amendment proposed by the European People’s Party. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is essential that we see the FTAA project as a counter-offensive by the United States to reduce the European Union’s influence – which, although in principle it is contradictory, can also be described as beneficial – in relation to Latin America. I believe that is the most important issue which should be dealt with at the European Union/Latin American Summit of Heads of State. And we are therefore obliged to analyse the consequences of both the FTAA project and of 11 September and the change that has taken place throughout Latin America. We must take into account the violations of human rights in Guatemala and the impunity relating to them. We must consider the breakdown of negotiations in Colombia, which have failed, and we, who are committed to promoting dialogue and negotiation, should insist on this policy of dialogue and negotiation in order to restore common sense.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot pursue the aggressive militarist policy of the United States because that would cause us to lose all credibility in the eyes of the world and of Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">The same can be said with regard to Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil, where, incredibly, democratic candidates from the Workers’ Party and trade unionists are being eliminated before the elections, and all with the usual impunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, our influence in Latin America, in view of the Summit, should be decisive, in order – just as Mr de Miguel and Commissioner Patten have said – to strengthen human rights, peaceful co-existence and democracy through the influence which the European Union can exert and which the United States is failing to exert. I therefore believe that it is worth taking full advantage of this opportunity and that we must not turn our backs on the situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Latin America indeed continues to face political, economic and social challenges that require Europe and Latin America to work together with mutual respect. The summit is, therefore, an excellent opportunity for defining the strategic framework needed by the European Union to develop a foreign policy involving more balanced association and cooperation with the countries of that area. Seen in that light, a common EU vision of South America is not just strategically important, it also needs to be encouraged at the political level.</p>
<p class="contents">The starting point for this common strategy and for EU policy on Latin America should be the principle of association, and it needs to enjoy the support of both sides. Implementing this strategy involves adopting an overall approach so as to encourage relations between the various parties in a consistent and organised way. This does not mean that the European Union should not encourage ever closer cooperation with the individual countries in that part of the American continent, especially given that some of them, such as Argentina and Venezuela, are for various reasons passing through a particularly difficult period. In this context we think there are many advantages to bilateral partnerships between either the European Union or its Member States and various Latin American countries.</p>
<p class="contents">These bilateral cooperation arrangements are the precursor of the successful application of the common European strategy. The objective of sharing prosperity by creating a free trade area by 2010 is very important and must not fail to take account of the differing weight of the various partners. In the context of this bi-regional political dialogue, both the European Union and the countries of Latin America need to marshal their forces so as to identify specific initiatives and actions that will provide their relations with a strategic framework which is both authentic and well structured. For example, we need to define a global plan for combating drug trafficking, and also to strengthen agreements on security, which have become increasingly urgent since the terrorist attacks of 11 September. It is also essential to step up trade and to encourage investment in both regions, which implies support from private initiatives in the countries of Latin America as a key aspect of this mutual development strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we should not lose sight of the need to defend and strengthen human rights and to promote democracy in all the countries of the region, without exception. I therefore support the proposal for a joint resolution whilst recognising that compromise texts like the one we are debating sometimes lack in clarity what they may gain in parliamentary support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sadly, he drowned on one of those hazardous journeys. So trade with Latin America is long established between my country and this great continent.</p>
<p class="contents">It therefore gave me great pleasure to attend the EU-Latin American Parliamentary Conference in the same city last April. I am hopeful that Chile will shortly become the most recent signatory to a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with the EU, as Mexico – whose President Fox is visiting us here in this House today – did following the first summit meeting in Rio in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, Latin America has been very much in the news. We have had President Carter's reconciliation visit this week to Cuba, the sole remaining communist dictatorship; the farcical short-lived coup in Venezuela against the maverick President Chávez; the sad economic meltdown that we now see in once prosperous Argentina; as well as the ongoing tragedy of Colombia, racked by guerrilla war, political assassinations and illegal drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in spite of these problems, I retain a degree of optimism that Latin American countries will eventually realise that to reach western-style prosperity and security they will have to put aside their petty divisions – which are small compared to the linguistic and cultural differences that we face here in the EU – and unite in developing strong and stable functioning market economies, based on the Rule of Law, good governance, democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Initially the EU will have to negotiate bilateral treaties, but I am convinced that in the longer run a Latin American free-trade area drawing on the lessons of the Mercosur and Andean Pact countries' experience will emerge over the next decade. This will itself be subsumed eventually into the free trade area of the Americas, as agreed by the USA and the Latin American heads of state and government in Quebec last year. It also established for the first time embryonic clauses on human rights and democracy to which all the states signed up except, shamefully, Venezuela.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the second summit of the heads of state and government of Latin America, the Caribbean and the EU in Madrid on 17 May. I wish it well in its challenging project of bringing about much closer cooperation between these two great regions of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the words of many of my fellow Members, but I believe that one of our obligations is to point out the possible problems and as far in advance as possible. There is good news about Mexico – today we are going to have the honour of receiving President Fox – about Chile and about other things. But I would like to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to the poorest region of the American continent, that is, Central America.</p>
<p class="contents">From 1984, the European Union played a very positive role in the development of the peace processes in the region. We are seeing political changes which have meant peace and the installation of democratic governments, but also a situation in which the difficulties of economic and social change are being combined with natural disasters and continuing inequality and poverty of staggering proportions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the conclusion of a peace agreement should always be viewed as a starting point rather than a point of arrival. And it would be a mistake to be content with the management of the past and not appreciate that there is a risk in the region, and in the whole of Latin America, of a lack of prospects which leads to the most disastrous thing in political and social terms, which is stagnation, not conflict, but a total lack of prospects, the development of stagnant situations.</p>
<p class="contents">This problem is particularly serious in Central America and I believe that the Union has an essential role to play in supporting the regional development of the area in the medium and long term.</p>
<p class="contents">To be absolutely frank, I believe there is increasing frustration in Central America in relation to the Madrid Summit, and I would ask the Council and the Commission to do everything possible to prevent this, or at least to alleviate it, by offering prospects for the immediate future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We hope that the Summit will achieve real results, but I agree with Mr Salafranca that the presentation by the Commission of a budget in which the contribution to that region is reduced by EUR 30 million is not the best message to send at this point.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to refer to another issue: the issue raised by Mrs Frassoni, who has asked us, on behalf of her group, not to include an amendment condemning terrorism. I believe that this could prejudice the hostages of terrorists and that is a mistake from the methodological point of view. We cannot become hostages to terrorism, because if we give in at this point, then we are actually inciting terrorists to kidnap our nationals and our representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish police have just countered a terrorist operation which was apparently aimed at overshadowing the Madrid Summit. I believe that this should reinforce our desire to combat terrorism both on this side of the Atlantic and on the other, and to cooperate with the democratic governments of Latin America in order to consolidate the democratic options. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to state publicly that the Presidency of the Council has had invaluable assistance from the European Commission in relation to fulfilling our desire to give this Summit substance. It is not my job to pass judgement on budgetary issues which, furthermore, I have no information about, but I can say that the Commission will take account of what the honourable Members have said, although this does not fall within the competence of the Commissioner responsible for external relations. However, both this Commissioner and the Commissioner responsible for trade, Mr Lamy, have made a huge effort to give substance to this Summit, which – we all agree – must not merely be a talking shop. The Commission, together with the Member States, has made a great contribution to this.</p>
<p class="contents">The panorama we are facing in relation to Latin America is surely one of the most difficult we have seen in recent years. Following the so-called ‘lost decade’, everything seemed to indicate, during the 1990s, that the Latin American continent was moving forwards, that democratic systems were being consolidated and that great progress was being made in the social field, which is extremely important, because the great problems of Latin America stem from the huge differences between classes, with a very high percentage of people living in a dispossessed class and living without hope. Just when we thought that, by means of our fora for dialogue – whether at sub-regional or at other levels – such as the Rio Group, the San José dialogue, the Andean dialogue, Mercosur, etc., we were beginning to find a way to improve the region, it turns out that we are now facing a very serious situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The truly dramatic situation of Argentina has been mentioned. There has also been mention of the situation of Venezuela, of Central America … it is not just one country but a whole range of countries which are not in a position to progress, and – as Mr Obiols i Germà said – they have practically been forgotten. It appears that the rest of the international community has turned its attention entirely away from Central America. These are the realities we must confront in a context in which the European Union is fully aware of its historical commitment to the other side of the Atlantic. There is absolutely no doubt that transatlantic relations are an essential part of Union’s foreign policy as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">America as a whole, from Canada to the Magellan Strait, is a continent in which European culture, history and life have had a great influence. The result of this influence has been hybrid societies, differing societies, which are not European but whose value systems are based on everything they have inherited from centuries of our presence throughout that enormous continent. The European Union’s desire is to value the idiosyncrasies and independence of all those countries while at the same time strengthening all those purely European values which are still alive in those societies and which we are obliged to maintain through our policies. We naturally have to do more than that and that is why we are so involved in the issue of economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">We also know, however, that solutions are always long-term, because there are regions, such as Central America or the Andean area, and even the most developed regions, the Southern Cone, which, because of their circumstances, will in reality be very seriously in debt over the coming years, with social consequences which may be extremely dangerous for the future of those countries. I therefore believe that the examples that have been provided, such as the free trade agreement with Mexico and the one we are now going to sign with Chile, offer a means for fairer and more intense exchanges at the highest level. The Union has only reached free trade agreements with one Latin American country, Mexico, and now it is going to sign one with another, Chile, but with the rest of world we have no free trade agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">This indicates that we must move towards a shared and fairer commercial system, but, at the same time we must not forget that, together with those two countries, which are the exceptions, there are other countries which have very serious problems, which are not going to be resolved purely by free trade agreements, since, as Mrs Frassoni said, trade is not everything, and we must also act on other levels. This will enable us to take a clear initiative with regard to the policy of the United States which actually is restricted to a great free trade agreement, the FTAA, and offers nothing else. The added value of our European culture and our historic link to that continent must be that "something more" that we must offer, firstly, through the elimination of differences in wealth and the creation of a more balanced and just society, and, above all, through the promotion of good governance, respect for the Rule of Law and respect for human rights. These must be the messages and I believe that the Latin American countries are hearing them. Mr Fox will hear them today – because today we are going to hold a meeting with him – and I believe that all the Heads of State and Government will also hear them within the framework of the dialogue with Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Presidency takes good note of the fact that the European Parliament’s sentiment is precisely that: we must go further than the commercial field, without ignoring it, in order to increase the quality of our relations with Latin America through dialogue between closely-related countries, because we share a culture, language, history and values – above all values – and because the values which have made European society what it is must also make Latin American society more prosperous, more egalitarian, more just and more protective of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this spirit that the Presidency will approach the Summit and furthermore it now has the support of this Parliament in order to move in the direction we consider to be appropriate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
