In this respect I appreciate why he is not yet here at the moment, and in any case he knows us all quite well already.</p>
<p class="contents">This is indeed a tricky business: Greenland lies only a few kilometres off the coast of Canada, while it is more than four hours' flight from Copenhagen but is nevertheless a part of Denmark. Denmark, meanwhile, is a Member of the European Union, while Greenland withdrew from the EU more than 15 years ago following a referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">Have no fear, I do not intend to give an impassioned speech in favour of Greenland returning to the EU, although I am sure that would be an interesting debate. I simply want to clarify how difficult the situation before us actually is. Since Greenland withdrew from the EU in 1985 it has had Fisheries Agreements with the Community. These were necessary in order to regulate fishing in Greenlandic waters and set catch quotas for European fishing boats.</p>
<p class="contents">The Third Protocol to the Fisheries Agreement expired on 31 December 2000 and was replaced by a new one that came into force on 1 January 2001. Yes, a Fourth Protocol has now been in operation since January 2001. If one looks at today's date then one can see that we in Parliament are trailing behind by some months. However – and this should be emphasised again in the context of the present debate – the reason for this delay does not lie with Parliament! The signing of the Protocol went ahead in September 2000. However, the Commission did not submit the Protocol for Parliament’s approval until the end of December 2000, in other words shortly before it was officially due to come into force.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to take our role seriously, and be taken seriously, as the body responsible for budgetary matters, then this way of handling procedures on the part of the Commission is unacceptable. In the interests of ensuring good relations between the Commission and the EP there is an agreement to allow Parliament a period of six months between submission and entering into force to afford it time to make comments. And Greenland too, incidentally, which had to wait for four months in vain for payments, was not best pleased – to put it mildly – with the behaviour of the Commission. The advance payment that the Commission then initiated off its own bat in mid-April did little to change that.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of future Agreements the Commission should pay more attention to the deadlines and arrangements in order to avoid irritations of this sort, which give rise to ill feeling between institutions and damage the international standing of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do we need a Protocol of this sort at all, when after all it costs the EU EUR 42.8 million per year? On the one hand, of course, it directly benefits EU fishermen who lay their nets in Greenland's waters. These fishing possibilities are irreplaceable. On the other hand, the Agreement with Greenland is of tremendous importance as regards the Fisheries Agreements with other nations such as Norway or Iceland, as it is through the exchange of fishing quotas that the Agreements with Norway or Iceland are possible in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Fourth Protocol the fishing quotas have at last been reduced to a realistic level. Conservation of stocks and sustainable management were the deciding factors in setting the quotas. And this is a good thing, as we do not want to fish to the point where there is nothing left to catch. We want to leave our children and grandchildren the chance of making a living from fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">One question, if not the most important question, in the case of Greenland will be: will cod recover? Despite some signals to this effect, there are still no positive, conclusive findings from fishermen or the scientific community. This is of course bound up with the problem of what we so appositely call ‘paper fish’. What use is it to our fishermen, after all, if on paper they are allowed to catch so many tonnes of fish but the fish is simply not there? We need more realism here. This includes the possibility of fishing other species, as is expressly provided under the new Protocol, and also annual review and confirmation of quotas and support for joint venture projects, which has so far been lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a realistic fisheries policy with Greenland. I therefore advocate undertaking a cost-benefit analysis before the renewal of the Protocol and a review at mid-term with the active involvement of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In doing this, one issue will be how to separate financial compensation for purely fishing possibilities from the total contribution, which also covers development projects. As you see, there is still a great deal to be done. I hope that the proposals for amendments we have put before you will pass through Parliament successfully. If relative stability is to be brought about, however, I would ask you to reject this motion. We are, however, in the process of elaborating a compromise to show how unanimous we are in our efforts with regard to the subject of fisheries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We simply have to look at the text and compare it with the Council’s mandate to see how arbitrary the Commission has been. Furthermore, if we compare the Protocol with any other agreement with the South, it is frightening to think how sure some high-level officials in the Directorate-General for Fisheries must be of their position of impunity. That is the heart of the matter. Not the fact that there are EUR 300 million to solve the crisis facing the fleets affected by the failure with Morocco and that there is more than double to pay for fishing opportunities in Greenland which are not even worth what has been spent on their negotiation, not to mention the cost in terms of the loss of prestige and credibility of the Commission. Nor is the most important element the fact that, unlike the agreements with the South, there was no clause allowing new Member States access, nor the fact that only shipowners within the agreements with the South have to contribute to the funding of the external fisheries policy, nor the fact that it is impossible to control the spending of this considerable amount of tax-payers’ money.</p>
<p class="contents">The important thing, Commissioner, is that this Protocol demonstrates in a few pages the extent to which the CFP can be arbitrary and unfair. Furthermore, the Director-General for Fisheries’ attempts at an explanation before our committee could be called laughable if the gravity of the situation did not make them insulting. He thinks it is completely normal to have double standards in terms of the benefits of agreements for the North or for the South. And he added unashamedly that Council ended by approving this Protocol. Of course we are also going to approve it, because we are very aware of the difficulties of ending up without a fisheries agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither do we have great hopes for an improvement in the mid-term review, since the Protocol makes it clear that, if one party does not wish to deal with an issue, that issue will be left out of the review. If this is not the case, if we have interpreted it wrongly, we would ask you, Commissioner, to make a gesture to calm the worst fears of the fishing industry and to put an end to the feeling that our CFP always benefits some people at the expense of others.</p>

<p class="contents">However, I would like to say that this debate concerns a fishing agreement which is atypical for many reasons. Firstly, because it is the only Community fishing agreement which is not international, since the Community negotiates it and signs it with a Member State, as well as with the local authorities of Greenland. This international agreement is in no way ‘international’ and it is barely a ‘fishing’ agreement, since it does not distinguish – despite the claims of Parliament and the Council – between the specific amount intended for development cooperation and the amount corresponding to fishing possibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">This is fundamentally a development cooperation agreement dressed up as a fishing agreement. EUR 14 million is intended for development cooperation but it is also the case that the very limited use of the fishing opportunities means that most of the remaining 28 million also goes into the coffers of Greenland’s treasury, with no compensation for the Community’s fishing sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Another idiosyncrasy of this agreement is that it is the only one in which shipowners do not have to pay a single tariff for carrying out their activities. It is regrettable that there has been hardly any development of the possibility of creating mixed companies and that exploratory campaigns have not been developed at all. Commissioner, the sector affected casts doubt upon the figures supplied the Commission on the true use of fishing possibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">According to some reports, only 12% of the fishing possibilities were utilised within the last agreement, and the agreement negotiated by the Commission, which it is proposing to this House today, prevents these possibilities, paid for the Community tax-payers, being used by other Community fleets with an interest in fishing in these waters. The whole thing is a wasteful mess.</p>
<p class="contents">Iberian fleets – Spanish and Portuguese – which before joining the Community fished in these waters, are still being excluded, 15 years later, from the scope of this agreement, owing to an abusive interpretation of the principle of relative stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the high financial figures involved, second only to Mauritania, the Community must make a real assessment and not a fictitious one. Furthermore, Parliament should have been consulted during the negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group will vote in favour of the amendments of the Committee on Fisheries and also the amendment tabled by Mrs Figueiredo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Greenland Agreement is important for the Union, especially because it gives the Community the opportunity to enter into other very important fisheries agreements, for example with Norway and Iceland. There are four countries that benefit from the Greenland Agreement, but there are even more Member States that benefit from the agreements with Norway and Iceland. In short, the third country agreements that the Union has with countries in the north, west and south bring many advantages. With reference to respect for the principle of relative stability, we are therefore opposed to Mrs Figueiredo’s Amendment No 9. In this area, I would also support the ideas discussed by Mrs Langenhagen during her submission.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the fishing possibilities, to which access is being purchased, are more realistic than in the previous agreement. I share Mrs Langenhagen’s desire to apply the principle of ‘money for fish’, i.e. separation of the financial consideration for the fishing possibilities, on the one hand, and the resources for development needs, on the other. I would like to call upon the Commission to seek a solution model which Greenland’s local Government can accept and which distinguishes between the value of fishing rights and more development-oriented financing, which is actually taken into account in the budget items, as is reflected in their headings. On behalf of the Liberal Group, I have put forward an amendment to the effect that those fishermen who benefit from the agreement must also be involved in financing the agreement. This is a proposal that we always make because we feel that the users must contribute to the financing to a greater extent. We believe that this principle should apply to all the EU’s fisheries agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we have said here many times, our position is not against fisheries agreements in principle but more against the way in which they are negotiated and the terms arrived at. All too often there is very poor – if any – scientific understanding of the status of the stocks. There is also poor control and enforcement of EU fishing activities. Negotiations do not take place in a regional context. That is why we have generally voted against them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greenland agreement is different. It falls in the geographical zone of three international fisheries organisations: the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, the North West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, and the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission. These are among the most scientific regional bodies that exist. There is therefore scientific information on the status of the stocks being fished and we note with approval that the overall quantities to be fished have been reduced dramatically and are more in line with responsible fishing opportunities. Both NAFO and NEAFC also have among the best and most comprehensive programmes for control and surveillance. For that reason, this time we will support the agreement. We will also support the amendment by the Liberals on the Commission recovering the costs of the agreement from the ship-owners who benefit from it. This is an extremely important principle, which should be followed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new protocol guarantees fewer fishing possibilities, arguing that this is a more accurate picture of the real catch. Nevertheless, we still need to resolve the fundamental issue of guaranteeing fishing possibilities for fleets from other Member States, which are able to make use of the predicted catch possibilities. Until such fishing possibilities are guaranteed, we cannot achieve greater balance in the cost of the protocol, which would be of economic and social benefit to these countries. We would also be disregarding the conclusions of the Council of Fisheries Ministers of October 1997, on the fisheries agreements and the underutilisation of quotas. Hence our proposal for an amendment, which seeks to ensure that all Member States can make use of the fishing possibilities that are available. The current situation is especially unfair to fleets such as Portugal’s, which has fished in those waters since the 1930s, although Portugal did not sign up to the protocol when it joined the European Union in 1986. The existence of a small quota for Portugal could reduce its fishing deficit by 12 000 tonnes, which would help to keep afloat the rest of its deep-sea fleet. I should point out that of the 52 factory ships that existed in 1990, only 14 are still operational. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this way, the European Union is paying a very high price. We must remember that this is the most expensive agreement, together with the Mauritania agreement, since the Moroccan agreement disappeared, simply as a result of what is known as ‘paper fishing’.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that Member States other than the ones that traditionally benefit cannot use the fishing possibilities makes this agreement controversial. If we add the fact that, in the agreements with the South, shipowners have to contribute increasing amounts of tariffs for the funding of these agreements, while in Greenland they are exempt from these payments, we have another good reason to describe this as a discriminatory agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to point out that the partial payment brought forward by the European Commission, before Parliament has expressed its view, has been strongly criticised in our committee because, while legally possible, it is nonetheless politically unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the mid-term review of this agreement – and of the common fisheries policy itself – will consider and overcome these difficulties, which have nothing to do – I stress – with Greenland, which is offering us its waters. The agreement must serve to genuinely promote fishing cooperation, opening up new avenues to new Member States in order to jointly develop the fishing potential of Greenland to our mutual benefit, that is to say, the benefit of those States and of the European Union, of those who are fishing now and of those other Member States who are not doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">At this difficult time for the agreements with the South, after the failure of the negotiations with Morocco, I would like to take this opportunity, Commissioner, once again to remind you, for the second time in this debate, of the political priority and urgency of European solidarity, which should take the form of a generous, practical economic plan for the people affected by this agreement, as was approved at the Nice Summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first issue that must be raised about this agreement, which is of such huge scope, is that there appears to be an unacceptable degree of confusion between what is a fisheries agreement and what is development aid for a region which, although part of a Member State of the European Union, has decided not to be a part of the Union. We have nothing against such development aid and in fact I feel it may be totally justified, but I fail to understand why this development agreement should be disguised as a fisheries agreement. This is a fisheries agreement which reflects and lays claim to the principle of relative stability based on historical catches, but one in which the historical facts are ignored! Portugal will soon be celebrating 500 years of fishing in Newfoundland. Fishing in Greenland is actually a little more recent, and does not date back 500 years. It would, therefore, be difficult to say that any fishing tradition is older than that of Portugal in the seas of Greenland. To say that Portugal has no place in this fisheries agreement is something that we could never accept and which is completely out of touch with the reality of the situation. We can therefore not accept this interpretation of the principle of relative stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot understand why the fleets of Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Denmark should be given favourable treatment, particularly since they cannot even reach the level of catches allowed under the previous protocol and since they have not taken advantage of the opportunity to create joint, mutually beneficial companies. We cannot accept the discrimination against the fleets of other Member States such as the Spanish and Portuguese fleets – and within the Spanish fleet, the Galician fleet – that want to fish in Greenland’s waters and which are in a position to make business agreements with local agents, as allowed under the agreement. What we want, and it should not be necessary to have to say this once again, is sustainable development and the preservation of fish stocks.

Despite that fact that it did not fish, the European Union nevertheless made payments, on time, of an average of EUR 38 million per year during the period covered by the previous agreement. The most shocking aspect of this third agreement is that fishing possibilities for the period in question are being reduced, whereas the European Union’s financial compensation, which stands at around EUR 43 million per year, is being increased. In other words, we are paying more for fishing considerably less. What has brought about this decision by the European Union to sign a fisheries agreement despite the negative experience of the previous agreement? Our rapporteur highlights two main reasons: the first is the importance of this agreement for the conclusion of other agreements in the region, specifically with Norway and Iceland, and the second reason is that it is crucial for the fleets of countries that fish there.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons and despite all the inconsistencies, the rapporteur proposes that we adopt the report. I understand these reasons and shall, therefore, not oppose the rapporteur’s proposal, although I have adopted various amendments tabled by other Members of the House. We must nevertheless bear in mind that, according to the two main arguments invoked by the rapporteur to persuade us to support this agreement, this one was to be followed by other fisheries agreements, which did not happen, as we know, with the agreement with Morocco. The agreement with Morocco was not signed despite the fact that this was essential to the fleets of two Member States that fished there and the fact that it was a fundamental sign that we needed to give in order to conclude other fisheries agreements in the region, with Mauritania and with other countries to the south of Mauritania, for example. There can be no doubt that this is an incomprehensible two-tier policy with two sets of standards, and I hope that the relevant Member State governments – Portugal and Spain – take due account of what has happened and what is happening with this agreement with Greenland, in order to make a similar procedure hold sway in the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed she went beyond the call of duty and applied herself very sincerely to consideration of the Greenland problems and the European problems. Having said that, this agreement should be based on economic criteria. We should evaluate what we are buying, consider the cost of catching it and consider whether the game is worth the candle. We should not get involved in the business of giving aid and buying fish at the same time. It is not the business of our Commissioner for Fisheries to deal with aid to Greenland. In the first place, Greenland was once a Member of this Union. It chose to leave. We do not owe it any economic aid. If it is poor and hungry, let our people in the Commission who consider such problems deal with that. We are dealing with fish. This should be a commercial activity. We should buy the fish and ensure we are getting good value.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to consider also that we are dealing with countries that are normally weaker than we are. We must ensure that we do not exploit those countries and do not allow our fleets to damage or exploit their fishing stocks. I do not accept that we should charge the ships that specifically go there. When we buy these fish they belong to the European Union and should be shared out amongst the fishermen on the same basis as all the other fish that the Union controls, in order to create a balance. It does not necessarily not make sense for Portuguese fishermen not to go to Greenland. In relation to historic rights, 500 years ago Basque fishermen went to Newfoundland. Fishermen from Bristol went there as well and also fished around Iceland. Today they would not do that because the navies of these countries will not allow them to do so. Historic rights are not necessarily right. Generally speaking, we should apply common sense to today's problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also pleased that you, as rapporteur, recommend approval of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Among other things, the Fourth Protocol, which was initialled on 13 September 2000 in Copenhagen, creates a basis for re-assessing the relationship between the Community and Greenland. The most important measure for this re-assessment is described in Article 14 of the Protocol. An interdepartmental working group of the Commission will review measures that are intended to bring more transparency and accountability into relations with Greenland. This review will take place by 30 June 2003 at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of this mid-term review is to create a new framework for future cooperation between the Community and Greenland. Parliament will of course be involved in drafting such an agreement in accordance with the provisions in force.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the most important aspects of the Fourth Protocol? First of all let us consider catch quotas. These have been reduced by comparison to the Third Protocol in order to set catch possibilities that are also actually available. This applies especially to cod, which has been reduced from 31 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes; redfish has been reduced from 52 000 to 31 000 tonnes and roundnose grenadier has been reduced from 8 000 to 3 350 tonnes. A new article has been included with the aim of intensifying cooperation within the framework of regional fisheries organisations, especially with regard to implementation of monitoring and control regulations and in the field of research. Financial compensation has been set at EUR 42.8 million, taking into account the desire of both parties for close and stable relations and with due consideration for the development requirements of Greenland and for inflation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that the Commission supports the rationale behind most of the proposed amendments, and will cooperate constructively with Parliament on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">For formal reasons the Commission must nevertheless distance itself from the amendments in their present form. Concerning Amendments Nos 1 and 2, the Commission supports Parliament’s wish to be informed appropriately, in advance, about budgetary issues or other issues connected with the implementation of the Protocol. However, the Commission already makes relevant data available in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement. For this reason the Commission considers the proposal to be unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Amendment No 3, the opinion of the Commission here too is that the amendment is largely covered by Interinstitutional Agreements, especially the Framework Agreement of 5 July 2000. The cost-benefit analysis referred to is part of the information provided to Parliament prior to the renewal of a Protocol. The Commission does not feel that annual cost-benefit analysis would be very useful. The Commission therefore cannot accept this proposal either. The Commission rejects Amendment No 4 on principle because it contradicts current practice with regard to Protocols to Fisheries Agreements and affects the Commission's powers of negotiation. As the Protocol is an annex to the framework agreement, no new mandate is required to renew it. It goes without saying, of course, that the Commission, as chief negotiator, has responsibility for ensuring that the guidelines laid down by the Council for the negotiations are adhered to.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the Fourth Protocol with Greenland the Commission proposed guidelines for the negotiations – which were approved by the Council – because it wanted to introduce several far-reaching changes compared to the previous Protocol, especially the provision relating to a mid-term review. As far as the latter is concerned, too, the Commission will make an effort to inform Parliament, and especially the Committee on Fisheries, in the appropriate manner. Amendments Nos 5, 6 and 7 are not acceptable because they interfere with the authority of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with the content of Amendment No 8, although it would forestall the mid-term review, and that does not seem sensible. The Commission cannot agree with Amendments Nos 9 and 10 because they do not correspond to some of the principles of the Common Fisheries Policy. Amendment No 9 fails to take into account the principle of relative stability, which assures certain Member States that they will have certain catch quotas in Greenlandic waters too. I would like to add here that the Commission constantly encourages Member States to utilise their fishing rights to the greatest extent possible and also always makes a point of reminding Member States of the possibilities of quota exchange.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 10 would result in 100% of the costs of the agreement being taken on by the fishermen, and this has never before been the case with any previous agreement. Such a proposal also raises considerable legal and practical problems and I think that it is unacceptable for this reason. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
