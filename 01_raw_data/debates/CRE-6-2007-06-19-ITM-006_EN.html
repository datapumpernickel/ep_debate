<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Μarie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the future of the European economy and the development of competitiveness and of the facility to work in the European Union will depend to a great extent on the level of education and training of the citizens, especially young people, so that they can contribute to economic development and social cohesion in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Efforts at both European and national level have borne fruit. In the Europe of the 25 in 2004, the majority of young people between 20 and 24 years of age were in higher education. However, extending the period of study in combination with training, retraining, further training, lifelong learning and so on results in young people postponing their personal, private life or starting a family or pursuing their desires because, as the Green Paper on demographic change concludes, the desires of European citizens to start a family and have children are not compatible with everyday reality. Having children at an advanced age also causes problems on health grounds. It puts a burden on public health and is an obstacle to the demographic development of Europe. Therefore, creating a family-friendly society – as also provided for in the European Youth Pact – means that private, family life needs to be combined with work and with the period of studies which, as we can see, is very long.</p>
<p class="contents">The report being tabled today for the vote endeavours to highlight the approach needed in order to formulate policies which support young people. It will give them the facility, on the one hand, to programme their education plans and, on the other hand, to honour their family commitments to raise children or to support elderly people in their family environment because, as we know, in a few decades two thirds of Europeans will be elderly people.</p>
<p class="contents">Many students are already living this sort of life combining studies and family. However, the percentage differs from one state to another, from 41% in Sweden, to 12% in Greece, 10% in Austria and 10% in Latvia. There are therefore huge differences between the Member States and this is hampering mobility and access to education.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of our report, therefore, which has no wish to subtract from subsidiarity, is to recognise and respond to the family and social needs of young men and women taking on family responsibilities in parallel to their studies and training. The Member States are responsible for granting special social assistance in order to support the wish of young people to have families without taking account of whether they are exercising some professional activity or whether their parents have an income.</p>
<p class="contents">Family benefits can also be granted in the form of loans, affordable housing, adequate crèche services in universities, social and health cover, greater flexibility during studies, an awareness on the part of the teaching staff of the particular needs of student parents or students with family commitments and the use of new technologies to make their life easier. There must also be stronger equality policies, in order to understand that the burden must not fall entirely on women when they are studying.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly satisfied that the Commission communication acknowledges the need to combine studies, training and family life. I hope that my report will inspire future proposals for family- and youth-friendly measures and a forward-looking solution to the demographic problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank my honourable friends for the amendments which improved the report; however, I do not support amendments which limit the content of the report or add elements which are unrelated to its subject matter. I therefore hope that my report will be supported. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou on the quality of her report and the very pertinent suggestions it contains. The Commission broadly welcomes the motion for a resolution of the European Parliament on measures enabling young women in the European Union to combine family life with a period of study.</p>
<p class="contents">While education and family policies are matters for the national authorities, it is important, in every context, to encourage the reconciliation of family life and study periods. At the Stockholm and Barcelona European Councils, the Heads of State and Government recognised that the future of the economy and of European society would depend on its citizens and, in particular, on the younger generations and their levels of training. Education and training have thus been located at the heart of the Lisbon process.</p>
<p class="contents">These policies are decisive for achieving a real knowledge-based European society. For economic reasons and on grounds of equity and equal opportunities, it is therefore important to ensure that young men and women with family responsibilities have the opportunity to take up and complete studies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is pleased that the motion for a resolution concentrates not only on students with responsibilities for children, but also on those with responsibilities vis-à-vis dependent adults or people with disabilities. Likewise, it also welcomes the recommendations concerning childcare facilities, fathers’ roles and better sharing of housekeeping and family responsibilities as a significant factor in equal opportunities between men and women. This approach is in line with the Commission’s policy in the field of reconciling private lives and working lives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also draws encouragement from the stress placed on equality between men and women. Reconciling private life and working life is one of the six priorities of the roadmap for equality between men and women adopted by the Commission in March 2006. As stated in the proposal for a resolution, we are well aware that, in reality, women bear most family and housekeeping responsibilities, even while studying. In the absence of adequate support, young women are thus more likely than men not to continue in education, to give up in the middle of a course or never to return to education, which inevitability leads to inequalities between men and women in their working lives and a loss of their potential.</p>
<p class="contents">Crèches and other childcare facilities are therefore essential to gender equality. In the roadmap for equality between women and men 2006-2010, the Commission emphasised that childcare services are adapting too slowly to social developments, and it undertook to support the achievement of the Barcelona objectives and the development of other care facilities through the Structural Funds and the exchange of good practices.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2008 the Commission also intends to present a communication on the achievement of the Barcelona criteria, which will take stock of the progress made and the efforts that remain to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">All these elements also contribute to the response that we have to give to the demographic challenge. Childcare services support individuals’ free choice, allowing them to have the number of children they would like to have.</p>
<p class="contents">You probably know that the Commission has launched a formal consultation of European social partners on reconciling work life and private life on the basis of Article 138 of the Treaty. The first phase began in October 2006 and the second in May 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that different legislative and non-legislative components are indispensable with a view to better reconciling work, private life and family life. That is why, in the consultation document, the Commission invited the social partners to give their opinions on a set of legislative and non-legislative options. I am pleased to note that the motion for a resolution broadly echoes the concerns and arguments defended by the Commission in its two documents consulting the European social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I recall the adoption in November 2006 of the action programme in the field of lifelong learning for 2007-2013. This programme, which symbolises the new priority given to education, may provide support for projects that meet your concerns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has allowed all the political groups to have their say in her report without, for all that, the basic message becoming distorted. She is used to making compromises, being the mother of nine children.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight two points. First of all, we have to create conditions that make it clear that young people’s parental responsibility is not just a heavy burden in addition to the demands of their training courses. That goes for young men as much as for young women. With this in mind, there must be widespread and appropriate information campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns national and Community policies. Statistics show that the Scandinavian countries achieve a figure of 30% to 40% of young people in education who are allowing themselves the pleasure and responsibility of being parents. The European Union could usefully put at the service of all Member States the Scandinavian countries’ experience in promoting dialogue and exchanging best practice. Higher and professional education establishments also have a responsibility for putting in place their own child care services. It would be worthwhile encouraging competition between universities: this would no longer be limited to the quality of teaching, but would extend to support services for students who are parents.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I must emphasise the importance of grandparents and their crucial role in the process of children’s education and in helping young parents who are studying or working. In the light of the many changes of career that punctuate the lives of workers at this time of globalisation, this represents an opportunity for young retired people to make themselves useful in other ways. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Here, we should pay particular attention to the potential of educated young people in terms of demographic renewal in Europe. This aim can be achieved by introducing favourable social, economic and educational conditions which will allow people to start families earlier in life, without their decision having a detrimental effect on their education or career development. According to the conclusions contained in the Green Paper on demographic change, the European demographic deficit is due to the fact that people currently take longer to reach certain stages in life, in terms of education, work or children.</p>
<p class="contents">In many countries, students simultaneously take on family and study-related responsibilities or start families before they finish their studies. In Sweden, for example, 41% of women have their first child before they finish their studies, and in Finland this figure is 31%. Following this example, the remaining Member States should take the situation of young parents, who are studying or completing their vocational training, more into consideration. Measures to attain this goal might include offering affordable student insurance, as well as social and medical care, which could also cover the student's dependants.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also consider lowering taxes for young people who are both studying and working, those who have family responsibilities, and make it easier for them to obtain loans at a favourable rate from credit institutions. Educational establishments should take into account the financial circumstances of this social group when it comes to calculating fees and provide suitable social assistance, including after graduation. An example of this approach would involve providing aid for a sixth-month period to make it easier for them to get into the job market. I would therefore like to ask you to support paragraph 25 of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important for Member States, together with higher education and vocational training centres, to offer young people a more flexible means of organising their studies, for example through more distance learning opportunities, continuous learning programmes or part-time studies.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in order to reconcile students’ family lives with their studies, it is vital to ensure that those with children have access to good quality, affordable state nurseries and after-school childcare facilities. That is why I appeal to you to vote in favour of paragraphs 14 and 15 of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has come for Member States and Community institutions to exchange their code of best practice in terms of providing support for learners with families, while taking into account pioneering legislation introduced in this field by certain Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Mrs Panayotopoulos, for a very well prepared report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate the rapporteur on her very thorough approach, which highlights the countless implications of this issue: the family and educational projects, the fall in the birth rate, housing policy for young couples, the Lisbon Strategy objectives and lifelong learning, with the starting-point that education is a human right and there is a need for investment in human resources, as a tool to strengthen social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Tellingly, Parliament is tackling this report in the European Year of Equal Opportunities. The need to reconcile family life and work, although recognised by the European institutions and the Commission, which even adopted it as a basic principle in its recent administrative reform, has not so far produced effective, concrete action, as we might have expected it to. Such action might – and we hope that it will in the future – have triggered better awareness by the Member States and thus led to policies that are attentive and responsive to the needs of young people and young mothers and designed to achieve an equality that is not just empty words but is properly promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the instruments proposed by the rapporteur as useful starting points for national decision-makers, I consider particularly effective the flexible study programmes, for example part-time courses, greater use of learning techniques derived from new technologies, tax concessions for young working students, study grants for students with family responsibilities as well as easier access to nursery schools and after-school facilities. Finally, I endorse the proposal to encourage the exchange of best practice with regard to support for students, by looking at the experiments successfully tried in some Nordic countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are many, varied reasons why the cradles of our towns are remaining empty for too long: the ever-increasing cost of living, with which wages are not keeping step, and the late entry of young people onto the employment market, partly due to the wish and the need to study longer in order to become more competitive in a society that is ever more demanding.</p>
<p class="contents">The ambitious goal, which is not an easy one to meet, is therefore not only that of reconciling young people’s right to further education and training with their aspirations to create a family and to have their children at an earlier stage of their lives, but also, indirectly, that of making the Lisbon objectives compatible with the demographic regeneration of our society.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States have a duty to create an appropriate social, economic and educational framework, always keeping in mind the ultimate aim of promoting equal opportunities. For example, the allocation of paternity leave, which is increasingly widespread in northern Europe, is a valid way of attempting to meet the rightful aspirations of young women.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we all know that the Member States have exclusive responsibility for the sectors of education and the family, but it is for this very reason that, with a view to finding a common denominator among the states of the European Union, I believe that the rapporteur’s proposal to provide for the exchange of best practice within the context of the meetings of Ministers is to be fully supported. For this reason, my parliamentary group is in favour of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We complain, but the Commission and the Council did not even put childcare on the agenda for their last spring summit, and that shows just how little importance they attach to it.</p>
<p class="contents">My expectation, Commissioner, is that we, when it comes to making laws, should move ahead rather than standing still; why is the Commission not doing more to bring the employment rates of men and women closer together? We know that the reason why work and family are more readily compatible in the Scandinavian countries is not only that there are more child care facilities available there, but also that more women are in employment. At the same time, in all European countries, the percentage of women with children in work has gone down by 15%, while that for working fathers has gone up by 6%. Almost a third of all women do part-time work; there is still a perceptible wages gap in the European Union, and it is Germany, indeed, that is bringing up in the rear with 26%.</p>
<p class="contents">What I expect of the EU, then, is that it should come up with proposals rather than merely lofty sentiments. I also expect the Commission to make a statement on just how it happens that, in Member States such as Germany, there can be such a thing as what is termed the ‘splitting tariff’ for spouses, which is a reward for staying at home and does childcare no good whatever, while also, in fact, constituting a breach of the directive on ‘equal pay for equal work’. Why is it that children are not made a more central focus of policy in the European Union? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ultimately, the biggest difficulty is to find a solution in the face of age-old stereotyping. According to the report, the higher the level of education reached by women, the more successful they are in the labour market. It also points out, on the other hand, that for women starting a family the path to education is blocked. This often leads women who want to have both an education and a family to delay having children or to have only one child.</p>
<p class="contents">It would appear that families stand in the way of both a professional career and lifelong learning, and that work and education, on the one hand, and the family, on the other, are irreconcilable. Anyone seeking success and an education, be they women or men, often have to give up on the idea of starting a family. Does it have to be that way? This is precisely the question we are asking.</p>
<p class="contents">On an individual – and, it must be said, non-systemic – level, this is a dilemma for young women that is well-nigh impossible to resolve. Aware of how complicated the task is, the Community can offer progress and take action accordingly. The necessary requirements are being incorporated into the system with a view to making it easier for women to have a family and to study and broaden their minds through education at the same time. Accordingly, the position of young women in the labour market will be strengthened, which, in turn, will lead to greater economic equality between the sexes.</p>
<p class="contents">An advanced society needs educated men and women, as well as a functioning family, which, by creating an environment of safety and solidarity for all family members, is vital to bringing up children. A society cannot stop developing, but it must not sacrifice the family at the same time. It must not stop women from accessing education, but it also must not restrict the right to have children. These are critical imperatives that tend to produce conflicting results. This is why we are talking of reconciliation as the solution to the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in the interest of the Community – and in particular its lawmaking bodies, educational institutions and employers – to be aware that the temporary economic losses that may be incurred will bring long-term gain. Where employers are unaware of this philosophy, the Community can offer some form of compensation to offset any losses.</p>
<p class="contents">Traditional solutions to the conflict between the family and education or career are well known. Women who cannot leave childcare to somebody else, or do not want to, have to give up on higher education and a career. This also works the other way round. There are a small number of women combining study and work who can use childcare facilities or whose grandparents can look after their children. When neither of these solutions are possible, women are faced with a choice: a family or education and a career. This is a dilemma that should be consigned to the past and I am glad that the rapporteur has put forward some good solutions aimed at leaving that past behind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Apart from the demands contained in the document, an important way of helping young, female students to raise their children would be to rebuild a multi-generational family structure in which it is natural for parents to help their children. Their assistance would not only deepen emotional bonds, but the priceless gift of their grandparents’ love would also have a positive impact on the children’s personal development. Rebuilding the extended family would also improve the mental health of our citizens. This would, in turn, facilitate the implementation of numerous strategies.</p>

<p class="contents">This report reminds us, in its first recital, that the Member States alone are competent in these areas. The problem, however, is that, in the paragraphs immediately following, it sets out to show that it is up to Europe to take action by promoting active policies that encourage, for example, ways to reconcile studying, training, private life and family life. Even though we might be in agreement with some of the proposals in the substance of this report, the fact remains that it is not up to Brussels, and still less up to the Commission, to tell the Member States what their demographic, family, educational or even professional policies should be. It is up to each Member State to know what its policies should be in these areas and to carry them out. We do not have to let ourselves be dictated to by some European text about measures relating to morality, religion or even fundamental principles or values.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is, little by little, by means of recommendations, regulations or even directives, that Brussels interferes in national policies without being authorised to do so and without even having been approached by the peoples to do so. This systematic propaganda, particularly in relation to the family and to education, is aimed at destroying the traditional concept of the family unit, consisting of a mother, father and the biological children they have had together, and this in the name of freedom without limits and without moral rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a choice they make generally in conjunction with their partner and invariably they understand and have discussed the social, educational and financial consequences of having a child. But they choose to have a child because it is a truly wonderful thing to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Member States, including mine, endeavour through many means to give women the choice, having had their family, to go back into education or into the workplace. From this perspective this report, or at least its title, is worthy of political discussion. The report correctly points out in recital A that education and the family fall within national competence and responsibility. And thank heavens it does, because reading this report you can see why the European public struggle to take this Parliament seriously and why, thankfully, Member States will not budge on giving this competence to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall cite two paragraphs. Paragraph 30 recommends that Member States ‘facilitate the granting of extension of social benefits to students from other Member States who have dependent children’. In my country, as you know, the debate on immigration is very hot and this would simply be unacceptable to even my socialist opponents from my country. Paragraph 10 calls on the Member States to ‘reduce or put an end to taxation of young men and women who both study and who have family responsibilities or responsibilities towards dependants’. That is everyone! Every single person – so no-one pays tax and government completely stops.</p>
<p class="contents">We can learn a lot about how to improve the lives of women who wish to combine family life with a period of study by looking across the different best practices that exist across Europe, especially in the northern Member States. I would suggest, however, that the Committee on Women’s Rights in this House has proven itself to be almost uniquely the worst place for this discussion to take place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We see from the Green Paper on Demography that the life stages of young people – of students of both genders, that is – are being completed later when it comes to work and family, and women have seen in this process the opportunity to have, by means of ‘second chance’ education, a better life, a life of their own choosing, and they have seized that opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Women, accounting for 59% of those who complete higher education, have in that respect overtaken men, but the position is nowhere near as favourable when it comes to decisions taken later on, where the glass ceiling again comes into play, and only 43% of doctoral candidates are women, with the figure falling to a mere 15% for professorships, and lower than that – to 8% – in Germany. Is anyone surprised, then, that women, particularly academics, are more and more likely to decide against having children?</p>
<p class="contents">We need to work towards overcoming gender stereotypes and the social divisions between the worlds of women and men, and must adopt measures to improve compatibility between family and working life, for example by means of affordable facilities. That point has been made, and I am glad that the Commissioner has expressed the intention of doing something about this, but, with the best will in the world, that is not on. What is needed is for pressure to be brought to bear. People will decide for themselves how many children they want, or, indeed, whether they want to have any at all. I do not know whether young academics will be aware of our debate here today, but we have to respect their right to come to their own decisions, and make the choice easier for them.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to respect the desire of more and more people today to live alternative lifestyles and their abandonment of the traditional family model; I might add that that most needs to be taken into account by our governments, not least the government in Poland, and it makes me positively furious that the Poles are yet again standing aloof from this. Many friends of mine in Poland have asked me to make this point today, and I stand here to speak out for the people in Poland who have the same right to free personal choice as anyone else. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Demographic developments show clearly that increasingly few well-educated women are prepared to combine their careers with starting a family – and why should they: young women in academia make the utmost demands of themselves, and so they make these of the family, too. The German proverb: ‘To whom the Lord gives young, He also gives the means to feed them’ may have influenced women’s thinking in the past, but those days are gone.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it is the turn of us politicians to make provision for meeting the demands of young people. That means we must rebuild the family-friendly society that now lies before us in ruins. Anyone who brings up children nowadays must either be very wealthy or live very modestly as, up to now, our society has been promoting everything above children. Just take a look around: where are the open spaces where children can enjoy carefree play nowadays? Where are children really welcome? Even parks are littered with ‘no playing’ signs. Last week, in my home town, Vienna, a man shot at children playing, claiming they were too loud. Most Member States are investing far too little of taxpayers’ money in education and parenting, Mr Heaton-Harris. Our classrooms are overcrowded, teachers are overstretched. We are trying to produce self-confident individualists in schools that still work like barracks.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we promoting family-friendly living? No, we are not: the property market is solely driven by the profit motive. Young people in the city are now happy if they can afford a room in a shared house. That may not have stopped people having children decades ago, but what young people particularly want nowadays is quality of life, and that is what politicians must guarantee them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report contains many excellent measures that aim to make it easier for young Europeans to raise children. However, these measures will not be successful if we continue to live in an environment where nonsense is spoken about the supposedly undesirable inclusive family model consisting of a man and a woman.</p>
<p class="contents">Do adults need reminding of the fact that only these kinds of families produce children? We, in Poland, are aware of this.</p>
<p class="contents">European societies have never been so rich and have never produced so few children. There are both objective and subjective obstacles to parenthood.</p>
<p class="contents">The family has slipped down the list of priorities in life. What counts is work and having a good time. Enjoyment without any responsibilities is now the top priority.

<p class="contents">We must respond to this challenge by promoting policies on everyday life, with an overall view of the needs and establishing transversal public service policies, guaranteeing the provision of measures such as nurseries, and public mobility, and with flexible working hours that respond to the differing specific realities, without jeopardising the quality of service, as well as the economic and fiscal aid that makes it possible for creating a family to ultimately be a personal decision, including amongst people of the same sex. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The concepts of family life and family are central to this report, as well as to other reports concerning parents and children. No definition is provided of the concept of ‘family’, but I presume that the concept is used to denote a variety of alternative family configurations, and not only the traditional picture of a nuclear family consisting of a mother, father and their own biological children. Rather, the concept of a family must also include, for example, lone parents, parents of the same sex and other arrangements that people now choose for leading their lives. In order to clarify this, I hope that Parliament will vote in favour of Amendment 8.</p>
<p class="contents">The report proposes a wide range of measures for giving young women the same educational opportunities as men. I support most of the proposals, with the exception of the text that emphasises the importance of older family members, namely grandparents, and what they can do to help students or working parents. The current generation of grandparents often work professionally themselves. Even if they are pensioners, they are entitled to live their own lives, while obviously enjoying the company of their grandchildren. It is not they, however, who should assume responsibility for child care.</p>
<p class="contents">Society has a responsibility to develop child care and other forms of care so that all parents who seek such care, and whether they are studying or in paid work, have access to high-quality and educationally sound care for their children.</p>
<p class="contents">Both women and men are entitled to engage in study, to have a working life and to produce children. They are entitled to ‘both/and’ rather than ‘either/or’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, these two things have perhaps been clashing recently, because the reproductive age of women, according to the experts, is about 35 years. When half these years are 'wasted' studying up to the age of 30 or 32 for postgraduate degrees and doctorates, valuable time is lost for having a child. Thus, supreme blessing is reserved solely for the well off. The well off are able to pay for their children to study and for the woman to study and have children. People who do not have enough to live on 'postpone' having children and that, to put it one way, is criminal. It is a class difference which we should not allow. We must find ways and means of giving young people the chance, in the form of financial aid, to study and have a family, to have children. We need children. In my country, we have a very low birth rate and this is a huge problem. Children are an issue which deserve particular attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Being a mother is a difficult and demanding role, but the much-talked about knowledge-based society cannot just be made up of men. Due to the lack of suitable support, young women are inclined not to carry on with their studies, to give them up and never return to them, which inevitably leads to inequality between men and women in terms of professional life and later productive capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">We must offer every assistance to women, and to young couples in general, in a Europe with a low birth rate and ever ageing population. In other words, those who want to start a family, have children. If this is combined with the necessary ambition for self-improvement and eagerness to learn, society must reward and support this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Culture and Education is also striving to remove every obstacle from lifelong learning and to ensure that students with family responsibilities, taking into account their particular situation, for instance their lack of mobility, also have access to learning opportunities. In order to achieve all this, a social network needs to be set up in the Member States which are showing solidarity with the families playing the biggest role in supporting society. A network of crèches and nurseries is required, which will provide suitable care for the smallest members of society, as well as schools which will guarantee afternoon activities to keep children occupied under expert supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not exclusively a material issue, it is also about approach. In fact, our governments' policies on family, education, social welfare, employment and youth depend on it to a large extent. We are gradually realising that every child who is born is worth their weight in gold, and even more, as it means that our future is safeguarded and that our peoples will survive and have a viable development.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur as, although education, learning and the various family support systems come under the Member States’ jurisdiction, this report draws attention to solutions and local practices, making it very useful to all those Member States where this issue has been neglected up until now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Demographic change is the main challenge facing Europe. It is a very serious problem requiring urgent measures. The situation varies from country to country, but one thing is for sure: conditions must be created at social and economic level, and in terms of education, whereby young Europeans have the children they want to, without this hampering their careers and without their having to interrupt their studies.</p>
<p class="contents">Women continue to be the worst affected and suffer real discrimination when it comes to having access to, and pursuing, studies and lifelong learning. Yet young families are shunted out to the periphery of major cities. This means that it takes them longer to move between home, work and school and that they are under more physical and mental strain. It also means that parents spend less time with their children, with the incalculable social costs that that implies.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two major challenges underpinning any gender equality policy: firstly, to eliminate the salary gap between men and women and, secondly, to guarantee that family life is balanced with working or academic life. Access to education and professional fulfilment are rights for both men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, the Commission and the Member States must put forward policies that take into account the characteristics of different families, for example parents who study, single mothers and so on, in relation to social security systems, decent housing, childcare facilities and flexibility in terms of curricula, timetables and choice of educational establishment. That way, our young people can contribute to a knowledge-based society, to the competitiveness of the economy, to social cohesion and to the regeneration of European society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

De asemenea, o mare parte din ţările europene înregistrează o rată negativă a sporului natural şi se confruntă cu probleme serioase în ceea ce priveşte relaţiile dintre generaţii, înregistrându-se o creştere a numărului persoanelor aflate în întreţinere. Deci se impune o soluţie de mijloc, care să nu însemne nici renunţarea la copii şi familie, şi nici abandonarea şcolii. În găsirea acestui echilibru statul joacă un rol foarte important. El este cel în măsură să preia de pe umerii familiilor, de pe umerii părinţilor, o parte din responsabilităţile legate de educaţia şi îngrijirea copiilor; să adopte măsurile necesare pentru ca studenţii părinţi să poată beneficia de locuinţe adaptate nevoilor lor; să propună în asociere cu instituţiile de învăţământ o organizare mai flexibilă a studiilor; să faciliteze împreună cu instituţiile de credit acordarea de împrumuturi pentru cei care-şi întemeiază familii şi urmează o formă de instruire; să acorde burse; să scutească părinţii studenţi de la plata unor taxe şi impozite - adică într-o ţară statul poate crea un mediu care să încurajeze tinerii să nu aleagă între o opţiune sau alta. Cred, însă, că la toate acestea mai trebuie adăugată o responsabilitate a statului în ceea ce priveşte educaţia: introducerea educaţiei pentru parteneriat în cadrul familiei. Numai când cei doi soţi vor considera că în familie fiecare îl poate suplini pe celălalt, îi poate juca rolul şi chiar o vor face, atunci concilierea dintre viaţa de familie şi cea profesională este posibilă cu adevărat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Public policies on the reconciliation of private and professional life must not therefore ignore the needs of young people during their years of study.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this context, women students are also in a particularly vulnerable situation, since, despite being students, it is they who, in the majority of cases, take on most family responsibilities, not just in the case of maternity, but also in the event that they are responsible for the care of elderly or disabled persons.</p>
<p class="contents">Without adequate support, young women are more likely than men to interrupt their studies and not return to them, which inevitably means that men and women do not have equal opportunities in their future professional lives, and the consequence of that is a significant loss of human potential for the labour market and for society as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">A person’s educational qualifications have an undeniable impact on employment, as previous speakers have said. The statistics show that unemployment rates are lower when educational qualifications are higher. If the European Union wants to achieve the objective of increasing the employment rate amongst women to 60% by 2010, therefore, clear measures must be taken so that policies for reconciling personal and professional life begin to be applied while people are young and still studying. The recommendations of this report are therefore very important and I would like to congratulate Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou on her work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the challenges of our time, including in terms of the demographic situation, is to find solutions that will allow people to reconcile bringing up children with studying and starting a career. We are not only simply talking about young women, but about young parents in general, namely both mothers and fathers.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be stressed that the current need to complete a higher education course, followed by a PhD or various training courses, and then to start a career and become independent, requires a great deal of effort and that this process usually takes more than four years. On the other hand, one cannot deny the laws of biology. Therefore, young people need conditions that will allow them to start a family, as well as fulfilling their educational and career development goals. We also need a benevolent, family-friendly and non-discriminatory environment, which includes social support, flexible studies and academic internships. In this respect, the Internet will prove to be a very useful tool. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this resolution, however, I think we have failed to look at the difficulties women face in reconciling the rest of their lives which have been glossed over. Women were almost forced to forego childbearing, and if they did bear children, they were forced to forego childrearing. If they did choose to rear their children, they were asked to be superhuman to do it. Thankfully, women are now forcing us to look at changing this and making things more flexible so that they can reconcile family, work and education. We must be flexible. We must help women to combine these things. Or we must even allow women the opportunity to take time off, if they should so choose, in order to have children and to rear them, in the security of knowing that the opportunities will be there when they choose to resume their place in the workplace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim is to prevent young people having to choose between an education and a family. Mrs Panayotopolous-Cassiotou’s report contains good proposals for reconciling these two European needs. I support the proposals and opinions expressed during the course of this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">However, an even greater problem arises after university. In Europe, more women than men obtain a university degree but three times fewer women opt for long term careers in science or research. Barely one in six professors in Europe is female. In the meantime, there are 700 000 empty research posts. More young scientists are particularly needed. We will not solve the problem of growth, or make sure that the Lisbon Strategy succeeds, if we do not change this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we urgently need to also apply the solutions proposed in Mrs Panayotopolous-Cassiotou’s report to the period after the end of one's studies. These solutions should also apply to university work, to work in scientific institutes, laboratories and the research centres of large corporations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is almost impossible for women to return to a scientific career after giving birth and raising, even for a short period, two or three children. I would therefore like to express my great admiration for UNESCO and L'Oréal for organising a global campaign to support women in scientific careers and I would like to encourage you to visit the exhibition which the European Parliament is organising in October, together with UNESCO and L'Oréal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I assume that many of them are fathers who object to their daughters continuing to be disadvantaged in future. Perhaps this will help us achieve more equality.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said many times today, the balance between working life and private life is taking on ever greater political importance, particularly as we have also recognised that, on the one hand, the benefit of the great potential of the female workforce and, on the other hand, the lack of children, can and should no longer be overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as childcare facilities are concerned, the implementation of the Barcelona objective is unfortunately very disappointing. We note that different countries have different statistical data for students who are also parents. In Austria, for example, the proportion is 10.8%, in Sweden 41%. This is proof that situations can be changed by changing the framework conditions. It is obvious; we just need to tackle it.</p>
<p class="contents">Giving birth while studying must not be a reason for postponing one’s studies for a long time, dropping out completely or not starting them in the first place.

This is due not only to the current work situation and the way in which society has developed, but also to the fact that many women are waiting until they have completed their education before they have children. The older a woman becomes, the lower her fertility.</p>
<p class="contents">The opportunity for students to have families is very important from an equality perspective. The lack of adequate support from society means that many young women abandon their studies once they have children, or else do not embark on study at all. This, of course, leads to an unequal labour market and also entails a loss for the economy as a whole because the full potential of these women is lost.</p>
<p class="contents">We notice this pattern in Sweden, in particular. More than 60% of those who embark on higher education in Sweden are women, but the proportion declines the higher up the hierarchy one goes. A particularly large proportion of women abandon PhD studies once they have reached the age at which they wish to have children, because it is difficult for PhD students to take parental leave.</p>
<p class="contents">The level of women’s education is crucial to European growth, innovation and women’s personal development. The Member States must therefore make it easier for students who have children to combine study and family life. This ought to happen through social and economic reforms, such as state financial support and well-developed and inexpensive child care. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no simple answer to this question, and women have to balance having children with work and education demands.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Agenda is well known for its goal that by 2010 Europe should become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth together with quantitative and qualitative improvement in employment and greater social cohesion. It has been calculated that this would increase the overall employment rate in the EU to 70% and the employment rate for women to more than 60% by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">This has obvious implications for women and decisions about family, work and education. Education and training have obvious benefits for individuals and society as a whole. At the same time, women often delay having children because of the demands of work and study. I welcome the Commission’s recognition in its recent communication on reconciling professional, private and family life, that public policy should also be addressed to young women and men who are still in higher education.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to make it easier to combine family life with studying. Unfortunately, few EU countries have a range of social and economic measures to help the students who are parents. Students with family responsibilities face considerable difficulties in their university courses and their daily lives. They have special needs, in particular with regard to housing, childcare services and course flexibility. This particularly affects women, as they are more likely to give up studies due to childcare commitments. This builds in disadvantages for women which we have to address.</p>
