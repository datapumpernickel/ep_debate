<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lulling (PPE-DE) </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, in its 1995 accession treaty Finland obtained a derogation until 31 December 1996 to restrict beer imports from other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This derogation is an exemption to the fundamental right of Community citizens to carry goods purchased for their own consumption from one point in the Community to another without having to pay further duties. Finland obtained an extension of this derogation until 2003. At the same time, in order to comply with European legislation in force in the context of customs union, Finland was required to increase the quantity of beer that could be imported tax free from third countries from 2 to 15 litres.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, in the face of the massive amount of importation carried out by its citizens from Estonia and Russia, which primarily affects the livelihood of the many SMBs retailing beer in border regions, Finland has requested that the limit for residents’ beer imports from these two countries be reduced from 15 to 6 litres. Finland also mentions problems to do with health, public order and loss of income. In the meantime, such imports account for some 10% of Finland’s beer retail market. The reason for this is simply the vast price difference resulting from the exorbitant taxes on alcohol in Finland.</p>
<p class="contents">The Finnish population’s response to this situation is a perfect illustration of the truth of La Palice’s maxim according to which too much tax kills tax, because citizens react against what they consider to be excessive taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">In comparison with other Member States, Finnish excise duties on alcohol are the highest, and for beer, for example, they are 17 times those in Spain and 44% higher than those in Ireland which, in the hit-parade of excise duties, comes in second position behind Finland, which is the champion of the European Union, though, admittedly, it is beaten by Norway, which is not a member.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that, due to Finland’s geographical position, imports by private individuals from other Member States are much less, and this is not, for example, the case in the United Kingdom and Denmark in particular, which have much higher excise duties on alcohol than their neighbouring Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the seriousness of the situation, I recommended in my report that we should agree to this new 6 litre limit for beer from Russia and Estonia, but only until 2003 and not until 2006, principally due to the fact that Estonia is an accession candidate and that the traffic in goods, even the illegal traffic, will not cease after 2006 unless Finland decides to impose less stringent taxes on alcohol products, especially beer and wine. </p>
<p class="contents">The majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not agree with me on this. I persisted, and I even tabled an amendment, principally due to the review of the derogation on imports for personal use from other Member States. The amendment of the directive in question, which was referred to us at the same time, effectively envisages gradual liberalisation from the 15 litres currently allowed up to 64 litres in 2003, and then, as of 1 January 2004, the general regulations will come into force. This represents definite progress in relation to the current situation which may continue until 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a great deal of controversy in committee regarding the problem of alcoholism. I still claim that the problem of alcoholism, especially the Scandinavian style of consuming alcohol for the purpose of getting drunk, cannot be solved by excessive taxation, quite the contrary, because it makes alcohol a luxury product, a sort of status symbol. I therefore dare to recommend that Finland take advantage of this new derogation period in order to reduce its high rates of taxation, particularly on alcoholic drinks such as beer and wine. </p>
<p class="contents">The real alcoholism and health problems which result can only be combated by information and education. High taxes do not stop serious drinkers from drinking, they just penalise the great majority that consume beer, wine and other alcoholic beverages in moderation, which is very well known and scientifically proven to have beneficial effects for health and for the prevention of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular illness. Let us put an end to hypocrisy, and let us give up on solutions that do not work. </p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, we all know that we cannot, and do not, wish to challenge the prerogative of Member States, in matters of fiscal policy, to set their own excise duty rates as they see fit. We at least hope, though, that Finland may be persuaded that reducing the gaps between its own excise duties and those implemented by the other Member States and neighbouring third countries would be the best means of preventing an increase in the cross-border trade which presents a problem, and that such a policy would have much more chance of success than maintaining and intensifying restrictions on quantities.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I deplore the Commission’s reticence on this subject, especially given that you use Article 93 of the Treaty as a legal basis, and this deals specifically with the harmonisation of indirect duties and taxes. Make of it what you will! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, for once we have a report to discuss that is guaranteed to interest consumers, at least in my home country of Finland. Before we joined the European Union we Finns were promised that the EU would mean a more open policy on alcohol, that it would bring down the astronomically high prices of alcoholic beverages due to heavy taxation and that it would free up the retail market as well as break up the state monopoly on alcohol. I quite agree with what Mrs Lulling said, that the alcohol problem cannot be resolved by restricting imports, nor can it be resolved by keeping prices high and the sale of alcohol in the hands of a monopoly. Consumers have had to wait for reforms as regards the policy on alcohol, on account of the fact that the long transition periods and the various restrictions on imports have blocked healthy competition. The report we now have to discuss is a giant step forward in the gradual opening up of the Finnish markets.</p>
<p class="contents">As a counterbalance to the opening up to EU imports, Finland, however, is asking for the right to reduce quotas on beer imported from non-member countries. This restriction that is being sought is, in itself, justifiable, as long as the restriction is not a permanent one. Also in connection with non-member countries, Finland must, in a determined manner, approach a situation where the market is as open as in other Member States. The restrictions with regard to non-member countries should be lifted by the end of 2003, as the faster Finland is obligated to open up her market entirely, the more likely we will be able to see a real solution to the question of excise duty. This is what everything hinges on at the end of the day. Obviously, lifting the restrictions by the end of 2003 on imports from Estonia and Russia, for example, would, at present gross price levels, lead to an undesirable situation. Opening up the market in respect of non-member countries more rapidly than scheduled, however, will increase pressure to lower taxes, and the faster taxation reaches a European average, the healthier the situation in the internal market will be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Färm (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Madam President, Finland’s special regulations governing beer imports are naturally of great importance both for public health and for commerce. The problem is, of course, much more acute because of our proximity to third countries, that is to say Russia and Estonia. Clearly, special rules are also required when it comes to customs relations with these third countries. </p>
<p class="contents">As we saw in the previous debate on Swedish alcohol policy, Finland, like Sweden and Norway, has a quite distinctive policy in this area, based partly on high taxes in the belief that high consumer prices will also lead to reduced consumption. The fact is that, in Finland too, this policy has proved to be successful when it comes to combating the harm caused by alcohol. In spite of the special pattern of consumption traditionally to be found in countries like Finland and Sweden and in spite of there being a good deal of smuggling and illicit distilling, the relatively low overall level of alcohol consumption does in fact lead to less harm and lower social costs as a result of alcohol. Where this is concerned, I do in fact believe that there is convincing proof that the rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, is wrong when she states that high taxes do not lead to reduced consumption or that a restrictive policy would not be effective. On the contrary, there is a good deal of research to show that it is in fact effective. It is also now the case that the UN, for example, is recommending an alcohol policy based on the Scandinavian experience and is recommending other European countries too to go down the same road. However, this more restrictive policy is naturally more difficult to implement without the protection of import restrictions. That is the reason why Finland, in common with Sweden, has requested until the year 2003 to increase the quantities of beer imported from within the EU. Quite simply, time is needed to prepare the new alcohol policy and incorporate new features which may reduce the possible risks involved in abolishing import restrictions. </p>
<p class="contents">For Finland, the problems it shares with Sweden are exacerbated by its proximity to non-EU neighbours, especially Russia and Estonia, for these countries have quite different cost levels and quite different levels of prices and taxes than is the norm within the European Union. The proximity of southern Finland to Estonia and the enormous differences in prices and taxes have led to a situation in which Finland and the European Commission wish to retain the restrictions in connection with these countries for a further two years, that is to say until the year 2005, which I in actual fact think is reasonable. However, the rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, felt unable to accept this and is instead demanding that the same time limit apply in regard to third countries as applies to the internal market. Happily, the Committee nonetheless elected to follow the line taken by myself, the Finnish Government and the Commission who considered that these big differences in price and tax levels do in fact justify an additional two-year period of adjustment, as long as Estonia does not become a member of the EU before this period expires for, if it did, then it may only be right that the EU’s rules should also apply to Estonia. Of course, the risks concerned relate, above all, to public health problems but also to problems involving the national production and sale of beer in border areas. </p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lulling has, above all, chosen to use her report to argue the case for reduced taxes on alcohol in Finland. I agree that high taxes are likely to be difficult to maintain in the longer term when more and more people are crossing borders and have the opportunity to import alcohol on a private basis. As Commissioner Bolkestein noted earlier, it is, however, in spite of everything, an important principle that this type of tax is an issue for individual nation States and <span class="italic">not</span> a subject for formal harmonisation in the context of the internal market. </p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, it will now probably become necessary for the Finnish Government to begin adjusting tax levels downwards so as to avoid major problems when the restrictions on private imports of beer are gradually reduced to that level which is to apply to the rest of the internal market. </p>
<p class="contents">It is nonetheless a little sad that the rapporteur, who is of course a well-known champion of the interests of wine producers, does not take the public health problems at all seriously but, unlike Mr Maaten (the rapporteur on the issue of Sweden’s restrictions on alcohol), only sees this as a tax problem and as a problem concerning the internal market, for it is in fact obvious that low-price imports into Finland from Estonia and Russia have already led to undeniable social and public health problems. It is therefore gratifying that the forthcoming presidencies will – as I understand it, during the coming year – in actual fact be taking up this issue in terms of public health initiatives concerning the role of alcohol. However, a whole range of new methods will certainly be required.

These include regulations on the importation of beer. As representative of the ELDR Group, I wish to defend the abolition of competition distortion as well as the principle of free trade, which, however, must benefit the public.</p>
<p class="contents">I would approach the problem, however, from the angle of the principle of subsidiarity. For a very long time in Finland, there has been a successful social policy in force where the aim has been to restrict alcohol consumption. All the statistics relating to alcohol consumption speak in favour of continuing with this policy. On the other hand, I will admit that consumption is not evenly spread. In Finland there are groups of alcohol abusers, such as the young, for example. It is alcohol consumption among these groups that we aim to influence. One reason for keeping stringent restrictions on imports is, for example, the matter of public order.</p>
<p class="contents">An essential part of health policy has been high taxation and, at the same time, well-maintained border controls. Finland’s geographical position is very different from all the other EU countries. Beyond our frontiers are countries where prices are low. If, for example, the general EUR 175 tax-free import limit were applied on imports from these countries, permitted imports would double in terms of litres. That is why Finland needs an independent mechanism regarding what it itself perceives as reasonable import restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this matter it is necessary to advance in stages towards lower taxation on alcohol and a gradual liberalisation of imports, but let us respect the conditions that now prevail in the Member State as it itself sees them. Finland believes it justifiable to have a two-year extension to the restriction on imports from non-member countries. We cannot therefore support the amendments that were reintroduced in plenary after having been voted down once in committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is an initial point which needs to be cleared up: it is true that the free movement of goods and products within Community countries seriously hampers the creation of the single market. And it makes no difference whether the products in question are beer, as in this case, or other products. The discrimination between consumers who are citizens of other countries and Finnish consumers is clear and self-justifying. The discrepancy between the restrictions imposed by countries such as Finland on importing beer for personal use and Community standards<span class="bold"> </span>must therefore be eliminated, and eliminated immediately. There are no grounds for setting the deadline stipulated of 2003, and there are even less grounds for setting the deadline of 2005 for importing for personal use from third countries. On this point, we Radicals will support the amendments tabled by Mrs Lulling.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither are we convinced, Madam President, by the social or health reasons put forward in support of the derogation. The bans, the high level of taxes and the public monopolies, which are as unacceptable as all other monopolies, generate smuggling and unlawful activities even though they might benefit the Treasury. In the long term – and there is not even any need to cite the case of prohibition of alcohol in the United States, last century – they harm society and health rather than generating awareness in the consumer. Information on smuggling in the Scandinavian countries of products which are in themselves harmless, such as beer or wine, must serve as a warning against political prohibition of alcohol, and against prohibition of other products as well, rather than being an example which some have maintained should be followed by the other countries of the European Union. And that is not to mention the serious harm to individual freedom caused by all paternalistic excesses, whether they are engaged in by States or politicians.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The derogation has been restricted in terms of time, and I thus support the Commission’s line here. Finland’s alcohol policy has been a valid one, and we see evidence of this that goes unchallenged anywhere in the world. Our problem is the enormous difference in taxation. Hardly anywhere else does such a huge difference exist as is the case on the eastern border of our country. The reason is obvious if you think about it for a moment. A whole state collapsed over there and, at the same time, the price of vodka and beer likewise collapsed. That is what happened over there, and we will not get carried away in the flood, whatever you tell us. The cost of alcohol fell. Besides, they concoct alcoholic beverages over there by mixing tap water and home-made spirits. That makes for a pretty powerful brew. You can buy that virtually for the price of the bottle alone. What production could be so cheap that you could compete with that? Besides, who will be bothered by this restriction on imports from the east? It will not bother anyone, at least not the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">It is being said here that taxation cannot reduce the consumption of alcohol. What sort of experience have you had in this regard? Because we do have experience of it. The first thing that the poor cut back on if prices rise is alcohol consumption. There is research data on that. Then you say that education helps. I happen to come from a region where such education has been provided. What happened? Vodka continues to be drunk as before, and on top of that there is wine. In other words, total consumption is increasing. And we still have an additional problem. We have high taxation, which I used to be in favour of. If private citizens are allowed to bring in more foreign beer, tax revenue will fall. Then we would be obligated to lower taxation in our own country with a consequent decrease in tax revenue, but in either case the consumption of alcohol will increase. In other words, there is quite a significant double-edged problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard a gradual switch as being the correct approach and one where consideration is given to our country’s levels of taxation. Excise duty on beer is very high in our country but, ladies and gentlemen, what we cannot eliminate is the price gap that exists between us and our neighbour to the east. Our resources are insufficient for that. This gap is so great that, as a result – as Mr Pesälä said – our special position is quite important for us. And if it is removed, I will just say that our roads to the east will be soaked in vodka if all import restrictions are lifted. That is the issue here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is also obvious that this is mainly a fiscal problem. To my fellow MEP, Ms Kauppi, I would say that it is quite right to identify matters of concern to liberals here, but what has Ms Kauppi’s party colleague, Finland’s finance minister, done to try to adapt conditions in Finland to take account of this or other tax issues? It is, as has been said, in actual fact a fiscal problem. </p>
<p class="contents">I have referred in part to points of order. I am very disappointed that the Court of Justice of the European Communities considered that a discriminatory time limit could be introduced for citizens from third countries. My party, the Swedish People’s Party, was against this, but was unfortunately forced to give in when the Court in Luxembourg made its decision. </p>
<p class="contents">It is worth noting that, unlike a number of Swedish colleagues, the Finns were no doubt aware that our derogation for other alcoholic drinks from EU countries was a temporary derogation. For my part, I nonetheless support the Commission’s proposal whereby the year 2006 would be the time limit where imports of beer were concerned. I am also concerned that we should not relinquish future opportunities for transitional regulations in the negotiations with Estonia. The Committee has introduced an addendum concerning Estonia, among other countries. We have a similar problem in many border regions, and I would refer in this regard to Mr Paasilinna’s intervention. It is a question of not making a hasty decision. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also refer to the difficult situation where competition between transport operators in the Baltic is concerned. The situation is very unequal, and there is a risk of its deteriorating further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is being done by 2004, according to the deadline fixed in respect of the Internal Market. In asking for extra time for harmonising exports from non-member countries, however, Finland has been keen to ensure that imports from the Internal Market, considered a priority, are harmonised in a controlled way. The European Court of Justice and the Commission accept this order of priorities, and I thus hope for understanding on the part of Parliament as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the picture created in Mrs Lulling’s report of the situation in Finland is a false one. Commissioner, you can surely ascertain that from what we Finns have been saying here in our speeches. The essential problem regarding imports from non-member countries is that an EU-wide restriction on imports has been imposed on strong alcoholic beverages and wines among products liable to excise duty, but, for some reason or other, there is no such restriction on beer. Therefore, as regards the importation of beer, the general euro limit has to be observed, which is products to the value of EUR 175. At Russian prices, as we have heard, this means more than 200 litres of the best European beer. That is double what a citizen of the EU can bring in from another EU country. At what limit the importation of beer from non-member countries should be set is not as important as attending to the issue of imports from non-member countries according to a timetable only after the Internal Market has started functioning. The border between Finland and Russia is quite exceptional in the EU. I would point out that no other EU country faces such a wide price differential on its borders as Finland – and the problems resulting from this price differential will not be resolved at any level of excise duty.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent information, for example from research carried out in France, shows that alcohol causes serious public health problems in all EU countries. I also understand that Sweden and France are planning an EU policy, when they hold the presidency, aiming at preventing health problems caused by alcohol throughout the EU. Knowing the high social costs of alcohol-related problems, the harmonisation of excise duty should preferably come about at the average rate for Europe, not its lowest. Excise duty is not fiscal in nature, simply a policy to provide revenue for the state, but clearly it is an instrument which will lead to healthier lifestyles, aided by a market economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Finland has also agreed to gradually increase the quantities of beer which travellers coming from other Member States can bring into that country without paying excise duties. In this way, Finland is bracing itself for 2004 when travellers will be able to bring alcoholic beverages for their own use from other Member States for free, in line with the internal market principles. </p>
<p class="contents">Despite the large number of amendments tabled, I am delighted that Mrs Lulling’s report largely supports the Commission proposals. Although the Commission very much understands the motives behind the tabled amendments, it is unable to accept them. A number of these amendments concern the level of the tariffs applied by Finland. As I explained earlier this evening, as Community legislation stands at present, stipulating only minimum excise tariffs, it is up to Finland – and Finland alone – to decide whether the adaptation of its alcohol policy should also entail a reduction in the tax level. In any event, the Commission will be dealing with the level of tariffs in its wider context in a report which will be presented either at the end of this year or the beginning of next year. That report will also take into account the Treaty’s general objectives, such as health policy. </p>
<p class="contents">Neither is it necessary in this proposal to draw attention to the fact that Finland has so far failed to fulfil its obligation to liberalise the intra-Community restrictions in stages. This obligation is already embodied in the existing text of the directive, and the Commission has reminded Finland of this obligation in its general report of 24 May last on the application of the restrictions in the Scandinavian Member States, a copy of which has also been sent to the European Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the restrictions on imports from third countries, I would like to note that it is the first time that Finland is requesting a derogation. Before, these restrictions were automatically incorporated into the restrictions within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the situation in Estonia, I would point out that the excise tariffs which apply to beer in that country are already somewhat higher than the minimum tariffs laid down in Community law. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the proposed date of implementation, i.e. 1 April of this year, will have to be changed by the Council upon receipt of the recommendations from Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee. This change will not require a change in the proposal. The new date will most likely be 1 July of this year. </p>

<p class="contents">If the policy of high excise duties, at 17 times higher than the Community minimum for beer, had indeed been successful, then what need would there be to request further restrictions? It has been clearly demonstrated that this policy is not successful. Why else would Finland be complaining about the increasing amounts imported from Russia and Estonia in spite of the exorbitant excise duties. So I would advise Mr Färm, who has unfortunately left the building, to check back over his reasoning and try to come up with something better, since he is subject to rather a lot of contradictions. He even suggested that I had reduced excise duties. That would be a fine thing, if only I could.</p>

<p class="contents">I have the right to reply, and I shall finish soon.</p>
<p class="contents">As I was saying, I mean to make the most of my right to speak. Mr Färm also criticised me for defending wine producers. I am proud that I did though! Must I remind you that wine is an agricultural product and a foodstuff which, consumed in moderation, has therapeutic and preventative properties, and I would like to see those citizens that get drunk on beer and vodka on Friday and Saturday drinking a couple of glasses of wine every day instead. It would be much better for their health. I should like to see these citizens in a position to purchase these two glasses of wine, for this is not possible due to the excessive excise duties applied by this country. It would even be good for the social security department in Finland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
