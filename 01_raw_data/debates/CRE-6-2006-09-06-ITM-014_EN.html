The PSE Group also believes that there are a number of factual errors in the report which could only be corrected via a huge number of amendments. However, we are of the opinion that such an important report from the Committee on Foreign Affairs concerning a global power like China needs to be re-examined and re-discussed in detail. This is because the report contains 125 recitals and paragraphs, of which only two paragraphs are on EU-China cooperation. Just 13 paragraphs concern foreign policy, while some of the EU’s basic principles of the last 30 years are ignored. Global security and energy issues are barely mentioned, and therefore we need to bring balance into this report.</p>
<p class="contents">We urge the House to refer this report back to committee, where we will have sufficient time to address these extremely important issues as regards EU-China cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently doing a tremendous job in dealing with EU-China relations in more than 20 different policy fields, including foreign policy, global security issues and energy issues. We need to act together to define a coherent position based on facts and clear information from the relevant departments in the Commission and the Council. Parliament’s position will be greatly strengthened and we will be more influential in achieving our common goals if we give ourselves some extra time to prepare and reflect on this report again.</p>

These are not, therefore, even at issue today.

<p class="contents">By choosing to debate the report, we will thus be able to reach a comprehensive agreement, a sign that tensions are easing and that attention is also being paid to the requests made by the PSE Group.

The present report offers Brussels and Beijing benchmarks for all facets of mutual relations: credibility, stability and responsibility. </p>
<p class="contents">As a European rapporteur, I saw it as being of the utmost importance that I should listen very carefully to the Chinese discussions about the impressive peaceful development of the People’s Republic over the past three decades. These also spelled out the dark sides, with all the implications that these entail for the EU-China partnership. It is only logical that these should also be included in the draft resolution. A large majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs endorses this specific approach on account of its indispensable and valuable contribution, for which I extend warm thanks to the Members concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The public responses from the Chinese Embassy in Brussels during the various stages of my report oblige me to give you my position, in summary, in three key areas: the Ankang system, freedom of religion in the People’s Republic and the issue of a peaceful annexation of Taiwan to China. </p>
<p class="contents">In a letter of 25 April, the Chinese Embassy flatly denied that political and social dissidents were subjected to compulsory psychiatric treatment. This abhorrent torture method is officially known as Ankang, which translates as: health through rest and peace. </p>
<p class="contents">As it happens, the 3 November 2005 issue of the German weekly <span class="italic">Die Zeit</span> included eyewitness testimonies of three victims of this Ankang system under the revealing title ‘Electric shocks against the freedom virus’. On 14 December 2005, the <span class="italic">Neuzüricher Zeitung</span> published an equally damning article on Ankang. Disregarding these, the Chinese Embassy advised this House to delete Paragraph 24 of the draft resolution on Ankang as being completely unfounded, and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, acting as if there were nothing wrong, tabled an amendment to that effect. I asked the Committee on Foreign Affairs to withdraw the amendment on two occasions, but to no avail. </p>
<p class="contents">The Ankang system is completely at odds with the basic human rights that surely all of us warmly support, as I heard Mrs De Keyser say only a moment ago. I am therefore completely perplexed by her attitude. I would urge you to remove this blot on Parliament’s escutcheon, and support the original text on Ankang which I am re-tabling as an amendment. </p>
<p class="contents">We already know enough about the many violations of the basic fundamental right of freedom of religion in China. This applies just as much to critical internal discussions about this government action, even down to the offices of the state bureau of religious affairs. I would have really enjoyed talking to those officials who were so approachable during my visit to this state institution last autumn. </p>
<p class="contents">According to the Chinese mission to the European Union in its 31 August news bulletin, the Chinese people enjoy extensive freedom of religion. I would hereby invite it publicly to translate and publish the recent interview with China’s ‘religious big boss’ to clarify just what control the party exercises, for what is positive and negative in religions is to be assessed by the Chinese Communist Party and nobody else. </p>
<p class="contents">The overwhelming majority of the Taiwanese people do not in any event wish to be subject to the same control. This is what I heard from European diplomats on the ground and from many Taiwanese citizens themselves. One of them explained why Beijing’s doctrine of peaceful reunification, certainly the ominous one-child policy, which is the PSE's key issue, does not have a chance in hell at the moment with those people: ‘It is not so much about ideology or nationalism as it is about the difference in political system and in respecting all human rights as a way of life. This does not stand a chance as long as China does not abandon its authoritarian regime, which is not likely to happen in the foreseeable future’. </p>
<p class="contents">I assume this adequately addresses the socialist amendments, which, moreover, curiously deviate from the officialise used in EU documents, raise the subject of two systems with regard to China and Taiwan. That is rather revealing.</p>
<p class="contents">This report represents Parliament’s commitment to a solid partnership between the European Union and China. That is why it is honest in listing the obstacles in this political pursuit, certainly now that these are being recognised just as much on the Chinese side – I invite you to read the report which contains statements by the Chinese, not least by Chinese academics – but which, politically, are not at all sufficiently recognised as obstacles and eliminated as a result. </p>
<p class="contents">The message we must send to the Council and Commission on the eve of the summit with the Chinese leaders is that China needs to be helped to establish the rule of law and to be encouraged to carry out political modernisation as the necessary social parallel of its astonishing economic development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Benita Ferrero-Waldner, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, let me begin by welcoming this debate. I thank the honourable Members and the rapporteur in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a few strategic remarks at the outset. As you will be aware, the ninth EU-China Summit will take place in Helsinki in just three days’ time. It will be a very important opportunity to discuss current issues and concerns at the highest level. However, I should also like to focus my contribution today – particularly in the light of the focus of your report – on how we can bring a more strategic approach to our relations. I may then add a few words on some specific items.</p>
<p class="contents">Our relationship with China is one of the key issues facing the European Union today and one that is constantly on my mind. This is true across the board, whether on environment and climate change, energy security, non-proliferation, global and regional security, economic and trade relations and specific issues such as illegal migration. There are also all the issues relating to the rule of law that you have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know the key challenges. Firstly, China’s economic growth has been phenomenal, but, at the same time, it is still a developing country and more fragile than we might think. To be sustainable, economic growth must be accompanied by social and political reform. Secondly, China has a vital role to play in creating more stable international energy markets and dealing with environmental challenges. Thirdly, accelerating globalisation – which is increasingly identified in the public mind with cheap production in China – is an issue and is leading to pressure for protectionism in developed markets, which both the European Union and China need to work to avoid. Fourthly, China, like the European Union, wields global influence. Will this support or hinder a rules-based multilateral world order? Put simply, the question facing us is how we should respond to the rising superpower with whom we certainly share interests and common ground, but – and let us be realistic here – with whom we also disagree as regards some very fundamental values and beliefs.</p>
<p class="contents">Before suggesting some principles that should guide our strategic response to this challenge, I should reiterate that the basic premise for the EU’s policy towards China must be one of engagement and partnership. There is no suggestion of containment or of hedging our options. Engagement and partnership are the most effective basis for encouraging and supporting China’s development in a way that meets the aims and interests of both the EU and China.</p>
<p class="contents">What principles should guide us? In terms of China’s internal reform and development we must be constructive and we must complement Chinese policy where possible. However, the European Union must also send firm and very consistent messages on our areas of interest, such as the need for social and political reform to ensure China’s sustainability, the importance of international non-proliferation regimes, and immediate market access and a level playing field for EU companies. Secondly, internationally, the European Union has an interest in encouraging more active and responsible international engagement by China. We need to enhance our understanding of Chinese foreign policy if we want to work together effectively. We should emphasise the regional component, increasing our awareness and sensitivity as regards regional issues and encouraging regional integration and greater multilateralism in Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the European Union needs greater focus and coherence internally. Before exploring new areas, there should be a full internal review of our existing cooperation, leading to a clearer focus on priorities and, as necessary, moving on from areas which are ineffective or are no longer priorities. Our aim should be a holistic approach, with the European Union as a whole speaking again with one voice on its China policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we should also work to ensure that our bilateral relations are strengthened by embracing all constituents of societies. Parliament will also have a very important role to play in this context. We need a long-term programme to promote mutual understanding and an effective strategic policy mechanism that is sufficiently informal and flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, throughout this process, the European Union should be aware of its strengths. There is particular EU expertise on a range of issues relating to internal stability where China wants help, for instance on energy, the environment, regional integration and public health, and we should exploit this as fully as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, there are other areas in which we have less leverage. I know the human rights situation in China is of particular concern to Parliament, as it is to the Commission. The past year has not been seen as a year of significant progress on any of the areas in which we are particularly interested, such as the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the release of the 1989 prisoners, the abolition of reform through labour and greater protection for freedom of expression and of religion, where we continue to have real concerns. But I can assure you, honourable Members, that these issues will remain a central part of our policy agenda and we will continue to engage and to push for progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is taking steps to turn these principles into reality. We will, as the report requests, set out a new strategic vision for our policy towards China, which we will be in a position to present formally to the Council and Parliament in November. I look forward to assessing the situation for myself during my trip to China early next month.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to our continued support for China’s internal reform process, I think we should also focus on four basic priorities: first, we need a greater balance in our bilateral relations, whether described as reciprocity, equality or mutual benefit. That includes a more meaningful dialogue on human rights and related issues. Questions such as progress on social and economic rights would be included there. We are worried by the situation on civil and political rights in China, and in particular, as has been mentioned, as regards freedom of expression, religion and association and the protection of the rights of minorities. We are, in that context, concerned that internet use is being more and more restricted and controlled. As I heard the rapporteur say, we attach great importance to the issue of organ harvesting. It is clear that the legislation on that issue recently adopted by the Chinese Government does not adequately address the issue of donor consent, particularly for those who have died in custody or who have been executed. We have made our concerns known very clearly to the Chinese Government, both through our human rights dialogue and wider political channels, urging it, in quite strong terms, to take measures to address these concerns as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to make China a responsible member of the international community, but more than just a stakeholder, it needs to be a positive and active contributor. On trade issues, if EU markets are to remain open, we have to see to it that we need a genuine, bilateral and multilateral response from China implementing the letter and spirit of the WTO commitments. We need to overhaul the management structures for our relationship to avoid fragmentation and to ensure our allocation of resources on China is appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much to be done in defining a realistic but also an ambitious strategic vision for moving EU-China relations forward. We should not ignore the difficulties involved in achieving this – and I do not think we are ignoring them. But let me reiterate that it is crucially important that we get the relations right. Both sides want a genuine strategic partnership that merits its name. It is our responsibility to translate this political desire into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we have a good basis on which to move forward and, as we do so, I hope we can count on your support, because it is too important an issue for us not to succeed.</p>

<p class="contents">As was mentioned previously, the forthcoming summit between the EU and China takes places on 9 September, with the Prime Minister, with Foreign Ministers, and with Ministers for Reform, Planning and Trade. On 12 September, also in Helsinki, there will be a high-level Chinese-European economic forum. From the perspective of the world economy there are other important dates approaching, namely a new distribution of votes within the International Monetary Fund in favour of China and possibly to the disadvantage of Europe, and, at the end of September, new groupings and alliances will need to be formed in the Doha round in Australia.</p>
<p class="contents">As the draftsman of the opinion on this issue in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I will concentrate on economic and monetary policy perspectives. In 2005 the Chinese trade surplus was USD 102 billion; in 2006 it will be even greater, and by the end of 2006 China will have more than 1 000 billion USD in its currency reserves. Demands are being made from many quarters for a rapid change in the exchange rate, and in the medium term China prepared to listen to these demands. In view of the close interconnection of the financial markets, however, in my opinion I have argued in favour of a cautious change, because radical and swift measures could lead to incalculable consequences for the financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The International Monetary Fund must monitor such developments and take timely action where necessary. At the IMF’s forthcoming annual meeting, China is due to receive more weight in the Fund, and in this development it is getting strong support from the United States. One might ask the question why the USA, with its enormous budget deficit, is so keen to support China. Perhaps this is because China, as was noted previously, with its exchange rate policy and its high currency reserves, now has a say in matters affecting the US dollar.</p>
<p class="contents">How is this perceived in the Member States of the European Union, and what do the officials in the ECOFIN council have to say about this? The European Union is the most important trading partner for China, China is the second most important trading partner for the European Union. We therefore owe respect to the Chinese for the way in which they have partly fulfilled, and are trying to fulfil, the commitments they made when they joined the WTO, although there is still considerable room for improvement on copyright protection and especially on credit issues. The further opening of the banking and insurance markets, and the advances in the search for common standards, are visible steps forward.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of September it is hoped that talks in Australia will breathe new life into the Doha round. Here too the USA would be glad to see an increased Chinese influence. Which people will the European Union choose to accompany this process, in order to give the Chinese the feeling that Europe can work in partnership with China in developing common strategies? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a comprehensive report, it addresses all of the problems concerning relations between the European Union and China and it is based on the important debate that took place within the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for which I thank Mr Brok, who sought to thoroughly analyse the topic.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope for a broad consensus on this report, and so we call on the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to vote in favour, not least because we are committed to supporting the one-China policy, which underpins efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Taiwan question by means of constructive dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">The report certainly does not portray China as an enemy of Europe; quite the contrary. China is a very important partner in the sectors of trade and industry; many European companies find the kind of hospitality in China that allows them to discover new markets. However, if relations between the European Union and Beijing are to improve, and if both sides are to benefit in future, then definite rules must be set and must be complied with, just as there are fundamental human values, which, when they are violated, can make cooperation between the European Union and China a less positive prospect.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned about the undemocratic decisions made by the Chinese Communist party, the violation of human rights and trade union rights, the freedom of minorities, freedom of information and the Tibet question. The parliamentary group, which is following this problem closely and tabling and gaining approval for various amendments, has highlighted the issue of religious freedom: we are concerned about the Communist party’s appointing of bishops; it is like the Vatican appointing generals in the Chinese army; it is incomprehensible, and the freedom of so many Chinese citizens is being violated.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the matter of the rules concerning economic and trade relations; we call on the Council and the Commission to commit themselves to protecting businesses in Europe and in other countries bordering Europe, particularly in the textile and footwear sectors. Mr Mandelson has sent out certain signals, but we must continue undaunted with regard to the protection of human rights, as must the Finnish Presidency, which I regret is not present in this House. For all of these reasons, we shall vote in favour of the Belder report and shall endorse certain amendments that also relate to environmental issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We agree that China needs to shoulder a growing international responsibility because of its status as a permanent member of the Security Council and now as the world’s fourth largest economy. We agree with the importance of China’s role in Africa and the Middle East. We need to have a dialogue with China over the situation in North Korea, where it has been playing an important role chairing the six-party talks; over Iran, where China can play a role in trying to find a solution to the nuclear crisis; and over Darfur, where China, because of its oil interests, has to date been resisting the deployment of UN forces.</p>
<p class="contents">We look forward to the establishment of an EU-China strategic partnership and we certainly support the need for the abolition of the death penalty – something we urge in all countries, including Japan, the Republic of Korea and the United States. We need to see continued improvement in human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">However, unfortunately, in total, the report suffers from both a lack of balance and the sins of omission. I thought they were sins of omission, but in his opening speech Mr Belder has made it clear that the reason that the one-China policy is not in the report is not because he has forgotten, but he is actually in favour of changing it. I hope that those in the Christian Democrat Group who still support it will not go along with that, but will support our amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">We have two lines on the plight of 150 million migrant workers – more than 10% of China’s population, one sentence on free trade unions and yet there are five paragraphs on a religious minority that is a hundred times smaller. The trouble is that Mr Belder cannot see the wood for the trees.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, of course, we need to stand up for all the oppressed groups, but where is the rapporteur’s sense of proportion? Equally, it is right to believe some of the bad things we are told about China, but it is not right to believe <span class="italic">all</span> of them, without the evidence necessary. There are areas in which we tread very much on the Committee on International Trade’s territory, but the report takes a much more protectionist line than that committee’s recent report.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of market economy status is dismissed very easily, yet 40 countries in the world have already granted market economy status to China – most recently the Republic of Korea in November 2005. I respect the European Parliament’s view on the embargo, but here we are insisting that all our partnership countries follow an embargo that puts China in the same situation as Burma and Zimbabwe – which I consider personally to be rather worse in terms of their oppression and discrimination – while, at the same time, asking the Chinese to assist us in putting pressure on those two countries that we say are exactly the same as China.</p>
<p class="contents">In paragraph 4, we note that China will have at its disposal EUR 1 billion in farm reserves by the end of 2006. The accuracy of the report is fine; it is only one thousand times wrong: it is actually a trillion and not a billion and yet nobody has noticed; yet this is a wonderfully accurate report that everybody is endorsing.</p>
<p class="contents">Nowhere do we complain that China holds too few euros – rather than dollars – or say that China should continue to work with the European Union on the six-party talks. We do not mention the fact that China’s concern about the Yasukuni Shrine is reflected in the recently revealed fact that the Japanese Emperor refused to visit it once class-A war criminals were included there.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as the Commissioner said, we want engagement and partnership, not confrontation and containment. I am afraid the wrong message comes from this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU’s relations with China have, of course, become ever more extensive, and not only in terms of trade policy. It is therefore good that we should tackle these relations in a more strategic way.</p>
<p class="contents">China is a growing economy and an ever more important trading partner. We liberal democrats see trade as an important way in which countries can become closer to each other and have more contacts and forms of exchange. Trade also leads in the long term to increased openness, better regulations, less corruption and in time, we believe, to democracy. Trade has also led to economic growth, enabling millions of Chinese to raise themselves out of poverty and meaning that we can, of course, also discuss how the fruits of that growth are to be distributed.</p>
<p class="contents">China has growing ambitions on the international stage. That is good, but in that case it must also accept increased international responsibility and be a responsible partner. We believe that China can play an important role in relations with North Korea, but we cannot accept China making use of its UN veto to prevent global intervention designed to put an end to the genocide in Darfur or aimed at putting pressure on Iran to open up its nuclear power programme to international scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">Given its size, history and population, China has huge potential. At the same time, we have to recognise that China is also a dictatorship. We cannot accept thousands of people being put in prison for having different political views or for being of a different religion or from a different ethnic group. We cannot accept China’s censorship of the Internet, and we view with great concern the reports now coming from right around the world – and most recently from a respected institute in Canada – on trade in organs from, for example, Falun Gong sympathisers. We are also concerned about the threats directed against the Taiwanese democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We must never miss an opportunity to point out to Chinese politicians and companies that we condemn these breaches of human rights. At the same time, we must also be constructive in trying to help China travel the long road towards democracy. In the same way, all of us as politicians, entrepreneurs and consumers must demand that Chinese companies permit trade unions and allow their employees to enjoy security and fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">China is also an environmental time bomb, the environment being a huge potential area for cooperation between China and ourselves in the EU. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner talked of the need for a strategic partnership involving many practical elements. We welcome this and hope that the European Parliament can play a critical but also constructive role in this work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it would have been a mistake to refer this report back to committee and it would have sent out the wrong message, particularly given the importance attached to the sovereignty of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">China is clearly making great progress and modernisation is currently moving ahead, but we must bear in mind that the accelerated and rapid pace of that modernisation poses risks from the social and environmental points of view. In this regard, the European Union must contribute to the development of the positive aspects of this modernisation and not encourage the negative aspects or the risks attached to it.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore make our position very clear at a time when we are discussing European Union-China relations. Friends must speak clearly to each other; it is with friends that we must maintain good relations and also speak very honestly. In this case, I believe that we must do so while making the values that we consider to be fundamental to a good, fruitful relationship very clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of them have already been mentioned, but I would like to raise them again, in order to make it crystal clear that we are in favour of abolishing the death penalty and that we believe that to be a universal value, that we are in favour of democratisation and freedom of expression, including on the Internet, and of freedom to exercise one’s culture and religion, that we condemn systematic torture and the existence of re-education camps for prisoners and that we consider respect for the rights of people such as those of Tibet to be fundamental. We therefore call upon the Council to implement the applicable policy and to agree to sending a special envoy. With regard to the arms embargo, we have said many times that we cannot and will not accept any lifting of the arms embargo unless there is firstly a solution, a justification or a clear acceptance of responsibilities with regard to the events of Tiananmen Square; until that issue is cleared up, we cannot consider lifting the embargo.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the One-China policy, I agree that that must be the objective and that it provides a good framework for negotiating relations between China and Taiwan, but it must be between democratic entities. If that is not the case, of course, the One-China policy may have negative consequences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This mistake is made explicit in its point 75, which proposes that the European Union and the Member States be urged to establish a policy based on a consensus with the United States with a view to establishing a strategic relationship with China.</p>
<p class="contents">I would put the question: in what areas can a consensus be established with the United States? The death penalty? Respect for international law? The demilitarisation of security? Climate change? In other words, are we going to go hand in hand with the United States in establishing that consensual relationship – the European Union and the United States – so that we can tell the Chinese what to do in those areas?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that that would be a terrible mistake and moves in completely the wrong direction. Furthermore, the report also proposes telling the Chinese – the Chinese Government, the Chinese authorities – what policy they must implement in their region, with which countries – with North Korea, with Iran – and on the basis of what principles. As if the People’s Republic of China can be told what to do and as if they will accept being told what to do. As if the People’s Republic of China could tell the European Union what kind of relations and what kind of policy we should implement here.</p>
<p class="contents">That cannot be taken seriously. We must bear in mind which country we are talking about. We are talking about a country with 1.2 billion inhabitants, of 9.5 million square kilometres, and one which in 1910 was still a feudal society. Unless we consider this report within the correct context, we will be lashing out in the dark. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I also believe that this report oozes purely economic interests. Nothing more. The rest is nothing but fine words.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group is therefore going to vote against this report tomorrow, because I believe that it moves in the wrong direction. When trying to influence the People’s Republic of China, we must do so on the basis of a clearly autonomous European Union, not on the basis of a link between the European Union and the United States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is no secret that China refuses to engage in direct dialogue with the democratically elected government of Taiwan. The European Union therefore ought to urge China to maintain an atmosphere of mutual trust with Taiwan, and to employ peaceful means in developing relations to achieve stability throughout the region. China’s actions in restricting Taiwan’s participation in international processes cannot be endorsed. China must respect the fundamental human rights and freedom to make political choices of Taiwan’s 23 million inhabitants. We should condemn the fact that the Chinese law legitimising the possible occupation of Taiwan hangs over Taiwan like a sword of Damocles. Ladies and gentlemen, in my view, in the concept of ‘one China’ the idea of peaceful reunification should be replaced with something that is more applicable – a peaceful solution. The deployment of approximately 800 guided and other types of missile on China’s southern coast, opposite the Taiwan Strait, must be significantly reduced. This is threatening and stressful for the inhabitants of Taiwan. It results in the need for counter-measures to build up arms in Taiwan, taking significant resources away from the needs of the economy and society. The European Union’s arms embargo ought to be maintained. To lift it would be misinterpreted as encouragement for further increases in China’s military might. That might seriously affect stability in the Asian region and lead to the escalation of expenditure on weapons. A lifting of the arms embargo would not foster the desired democratisation of China. The impetus for the one-party regime to end the significant human rights violations that we have seen for so long would disappear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mao’s legacy of murder, oppression, suffering, misery, starvation and death is in a league of its own. He brought China to its knees. His instrument for enforcing this tyranny was, of course, the Chinese Communist Party, which still governs China. The recognition by Mao’s successor Deng Xiao Ping and his successors of some capitalist and free market realities has enabled China to progress economically to the point it has reached today.</p>
<p class="contents">However, at the heart of the Chinese economic phenomenon lies an unresolved contradiction: China’s new-found prosperity is based on capitalist principles applied by the Chinese Communist Party, which is the only political party in China. We have the curious spectacle of a communist party that no longer believes in communism applying capitalist ideas that it is not supposed to believe in. Its only real belief is in ensuring its own survival, and the European Union should not assist it in that aim by lending the kind of support that we have already seen.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress in China will inevitably be limited to the economic sphere for as long as the Chinese Communist Party retains power. Progress will not extend to freedom of association, freedom of speech and democracy. The Chinese people are at long last beginning to reap some of the material benefits of the capitalist system. But when are they going to reap the benefits of the Western democratic system? Mr Belder’s report rightly calls for political pluralism, an independent judiciary and for the EU not to lift its arms embargo until China properly addresses the situation regarding human rights and civil and political freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Belder calls for a consistent and coherent policy towards China. Such a coherent policy should promote the interests of the Chinese people, but not the interests of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, we should not lift the arms embargo and we should continue to recognise Taiwan as an independent democratic State.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I have to say that this report should be rejected because it advocates the further development of an EU strategy regarding relations with China. That would be bad for the Chinese people. It would also restrict the political and economic decisions of the United Kingdom and would dilute its influence and priorities. In the long run, that would also be bad for the Chinese people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The individual speakers, the report itself, as well as all those taking the floor here have stressed how important relations with China are to the future of the European Union. However, we also agree that these relations are fundamentally different. Our approach has to be different, in discussions on this issue, from our relations with another large country of the region such as India.</p>
<p class="contents">When discussing China, we should always bear in mind the foundations on which this House, and the entire European Union, are built. Therefore, our priority is to promote, foster and create conditions allowing people to live in democratic conditions, without fear of repression and without acts which are part of the daily life in China.</p>
<p class="contents">In debating this report, which is, on the whole, correct – and I hope that all amendments, and all elements relating to human and citizens’ rights will be adopted by this House – we should remember that repression of religious communities – and that includes all, from the Catholic Church to religious movements such as Falun Gong, which are being oppressed in a quite shocking manner – as well as repression of fundamental human rights is not a thing of the past in China, and continue on a daily basis. Forced sterilisation and forced abortions continue to be practiced. The repression of national groups, as is the case in Tibet at the moment, is also still not a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to draw attention to all of this in our report, as it is extremely important that both the European Parliament and the whole European Union do not simply focus on economic statistics and on trade in their relations with China, but that they also focus on the ideals that the European Union does and should promote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must not sacrifice our convictions for the sake of economic or political considerations; rather, we must use plain language when speaking with our Chinese partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for the clear words which you have spoken in your opening speech, and I encourage you to make the same speech at the summit in Helsinki. If we are open and honest with each other, then we have a good chance of further developing the strategic partnership in a sensible way.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to make three further points. Like the Commission, we must continue to demand from the government of the People’s Republic of China that it implements the basic principles of fair world trade, now that it has joined the WTO. They cannot get away with the excuse that central government does not know what is happening in every province.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection of intellectual property must be enforced, and if the Chinese Government can enforce its political convictions in every prison, then it must also be able to implement the protection of intellectual property on every factory floor.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we call upon the National People’s Congress to finally ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They have signed it, but they are postponing the ratification. They return to this point in the discussions which we are always glad to have with them and they say that it is so difficult and that they have to prepare themselves first. No: they have signed, so they should ratify, and they should implement human rights. Implementation means, in practice: freedom of religion, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech. This must be guaranteed. There must also be cultural autonomy for Tibet.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that Mr Ford has understood things quite rightly: China must make the first move in changing the way it relates to its neighbours. It must also change its relations with its neighbours Japan and Taiwan. Indeed, as far as Taiwan is concerned, of course all of us in the House would like there to be a political dialogue between Peking and Taipei, but this must not occur in the form of threats. It is therefore completely nonsensical of the Socialists to have called – as they did recently – for the lifting of the arms embargo. You should instead get back to showing solidarity with the democrats in this House. As long as there are human rights violations in China, there should be no lifting of the embargo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the report were as balanced as your contribution tonight, Commissioner, I would wholeheartedly support it. However, throughout our discussions in the Foreign Affairs Committee, I have argued that the report was weak in the EU-China cooperation and foreign policy sections. For no reason that I can understand, the report does not take a position on the One-China policy or China’s role in the Security Council, and it does not take a balanced view on the Taiwan issue, the six-party talks, EU-China cooperation and global security issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The report singles out only one of the major partners for cooperation in dealing with China. Why? I, like the vast majority of people in Europe, believe that we should work together in cooperation with all our major partners, rather than with only one.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also factual errors in Mr Belder’s report, which is supported by the PPE-DE Group and other groups. I shall refer to just one example: in paragraph 24, Parliament invites the Commission to initiate a structured dialogue with its Chinese counterpart in the fields of employment and social affairs. Well, Mr Belder and colleagues from the PPE-DE and ALDE groups, either your homework has not been done properly, or we must congratulate the magical powers of the Commission, because two years ago it must have eaten some Chinese fortune cookie which said that in September 2006 Parliament would make such a call to initiate a structured dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that the Commission has been having structured dialogue on these issues and many other issues for years now. Our group’s suggestion, which was rejected, was to get the Commission to give us regular updates on the different sectoral dialogues, which now cover a wide range of areas from space technology to enterprise regulation, from environmental issues to education and the information society. Commissioner, the PSE Group would warmly welcome it if you were to give us those regular updates as regards your work in building structured dialogues with China.</p>
<p class="contents">My idea was that this report should be Parliament’s contribution to EU-China relations based on pragmatism, facts and respect for each other’s sensitivities, and aiming for the progressive deepening of the relationship between the two sides, which is rapidly maturing into a comprehensive strategic partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, Europe is engaged with China in cultural, economic and strategic terms. Correct me if I am wrong, but the big question is whether China will respond wholeheartedly in trying to understand and accept European values. Is there any way to find answers to these questions other than through constructive dialogue? My idea was that this report could contribute to a process in which both sides could understand one another better. This would be for our mutual benefit. Unfortunately, the report as it stands makes no such contribution. It greatly weakens Parliament’s position and influence in achieving our common goals, especially now with a view to the forthcoming summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur has worked very hard, and the report contains many valid points made or repeated by this House, but what is missing, in my opinion, is an assessment, a critical and constructive assessment of what the Commission is already doing in China at the moment. How critical are we about some of the things the Commission is doing over there? After all, it boasts a very extensive delegation over there, second only – or so I believe – to that for relations with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Where are we offering the Commission encouragement? For example, is there sufficient cooperation between China and the Commission in the area of regional policy, the development of China’s disadvantaged regions? We could teach them a thing or two in this respect. Are we working together sufficiently and could we not, for example, ask the Chinese Government to be a little more receptive to this?</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the kinds of things that are missing. There is insufficient scrutiny or critical and/or constructive analysis of the activities the Commission is engaged in. What suggestions are we putting forward for the Helsinki summit? My mixed feelings stem from the fact that those are not reflected anywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that you are facing the problems head-on. Since Members have already pointed them out, I will not dwell on the issues of human rights, trade union rights, the free expression of opinion and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not that enthralled by the way you are asking for EU-US consensus on China policy. That would make me very unhappy. In fact, we in our group have tabled amendments on this very subject, because there are differences between us, the European Union, and the United States, as to how to approach China. There are also different interests in play. We should not ask for consensus with the United States after all, for I think that would restrict us enormously in our policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, China is not just any old country. We can pretend that the Chinese only need us, but we should not labour under any misconceptions: we need the Chinese as well, both economically and strategically. Let there be no mistake about that, Commissioner. I assume that the one-China policy is a cornerstone of the stability which we would like to see across the whole of Asia, and that it is also a cornerstone and an elementary component in the EU’s policy in respect of China. I cannot find any extensive detail about this in this report. We are assuming all kinds of things, but we as Parliament should also confirm the one-China policy, because it is important for the sake of stability.</p>
<p class="contents">China needs us where the environment is concerned, for example. I think that that country could take on board a huge number of suggestions from us, including in the area of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as conditions for partnership are concerned, it has to be said that every day, some minister or other, commissioner of a region or a country, sets off for China in order to discuss this strategic partnership over there. We should therefore stop pretending that it does not exist and that we can simply prescribe whatever conditions we please. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission response to date has been to say that Europe simply has to move up the value-added chain; we simply have to diversify into higher-skilled, more specialised work. However, it is rather complacent and patronising to assume that Europe and the West can keep a monopoly on innovation and high-tech solutions, while China simply does the manufacturing. Chinese graduates are rightly, and to their credit, moving up the value-added chain and very soon we may need to face the possibility that there will be very little that Europe can produce which China cannot produce more efficiently. The old colonialist assumption that the EU and the industrialised countries will keep the leading edge in knowledge-intensive industries, while developing countries focus on lower-skilled sectors, is now open to huge debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Our response to the challenges posed by China needs to include a thorough-going reassessment of the assumptions that have underpinned international trade theory until now. Not for our own sake, necessarily, but certainly for the sake of many workers in developing countries, because the reality is that China’s deflationary pressure is already driving down wages right across the developing world, pushing global suppliers to reduce their workers’ rights and conditions in their bid to remain competitive at all costs, and forcing ILO conventions on freedom of association and bargaining on China is certainly part of the solution.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would also ask the Commission to look much more closely at some of its assumptions about the winners and losers from the globalisation process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, the rapporteur was aiming for the broadest and most detailed overview of EU-China relations, yet I believe that there are two areas on which we need to focus particular attention in the future. The rapporteur stresses on a number of occasions in the report that the growing importance of the People’s Republic of China in world politics, together with its growing importance as a global economic superpower, bring greater international responsibilities. Against this backdrop, I should like to highlight two issues that strike me as highly important. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there are issues relating to environmental protection. Representatives from the People’s Republic of China are aware of this important issue, but are held back by the costs associated with more environmentally-friendly forms of production and consumption. I believe that the EU should be much more proactive on this issue than it has been so far. Perhaps protecting the environment and green technology could be future areas in which EU businesses can invest in China.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue which is mentioned in the report, and which I feel should become a major topic of negotiation with representatives from the People's Republic of China – but also an area in which Europe should share experiences – is that of health protection in the work place, social support, social dialogue, the prevention of child labour and ensuring basic rights for workers. Let us lend a helping hand and contribute towards finding solutions to these complex problems that will above all lead to raising the standards of those who are most directly involved in the Chinese miracle.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore becoming crucial to clarify the relations that exist between our continent and China, so as to do the best possible job of tackling future global challenges, even though I believe that there are still too many critical points to be highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite being part of the WTO, China has often shown that it does not observe the rules shared by its other trading partners. As we have denounced all too often up to now, China is placing goods on the European markets that are counterfeit or that do not comply with EU legislation, with quality and safety standards. China does not adequately comply with the TRIPS agreements on the protection of intellectual property rights and inventions and does not help its foreign partners to access its markets. The trade agreements on footwear, textiles and clothing must also be reviewed with the utmost urgency, as unacceptable imbalances still exist.</p>
<p class="contents">What are even more worrying are the problems relating to human rights and, more specifically, the rights of women and children; the absence in many cases of minimum health and safety standards in the workplace; and even the existence of labour camps. These are unfortunately all prominent issues, but it is time to identify the solutions and, above all, the specific means for more incisively tackling the unfair competition and the social and environmental dumping practised by China.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, it is worth hoping that the Finnish Presidency can finally take upon itself the role of champion of the real interests of European citizens, consumers and producers, and that includes during the forthcoming EU-China summit being held in a few days’ time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, for some Members, the interests of international communism take precedence over European values! </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(PL)</span> Mr President, it is a good thing that the European Parliament is debating the issue of EU – China relations. China is the second largest world power in the world and is neither a democracy nor has a market economy. By 2010, China wants to create the world’s most powerful economic block, together with the ASEAN countries. Even today, China is its largest factory. Since enlargement, the EU has become China’s largest trading partner, which is why relations with China are so important to us. We should, however, remember that a purely economic approach to our relations will not reveal to us the true face of the Chinese dragon.</p>
<p class="contents">Politically, China continues to be a threat to the world. Utopian socialism continues to flourish there. There are political prisoners in its jails, there is no freedom of speech and there is censorship. The communist party continues to be the only true path. Torture is widely used in China, as is religious discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, China is the world’s third largest importer of crude oil. Economic interests have brought China closer to countries with problems such as Iran, Sudan or Venezuela. Competition for raw materials will put increased pressure on our relations with China in the future. China’s energy policy has led the country to make bilateral agreements that undermine all efforts to stabilise the price of oil. The increase in China’s military spending, particularly in the light of its provocative announcements of the possibility of using armed force against Taiwan, also provides grounds for concern. China regularly stages military manoeuvres that simulate an attack on Taiwan.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must take a decisive stance on this. Only a fully independent Taiwan is a guarantee of peace in the Far East. I repeat: only a fully independent Taiwan is a guarantee of peace in the Far East.</p>
<p class="contents">The Belder report, which we are now debating, provides an objective view of EU-China relations. Let us hope that it will be the start of a more critical approach by the EU to the issue of China in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We endorse the Belder report because we believe that Europe should not be afraid to ask China, as the giant and the economic power that it is, for satisfactory answers on the various topics mentioned. I should therefore like it if, when the protection of human rights is spoken of, including by the Commission, it were not done in the same way as when all of the countries’ old European Affairs offices used to insert clauses as a mere formality, things that had to be said: we must now talk about Tibet, both in order to create a good impression and to show that we take an interest. Having heard here the words of such a high spiritual authority as the Dalai Lama, which moved us all, I feel – and I am expressing myself freely here – that our responses to the Tibetan tragedy, which is the tragedy of a holocaust and of the cultural genocide of a nation, are very weak and fundamentally ineffective.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the economic and monetary field, I go beyond the Belder report and I would criticise it in the sense that, as far as the monetary field is concerned, it is time we called for a rather swift, though gradual, revaluation of the yuan renmimbi, if we want to protect our economies from the Chinese offensive.</p>
<p class="contents">How is it possible, then, that, while knowing that 70% of the counterfeit goods that circulate in our countries come from China, we still have to address issues such as those concerning the running of Chinese courts, the responses, the fact that there is a court here that finds in our favour and to which one can turn; in short, how is it possible that we have to call on China to completely overhaul its system so as to meet the requirements of democracy and development, and so on?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention the issue of religious freedom, which is a fundamental issue: Christians, Catholics, Protestants, but also, as we have seen before our Parliament, members of the Falun Gong; in other words, human beings who believe in their ideas, in their philosophy and who are treated like criminals, tortured, incarcerated and probably also have parts of their bodies removed. The traffic in organs that is practised by a country with which we continue to trade is a disgrace! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has not been an easy job to construct an EU-China report, because there are a multitude of factors that have needed to be considered. The final result needs to be a balanced one that reflects the developing, positive relationship between two huge economic blocs while not shying away from the real and difficult concerns that exist on issues of human rights and the promotion of democracy; issues which we in Parliament claim to be serious about.</p>
<p class="contents">I am strongly in favour of continuing to develop a closer relationship with China. The EU is China’s largest trading partner, after all, and it is our second-largest trading partner. Massive economic opportunities exist for both parties to grow and take advantage of new markets. Therefore, anyone who advocates the isolation of China as a foreign policy strategy, for whatever reason, is being unrealistic.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, however, we must be firm and consistent in our efforts to ensure that with the developing trade relationship must also come democratic development and an increased respect for human rights. The two must go hand-in-hand. That is why, as a human rights spokesperson, I am so glad to see such a strong emphasis on human rights concerns in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I was relieved to hear Mrs De Keyser clarify that the PSE Group’s objections are not based on concerns over the references to human rights issues; but that was until I heard what Mr Ford had to say. The report is certainly not dominated by human rights concerns, but it does ask the hard questions, and rightly so, if we are to be taken seriously by China in relation to human rights issues, such as the need to guarantee genuine religious freedom; the concern at reports of widespread torture in Chinese prisons and reports of inhumane, degrading treatment and internment without trial; the laogai system of detention centres and labour camps; forced compliance with family planning policy; censorship of the internet and recent reports of sourcing human organs from prisoners. I was delighted to hear the Commissioner make a very strong statement in relation to that issue. In fact, I would congratulate her on her very balanced presentation this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">These are serious concerns that demand our attention as we proceed to develop the closer relationship with China that we all accept is inevitable and desirable.</p>

<p class="contents">At the same time, the Central Bank has decided to increase the lower limit on deposits in foreign currency from 3% to 4%, with the ulterior motive of limiting the supply of dollars, given that the country has exchange reserves of EUR 941 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">Chinese products, due to their low cost and exchange parity have a comparative export advantage. China is the biggest consumer of electricity in the world and the third biggest oil importer, which makes it the regulator of energy policy and of economic development at international and regional level. It is a development scenario which is an unobtainable dream for Europe and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the European Union must not under any circumstances deal with the emergence of China in global trade and the economy as a threat, but as an important new market which offers new possibilities and important opportunities for the economic development and strengthening of the European market itself. It suffices if this is demonstrated and sought in agreements and with specific policies. I think you will find the European Parliament agrees with your reference to the policies and tactics of the European Union and I would like, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, to welcome this political move by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to put at the centre of a cooperation agreement with China the further opening up of the Chinese economy to European companies, something which requires legislative and administrative regulations. Recent announcements by the Chinese Government about increases in the capital which investors are allowed to hold in domestic companies and the anti-monopoly bill are particularly positive steps in this direction.</p>

In my view, the request is slightly biased by the idea that a distinction can be made between the debate on human rights and the debate on the necessary report on China; in reality, we are talking about the same thing: enforcing international law and the international regulations on dumping and on free competition is the same as seeking to enforce the international charters on human rights and on the individual right to freedom and democracy, particularly for peoples such as the Tibetans, but also for the Yugur, who are often forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">While we are on the subject, we must concentrate, as I would say to the Commissioner (and as I would like to say to the Council, too, but unfortunately it is not present) – the President has the light behind him, so he might be taking part in a Chinese shadow puppet show – on three issues that require our attention, starting with Internet freedom. This is undoubtedly a Chinese problem, but it is also true that the technology for oppressing Chinese citizens via the Internet comes from the United States and Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: Europol. It seems that Europol’s management board would even like to begin talks with a view to concluding a cooperation agreement with the Chinese. It really seems the height of contradiction to me that we should cooperate with the Chinese police.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue, which is also a campaign led by the transnational radical party, concerns the death penalty: the task is ours too; at the forthcoming sitting of the UN General Assembly, we, as the European Union, must raise the issue of establishing a universal moratorium on capital punishment.

I too received the letter from the Chinese representatives, to which perhaps this reaction is attributable, for it does indeed contain some astounding so-called refutations of the claims made in the resolution. Among other things, the Dalai Lama is once again called a separatist, even though he has repeatedly stated in public that he does not question the One China policy. Moreover, the Falun Gong was described as an ‘evil group’, a choice of words in which we no longer have much confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ask these questions when we talk with China, for failure to do so will not gain us more market share, but rather lose us the respect of our partners.

However, such cooperation should bring benefits to both parties. Unfortunately, as far as relations between China and the EU are concerned, this healthy principle has been skewed, to the detriment of Europe. The reasons are as follows.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Chinese manufacturers do not include social welfare contributions, the costs of environmental protection, etc. in their manufacturing costs. This allows Chinese producers to offer products at much lower prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in China, the manufacture of a variety of goods, including metal products, enjoys various forms of state support which constitute prohibited state subsidies under European Union regulations. Exporting these products to the European market therefore constitutes unfair competition with European manufacturers.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Chinese currency is significantly over-valued compared to the dollar or the euro. Artificially maintaining the exchange rate at the current level significantly increases the effectiveness of Chinese exports, whilst hampering imports on to the Chinese market.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the Chinese authorities are doing practically nothing to restrict large-scale piracy of branded products by Chinese manufacturers. Suffice it to say that as many as 70% of all pirated products on the European market originate in China.</p>
<p class="contents">In such circumstances, the European Commission must do everything in its power to minimise unfair competition from China. It should step up the following activities in particular:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission must increase pressure on China, both through the WTO and directly, to eliminate unfair competition, and in particular the unfair competition resulting from an assisted exchange rate policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission must adopt a joint anti-dumping policy towards China as soon as possible. It particularly needs to introduce high anti-dumping customs tariffs in the sectors most susceptible to unfair competition, especially the textile, shoe-making and metal sectors as well as the farming sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Commission must offer a comprehensive aid package to those sectors of the European economy that have, to date, suffered from unfair Chinese competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to address a few observations to my fellow Members. First of all, I should like to extend warm thanks to the Commissioner for her response to the content of my report. Her commitment is evident. I am not at all opposed to the People’s Republic of China and even less so to the Chinese. I intend to carry on doing what I have always done, namely listening carefully to the Chinese discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">You were talking about a developing country. There are some heated debates at the moment, with one country boasting various economies, while seeking to work towards one harmonious society.</p>
<p class="contents">Chinese experts who are involved in this say they need social values. Well, it appears to me that it would be excellent if we were to take a cautious, yet committed approach to the discussion, for the benefit of both the partnership and internal stability. We would then be part of the thinking process, not from the outside, but from the inside, for the benefit of the wellbeing of the Chinese people as well as for the partnership. I am, then, greatly indebted to you for your approach, and I hope that you will be able to put it across at the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I have again noticed that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has still have not replied to my question about the Ankang system, while claiming to be champions of human rights. Mrs Dobolyi, you have failed to respond to an emphatic question that I have put to you three times now. If there are factual mistakes, as Mrs Ford suggested, then I would like to see those put right in an amendment. Some things have been added to the text thanks to the recommendation by Mr Hoppenstedt.

I believe that the debate we are having today is an important one, because China – and this not just a throwaway remark – is a great country with a great culture, one which can play an important role in the future if everything happens as it is expected to. Even so, the rules must be observed. We want this constructive strategic relationship and partnership with China.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if a country wishes to join the WTO, then it must respect intellectual property, it must address the rules on dumping, it must ask what the labour of prisoners in prison camps means, what competition on an equal footing means, it must cooperate in Doha, it must maintain an appropriate currency policy, and it can achieve a trade surplus through its own achievement, but not by ignoring the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that such a country plays a part in solving political crises, as China is indeed doing to a certain extent in connection with Iran, however at the same time it is buying energy everywhere, for example in Darfur. The question arises: is this how the responsibility of a future superpower is to be envisaged? It is vital that this responsibility should be linked to human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">China has experienced intensive economic development, but it must produce evidence of the large-scale liberalisation not only of the economy, but also of the political system. If it does not do so, then there could be a big rupture which might undermine its economic development. So far China has offered no such evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">I will defend the One China policy, but only if it is based on the free decision of all interested parties, and this cannot be achieved through violence. Last year’s Chinese legislation on the subject is unacceptable, and, for as long as it remains so and threats continue to be made, then the arms embargo cannot be lifted.</p>
<p class="contents">We want relations with this great country, with China, but I think that in doing so we must also respect the common rules of international humanitarian law, and that this is the only basis for stable progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Statistics show that mutual trade is growing sharply and flourishing. Indeed, the last 25 years has seen a 40-fold increase. The EU has become China’s biggest partner and, on the other side of that coin, China has become the Union’s second biggest partner. Nevertheless, alongside these positive developments, one cannot fail to notice a great many negative developments that are blocking further expansion of significant trade, including, first and foremost, the piracy and counterfeiting of European products and trade marks by Chinese manufacturers. </p>
<p class="contents">It is no secret that more than two thirds of fake goods intercepted on the European market come from China. I should therefore like to call on the Commission and the Council to address this problem at the forthcoming summit in Helsinki. China should be called upon to make substantial improvements in the protection of intellectual property rights and international inventions, to strengthen current legislation on the protection of intellectual property rights and of course to reinforce the activities of the country’s civil courts in solving cases of industrial piracy. The rules of the World Trade Organisation, to which China is a signatory, are after all binding in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Economically and politically, the People’s Republic has become an important player. Of course, the differences between our political systems mean that there are limits to cooperation, but, nevertheless, the EU must view good relations as a central priority for this partnership, and I think, Commissioner, that - as Mr Coveney has already said - you have, today, struck this balance extraordinarily well.</p>
<p class="contents">One example of positive cooperation is in foreign policy. We want China to assume a greater responsibility in matters of foreign policy; a China that is credible and reliable in terms of foreign policy could make a substantial contribution to international stability. We are having a dialogue with China on human rights and civil rights, and on the right of non governmental organisations and political foundations to go about their business freely. I therefore welcome emphatically this House’s call for the reopening of the office of the German liberal Friedrich Naumann Foundation in Peking, which was forced to close in 1996. It is important that the Foundation should resume its work of promoting democracy and development, and this must be implemented. It would be an important contribution to the development of the strategic partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by responding quite briefly to what has been said today: should we have a dialogue with the USA about China? I think we should. We are witnessing a power shift within the international system. We can see it happening before our very eyes, and I believe that it is the responsibility of the great democracies in Europe and North America to consult with each other about such a change in the international system. It is better, it is most important for us to talk about it with each other.</p>

The excitement about this China report shows us that in our own House there are double standards of morality. This is improper for a debate on politics and human rights. The EU is known around the world as a champion of human rights, at the same time it is China’s most important trading partner. It is on this basis that we need to act. We all know about the serious violations of human rights in Tibet and in China, and that, time and time again, our Parliament calls upon China to respect those human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I am addressing Mr Brok when I say that this clear demand must be reinforced by the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Tibet. An amendment to this effect has been tabled by my group and by Members from other groups, and I would ask for it to be supported.

Nevertheless, it remains a one-party communist dictatorship, sharing little in the way of common values with the EU, unlike India, which shares the West’s respect for democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">One rare example of common interest is in the fight against international Islamist terrorism, as China has problems with its own Uighur Muslim minorities. Regrettably, however, in its quest for international support and, in particular, energy security, China has recently courted terrorist-sponsoring Iran, and along with Russia refused to impose UN sanctions for Iran’s continuing uranium enrichment programme. Similarly, on the principle of non-interference, China has good relations with maverick regimes ranging from Venezuela to Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">EU criticism of human rights in China is a good thing in itself. China has an appalling record of inappropriate and wide-scale use of the death penalty, persecution of religious and other minorities, such as unregistered Christian groups, Falun Gong practitioners, Tibetans, etc. However, its inhumane treatment of forced labour prisoners, including allegations of organ trafficking from those executed, poor standards of animal welfare and ignoring of ILO standards, also mean that it has an unfair competitive cost advantage in its exports, which will give rise to legitimate calls for more protectionism, when we should all be striving instead for global free trade.</p>
<p class="contents">China is also obstructing full democracy in Hong Kong, dear to my heart as a British MEP. In its recent anti-secession laws, China has also shown a belligerent attitude towards democratic Taiwan, which serves as a model to completely rebut those who say that China is too big and Chinese people too culturally different from the West to have democracy and high standards of human rights. Therefore, we must maintain the arms embargo imposed by the EU.</p>

There are no disagreements over the need to demand that China make rapid and clear progress on these issues. This is not a competition to see who cares most about human rights, because I truly believe that this House is united in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also acknowledge, however, that China has to deal with enormous challenges, political, social, economic and environmental challenges; it must deal with the consequences of its rapid growth and at the same time it must respond to the growing expectations of its citizens in the field of freedoms, naturally, and of education, health and many other fields. We cooperate with China in many of these fields, with European Union human and material resources, in order to contribute to China’s progress and, when problems arise, as in the case of certain commercial issues involving the textile and footwear sectors, we demand reciprocity, but at the same time we remain firm and employ dialogue in order to resolve those problems, because it is also in our interest, of course, to access that market and for our products to be respected under reciprocal conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I frankly wonder whether this report is going to help us to strengthen relations, whether it is the right way for us to have more influence on these processes of transformation, whether it helps us to be united in order to exert greater influence, or whether it divides us, and whether it strengthens us so that we can play an active role in the process of change in China, or whether it weakens us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

China is becoming one of the most important foreign trade partners of the EU; therefore, the development of cooperation between the EU Member States and China is of great importance, especially in economic and trade relations. In the meantime, economic relations between the EU and China are facing some problems. China is still not a free but rather a mixed market and planned economy. The Communist Party governing the country and controlling national funds is able to interfere in the economy, while state institutions are trying to maintain their influence via bureaucratic procedures and administrative requirements, thus impeding access of EU investments and goods to this market as well as their effect upon the market. After China joined the WTO, Chinese products flooded the EU market. The balance of trade of EU Member States with China is becoming increasingly unfavourable to the EU. Chinese goods are displacing local ones, but China is not willing to open its markets. Considering the EU-China strategic partnership that began in 2003, we must pursue China's contribution to make conditions beneficial to foreign trade, improve legal protection for foreign investments and open markets for EU goods and investments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very grateful to the Committee on Foreign Affairs for having supported the amendments proposed by myself and my colleagues in the Tibet intergroup.</p>
<p class="contents">The report describes the foundations and the future orientation of our relations with China and it has an important signalling effect. Human rights are not a minor issue, but the starting point of our political activity. They are by no means the expression of so-called typical Western thinking. This is not about empty words which sound pleasant and are not binding; it is about practical respect for fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In paragraph 37, Mr Belder has found a decent compromise and included my amendments. We condemn the severe human rights violations in Tibet, the oppression of religious freedom, arbitrary arrests or torture. We repudiate the so-called ‘patriotic education campaign’, which involves monks and nuns being forced to make statements denouncing the Dalai Lama as a ‘dangerous separatist’ and proclaiming Tibet to be a part of China.</p>
<p class="contents">We call upon China to grant unimpeded access to the abducted Panchen Lama, the second highest spiritual authority after the Dalai Lama. We expressly support the negotiations between the Chinese authorities and the representatives of His Holiness, also regarding genuine autonomy for Tibet. In paragraph 82 we demand the abolition of the death penalty and increased protection for minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this House will approve both of these amendments tomorrow. They are so important for a people that has been robbed of its identity by stealth. I recall the Dalai Lama’s visit to Brussels on the 31 May. He met MEPs as well as several Commissioners and the President-in-Office of the Council, Wolfgang Schüssel. We hope that an increasing number of people in positions of authority in China succeed in freeing themselves from their ideological ballast. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Belder report bears out this view, but it does contain some important, relevant points. Firstly, it goes into great detail about the human rights situation and the political, economic, social, labour and environmental problems in China, which are particularly prevalent among minorities such as the Tibetans and the Uighur. </p>
<p class="contents">Amnesty International has just forwarded a document to the Finnish Presidency as regards the EU-China summit, in which it describes the human rights situation in the country, concluding that the little progress that has been achieved is unsatisfactory. Forced labour camps, Internet controls, the death penalty and curbs on religious freedoms form part of this sad reality. Secondly, the Belder report highlights the importance of China taking seriously its responsibilities as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. </p>
<p class="contents">In the EU, we do not accept Beijing’s occasionally threatening stance towards Taiwan. Ultimately, China knows that it can achieve what it wants through peaceful means, as in the examples of Hong Kong and Macau, not least as regards its relations with African countries. Beijing has not shown that it is committed to sustainable development, democratisation and peace. Far from it in fact; China is one of the main arms exporters to Sudan, a country in which the regime is preparing for yet another bloody onslaught in Darfur. China also imports oil from Sudan. </p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, and most importantly, this report reminds us of the Tiananmen massacre and the importance of maintaining an arms embargo against a regime that refuses to face its own past. It is a country in which people continue to be detained and to disappear, their families kept in the dark. </p>
<p class="contents">We are not naïve. We are well aware that European countries, along with the United States and others, continue to sell military technology, or technology for military use, to China, in spite of the arms embargo. Clear evidence of the symbolic political importance of this embargo is Beijing’s eagerness to see it lifted at all costs. </p>
<p class="contents">I support the maximum amount of interaction between the EU and Beijing at all levels and in all fields, for example, the economic, political, trade and cultural fields. Yet I also support a language of truth. China deserves nothing less, and therefore the embargo is a useful tool to have in place until China faces up to what happened on those fateful days in June 1989 and until it stops exporting arms to, and supporting, regimes that massacre and oppress their people, as in the cases of Sudan and Myanmar. </p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that the EU maintain this embargo, especially as the EU has yet to make its Code of Conduct legally binding. We owe it to the EU, to our values, and to the thousands of Chinese citizens who are now living better, economically speaking, but who are ever more fearful about freedom and democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to the latest trade disputes, the European Union must not fail to ensure that intellectual property rules are respected and permit easier access to the Chinese market. If China’s emergence as an economic superpower creates obstacles, it also makes new prospects available to the European Union, on condition however that international trade regulations are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not so much a question of avoiding putting protectionist measures in place as of making China aware that, as a full member of the WTO, it has a duty to respect the rules of a fair and balanced world market. That being the case, the implementation of anti-dumping or safeguard measures – which are legal instruments for protecting trade – is merely the outward effect of trade imbalances and no obstacle at all to our taking up the challenge of fairer globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In adopting its new strategy on China, the European Union will have to protect itself against accusations, and possible indications, of engaging in unfair competition and facilitate European manufacturers’ and exporters’ access to the Chinese market. Parallel with this, and in order to abide by a partnership based on balanced exchanges, Europe will have to take up the challenge of competitiveness, technological progress and innovation. Let us ensure, Commissioner, that China has as much need of us as we have of China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In recent years, relations between China and Europe have improved in many fields, particularly in trade, as well as in the field of technical and scientific cooperation. The most important example of strategic partnership is perhaps cooperation on Galileo, the European satellite navigation programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is China’s most significant partner and investor, while China is the EU’s second largest trading partner. As a rising economic power and permanent member of the UN Security Council and a member of the WTO, China bears increasing responsibility for international security and global peace. It is from this point of view that I would like to draw attention to the information sent by Amnesty International to the Finnish presidency in relation to the EU-China summit to be held on 9 September this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Amnesty International has drawn attention to violations of human rights in China. Their information raises the question of the use of capital punishment in China, ‘re-education’ through forced labour, arbitrary arrest and detention, the use of torture and persecution against human rights activists and lack of media freedom in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Amnesty International has also raised the issue of the sale of arms by China to Sudan as an example of a foreign policy that ignores fundamental human rights in the modern world. The European Union must combine its strategic partnership with China with work to persuade the Chinese authorities to expand political and personal freedoms in the Chinese system and to truly observe the constitution and international treaties to which China is a signatory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report expresses serious concern over the latter, and rightly so. Indeed, we must face the reality that increased economic relations have not resulted in any real progress in the field of the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, experience shows that merely expressing concern over human rights has no impact on dictatorships. Therefore, our message for the EU-China summit should be that there will be no automatic progress in economic relations without real progress in the rule of law. The EU, as China’s largest trading partner, has the leverage to force China’s leaders to start implementing genuine democratic reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a few comments. The economic relations themselves need to be balanced. In China there is wholesale counterfeiting of EU brands, competition is distorted and intellectual property rights ignored. EU Members States are, in all probability, importing large quantities of goods produced by prisoners in laogai torture camps. That is a moral outrage.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is Tibet. The EU must make it one of its priorities to insist that China grants Tibet cultural and religious autonomy, and also opens a dialogue with the Dalai Lama. Tibet is rated by Freedom House as being, along with Chechnya, one of the world’s two worst-off territories. The EU should stress the seriousness it attaches to this by appointing an EU special representative for Tibetan affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is Taiwan. Taiwan-China policy should fully respect the democratic choices of the 23 million inhabitants of Taiwan. We should also insist that Beijing allow Taiwan to enter into practical cooperation with the World Health Organisation and other international bodies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are an attractive market for Chinese manufacturers, and we are a good source of income for Chinese workers. We are in a win-win situation. Thanks to affordable purchases and a wage situation different to our own, our consumers can buy affordable products, and meanwhile in China they have financial reserves totalling hundreds of billions enabling them to buy products from us as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thus talking about opening our markets to each other, reducing quotas, lowering customs duties, which will lead to a win-win situation on both sides. As the speaker on questions of energy for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the issue of energy and the issue of Kyoto are matters of particular importance to me. China plays a very important role in the field of coal: 75% of its energy is produced from coal and, Mr Brok, only 1% from nuclear energy. We must therefore face up to reality: 75% of the Chinese require a great deal of technology in order to get onto a level footing with Kyoto and with the general implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Here there are great opportunities for both sides, just as there are in the use of water power. In this field China has enormous potential: worldwide, it has the largest share of water power. Here there are still many resources that can be developed in the future. The consumption of crude oil, too, which at the moment amounts to around 5.5% of world consumption, will rapidly increase in the future. At present, China accounts for 40% of the additional worldwide demand for oil.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see that energy is a central challenge, and I would ask the Commissioner to properly address this issue at the summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I would like to thank the Chair of the Committee and the rapporteur, and, secondly, the Commissioner for her presence in the plenary here this afternoon and this evening, while others were absent because they were busy waiting for a flying visit from the Iranian mediators and therefore do not have time for this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we refused to appoint a Special Representative in the Committee because a Special Representative is impossible to control. Such Representatives are expensive, and there is already in any case an inflated number of Special Representatives, whom no one is able to inspect. For this reason, it is important in my view that we find solutions that can work within the framework of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of supporting Tibet and supporting its cultural identity, but we should not undermine the Commission, which has the powers to deal with human rights. The Special Representative would set himself up in the Council, where, because of the legal situation, this House would be unable to intervene. We therefore agree with what you have to say in terms of content, but we think that your methods are incorrect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to add that the vast majority of subjects raised tonight will also feature clearly on the summit agenda and I will report back to you on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a general point on the relationship between trade and human rights, which is a central theme of this report. I am not sure whether specific linkages are desirable or feasible, but I would argue that this is an inevitable connection, insofar as China’s opening is strongly predicated on its WTO accession, which, apart from frequently raised important issues like intellectual property rights, involves also an overhaul of the Chinese legal system, with an emphasis on the rule of law. It must be said that real progress has been made. That is fundamental in moving forward in <span class="italic">many</span> of the human rights questions raised today and it is even happening almost by stealth.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me come back to some specific points that have been raised tonight. Firstly, on Tibet, we share the concerns expressed by the European Parliament regarding the human rights situation in Tibet and in particular the preservation of the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people. We have regularly addressed the issue of Tibet in the framework of the EU-China bilateral dialogue on human rights, as well as at the highest political level, including summits. As part of this overall policy vis-à-vis Tibet, for many years we have been asking for the establishment of a direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities, as that is the only realistic way to find a peaceful and lasting solution to the question. We have therefore taken note of the talks between the envoys of the Dalai Lama and the representatives of China.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say a word on Taiwan. We have been consistent throughout in urging the two sides to resolve their issues through a peaceful dialogue. In this regard we have also noted some recent positive developments in the cross-strait situation. We have to recognise that there are new Chinese efforts to restart discussions with Chinese and Taiwanese opposition politicians. Flights across the Straits have resumed, but an inclusive dialogue with all parties in Taiwan is also needed. This is important.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also make a point concerning our bilateral relationship and the relationship with the United States of America. As Mr Lambsdorff said, it is important to talk about China to the US about common concerns, for example on open markets and human rights, because we can achieve more together vis-à-vis China. However, it is also clear that a strategic dialogue with the US, which we have at official level, does not mean that we have to agree right across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">On the long-standing issue of the arms embargo, it is true that we are willing to continue working towards a possible lifting of the embargo, on the basis of our joint statement of 2004, the EU-China Summit and the subsequent European Council conclusions. However, at the same time, we have left China with no doubt as to the importance of progress on human rights in order to create a more positive atmosphere for lifting the embargo. We have also made clear our commitment to ensure that lifting the embargo would not lead to any substantive change in the strategic balance in the Asian region and that the national security of friendly and allied countries would be fully taken into account. So, again, this is one of those issues that is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">On the very specific and important issue of shoes, let me say that on 30 August 2006 the Commission adopted a proposal to impose anti-dumping duties on certain leather shoes from China and Vietnam. Reflecting the finding that dumping exists and EU producers are suffering harm, we have proposed a duty of 16.5% for China and 10% for Vietnam for certain leather shoes. This proposal now passes to the Member States, which have one month in which to consider it for adoption. That is the situation at present.</p>
<p class="contents">On the sectoral dialogues, my services produce regular updates and these are on our websites. A further update will be available shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close with two general statements. Again, as I said at the start, we are committed to human rights, social and economic rights, which include in particular freedom of expression, religion, association and protection of the rights of minorities. I should also like to say that the death penalty is one of those questions continually being addressed. I should also like to re-emphasise what I said before about the Falun Gong.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in response to Mr Brok, and as I said at the beginning, we need China to become a responsible member of the international community, but more than just a stakeholder: it needs to be a positive and an active contributing partner. It is a very important member of the international community, being a permanent member of the Security Council. All of that will feature prominently in our communication, which will be available in the autumn.</p>
