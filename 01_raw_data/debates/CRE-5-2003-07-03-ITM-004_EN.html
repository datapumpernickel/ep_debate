<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ghilardotti (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us today slots perfectly into European policy on equal opportunities, which, as we know, has two basic branches: specific measures benefiting women and gender mainstreaming, or the incorporation of the perspective of gender equality into all stages and levels of public policy by all the actors involved in the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">Gender budgeting is the application of the principle of gender mainstreaming in the budgetary process. As we are all aware, budgets are not gender-neutral, but reflect the way in which power is distributed within society. Whenever they define revenue and expenditure policies, public budgetary authorities at all levels are taking policy decisions. Budgets are not merely economic tools but, in fact, key instruments with which political authorities shape a society's model of socio-economic development and criteria for internal redistribution and prioritise the measures to be taken in respect of policies and the needs of their own citizens. The impact this has is not the same on men and women. The way in which public budgets are normally drawn up tends to ignore the differences – in terms of roles and responsibilities – between men and women, and, in most cases, the indicators and data used fail to make any gender distinction. Although they are presented as neutral economic instruments, public budgets, in actual fact, reflect and thus reproduce the socio-economic disparities already present in the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Analysing budgetary policies on the basis of the different impacts they have on men and women and adjusting them accordingly serves to ensure that public budgets meet appropriate criteria in terms of fairness and cost-effectiveness. In order to be not merely fair but also efficient, public spending must help to promote the development and exploit the potential of all sections of society. It is therefore a matter of adopting an economic and social approach based on the principle that, even in an open and globalised market economy, economic and social development are considered inseparable and interconnected. An economy cannot be competitive, dynamic and healthy in the long term unless the productive, commercial and financial processes are backed up by a stable, cohesive and fair society in which human rights, resources and capacities are properly developed. The strengthening, modernisation and reorganisation of public intervention, and hence budgetary policies, with a view to social development are, in fact, an absolutely essential intangible investment in capacities, empowerment and new resources and opportunities for economies wishing to be dynamic and competitive through being knowledge-based, in accordance with the objective set by the European Council in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this is the first time that Parliament has discussed gender budgeting, it is by no means a new concept. The Platform for Action drawn up at Beijing at the Fourth United Nations World Conference on Women specifically refers to it; an experts' working group has been set up within the Council of Europe's Directorate-General for Human Rights; the Commission itself, after the conference organised by the Belgian Presidency, set up a working group of experts; but, above all, numerous experiments have been carried out in Eastern countries, starting with Australia, which adopted this instrument – like many developing countries, moreover – as early as 1984, and there have been interesting experiments carried out within the European Union too for some years now at both national and local level.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the specific objectives of the report? Firstly, raising awareness among the public and political and economic actors at all levels. Disseminating information on the gender budgeting strategy and method among the institutions of the European Union and the Member States. Calling on the Commission, which has already expressed its support, to produce and distribute as widely as possible an information brochure on gender budgeting. Involving the actors operating in the Community at all levels in the building of budgets. Most importantly, indicating an action framework for the implementation of gender budgeting, providing for bottom-up democratic participation and the involvement of organised individuals, NGOs and women's associations.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Madam President, with this point: wherever, especially at local level, experiments of this kind are already underway, they have also served to wipe away the indifference and detachment we see today at all levels in relationships between the citizens and the public authorities. This is an instrument which brings great participation as well as great justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission indeed first raised the issue at a technical seminar held in October 2001 and in 2002 the Consultative Committee on Equal Opportunities was instructed to look at current experiences and to study how Member States view the gender perspective and how they propose to integrate it into their budgets. This committee delivered an opinion which is available to this Parliament, distributed by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. Clearly, on the basis of this document, the committee is willing to draw up the pamphlet to which you referred and which could be useful in providing this information.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have some good practices in place in various fields, such as the European Employment Strategy, social protection, science and research and cooperation development and – perhaps the most interesting example – in the Structural Funds. All of this demonstrates that gender equality is being addressed more effectively in the current programmes than in the previous period.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, much remains to be done, but we are continuing to make progress in this field. The Commission Communication on integrating gender equality into the programming documents for the Structural Funds recommends that the Member States clearly indicate which funds are allocated to specific equality-related actions. The Member States will provide us with the relevant information, with precise indicators, as part of this year’s review.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States are also being urged to ensure that actions pursued under the Structural Funds use gender impact assessments and statistics broken down by gender and, at the same time, the Commission emphasises that specific funds, in most of the programmes, should be maintained and even increased for activities dedicated to ensuring gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to develop methodologies and tools to implement the integration of gender into the budget, but this means continuing with our discussions on exchanging experiences and all cooperating with one another. Consequently its report on integrating the gender perspective makes an, in our opinion, enormously useful contribution to improving the principle of gender integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The fruitful cooperation between Parliament, Member States and the Commission must remain in place and be stepped up if we are to achieve the aims that we all wish to attain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even though the Commissioner says that a lot is already happening at European level, I view this report rather as a start and a stimulus for building on the little that is already happening. People may say that there is a lot of expertise, or at least some, but, to be honest, I have to say that I have yet to see much evidence of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are there calls for gender budgeting? It is because a number of items in the budgets of Member States and the European Union are largely only benefiting half of the population. I shall give two examples.</p>
<p class="contents">It is common knowledge that, when it comes to allocating resources for scientific research into health care, a good deal of research is conducted on half of the population: the males and not the females.</p>
<p class="contents">A second example is as follows. When resources are given for stimulating democratisation and respect for human rights in developing countries, it frequently happens that these resources are principally used for the benefit of one half of the population and not the other. That is why it is expressly requested that we perhaps start with an analysis of a number of budgetary items that are very gender-sensitive, where something really could be done. If this could be carried out in consultation with the Member States, I think that something positive could result. It is indeed good to have a brochure, but we are actually still only at the stage of developing a mechanism. The development of a mechanism requires the building-up of a great deal of expertise. I give my support to the Commission, and to Mrs Ghilardotti, and I hope that this own-initiative report bears fruit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The promotion of the idea of gender budgeting is obviously not calling for the creation of separate funding headings, nor does it aspire to more financial resources for women. What we want is for the specific consequences on the economic and social life of both sexes to be evaluated and, of course, for the budgets to be restructured so that, through them, gender equality can be promoted instead of being undermined.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, it is becoming more and more understood that macroeconomic policy can reduce or widen the gap between the two sexes in relation to financial resources, economic independence, education and health care. For example, the health budget should take account of the specific needs which arise from the different physiology of the two sexes and the different health problems faced by the two sexes. In other words, the male cannot be used as the measure for everything. I regret that the European Commission does not have at its disposal either methods or reliable statistics for analysing the budget by gender.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to stress that all the committees of the European Parliament should apply gender budgeting in all their budgets. Finally, it is also important for there to be transparency and control mechanisms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very serviceable document that really is to be welcomed. It gives concrete shape to what many are talking about, that is to say gender mainstreaming, but which so few are attempting to convert into practical politics.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to hear that the Commission has the same problems as the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. Ever since the Beijing Conference in 1995, we have talked about statistics broken down by gender. Statistics of this kind have still not been produced in our Member States, and nor of course have they been produced by the Commission. We have also assessed in previous debates how the structural funds are distributed by gender. I am not usually particularly enamoured of the Commission’s various propaganda documents, but I really do hope in this case that an attempt will at least be made to produce a document on this issue that can be distributed in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that the Committee on Budgets has not itself taken the initiative that Mrs Ghilardotti has so creditably taken. All the institutions have undertaken to take account of gender mainstreaming in all areas. Now that, hopefully, many from the Committee on Budgets are present, I really do hope that this initiative will be taken to heart and practical measures continue to be taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason, some sober correction is in order.</p>
<p class="contents">The two genders must be valued equally: I am an outright supporter of this. However, this resolution smacks of an ideology that wants to forcefully combat one objectionable form of oppression by introducing another undesirable form of dictatorship or collective thinking. For, ultimately, the equality ideology does not value women as women. It does not give them their due. On the contrary, women must become the same as men. They will be forced to be the same. Where have I heard those words before? It must be understood that I am against any unworthy treatment of women.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to banish from society the problem indicated, we must not take as our starting point a model based on confrontation between the two genders, but instead set to work in accordance with a model based on harmony. This is the way God the creator intended it when he created humankind – man and woman as a unity of two parts that complement each other. Unfortunately, this harmonious relationship has been thoroughly disturbed on account of humankind's refusal to recognise God or his authority, instead insisting on being its own boss. Unfortunately, there is no place for this original truth in the equality ideology. As a result, it does not rise above the jealousy-promoting confrontation model, which involves the division of power and money; everyone the same, as if men and women will be happier as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution tramples on the subsidiarity principle. It calls for studies and reports from the European Commission that require an enormous amount of work, including from the Member States, in order to achieve an ideological and ultimately inhumane objective. In our opinion, it would be more just and fair to call for attention to the position of families and the extent to which government policy and budgetary policy in the European Union are family-friendly. After all, the individualistic spirit exuded by this report has very negative implications for the future of our societies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To my mind, that is a very important distinction, and one that we should not forget.</p>
<p class="contents">Gender budgeting does not involve creating separate budgets for men and women, but it does mean working to ensure that funding is distributed fairly and efficiently. Contrary to what we are often told, public budgets are not gender-neutral; in terms of both income and expenditure they have different impacts on men and women. We want to highlight these differences and take account of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Few people are aware of the impact of budget policy decisions on women in economic, social, and societal terms. That is why we need a budget analysis. Such an analysis means investigating the impact of budgets on women, and on tax systems, that is to say different types of taxation. How do women perceive cuts and how are they affected by them? The answer is: very often more than men are.</p>
<p class="contents">To make gender budgeting possible, we need transparency, consultation and joint decision-making. A group of highly committed Austrian women have written a book entitled ‘Women, Power and Budgets – Public Finances from a Gender Perspective’. I can recommend this to you as a starting point, and it could also provide a basis for the information leaflet the Commission has promised us. That leaflet should be widely published, easily accessible and go hand in hand with an information campaign. Statements like the ones you have just heard should then be a thing of the past.</p>

The rapporteur has explained that countries both outside and inside Europe have already been applying the practices of gender budgeting. Therefore I hope, Commissioner, that we will keenly support this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say, to the Member who believes that we are being ideological when we discuss this question, that this is an economic question. If I take as an example the issue of pensions, which affects most countries in Europe and, in the last few months, France in particular, gender budgeting enables us to make a diagnosis of the situation. We discover, for example, that while the difference in wages between men and women is 25%, that difference rises to 47% as soon as retirement age is reached. That is the sort of diagnosis that this study enables us to carry out.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, this diagnosis is not sufficient, because the pessimists will say that that is going to cost us money. Economic equality between the sexes does cost money, whether it is professional equality or equality of retirement pensions, as is the case with many other subjects. I should like to remind those pessimists that it is possible to produce a different analysis of inequality between men and women, namely that it is economic inequality between men and women that costs money. A better analysis and a better practice of equality in financial matters would make it possible to reduce a cost rather than to increase it. I say this for the benefit of those who think that we are being ideological. They are wrong, because we are also thinking in economic terms when we consider this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Gender<span class="italic"> </span>budgeting is a relatively recent idea, which was developed at the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing. In the context of gender mainstreaming, it involves analysing public budgets to assess their differing impacts on men and women, and to raise awareness among political and economic actors – which we have ample opportunity to do today. Discrimination very soon becomes apparent when figures talk and we see that only 6% of the Structural Funds are geared towards helping women. Let me give you another example from the EU Budget: the forest protection programme has a budget of EUR 52 million, whereas the programme for the protection of children, young people and women is allocated only EUR 41 million, a clear 20% less.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities hopes, by means of this report, to stimulate a debate that will expose the inequality and discrimination in the Budget. But we need instruments to achieve that, and this point is addressed to you personally, Commissioner Solbes Mira: please work within the Commission to ensure that we finally get the directive under Article 13, which relates to discrimination on grounds of gender, which will at last give us a significant instrument.</p>
