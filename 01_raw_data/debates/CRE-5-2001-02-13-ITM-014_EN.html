<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miller (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, earlier today we heard in the context of the copyright and GMO legislation how it has taken three years for Parliament to reach the point of being in a position to approve it. Can I say that this report has been under negotiation for nine years and it is only now coming to fruition. Since I took over the rapporteurship of this report I have tried to involve all the interested parties from the manufacturing side right through to the user side. On the manufacturing side, I have had several meetings with the European constructors’ association as well as individual bus companies. All of these organisations are happy with the common position <span class="italic">and </span>the amendments. In fact, they welcome the clarification it brings to the market. I have listened to the users carefully and I have consulted widely. It is only after these consultations that I have put forward the amendments that you have in front of you tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also pay tribute to the shadow rapporteurs who worked with me closely throughout the compiling of this report. Unfortunately not all of them were able to persuade their groups to follow the line.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5 are specific detailed technical amendments designed to assist the manufacturers and relate to gangway slopes of 12.5% on existing class I and II buses. These amendments have to be taken in conjunction with Amendment No 7. In Amendment No 6 I am seeking to replace that with Amendment No 10 which refers to the ISO standard and not to separate Member State standards which I had initially put in Amendment No 6. Amendment No 4 sets out in more detail the user groups that this report is trying to assist. This list is, however, neither exhaustive nor prescriptive. It was never intended to be and leaves plenty of scope for the inclusion of others. Amendment No 8 opens up access to public transport to all those groups referred to in the aforementioned Amendment No 4. For the first time, we are making public transport accessible to all those people with reduced mobility. This will be done by providing a kneeling system with either a lift or ramp but it also takes into account infrastructure improvements which have been carried out as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Maybe I should declare an interest at this point. Just before Christmas my mother unexpectedly lost her sight. As a son I obviously wish to help her, as I wish to help all visually impaired people within the European Union. It is what I was elected to do and I am sure it is what the vast majority of people in this Parliament were elected to do. These citizens are important users of public transport and they depend on us in the European Parliament to get it right. We have that chance tomorrow by voting for those amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I must, however, also mention Amendment No 9 which was submitted later by the PPE-DE Group. When this came up at the Legal Affairs Committee it went through unanimously but then, all of a sudden, we heard that the PPE-DE Group wishes to reject the common position. I am sorry and disappointed that their amendment rejects the common position. That would set back accessibility for those citizens I mentioned earlier by several years.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that one of the reasons that they are proposing rejection of the common position is because it will shackle the industry. It will tie up the industry in red tape. Can I ask those in the PPE-DE who are intending to speak on this how they would feel if they were shackled to a wheelchair or to sticks or to having to have a guide dog? That is shackling, not what we are trying to do with the industry. I would be ashamed if their Amendment No 9 is carried. I would be ashamed for every Member of this Parliament who puts their hand up or presses a button to vote for that amendment. I therefore urge you to vote against Amendment No 9 but support the other amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Harbour (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, it has been, as always, a pleasure to work with my friend Bill Miller on these technical directives and I believe that we will have made a significant improvement to this directive if it is approved. So I will not go through the amendments. He has done a good job on that. I just want to address the question of why we on this side have chosen to propose a motion of rejection.</p>
<p class="contents">It relates to the whole issue of whether Parliament should be handling technical directives. I recall that in a speech not long ago in this Parliament Commissioner Liikanen talked about some of the problems he is facing on potential pedestrian protection legislation for cars. He presented us with at least 60 pages of complex technical mathematical calculations and he challenged us: is this the sort of thing this Parliament should be considering? This directive is 150 pages long and it has it own share of technical calculations, graphs, charts and other detailed technical provisions. The same arguments apply.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to pick up on a point made by Bill Miller. He is right to challenge us on the question about disabled access, but he said and I quote him, "It will make public transport accessible to all users". Regrettably that is not the case. If it were, we would support it. This piece of paper includes provision to make buses more accessible for disabled users, but it does not address the whole question of operating regulations for public transport systems across the European Union. The issues which our colleague Mr Howitt quite rightly says we should be putting in here: changing the infrastructure to make buses more accessible for disabled users.</p>
<p class="contents">What have we actually achieved after nine years? Do we really have mutual recognition of technical standards between countries? Have we really achieved the sort of significant advances in safety that we want? I had a look through these 150 pages. I may be wrong – Commissioner, you may be able to tell me this – but I could not find in here any provision for mandatory fitting of seat belts. Why is that not in here if we are serious about the Council saying to us in this document that it has come up with a practicable solution with a high level of safety and user-friendliness. If we really had achieved that, then we should be proud of it.</p>
<p class="contents">There are provisions, certainly, for things like strength of superstructure but the worrying thing here – and I ask the Commissioner to address this – is that this is not all. At the end there is a list of things that the Commission and Council want to bring back to us. It does not address school buses. It does not address the latest developing technology of buses. There are going to be new provisions for superstructures. When is all this going to end? When are we going have realistic and sensible measures and the sort of technical committee structure that this Parliament asked you to introduce at first reading in 1997 and which is simply dismissed here? I quote in conclusion: "The Commission was unable to support the approach and in consequence did not amend its original proposal." Not a single word of explanation. That is why my group will be recommending that this is rejected tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Howitt (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, there is much in the text to promote access to buses by disabled people – passenger handrails, non-slip surfaces, standards for wheelchairs and a wide definition of reduced mobility to include all disabled people. However, the key to tonight's debate is Amendment No 8: a guarantee of level access to all new buses in urban areas for persons with reduced mobility. To achieve this requires a boarding aid, a lift or a ramp, because a low-floor bus on its own is not enough. Our failure to agree this crucial part of the text would leave disabled people quite literally falling through the crack, a crack for which we would ourselves be responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur – to whom I offer my heartfelt thanks – has forged a compromise which seeks to share responsibility for access between bus manufacturers, operators, local planning and transport authorities. But as we negotiate the final outcome I say to Parliament and the Commission that even a raised kerb at every bus stop can never be the full access solution. Bad parking or obstacles on the pavement can still prevent boarding, whilst a simple manual swing-over ramp, built into the floor of each new bus, is cheap and will work time after time.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet nine years after this directive was first discussed, when the disability movement for a generation has put accessible public transport at the heart of its demands, those on the opposite side of the House threaten to vote, not simply against the amendment, but to destroy the whole directive. Do they do so on grounds of cost? No. The study of accessible buses commissioned by my own government shows low operating costs outweighing the marginal extra capital costs, while a 14% increase in passengers brought in extra revenue.</p>
<p class="contents">Do they do so because of objections from manufacturers? No. A check today, again in my own Member State, shows that British bus manufacturers and British bus operators are unanimous in their view that they want the directive to go through. Do they do so because of a genuine difficulty at all? No. Because the parliamentary committee that scrutinised these proposals in detail voted for them unanimously.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, my only conclusion, as we have heard tonight, is that those who oppose do so because they share the prejudice that disability access is an unnecessary technical detail. They are wrong. For a disabled person it means the freedom to travel or the restriction to stay at home. Tonight we have the chance to grant that freedom to vote for accessible public transport. We must and we will. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rübig (PPE-DE)</span></span>  . – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us today the standard European bus directive, on which we adopted a position at first reading. The rapporteur then was Mr Murphy. Murphy's Law is of course famous, but I have to say that Mr Murphy did a first-rate job, because he recognised that this directive involves implementing a number of important political principles, namely access for the elderly, children and the disabled. We are fully in agreement with that. We need to do something for those groups: buses and public transport must be accessible to them and we want to put all our combined energies into achieving that objective.</p>
<p class="contents">So why are we rejecting this directive? Because at first reading the Commission brought forward a proposal comprising over 100 pages of detailed regulations, and during the first reading debate all the groups agreed to reject the directive for reasons of principle. Now the Commission and the Council have come back with their common position, which is not 100 pages long, but 150 pages. At first reading we said that we could imagine at most three pages covering the key political principles. This directive contains some really choice passages of a kind you very rarely find. For example, on page 17 we have Figure 17, which is about permissible configurations for rear corner seats, and shows a plan view of the prescribed seat area, with both rear corner seats, in relation to Annex I Section 7.7.8.6.3.4, and as with aircraft design a maximum radius of 150 mm is prescribed. I know that we in the European Union have set the radius of curvature for bananas and cucumbers and goodness knows what else, but I find it hard to imagine that we now need to set a radius of curvature for the standard European bus. The directive also contains a formula that must even be hard for engineers to understand. I have to say that this document is not a suitable basis for political decision making.</p>
<p class="contents">So the position is that designers, bus purchasers, consumer protection organisations and also disabled persons' organisations are in agreement with this directive, but are all very unhappy. They all say that we want to achieve the objective of using disabled-accessible buses in Europe. We in the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats want a new approach here, which quite simply means limiting ourselves to key policy aspects. First of all, that means standards for access for the elderly, for children and for disabled persons. This is extremely important and needs to be guaranteed. Secondly, we want safety standards for drivers and passengers. Thirdly, we want the principle of mutual recognition. The reason this principle of mutual recognition is so important is that a bus obviously needs to be different if it operates in a small poor village in Sicily, where it is very hot, as compared with a bus which has to cope with London's rush hour, with millions of passengers and where quite different demands are made of the bus. A bus operating in northern Finland, in conditions of extreme cold and covering great distances would again have to be very different. That is why the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats is calling for the rejection of the common position and is requesting a vote.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that it is important for us not to make everything in Europe the same. The European public is also opposed to this desire towards sameness. We wish to see mutual recognition. I have confidence in British, French and German buses, and that is how things should remain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the Council’s common position rides roughshod over Parliament. The Council has not in any way taken account of Parliament’s firm repudiation of detailed legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is about more than just buses. It is about the way in which the EU is to legislate. I am not of course opposed to making sure that people with disabilities can use European buses. What I am opposed to is the mode of procedure. I find it quite unreasonable that, as a politician, I should have to take decisions about how many millimetres bus door handles and luggage racks should measure. In my own country, the EU is often made into a laughing-stock for meddling and for regulating in too much detail. People quite rightly question an EU that is in many ways unwieldy and bent on regulating. MEPs’ credibility is brought into question if we take decisions about things we do not know anything about. An example is Annex V of the Council’s common position. I am not ashamed to say that I do not understand the formula according to which the closing power of automatic doors is to be calculated.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to contribute to making ourselves and the EU into laughing-stocks. Despite the fact that I was not involved in the first reading in 1988, I would remind this Parliament that it voted 485 to 1 in favour of the general guidelines rather than the detailed legislation. Why should Parliament change its mind now? For the Swedish Conservative Party, this was an important issue in the 1999 elections. I was elected on a mandate to combat politicians’ inability to leave things alone. I cannot therefore vote in favour of the Council’s common position. I would therefore call upon the whole Parliament to vote in favour of Amendment No 9, tabled by my colleague Mr Lehne and rejecting the Council’s common position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you no doubt recall, this proposal for a directive on the construction of buses and coaches gave rise to lengthy and involved debates at first reading. This draft has been before us for three years already. We have come a long way since then. A consensus has been reached between the Council, Parliament and Commission. As well as the institutions, the various parties involved such as bus and coach manufacturers, public transport operators and user groups, including those which represent passengers with reduced mobility, have also arrived at a consensus. That is why we welcome the work of the rapporteur, who succeeded in bringing together some often divergent interests. It is now possible for the proposal to be adopted quickly, which will allow the safety of buses and their passengers to be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept the eight amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, either in full or in principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 1, 7 and 8 are acceptable as they stand. Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 5, which relate to the permissible slope of the bus’s floor area, are acceptable in principle, but may, of course, be reviewed at the drafting stage. Amendment No 4, which gives a list of people with reduced mobility, will most probably be challenged by Member States, as it introduces the risk of excluding some categories of users. Would it not be better retain the general definition, which is, for that very reason, more comprehensive? Finally, Amendment No 6, which seeks to change the figure of the wheelchair, is acceptable in principle, but not in the form proposed in the report. The reference to an ISO standard or to an authorised diagram, as the rapporteur proposes in Amendment No 10, would be preferable, bearing in mind, however, that we must ensure that size, shape and weight of the wheelchair, together with its occupant, are compatible with the physical characteristics of access areas.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the Commission does not wish to repeat the debate held at first reading on the regulatory approach to vehicles. We do not, therefore, endorse the idea of challenging the timeliness of a directive, by which I am referring to Amendment No 9. To sum up, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10 in principle and can accept Amendments Nos 1, 7 and 8. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to reply to Mr Harbour on this question of principle. Since Lisbon, when we discussed new proposals, we must consider alternatives. For instance, we are talking about disabilities at the moment. I have had a lot of discussion about design standards for the disabled in the information society to try to find ways to make all the tools for the information society available for people with different kinds of disabilities. We should try to analyse when a new approach directive can be used <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> old approach directives. We must see what type of regulatory reforms we can have which serve this purpose in an easier way.</p>
