The Commission remains very concerned that no tangible progress has so far been made on the US side on their commitment to seek Congressional amendment to Title 4 of Helms-Burton, not least since the US Administration has regularly recalled that the President is obliged in the absence of such an amendment to enforce Title 4.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has for its part always made it clear that if action is taken against EU companies or individuals under the Helms-Burton Act it would request a new WTO panel against the US in respect of this act. The Commission had urged the US Administration to accelerate the implementation of the May 1998 Summit deal. The Commission is aware of the inquiries by the US State Department into the activities of certain of the companies mentioned by the honourable Member and is following the situation very closely. The Commission will continue to keep the European Parliament informed of any new developments regarding the implementation of the 18 May 1998 understandings.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just add this: I raised these issues at a meeting with Secretary of State Albright last week. I also went to see Senator Helms on the same visit to Washington. I stressed two points: first our commitment to opposing extra-territorial legislation, second our commitment to protecting property rights and the law of contract. I pointed out that if a waiver enabled us to trigger the May 1998 undertakings, that would ensure a comprehensive attack on the expropriation of property, not just in Cuba, where the May 1998 understanding was strongly attacked. I hope that the senator in particular and his colleagues in the Senate and the House of Representatives will reflect very carefully on what I said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to say to you, Commissioner, that the fact that the Commission tells us that it is still worried about this situation is frankly not enough. It also seems to me to be insufficient that the Commission, in its contacts with Mrs Albright, should say that she has to comply with the commitments which were agreed within the framework of the Transatlantic Summit. This is clearly not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know if you believe that, after twenty months of non-compliance, the Clinton administration will persuade Congress to ratify and amend Title 4 of the law.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore the question – and I understand and am grateful for your good will, Commissioner – is as follows: is the Commission prepared, in view of the harassment and pressures which European companies are suffering, to do more than express its consternation and concern, and to take some type of measure – and your predecessor, Mr Brittan, committed himself to this before this Parliament: I am well aware of this because I asked the question at the time – in the event that this non-compliance should continue to be absolutely evident and blatant? In a pre-election year, the Senate of the United States is not going to amend the law: is the Commission really prepared to denounce this non-compliance to the authorities of the World Trade Organisation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is in everybody’s interest to see a waiver to Title 4, it is in everybody’s interest including potential investors not to have a trade dispute that not just discourages investment but poisons our overall relations. So far we have not been obliged to have recourse to a blocking statute, we have not had to go to the WTO panel, though it is perfectly clear that in certain circumstances we would have no other choice.</p>
<p class="contents">I happen to think that at the moment it makes a lot more sense for me to try to persuade American senators, for me to try to persuade the American Administration to behave sensibly, than to throw up my hands and say we are going to go to the WTO. If the honourable Member has a better suggestion than going and trying to persuade Senator Helms – which I am not sure has been done recently – I would be delighted to hear in all humility what it is.

Not only does it seek to subjugate a proud race which insists on its right to self-determination; it also signals the wish on the part of the American imperialists, manifested on numerous occasions, to impose their will and their laws on the international economy, on international trade and on international business. This is why the Helms-Burton Act has met and continues to meet with general disapproval and demands for its immediate repeal, and rightly so.</p>
<p class="contents">What worries me is that the request for European undertakings to be exempted from the scope of this criminal legislation, however beneficial this may in fact be to European undertakings, fails to solve the problem. In essence, it is tantamount to acknowledgement of the Act, thereby detracting from the very pressure which we are exerting for its repeal. Do you not think, Commissioner, that the European Union should exert all its influence, using every means imaginable, to bring about the immediate repeal of this unacceptable Act, rather than confining itself to statements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our views on extraterritoriality are perfectly clear. We have made them clear again and again. We have also made clear – and you do not have to be a dyed-in-the-wool imperialist to take this view – that we are against expropriation of property. I imagine the honourable Member is against the expropriation of property as well. Sanctity of property rights has a great deal to do with the stability of plural societies. If, at the end of the day we can have a waiver of Title 4 under Helms-Burton and the triggering of the undertakings we gave in good conscience in May 1998 then that will be in everybody’s interests, it will prevent any trade dispute with the United States and it will give, I hope, investors around the world – not just in Cuba – greater certainty about what they are putting their money into. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

ECHO’s on-going aid amounts to EUR 5 million in two <span class="italic">tranches</span> of EUR 2 million and EUR 3 million. In addition ECHO is preparing a further decision to provide a significant amount for additional humanitarian assistance. These projects will cover food distribution, logistic support, water and sanitation, medical assistance, protection and security for the returnees and the transport of returnees from Dili to their place of origin. An essential element of humanitarian aid consists of food supply. A few days ago, the Commission reached agreement with the World Food Programme to supply 10,920 tons of maize and 1,240 tons of vegetable oil. This aid will cost EUR 8.5 million.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards our support for the UN administration the Commission intends to give EUR 10 million support to the new UN trust fund for East Timor. Consultations with Member States are already under way. The Commission should take a formal decision by the beginning of December. Another visible demonstration of the Commission’s priorities in helping East Timor is the forthcoming visit at the end of this month of my colleague in the Commission, Mr Nielson, to East and West Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the long-term prospects for rehabilitation the report of the Commission’s representative who participated in the World Bank-led assessment mission to East Timor will be evaluated as soon as he returns to Brussels tomorrow. The Commission will keep the European Parliament informed about this.</p>
<p class="contents">I see, incidentally, from this afternoon’s news agency reports that the World Bank has calculated after its mission that between USD 260 million and USD 300 million would be needed for medium-term reconstruction in ruined East Timor and that it will be seeking most of the funds from donors in Tokyo next month. We will be attending that donors’ conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I have no doubt at all that we will be expected to be sizeable contributors to the reconstruction of East Timor, though I imagine the honourable Member would agree with me that others should be contributors as well and I imagine that the honourable Member would also think it sensible for us to try to draw on the lessons of reconstruction activities elsewhere, not least in Kosovo to ensure that the money we deploy in East Timor is spent as effectively and rapidly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that it gives me very great confidence that Sergio Vieira de Mello is to be the UN administrator in East Timor – he is somebody that I worked with very closely in my previous occupation in Hong Kong dealing with the refugee and illegal immigrant problem there. He is a man of outstanding qualities and we will all look forward to supporting him in the very important work he has to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I just add this to the honourable Member – there is also an obligation on us to give some assistance to the new government in Indonesia as it tries to make the transition from authoritarianism to democracy. There are appalling social and environmental problems there – I would like to be able to help as much as possible. Then I look at the size of our Asia programme which runs at around EUR 350 million per year and I scratch my head about how we are going to be able to provide the level of assistance required to what may well be one of the very largest and most important democracies in the world. So I think we have to do our bit – in fact more than our bit – in East Timor and that we must also help in Indonesia about which we look forward to putting forward a communication to the Council in the early months of next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, that is by the by. The point is, it is only to be expected that, in a region in turmoil, there will be no particularly official record of the action, legal or otherwise, of certain systems with no legal status or authority. What is certain is that, if you were to inquire right now into the state of telecommunications in Kosovo, the answer would automatically come to light. You know full well that telecommunications in Kosovo, as a part of Serbia, were jointly owned by the Greek Telecommunications Organisation and the Italian company STET International and you also know full well what the situation is now. This investment is not therefore being protected. You know full well that the TREPCA mines were owned and operated by Mytilinaios and you know what the situation is now. And you should also consider in this respect that when the taxpayers of the European Union are asked to fund the reconstruction of Kosovo, while companies already established there are basically being threatened and have no protection, then this is a contradiction in terms and I would ask you to see it as such.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

KFOR is doing its best in extremely difficult circumstances and it deserves, for example, all our support in trying to ensure that there is no repetition of the sort of atrocity against both sides that has unfortunately disfigured life in Kosovo in the past.

It is about whether it is impossible to implement, it is about monitoring and there is also question about if the Commission is prepared to give renewed consideration to improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">This is my answer. The nitrates directive considers not only nitrogen from animal manure, but also from chemical fertilisers both as regards quantities supplied, see Article 5 and Annex III, and methods and periods of spreading and that is in Annexes II and III. The Commission is aware of the difficulties faced by several Member States in the implementation of this directive, but considers it to be an important element of its policy to tackle water pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context the Commission will continue to press for full implementation of the directive as requested by the Parliament resolution of 20 October 1998. The Commission is preparing monitoring and reporting guidelines with Member States which will allow comparisons and the aggregation of results and maps from the year 2000 when Member States report on the impact of their first action programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">A complete study of eutrophication and groundwater problems and vulnerable zones designation by Member States has already been achieved by the Commission. All the necessary tools for the sound management of nitrogen at field and watershed level can be found in the existing directive as soon as it is properly implemented in all intensive agriculture and livestock areas of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now you could, of course, wonder whether the Commission would consider a short-term revision of the directive. The Commission believes that the majority of measures that have to be taken by Member States, for example, transposition monitoring, designation and codes of good practice, action programmes and reporting are straightforward. Most of the measures of Annex II and III are very efficient in reducing losses of, for example, phosphorus from agriculture, and the future water framework directive will complete this with a tool of management plans at watershed level.</p>
<p class="contents">So, there is no need for new interim directives or the revision of the existing ones; instead we need increased pressure for their effective implementation at vulnerable zones and farm level. I think the directive could not be clearer, the problem still exists and is increasing, so we just have to continue along the same path. We have increased our legal pressure – 11 countries are currently concerned by infringement procedures at high level – the Court of Justice has recently condemned Italy and Spain, and thanks to this pressure things are now moving in a positive way.</p>
<p class="contents">All countries must now transpose the directive. A new designation of vulnerable zones has recently occurred for Spain, Greece, Italy and the UK and the action programme contents have been strengthened in a number of countries. A general improvement in the situation can thus be expected within the next few years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why Member States were given five years to prepare for adaptation and four more to achieve it and ensure the necessary reconversions were undertaken in a progressive fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of this, we have some problems, but a new delay would not change the social consequences of the necessary measures. So it is very important that the countries implement this directive.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Approval of Objective 2 proposals</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has asked the Member States for proposals for Objective 2 regions and programmes. Some Member States have submitted their plans for support regions in the manner required by the Regulations, but others have not.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital to the regions that the programmes should enter into force immediately at the beginning of the year 2000. EU aid has a significant impact on the development of the regional economy, and there should not, therefore, be any gap between the old and the new programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">How will the Commission proceed in its overall decision making with the aim of ensuring that countries which punctually forward their proposals for regions eligible for support and, subsequently, their Objective 2 programmes, do not suffer on account of other countries= delays? </p>

<p class="contents">As far as the list of eligible regions is concerned, Mr Pohjamo, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that the Commission sent a letter to the Member States on 1 July 1999, asking them to present their proposals by 31 August 1999. The least I can say is that we had not received many proposals by the time the deadline expired. So, Mr Pohjamo, I understand the concern which you are expressing, one which has been expressed most forcefully elsewhere by Mr Hatzidakis, the chairman, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">Is there a risk that the delays of some Member States in putting forward their proposals will penalise those who made efforts to respect the time limits better than the others? It is precisely so that we do not penalise the Member States who managed to submit their proposals at an earlier stage and in due form, complying with the terms of the Regulations, that the Commission has decided to approve the list in terms of groups of countries. So the Commission’s decision on eligible regions for Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Finland was taken on 26 October.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you, however, that this decision is a procedural one, since the Member States must be consulted via the committees, in accordance with the Regulations, before the final decision of the Commission may be taken. And it is only after the final decision that the programming process may begin, in negotiation between the Commission and the Member States. On this subject, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to say that the Commission shall exercise the utmost pragmatism in working in this programming. So, for example, as I recently indicated to the Greek authorities in Athens, in programming the future appropriations, we shall be taking into account in quite a substantial manner the tragic consequences of the recent earthquake. I may say the same, with reference to current events in France, regarding the equally tragic consequences of the floods which have just occurred in four French departments. We can adjust or adapt the total appropriations allocated to each of the countries of the Union in order to take current events, particularly when they have such disastrous consequences, into account.</p>
<p class="contents">The Regulations stipulate a period of four months for the economic development plans to be submitted by the national authorities, and a further period of five months for these proposals to be adopted. It is therefore expected that the first Objective 2 programmes shall be approved towards the middle of the year 2000. An identical process shall be followed for the eight remaining Member States to which Objective 2 still applies. However, due to the extended time limits for the approval of the lists – delays, as I have said, which the Commission is not responsible for – the programmes should be adopted in the second half of the year 2000, for most of these eight Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, not one programme will be in force by the 1 January 2000. I would, nonetheless, like to reassure the Members that may be concerned about this by specifying that there will be no interruption in the investment activity at local level since the resources for the current term, which has not yet run its course, must be committed in full by 31 December 1999. The implementation of projects for the previous period, which is due to expire on 31 December, will be continued for the next two years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Hatzidakis, there has been no change in the Commission’s position. In tragic circumstances, such as those which some years past affected Portugal or Italy and, more recently, Greece – which I recently visited twice, once, a month ago, with my fellow Commissioner, Anna Diamantopoulou, and again just a few days ago – we are basing our attitude on the same Regulations of the Structural Funds and we are being accountable. You cannot ask the Commission to do anything other than comply with the Regulations ourselves and ensure that they are complied with by others. </p>
<p class="contents">But, at the same, different responses are possible within the terms of these Regulations, and this is what I confirmed to the Prime Minister of your country, Mr Simitis, and to the other government ministers whom I met. Damage to public property in Greece following the latest earthquake on 6 September, and I am speaking from memory, are evaluated at approximately EUR 2.5 billion. In order not to compromise the considerable efforts undertaken in that country, particularly in terms of achieving budgetary stability, in preparation for its entry into the euro system, Greece called upon external appropriations of approximately EUR 1.9 billion. </p>
<p class="contents">We calculated that EUR 1 billion of public expenditure was eligible within the terms of the Regulations of the Structural Funds. Right now, without any change to the Regulations, and this is the best way, EUR 1 billion in public expenditure was eligible for European aid, within the framework of the total appropriations allocated to Greece. We are going to redistribute and redeploy these appropriations in order to carry out the works necessary in the aftermath of the earthquake, and these works shall be subsidised on average up to 80%. For the rest, your country is probably, in the near future, going to receive a loan in the amount of EUR 900 million at an extremely advantageous rate from the European Investment Bank. </p>
<p class="contents">My impression, then, and I mention this because it involves the question of solidarity among all the countries of the Union, is that, following the earthquake in Greece, there has been a good response in relation to material damage. It is not possible, naturally, to repair the human damage and the loss of life. No more than it is possible to do so in the context of the floods which have just struck France and which have caused dozens of deaths. I simply wish to say that in such cases I shall adopt a pragmatic approach in order to be able to adapt the programming of Objective 1 or Objective 2, according to the requests made by national authorities, in order to aid reconstruction in these countries. This is indeed a matter for regional development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of the remaining eight countries, the situation of the Federal Republic of Germany has been more or less finalised in the discussions which we are having. As far as the other seven, including Italy, are concerned, we still have to check, on the basis of the proposals received by my department, country by country, that the proposed zoning plan in fact meets all the criteria of the Regulations of the Structural Funds. This is what you must ask of the Commission, and this is what I strive to do in a pragmatic manner and in a spirit of cooperation with each of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We are having a rather specific and difficult discussion with Italy, given the zoning plan which we have received and which actually, in one specific respect, does not comply with one of the rules adopted by the Heads of State and Government at Berlin. I would like to specify, if I have time, that a great deal of flexibility for every Member State is acceptable, but, in the zoning plan which will be adopted definitively under Objective 2, we must find at least half of the population which was initially identified as resident in zones eligible according to Community criteria. The zoning plan which I have received does not completely meet that criterion.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore had a very serious discussion with Minister Amato several days ago, and we agreed to continue the discussion, in a constructive spirit, in order to reconcile our points of view. I may say that this meeting was a very positive one and that we shall continue to work, in the weeks to come, to come up with a zoning plan for Objective 2 from the various regions of Italy, which is compliant with the Regulations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council of the Union, in its joint action of 24 February 1997 relating to action against the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children requests Member States to revise the legislation and the practices in force in these areas in order to guarantee that the kinds of behaviour I have just referred to are subject to effective criminal punishment. At the end of this year, the progress achieved by Member States in this joint action will be debated in the Council. Since 1997, the Commission has been responsible for implementing the Daphne programme, which is specifically designed to combat violence against women, adolescents and children and which will be succeeded by the Daphne – 2000-2203 programme (approved this very day), which has the same objective. </p>
<p class="contents">Underlying these initiatives is the pressing need to defend human rights, especially those of women and children. By means of the action I have just mentioned, the Commission has supported a raft of initiatives relating to the structural causes of violence, particularly the practises and behaviour of men, as well as actions assisting and rehabilitating the victims. And the Commission will continue in its endeavour to develop initiatives to this effect. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also responsible for the STOP programme, the aim of which is to provide the necessary training and information for professionals, particularly judges, for police forces and for social services departments in the fight against the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of women. </p>
<p class="contents">Our main concern, apart from continuing in this direction, is to implement the Tampere European Council’s decision to come up with definitions, prosecutions and punishments for crimes of trading in human beings and crimes of abuse against children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is unfortunately the case that assaults upon women within the family are not illegal in all countries. It is important that there should be legislation of this kind. At the same time, it is also incredibly important to understand that it is men’s behaviour and attitudes which must be changed. It is on this matter that I should like to see the Commission take action. What, specifically, is one prepared to do to ensure that this structural cause of violence, that it to say, men’s behaviour, is changed? What is one prepared to do to ensure that those countries which do not have legislation outlawing domestic violence against women in fact obtain such legislation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And this punishment is really the responsibility of each Member State’s legal system. The time to assess the situation that you have just described will be when, before the end of the year, the Council evaluates the results of the 1997 joint action on combating violence against women. </p>
<p class="contents">As you have said, Mrs Theorin, and I agree with you, there are many different causes of violence: there are social causes, cultural causes, economic causes, and, at times, even political attitudes are to blame. And, of course, it is against the causes that we must act. It is true that, not just at the national level but also at the Community level, the main strategy that can be developed is that of reporting incidents, alerting people and providing information, all of which must be done by non-governmental organisations; we feel that the aim to which we have dedicated ourselves is to raise the awareness of public authorities, the police, to whom complaints are made or not made, and the judges, who have to judge each specific case, so that they all understand the criminal significance of violence against women, even when it is perpetrated within the family. And I think that some of the future Daphne programme’s concrete strategies will respond precisely to this concern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Changing the law is a very important instrument to fight violence against women and children, but we need to go further.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Andalusia and the EU's new border policies</span></p>
<p class="contents">There is an ever-increasing demand in Andalusia for EU action to deal with the major problems that are appearing there, on what is one of the Union=s southern borders. Andalusia is a comparatively disadvantaged region which is faced on a daily basis with disturbances arising from extremely high levels of illegal immigration, while it lacks the proper means to tackle, alleviate or resolve these problems. These are not local problems of Andalusia as such: they derive from the Union=s borders, and the responsibility for dealing with them should therefore lie squarely with the Union. However, to date the costs arising have been borne almost exclusively by this Objective 1 region (which should be a beneficiary, not a provider of funds), and it has proved virtually impossible to plan the financing of effective border policies. The Tampere European Council did indeed raise these problems, but has this been reflected in any concrete measures? Will action finally be taken on the demands concerning economic and social development in northern Morocco and interregional cooperation programmes?</p>
<p class="contents">What concrete measures does the Commission intend to adopt in the forthcoming months with a view to introducing practical improvements on the Union=s Andalusian frontier? What EU budget resources are to be allocated, and via which specific programmes? </p>

<p class="contents">Its conclusions define the elements of a global approach, which it is important to put into practice straight away. To this effect, the Commission will have a special responsibility, both with regard to providing appropriate initiatives and generally following up the implementation of guidelines through its “scoreboard” system.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the main political conclusions of the Extraordinary meeting of the Heads of State and Government targets the need, in aiming for a genuine migration policy, to move beyond the traditional limits of justice and internal affairs and to have recourse to a series of instruments within the scope of other Union policies, an idea that has been promoted by the Commission since 1994 and which has always merited the support of the European Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">The same thing applies to relations with third countries of origin and of transit. The European Council confirmed the renewal of the high level group’s mandate on asylum and immigration, whilst insisting that the plans already adopted be implemented. </p>
<p class="contents">You all know that one of these plans concerns Morocco and includes numerous recommendations, particularly in the area of economic development, which are in line with the concerns expressed in Mrs Izquierdo Rojo’s question. </p>
<p class="contents">Over the next few weeks, the Commission, in close collaboration with Member States, will be making an inventory of the measures currently in force or still to be adopted that are likely to contribute to the implementation of the measures to which I just referred. I do not think, then, that it can be considered that this initiative constitutes the Commission’s only contribution in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the Commission has for several years paid special attention to the development of the provinces in Northern Morocco, at a time when technical and financial cooperation with the Kingdom of Morocco has been implemented. In this way, around half the funds of the MEDA programme were allocated to these northern provinces between 1996 and 1999, and this represents projects to a total value of EUR 330 million. </p>
<p class="contents">Apart from this, under the third and fourth financial protocols as well as under other budget headings, several projects have been or are taking place in this region at a cost equivalent to more than EUR 80 million. In addition to this, the Community initiative INTERREG-II has already financed cooperation actions between Spain and Morocco during the current programming period, including a specific cross-border programme between Andalusia and Morocco.

I am sure that the Commission will guarantee the cohesion of the Union’s external and internal policy – of cross-border programmes and development aid programmes – and also that it is in the interest of the States benefiting from cross-border cooperation – Morocco and Spain – that proposals be put forward which will address the same concern. I believe that this new approach to the coordination of internal and external policies, and of the programmes which are related to one or other of those policies, may be a very positive step forward in terms of Union action in these fields. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Transport policy/aviation</span></p>
<p class="contents">Delays are becoming an increasingly common feature of air traffic in Europe. According to the latest IATA statistics, the number of air passengers in Europe has risen by 6% in 1999. This has been accompanied by a 74% increase in the number of delays. The EU is not prepared for the twofold increase in the number of aircraft movements that is set to take place over the next ten years. Events this summer gave an indication of the chaos that could soon be commonplace.</p>
<p class="contents">There are currently 66 national and local air traffic control centres in Europe. What is needed is a common European airspace and a joint air traffic control system. Given that there is little time left, the Commission must act immediately.</p>

<p class="contents">We really need to make progress in this area if we want to provide real solutions to the problems we are faced with. And I believe that all of you, as regular air passengers, know exactly what we are talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is completing a communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the delays which have occurred in air traffic management. To this end, I intend to present an action plan specifically to promote real changes which can respond to the demands which we have to address. Without anticipating the Council’s final decision, it is clear that our objective is no less than that of creating a single European airspace: fifteen countries under one sky. How can we achieve this?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there are measures under way which must be pursued and promoted, such as the European Community joining Eurocontrol, a process which will not only call for greater political responsibility on the part of the European Union but also that the last convention will be implemented and therefore measures may be adopted by majority voting, by majorities and not the systematic use of unanimous assent. We do not believe that this measure is a panacea, but we think that it is essential in responding to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in the area of Eurocontrol, and not only in that of Eurocontrol but also in other areas, we must guarantee efficiency and transparency in the operations of air service providers and furthermore clearly separate regulatory responsibilities from the provision of services. Air traffic management cannot be an exception in relation to the other public service sectors which have had to face up to the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a third aspect to be dealt with: better distribution of the civil and military use of the airspace of the fifteen countries. In that respect, there is a need for greater flexibility and greater cooperation in order improve management and the use of that airspace. The ambition is to try to prevent the chaos which, according to all the forecasts, we are inevitably going to suffer during the next summer season. To this end, I intend to deal with this issue at the next Ministerial meeting of the European Civil Aviation Authority Conference, which will take place on 28 January, and, as I mentioned before, the Commission’s communication on this subject will be presented to Parliament at the end of this year and to the Council of Transport Ministers, specifically at the meeting of 6 December. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is now really however a question of translating words into action. Where this is concerned, we naturally have high hopes of the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact that air traffic over Europe has seen a period of very considerable delays. This is to a very large extent due to the fact that the number of flights is increasing very dramatically just now. This year alone, the increase has been close on 6%. If delays are to be avoided, what is now really required is the ability to take political action. It is only to be hoped that the Commission has this. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner is saying here that we need to ensure that we get a common system of air traffic control in Europe. I think that is extremely important. In the long term, we cannot have 66 different national or local bodies dealing with the matter. Instead, one body is needed. I therefore think it is good that the Commissioner is now talking along those lines. Allow me just to ask a short follow-up question. When does the Commissioner consider we are likely to have implemented such a system? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If I obtain the support of the Commission, the intention would be to promote a high level group in which the main civil authorities would participate, and the military would perhaps have to take part, in order to help the Commission to develop suitable guidelines. But that is not all. We would also need to promote a dialogue with the principal operators – not only air companies and users, but also air traffic controllers and all the airports etc. That is to say, all those operators who participate within the complex world of air traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">As you have said, some of the delays can be attributed to air traffic control, to the management of air traffic, which accounts for more or less 50% of the delays, and the other 50% is shared between air companies and internal problems in the management of the airports themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">But I believe that we should act on all fronts. We should act in the short term with urgent measures. This includes achieving distribution and greater flexibility in the management of airspace in its civil and military uses – and in certain countries this can be achieved with a certain speed, we have to promote it and we are working on it – and, also in the short term, intervening in the management by airports and air companies of their flight forecasts and the organisation of their flights, in order to improve the use and efficiency of airport slots. But we also have to act in the medium term, I insist, with a more ambitious measure; this single airspace and this common management of the single airspace by the fifteen Members. And then we will make it more extensive, within the framework of Eurocontrol as well. It will cover wider European areas given that a larger number of these countries are asking to join the Union and will become part of it in the years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As always, this authorisation implied certain obligations on the part of the company, obligations intended to guarantee the genuine recovery of the company and limit the impact on competition and the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, these obligations have not been fulfilled and, consequently, the Commission had to reopen the case in 1996.

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the report on the reorganisation presented in April of this year indicated that the financial results of the company were below the forecasts.

This aid was given on the condition that the companies were managed commercially – and therefore that the administrations and authorities of those countries would not be involved – that a suitable process of reorganisation would be carried out and that, finally, we would have viable companies which could develop without the need for new public aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality is that – according to the information provided by the Greek authorities themselves – there has been an excessive involvement of the Greek administration in the management of the company, and the commitments of 1998 should have put an end, once and for all, to this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The granting of aid other than that authorised, which has happened over recent years, has been aimed, above all, at the funding of the social element of the reorganisation plan, and specifically supplementary compensation for employees made redundant. Therefore, there was a reduction in the aid authorised in 1998, in such a way that the total allocation did not increase. It is considered that this aid for social purposes should be deducted from the total amount which was granted to Olympic Airways.</p>
<p class="contents">And lastly, I have to say that the financial results of the company in 1998 are disappointing. They have led to the current Greek authorities taking a very important decision, specifically the appointment of a new board of directors, turning to experts from other companies – that is, Speedway, a subsidiary of British Airways – which must update the company’s recovery plan and which, I am sure, will be able to offer us over the next month, sufficient information and the necessary guarantees so that, once and for all, we can authorise the last batch of aid to Olympic Airways and ensure that it takes off correctly and takes to the air without any great problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the exception of the rights of itinerant workers and the coordination of regulations concerning them, the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> relating to social security is not very extensive. As the Commission’s Communication of 14 July 1999 on the modernisation of social security systems shows, efforts are being made to further develop the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. The applicant countries must be incorporated into this process.</p>
<p class="contents">In its annual reports, which were presented to the Council and Parliament on 13 October, the Commission draws up a balance in this regard for the situation in the applicant countries. The Commission establishes that although modernisation in the social sector and in health is generally only progressing slowly, efforts are being made to achieve strong social security nets.</p>
<p class="contents">Changes have recently been made in the social security systems and health insurance systems in Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Bulgaria and Poland. These are considerable, but they are still not enough. This leads the Commission to continue to implement the reform programmes for the social security systems in the applicant countries. These programmes are known as Consensus 1 and Consensus 2. They are to be continued in addition to the technical aid which most of these countries have already received in the form of national PHARE appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">From the year 2000 the reform and modernisation of the social security systems in the applicant countries might also be supported with the Consensus 3 programme. As of this year, i.e. 1999, this sector will be given EUR 18.6 million in support. These funds are for institutional improvements in the social sector in the accession countries, the policy of partnerships playing an important role.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of accession partnerships the strengthening of administrative structures for coordinating social security in the States of Romania, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Cyprus, Slovakia, Malta, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia has been given medium-term priority. The European Commission has also repeatedly pointed out to the applicant countries the useful role which social partners could play in the accession process and has also reminded them that greater consideration for social problems means that it is necessary to develop social dialogue in the applicant countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The controls on external borders and the visa policy of the EU were treated within the framework of Chapter 24 of the accession negotiations concerning cooperation in the sectors of justice and internal affairs.

That is the whole point, but under certain preconditions. Firstly, with regard to the visa obligation we do not want to allow any exceptions. The Council regulation is clear on this. If we make exceptions here, then we are giving up the basic principle of a uniform area of freedom, security and justice. I must point out at this juncture, as you have rightly said, that the subject is highly sensitive. The sensitivity is not just in the fact that it is difficult for the candidates to implement this. The greatest sensitivity is in the fact that I know a number of Member States which will not accept enlargement unless there is total clarity in this matter. We need not just the agreement of the candidate countries, but also of the Member States, and for most Member States this is a crucial point on which no compromise is possible.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to controls on external borders, the applicant countries expect that on accession they will take on and apply the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> of the EU, as I have said.

It has been said by another party which previously governed, a large opposition party, that there could be membership à la carte; there is talk of a status being accorded which is akin to that of Turkey, of a political discount, and I would like to ask you whether you consider such thinking plausible or whether you presuppose full implementation of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> <span class="italic">communautaire</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If I tell you that it was not sent to me and that no mention was made of it at the discussions in Prague, then you must believe me.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Good, then I am satisfied. It sounded otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the question: I had a detailed discussion with the Chairpersons of the parties which you mentioned last week in Prague. I also had discussions with other leading members of these parties. I would not describe this in the harsh way that you did as the policy of the largest non-governing party in the Czech Republic, since that is who we are talking about. Nevertheless, it is known that the previous Prime Minister Klaus, who is the leader of this party, has different views on the nature of the European Union from the current government and most of the parties represented in the Czech parliament. From the point of view of the EU, I can only say that the same applies to the Czech Republic as to all other candidates. The strategy is that the applicant countries must and wish to become full members with full rights and with full responsibilities. The completely mistaken notion of membership <span class="italic">à la carte</span>, partial membership or anything else was at no time and in no place suggested by representatives of the Czech Republic in the negotiations with the Commission. We are negotiating with the Czech Republic as with all others.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with your question I would like to also point out that I have a certain hope that the extremely marked polarisation in the Czech Republic will prove surmountable. In any case, the result of my visit last week was that, interestingly, all the parties represented in the parliament, including the extreme right and the extreme left, publicly declared, on the occasion of my visit, that they support the government’s policy of European integration. It was very interesting to hear that they support this policy and, this is the crucial point, are prepared to rapidly develop processes which can ensure that the very complex procedure of aligning Czech laws can be carried out somewhat quicker in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
