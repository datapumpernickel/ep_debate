<p class="contents">The Council plans to focus on five important entities. First, how to advance the matter of the institutional changes which the European Union needs and which the Convention on the Future of Europe has been processing since March 2002. Secondly, foreign policy and defence issues, with particular emphasis on the points of transatlantic relations, the formulation of a strategic perception on Union security issues and the issue of weapons of mass destruction. Thirdly, immigration, asylum and external border issues, which you know the Greek Presidency has an interest in, and their increasing importance to the Union over the last five years. Fourthly, issues relating to the strategy on employment and the Lisbon strategy in general, which the Council needs to address, and a fifth entity for the day after the Council, in other words Saturday 21 June, which concerns the Union's policy on the western Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, over and above these five entities, the Council will not omit to discuss and take appropriate decisions on a series of other issues. However, I shall confine myself mainly to the thematic entities I have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the first thematic entity concerns the institutional changes which are being processed by the Convention and the steps which need to follow. As a result of enlargement, the Treaty for which was signed in Athens on 16 April, there is the urgent problem of the changes which have to move forward so that the European Union does not fall into the ugly trap of having inflexible institutions which are unable to operate efficiently and creatively. That is why the issues of the Convention on the Future of Europe are major issues for the Council and the Union in general.</p>
<p class="contents">As agreed at the informal Council in April, the Convention, through its chairman, is expected to present the results of its work, which has lasted about 15 months. The Greek Presidency has managed, following special, multiple agreements, to ensure that the timetable given to the Convention by the Copenhagen Council is kept to. Ideas and proposals have been submitted. The dialogue can continue, but at some point we must conclude. This conclusion will obviously not happen under the Greek Presidency, but we expect the leaders to exchange views and decide on the order for the Intergovernmental Conference, and for the bridge to the final stage to be completed under the Greek Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The final product of the Convention will therefore be submitted to the Thessaloniki Council. It is not the Council's role to take material decisions; its role is to decide how the order will be given to the Intergovernmental Conference to start up work, so that we have a result which is accepted by everyone, which will be a common denominator and will constitute the institutional framework which will determine the course of the Union for several years to come. We need to make sure, when the time comes, that this common denominator is not a lowest common denominator, is not a change of limited importance, but is a denominator that will guarantee a dynamic course for an enlarged Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek Presidency plans to hold a discussion on the material aspects of this item so that there is an exchange of views, so that a picture of national positions is formed before the Intergovernmental Conference and, of course, so that decisions are taken on procedural issues relating to the subsequent stages of the procedure. The timetable of work for the Intergovernmental Conference is an important issue. In order to determine the timetable, account must also be taken of the obligation of certain Member States to hold an internal dialogue on the outcome of the Convention. We estimate that, around autumn, this procedure should have been completed, the Intergovernmental Conference should proceed and its work should be completed on time so that the period between the date of enlargement, in May 2004, and the entry into force of the new institutional framework is as short as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In all events, progress with the work of the Convention allows me to express certain views on a series of points. The debate on the institutional architecture of enlarged Europe started by identifying the need for greater efficiency. Everyone is convinced that we need to adapt the institutional structure and operations to the needs of a bigger Union, while maintaining all the principles on which the European unification endeavour is based. The drafting of a Constitutional Treaty is a quantum qualitative leap which is due in large part to the efforts made in the Convention. However, we must say that it also expresses the will of the European citizens. Its strength depends on two basic elements: on its more democratic functioning and on more efficient decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">I should particularly like to welcome the fact that, during the work of the Convention, a significant degree of agreement has been noted on a series of basic issues, such as, for example, the strengthening of the role of the European Parliament, the introduction of a single international legal personality for the Union, the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Constitutional Treaty and the further communitisation of the area of freedom, security and justice. The view that we can achieve better democratic credentials for the Union without creating new institutions or bodies was also broadly accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">An enlarged Europe should result in a stronger international presence. This means finding solutions, such as a more coordinated way of using foreign policy resources and the creation of a person who will unite the responsibilities of the High Representative with those of the Commissioner responsible for foreign policy. As you know, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is under way. Over and above the various approaches expressed in plenary at the Convention, it is, I think, important for us to maintain a balance between the Union's institutions, to safeguard the equality of the Member States, to make further use of the advantages of the Community method and to strengthen the democratic character of a Union of states and peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">In all events, I think that the Convention has been a success, taking decisions on a series of difficult issues outstanding from previous Intergovernmental Conferences. It goes without saying that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will have to take account of the decisions on which there was agreement and it is important in the final stage of work for there to be a spirit of compromise, for the authority of the Convention to be preserved and for the strong result which the Union so badly needs to be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">As I mentioned earlier, a second important area of work for the June Council has to do with developments over this entire period on the particularly crucial issue of foreign policy, which includes the question of relations between states. The EU/USA summit will be held in Washington a few days after the Council. It will be an opportunity to discuss issues which are important to both sides, to cooperate and address serious issues concerning international and/or bilateral developments and to overturn the climate which has often prevailed over all these recent months.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations between the European Union and the United States depend on traditional ties, the weighty role of the two sides on the international stage and their dynamism, despite the fact that over recent months they have been put to the test by a divergence of opinion on a series of issues. All we Member States, however, consider that what unites us is more than what divides us and that it is in everyone's mutual interest that we work together.</p>
<p class="contents">At the last meeting in Gymnich, we had a very useful discussion. We believe that the image of our relations with the United States should improve and should better reflect the real state of our relations. That is why we are working hard to ensure that the next summit, the agenda for which will be discussed at the Thessaloniki Summit, will be an important step in the further development of our strategic relations, so that we can meet the challenges of our times together.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues of Iraq, transatlantic relations and international developments in general recently created new challenges in the field of the European security and defence policy. In this sector, we will need to be in a position to develop a common perception of the new security environment and be able to deal efficiently with new challenges and threats. The Ministers for Foreign Affairs, at their informal meeting at the beginning of May, instructed the Union's High Representative to prepare a general report on the new security environment, the challenges and threats arising from it and the ways in which the Union can deal with them, to be submitted for initial discussion at the European Council in Thessaloniki. Similarly, the European Council expects to adopt the Presidency's progress report on the European security and defence policy, together with the annual report concerning the implementation of the Union's programme on the prevention of violent conflicts, which forms the cornerstone of the Union's security mechanism. The issue of weapons of mass destruction, which is linked with the foregoing, is also one of the important items on the agenda and, of course, I think that it will stay there, given that the proliferation of these weapons is a major challenge for the international question.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from the conclusions of the European Council in Seville, the Presidency also intends to bring a series of issues concerning immigration, asylum and external borders which, as you know, were basic priorities of our Presidency, to the attention of the heads of state during the June Council. Considerable progress has been made. The Council managed to bring about political agreement on the directive on family reunification and we believe that we shall manage to achieve political agreement on the directive on long-term residents and the related directive defining refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, we sought a global review of the question of immigration in the sense of both legal and illegal immigration. In an effort to formulate a single European policy on the issues of legal immigration and asylum, the Presidency also attached particular importance to the issue of the integration of third country nationals. We intend, together with the Commission, to formulate conclusions for Thessaloniki on the basis of the Commission communication on the development of a common policy on illegal immigration, people trafficking, the issue of external borders and the return of illegal immigrants, again in conjunction with the question of dividing the burden. The Presidency also intends to seek political agreement on including immigration as a necessary parameter in the evaluation of third country cooperation with the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the spring European Council, which was held under difficult economic and political developments, measures also need to be taken to implement decisions reached within the framework of the Lisbon strategy in March 2000, especially now that we are one third of the way through the process and a great deal still remains to be done. At the March Council, we decided to promote the application of a series of policies on employment, innovation, entrepreneurship and other policies. That is why one central issue in Thessaloniki will be the approval of certain guidelines, such as the revised European strategy on employment, recording progress made on various targets concerning, for example, public takeover bids, energy issues and environmental liability and the adoption of the package on the reform of the common agricultural policy, despite the fact that it is difficult today to forecast the final outcome of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the western Balkans. As far as the western Balkans and their relations with the Union are concerned, our programme targets a set of priorities, especially the strengthening of their progress towards European structures and European conditions. The fact that the western Balkans have remained high on the Union's list of priorities despite the adverse climate over recent months is an achievement on the part of the Union and also illustrates the major political importance we attach to the region. This interest has been manifested in real terms through the stability and association process, as well as in the political sector and in the security sector, with the two operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the FYROM.</p>
<p class="contents">Reconstruction of the western Balkans has been based on regional cooperation and the role of the stability pact is important in this direction. I shall refer in particular to the Presidency's initiative, within the framework of the south-eastern Europe cooperation process and the stability pact, to create a crisis and conflict prevention and early warning mechanism which will mainly emphasise the importance of economic and social development as a deterrent. The stability and association process remains the basic element in the Union's policy in the countries of the Balkans and, in our efforts to support this policy, stock was recently taken in Croatia of what has been achieved under the stability pact, the main objective being to coordinate actions under the pact in order to complement the stability and association process. Democratisation, reconciliation and regional cooperation, on the one hand, and the rapprochement of each of these countries with the Union, on the other hand, constitute a single entity.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objectives for the western Balkans have been agreed by the Commission and the Member States and the five countries in the region. The Council and the Commission are working to implement these objectives with specific operational conclusions. The relevant decisions are due to be adopted at the General Affairs Council on 16 June. The European Parliament will approve these decisions and, in this way, we look forward to marking a crucial point in our relations with the western Balkans, with a text of conclusions not only expressing the political will to support the European prospects of the countries in the region, but also containing an operational outline for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the European Council will confirm that the European future of these countries lies mainly in their own hands and in their commitment to implementing the necessary reforms. The stability and association process, an integral part of which is the principle of conditionality, continues to give us the necessary institutional framework. Enriching this process with elements of the recent enlargement experience will reinforce the evaluation, reform and control mechanisms on the basis of the 1997 conditionality and the Copenhagen criteria. In this spirit of further development, the Commission has proposed a specific means, the European integration partnerships. Inspired by the pre-accession procedure and adapted to the requirements of each country, they will indicate priorities and obligations which need to be honoured on a regular basis and will act as a guide for financial support via CARDS. The decision to adopt this mechanism is again expected to be taken at the General Affairs Council and the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the operational actions that will be discussed at the summit, particular importance is also being attached to the questions of justice and internal affairs, especially combating organised crime. We are seeking an evaluation of the achievements of the countries in the region in order to draw up lists of their specific obligations on these issues for the future. Specific actions will also be proposed on other horizontal issues, such as the return of refugees, the fight against unemployment, the liberalisation of trade and the protection of religious and cultural monuments.</p>
<p class="contents">An important precondition if we are to achieve efficient stabilisation in the region consists of strengthening European funding and placing greater emphasis on development measures. The decisions taken by the Thessaloniki Council will also be reflected in the Thessaloniki declaration which is expected to be signed by the interested parties on 21 June. Within this political forum, which follows on from the Zagreb summit in 2000, we intend to renew a political dialogue which will complete the existing framework and will also emphasise the responsibility of the countries of the western Balkans in the overall process.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above these basic parameters which the European Council will address, I might refer very briefly to certain other issues which are of particular importance. Following the historic ceremony of the signing of the enlargement treaty on 16 April, new impetus was given to this process and a basic stage in its overall course was completed. The ratification procedure for the 10 countries is proceeding smoothly, as is reinforced monitoring of the application of the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. At the same time, accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania are making satisfactory progress. With Turkey, we are in the process of completing the accession strategy in accordance with the Copenhagen decisions. It is therefore expected that the European Council will take note of the progress which has been made and will adopt the necessary guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not refer to other matters which will obviously occupy the Council on a running basis. I should just like to point out that, in an effort to bring European citizens closer to European developments, the Greek Presidency is dealing with the proposal for European political parties as a matter of high priority and is making every effort so that negotiations in the Council will be completed before the Thessaloniki European Council. I am particularly pleased that an overall consensus on organising an agreement on better legislation was reached yesterday and, consequently, we shall also have the presentation of this agreement to the Thessaloniki Council. I should like to close by noting that the Presidency has tried and will make a final effort to see if perhaps a solution can also be found to the question of the MEP statute. We shall see how this develops. I cannot prejudge anything.</p>

As the event is so important, my intervention today will be entirely devoted to this subject, and I am certain that the ensuing debate will provide much encouragement and many suggestions for the final, extremely delicate, stages of the Convention’s work.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, with just a few days to go before the Convention closes, I would like to thank all those who have represented this assembly at the Convention. Your commitment has been, and will be decisive for the future of this delicate process. I would also like to thank President Simitis and Mr Yiannitsis, as well as their team, for their patient mediation work which will culminate at Thessaloniki and I hope the results will be positive.</p>
<p class="contents">It was not so long ago that the Commission and Parliament strongly propounded a Convention on the future of Europe. Today we have the opportunity to establish our first true Constitution from a democratic debate taking place in the full light of day. Together, ladies and gentlemen, we sought the Convention and together we must strive for its success.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention must put forward a balanced text with no alternatives, a text that lays the foundations for Europe for many years to come, guaranteeing our presence and independence on the international stage. If we did not achieve this, the risks would be enormous. If we leave the decisions on a number of crucial issues to the intergovernmental conference, we risk a rerun of the sorry experience of Nice. That would be an ironic turn of fate because we wanted the Convention precisely because we were not satisfied with Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you of the original ideas behind this great reform of our policies and our Institutions. In December 2001, the Laeken Declaration established the Convention and gave it the task of preparing the ground for the Intergovernmental Conference as broadly and openly as possible. The Laeken Declaration sets three main objectives: firstly, a better division and definition of European Union competences; secondly, simplification of our legal instruments and action; thirdly, making the Union more democratic, transparent and efficient. The basic aim is to assert the values pursued by the Union, define citizens’ fundamental rights and duties and clarify the relationship between Member States within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention, therefore, came into being with a Herculean task, an extremely difficult task ahead of it. Nevertheless, we must also admit that in almost half a century we have built up an astonishing wealth of institutional and lawmaking experience and we have developed a style of politics that is unique on the world scene and of which we should be proud.</p>
<p class="contents">So the Convention’s brief is clear: it must define more clearly who does what in the European Union. This means striking a new balance between the Institutions so that Europe can play its part in a globalised world, but a balance that is easy to grasp for our citizens. Parliament and the Council must have joint legislative power, requiring the general extension of codecision; the Court of Justice must hold<span class="bold"> </span>judicial power, and in this respect I am in favour of extending its jurisdiction to foreign policy and to the area of justice and home affairs; lastly, in addition to clarification of its legislative power, the Union needs a single executive: the Commission. Under the control of the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission should apply legislation, implement policies and represent the Union externally, except in matters relating to the Common Security and Defence Policy. Duplicating the executive would not provide European citizens with the necessary transparency and accountability, and the executive would escape your control, Parliament’s control.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point, however, that I must stress as being of prime importance: the general application of majority voting as a decisive and determining element of the political will to act with democracy and efficiency. Without this we will lack democracy and efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest version of the draft Constitutional Treaty, published by the Convention, contains some, perhaps many, good proposals: the Charter of Fundamental Rights is firmly enshrined as Part Two of our Constitution; the scope of the codecision process has been extended, although not far enough; lastly, it is now clear that we will have a Foreign Minister to represent the Union at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">We must continue to push ahead on other issues, however: firstly, the requirement for unanimity has not been repealed. I must stress this point too: this is the basic issue on which the whole future effectiveness of the Institutions depends, because the right of veto can only bring deadlock in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The best solution – there may also be second best solutions – is double simple-majority voting – that is, half the Member States and half of the population: easily comprehensible, straightforward and clear. This is the system we prefer because it reflects the dual legitimacy of the Union which – I would remind you – is based on agreement between the States and the shared will of the peoples. I repeat, the fundamental point is to eliminate the right to veto, for which we are paying an unacceptable political price, both in internal and international policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the issue of a stable Presidency of the European Council is still unresolved. The solution put forward in the latest draft of the Constitution has three drawbacks: first of all, there is the fundamental problem of legitimacy, of accountability, as it is unclear to whom such a President would report, which is fundamental for democracy; in addition, it weakens your role, the European Parliament’s role, because this assembly rightly has power of control over the Commission, but not over the Council or its President. So this philosophy is asymmetrical; it is a weak kind of democracy that we are considering, that this draft is considering. We cannot accept this! Last, but certainly not least, it would create another executive within the Council which would end up generating confusion between Community competences. So no simplification of instruments here, and even less clarity about who does what within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Keeping that picture and these three basic objections in mind, we are open to various solutions, ranging from maintaining the rotating Presidency to creating a post of Chairman, purely and simply ‘Chairman’, to make the Council more efficient technically. More generally, what counts is laying the basis for effectively combining what cannot go beyond intergovernmental cooperation today and our firmly established Community mechanisms, something which does not, however, come out of the draft. This cannot be achieved by dividing and fragmenting these two dimensions, but rather by interlinking them, and providing for possible future development towards more unitary formulae, such as that of a future President of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be creative, imaginative and have a sense of time and the future. Today we already have the Union’s Foreign Minister as a practical example to work with. The person holding this post will represent the Union for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, while we want the Commission, as I just said, to continue to represent it in all other areas. This explains the proposal for a dual nature of the Foreign Minister and why he must be a Commissioner if the idea is to work, albeit a Commissioner with special status as regards the CFSP. The Foreign Minister will therefore need to work closely with the College and, in particular, with the President of the Commission and must have the backing of a genuine European service.</p>
<p class="contents">This structure must be linked administratively with the Commission so that it can work together with the other Commission departments in order to make optimum use of knowledge, resources and action in all sectors linked to foreign policy in the strict sense. The Union’s external representation will thus be truly unitary and able to utilise Community and intergovernmental instruments effectively, and this will give us the international influence and role we should have.</p>
<p class="contents">This, ladies and gentlemen, is a practical example of how the intergovernmental and Community dimensions should be combined. The events of the last few months have taught us one thing: until we put an end to our divisions, we will continue to be an economic giant and a political dwarf on the world stage; indeed, when you are a political dwarf for too long, you cease to be an economic giant.</p>
<p class="contents">Before closing, I want to raise one last point: we need the right institutional instruments to strengthen our economic policies, precisely to prevent us being sidelined on the economy too. In this context, one can legitimately wonder whether one option for a workable combination of today’s intergovernmental and Community mechanisms would not be for the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs to chair the Eurogroup and represent the euro area externally in international institutions. This calls for a strong person, someone who will continuously represent the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, that sums up what I wanted to say today. There are many things I could add, but I have sought to confine myself to the essential points so that there is more time for debate. I would just like to say a few, final words to thank the Greek Presidency. They have shown determination, effectiveness, understanding and sensitivity to the various points of view – a model of how we should work together. This leads me to make a further remark – which may seem ill-disposed but which on the contrary is sincere, indeed absolutely sincere – that is, that institutional engineering formulae may provide a rational explanation why the rotation system cannot function. I repeat: perhaps they can explain it, but no formula can replace the enthusiasm and intelligence of policy-makers who put their national cultural heritage at the service of Europe’s common interest.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   –<span class="italic"> (DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the President of the Commission received such warm applause, because he has really earned it. He deserved that warm applause for his comments, which were based on the Community method, and I too would like to focus my contribution on the Convention. I would first like to thank all our representatives to the Convention and its Chairman, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, very sincerely for all the work they have done up to now, although we have not reached our goal yet. If such clear progress had not been made over the past week, we might have found ourselves concerned about the risk of failure today. But I no longer have any such fears. Nevertheless, we need to make still further progress.</p>
<p class="contents">My group firmly believes that there should be an agreed and definitive draft for the constitution, without any options. We do not want a proposal to emerge from the Convention that could be reopened by the Intergovernmental Conference. No, we want a final draft, a definitive programme, which we hope will then meet with the agreement of the governments. And there is one thing that we want above all: the preamble refers to our Greek and Roman heritage and to the Enlightenment, but we must insist that our Christian heritage is also referred to in the preamble of the European constitution, forming as it does part of our identity today.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">We as the European Parliament demand equal rights in framing all European legislation, and we also demand that we should share budget rights with the Council, including medium-term financial planning.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Commission, we want a strong Commission, and we welcome the suggestion that the President should be proposed by the Heads of State and Government on the basis of the election results, and that Parliament should then choose the President of the Commission. We want a strong Commission, because it, together with Parliament, and of course with the European Court of Justice, forms the heart of the European Community. We are also calling for the Convention to find a solution as regards the size of the Commission, a solution that ensures that the Commission is able to act, but one that also ensures that all the Member States of the European Union are represented in the Commission. I say that because all Member States, large and small, want a place at the Commission table. It is quite possible to think of mechanisms, including both rotation and junior Commissioners, that allow not only the large Member States but also the small ones to have a place at the Commission table. This is of great psychological importance for our common European project.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also calling for the European Foreign Minister, who is at the same time to be the Vice-President of the Commission, to be subject – together with the entire Commission – to a vote of approval by Parliament. A situation in which the Foreign Minister has no link with Parliament is not acceptable. He too needs to have Parliament’s approval and confidence, and that is why we want him to be linked into the Commission as a whole, which will then have to be approved by us.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Council is concerned, I can very largely agree with what the President of the Commission and of course with what the President-in-Office of the Council has said, not in every detail, but in their broad thrust. In instances where the Council is acting as the legislature, we need genuine transparency, and, as a legislature, the Council must as a matter of principle take decisions by majority vote.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings us to the issue of the presidency of the European Council. The Convention Praesidium's proposal contains a formula according to which the President of the European Council should not belong to another institution. This is just a personal opinion, but I believe it would be a good thing if this sentence were to be deleted. We need to keep open the option that one day, if we can reach that point, the President of the European Commission can also be the President of the European Council. That is why I hope that this sentence, which still figures in the proposal, will finally be deleted.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to give my full support to the proposals for the European Court of Justice, for which I would specifically like to thank you, Mr Prodi. All or virtually all actions of the European Union must be subject to European law, because only if they are subject to court rulings will European actions be based on law rather than political opportunism. That is why it is so important that most areas of common European action, with very few exceptions, should be based on law and subject to control by the European Court of Justice. Only in that way will we become a genuine community of law. The same should apply to home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank you, Mr President-in-Office, for saying that the Greek Presidency will endeavour to achieve a result as regards the Statute for Members of the European Parliament. Mr President-in-Office, if we cannot achieve a result in the Council, then I fear that there will never be a Statute for Members. I think that we have now been wrestling with the issue of the Statute for Members for 15 years, and by finally reaching a decision yesterday, by reaching a decision today, we will have fulfilled our parliamentary obligations. I hope that you will manage to fulfil your own obligations. If you should fail, the Council will bear a great burden of responsibility. I therefore wish you every success in adopting the Statute for Members. I hope that you will also manage to adopt the European party statute, because it is very important indeed for all Europe's party political families, large and small, that we should have a party statute that ensures transparency and an ability to act, and I would very much encourage you to take this to heart.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I would like to make a comment about foreign policy, which will have a major role to play. Yesterday we had the President of Algeria, Mr Bouteflika, here with us. These days we naturally tend to look towards Eastern Europe. This weekend, this Saturday and Sunday, we are encouraging our Polish partners to vote ‘Yes’ to Europe in their referendum, to say ‘Yes’ to membership of the European Union. I had a wonderful experience last Sunday in Warsaw during a pro-accession demonstration, when we were shouting out: <span class="italic">Tak dla Polski!</span> ‘Yes’ for Polish membership of the European Union!</p>
<p class="contents">It is now time, however, not only to look towards the east, but also towards the south, towards the Mediterranean area. We should really be injecting some substance into the Mediterranean dialogue, because up to now it has largely consisted of rhetoric. We should not lose sight of the Mediterranean area, because if we are concerned about border security – and we need to be, both in relation to countries in the east as well as countries in the south – we do not want to erect a new wall. No, we need to help the countries of the Mediterranean area, in North Africa, so that people there, and particularly young people, have opportunities in life. That is why we need to redouble our efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish you every success at the Thessaloniki Summit. If you take this decision, you will have my group's support. I wish you, the Greek Presidency and all of us in the European Union good luck!</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me first of all to congratulate the Greek Presidency on its courage and determination. Like Ulysses, you have navigated through turbulent waters, and there were perhaps times when you should have tied certain members of the crew to the mast when the transatlantic Sirens began to sing, but we do have time to improve the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The central issue in this debate is the future of Europe, and it is within this framework that the Convention is working. I would also like to welcome the speech by the President of the Commission and to reaffirm, on behalf of my group, that we, who are working for the Convention, and who are participating actively, believe that it should produce a draft Constitution, and not just a list of options. This is an absolutely fundamental point. We also believe that to affirm the secular nature of the Europe we are building is a positive element, because it demonstrates our respect for all religions and for the complexity of our history. Consider, for example, that in Thessaloniki, until the Second World War, there lived the largest group of Sephardic Jews expelled from my country, which has a Greek, Roman, Christian, Muslim and Jewish history. It is a good thing that we are affirming Europe's secular role in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to external personality, it is also important, as the President of the Commission has said, that we genuinely affirm the fundamental principles and the criterion of majority as a working system. The Greek Presidency has indicated that the stabilisation and integration of the Balkans is an absolutely essential issue. And we must remember that, when we launched the CSFP, our first failure came when we were unable to reach agreement amongst ourselves. And that is what exacerbated the Yugoslavian tragedy. When we began to work together in Kosovo and Macedonia we were able to improve.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the final work of the Convention, I would like to point out firstly that the important thing is that no possibilities are ruled out, in other words, that the constitutional text allows us to evolve, because the text itself will not be able to change reality, but rather we must be able to continue with the Community method. And this involves certain fundamental issues. Firstly, the question of the Commission. If we say that the President of the Commission must be elected on the basis of the result of elections, this means, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you must make the Statute on European political parties an essential issue on the agenda at Thessaloniki, because without protagonists we will not be able to create a genuine democracy, in which the President of the Commission has democratic legitimacy, and I must say that it does not appear that the Council attaches great importance to this point at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the composition of the Commission, I would say that this is an open debate within all political families but, in any event, what we must do is strengthen the Commission's capacity as a college and the authority of its President.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the establishment of a Council Presidency of a dual nature, President Prodi is well aware, as we all are, that such dual systems are not stable. There must be one body with executive power. We must support improvements in the Council's internal organisation, but an organisation based on two institutions which, to a certain extent, overlap, will not be stable.</p>
<p class="contents">The very important issue for Parliament is the need to enshrine the power of the law, of shared legislative power, which means that the Council must also act in a democratic and open way and, at the same time, we must maintain the institutional balance.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, I would like to insist on one point, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and I would also like the President of the Commission to give his view on it during this debate. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this issue does not relate to Parliament’s internal system. It is an entirely constitutional issue and therefore what you have to do at this point is not to resolve the problem, but essentially not to oppose the solution we have offered, which furthermore justifies and supports the need for majority decision-making. Remember one thing: in relation to taxation, Nice decided on unanimity, and this is producing entirely negative results. Everybody must face their responsibilities, and you have responsibility in relation to an entirely constitutional issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, please allow me to refer very briefly to two important issues. One is the economy. There has been a G8 Summit, in which the President of the Commission has participated. I would like you to be a little more explicit with regard to the development of the Lisbon strategy and also the euro, which is an issue of concern us, above all because the European economy is not working as a motor.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the transatlantic Summit at the end of this month, it is very important to demonstrate the will of both sides to once again take up our responsibilities within a multilateral context, particularly at a time when there are signs of hope in the Middle East peace process and an opportunity to work for the future of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we must say to our American allies – and I am thinking of the extradition treaty – that they must treat us with equality, respecting our own legislative capacity and, above all, they must give us explanations – this is an important point – with regard to the entirely unacceptable situation of certain European citizens, in that law-free zone known as the Guantánamo base. This is also of importance in terms of our future relations.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, it is very important that you take a significant step, respecting and supporting the results of a Convention which leads us to a European Constitution.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, European Liberal Democrats in this House hope that President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing will present to the Heads of State and Government a draft Constitutional Treaty which commands a broad consensus. It must dampen the fires of the increasingly bitter disputes we have witnessed in recent weeks. However, it is for the Convention, not its President, to confirm the existence or not of a consensus, and if the Convention needs a little more time to complete its work, so be it. Mr Giscard d'Estaing likes to say that his Constitution will last unchanged for 50 years, but unless a durable consensus is reflected in the final text and Member States are given the time to debate it we are likely to have to revisit the matter in the very near future.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest proposals provide hope that the Praesidium is now in listening mode, but there is clearly still much listening to do. Even with the restrictions on his role in foreign policy, European Liberal Democrats remain unconvinced of the case for a full-time chairman of the European Council. We are suspicious that the larger Member States seek to unpick the seams of the Community fabric.</p>
<p class="contents">A double-hatted approach for Europe's new Foreign Minister commands widespread support, so why not take the same approach and integrate the roles of European Commission and European Council Presidents? Must we risk years of conflict, of turf wars, of duplication of effort before we recognise the sense of this approach? At the very least we must leave open the door to an integrated presidency in a few years time.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi spoke – and I have sympathy with much that he said – of the national veto. In the name of preserving national sovereignty, the veto all too often promotes international anarchy. Unless we are capable of thinking in new ways about the concept of sovereignty, we will continue to fail our citizens on the major challenges we face.</p>
<p class="contents">While I welcome the proposed extension of Parliament's powers of democratic control over the budget and European legislation, I am concerned that an imbalance remains between the powers of Parliament and Council in other areas, such as concluding agreements with third countries on crucial security matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, another item on your agenda in Thessaloniki will be the debate on High Representative Solana's recommendations for an overall strategy in foreign and security policy. It is vital for the European Union to develop a doctrine which enshrines the central role of international law and of institutions such as the UN, the WTO and NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe also urgently needs a framework for deciding under which conditions we should commit troops to military action, including conflict prevention, peace enforcement and humanitarian crises. Congo is a welcome step forward but our current embarrassment over Bosnia-Herzegovina is a setback. And to prevent the European Union fracturing again as it did over Iraq, we need to start debating and planning now our approach to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I hope that the summit will discuss Europe's approach to North Korea and Iran and not leave it until a crisis erupts.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of Justice and Home Affairs, I commend the President-in-Office for the progress made thus far under Greece's stewardship. I hope that you will continue to seek to balance repressive measures against illegal immigration with a generous approach to refugees and an emphasis on human rights and fundamental freedoms. I would also appeal to the President-in-Office to make every effort to conclude three important proposals concerning third-country nationals who are long-term residents, minimum standards for qualifying for refugee status and minimum standards for the granting of such status.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, you touched on the subject of a Members' Statute. I fear that the proposal we adopted yesterday will not make your work any easier, but I hope you will be guided in this, as in other matters on your agenda, by the advice of your philosopher, Socrates: remember that there is nothing stable in human affairs, therefore avoid undue elation in prosperity, or undue depression in adversity.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to focus, however, on a third major event, which is more important than any other: the sudden appearance of the Union’s identity crisis. What do we want to do together? This existential question remains, more than ever, unanswered, certainly with regard to our internal ambitions for the Union. Do we genuinely want to set ourselves the objective that the praesidium of the Convention proposes should be included in the future Constitution of the Union, namely balanced economic growth and social justice, full employment, high living standards, social protection and equal opportunity for all?</p>
<p class="contents">In that case, why refuse to open the debate on a change in the priorities of the European Central Bank? Its priority should no longer be price stability, at a time when there is a risk of recession, but instead protection of jobs, training and pensions for all women and men, the funding of useful infrastructures, such as large-scale piggybacking, and, more generally, genuine, fair, sustainable development. Why confine public services to the precarious status of a derogation to the rule of free competition, instead of making the promotion of high-quality services of general interest a priority of the Union, one consequently included in the Constitution?</p>
<p class="contents">Why continue to block any possibility of taxing the movement of capital and financial income? This kind of blatant contradiction between the statement of objectives corresponding to expectations and the rejection of means that would enable us to achieve them is at the heart of the lack of trust felt by our fellow citizens with regard to the European institutions. What do we really want? We must respond frankly and take responsibility for our choices so that Europeans can participate in the debate in an informed manner. As Albert Camus wrote: ‘Mal nommer les choses, c'est ajouter au malheur du monde’ (‘To name things wrongly is to add to the misfortune of the world’).</p>
<p class="contents">This identity crisis is equally obvious with regard to the role of the Union in the world. This has become only too clear since the war against Iraq. Before the conflict, contradictory, but frank, voices at least enabled public opinion to be clear on the matter and become involved in this confrontation of choices. They did so in such a spectacular manner and so uniformly from Western to Eastern Europe that this sudden crisis, in our opinion, represents a real hiatus in the history of the Union and the only hope of future change.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, since the show of force by the world superpower, against the law and will of the international community, it seems as if the European Union is rebuilding its unity on the basis of resigned or enthusiastic subordination to the fittest. Paul Wolfowitz admits that the crusade to eliminate weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was merely ‘a bureaucratic pretext to gain acceptance for the war’. This tremendous deception has called forth no indignation among the Fifteen, let alone among the Twenty-five. This was confirmed this morning, and I regret it.</p>
<p class="contents">George Bush decides to monopolise the management of the road-map for the Middle East, with all the risks entailed by his complicity with Sharon and the latter’s reservations on the very substance of the commitments to be made; the European Union, despite having jointly initiated this fragile hope of peace, allows itself to be ousted from the scene with no resistance.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States rejects the International Criminal Court, maintains special military courts, detains – as Mr Barón Crespo pointed out – European citizens in a law-free zone in Guantanamo Bay; the Council nevertheless prepares an extradition and mutual legal cooperation agreement with Washington, turning a blind eye to all these broken rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Our US partners relaunch their attack for the moratorium on GMOs to be lifted in order to protect US agriculture; Europe instantly starts to waver, holding back from applying the trade retaliation measures that are authorised by the WTO itself against the thoughtless tax advantages granted to exporters in the US.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, Mr President, my group considers that the Greek Presidency would serve Europe well by raising this entire problem clearly at the Thessaloniki European Council: what do we want to do together and what means are we providing ourselves with in order to achieve our objectives?</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, in our societies, the question has now been raised and that is a very good thing. Earlier, I quoted a French author. For good measure, I shall end my speech by quoting the great German, Hölderlin:<span class="italic"> </span>‘Where there is danger there is also salvation’. It is clear where the danger lies for Europe. Let us be among those who seek to save it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, I am grateful to the President of the Commission for having reminded us of the origins of the Convention and what our objectives were, given that at times we forget them, when we see that some members of the Praesidium and especially its Chairman want to pose more as members of the Intergovernmental Conference than Europe’s founding fathers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention, Mr President, must retain control of the process of reforming the European Union. If it does not manage to conclude its work by 20 June, we must allow it to continue working to reach an agreement, which is perfectly feasible provided that the Convention plays its full part as a constituent or para-constituent assembly, does not give in to blackmail by the small numbers of eurosceptics who have no interest in seeing it succeed – this needs to be said and reiterated – and asserts the value of an open, parliamentary working method which is very different from the intergovernmental method that is based exclusively on power politics.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the President and the Praesidium have clearly miscalculated, intentionally prolonging the concluding period of debates without ever setting out in black and white which points had achieved a broad consensus, thereby deluding themselves that they can control the Convention at will and giving the wrong impression that the Convention is divided on everything; but today the governments which are anxious to see this constitutional reform succeed – and they exist, I am sure, and I am also sure that your government, Mr President, is among these – cannot simply pull the plug on the Convention if it does not conclude its proceedings to the satisfaction of the majority of its members. We consider that, if the Convention offered options at Thessaloniki, this would prove that its job is unfinished.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, there are at least three issues where we need to send out a signal of progress, democracy and clarity, which can be seen directly by all the citizens: direct access to justice for citizens in the event of breaches of the Charter of Rights; the simultaneous extension of codecision and Council majority voting, in particular with regard to taxation and foreign affairs. We will not be able to act as a global player, committed to the values of multilateralism and democracy, if we are blocked at every turn by vetoes and counter-vetoes and if all of this sector remains, as it is today, totally free of any form of parliamentary control. The third and final point is that the reform process cannot maintain unanimity and cannot allow once again – and this really is an astonishing situation for 2003 – the European Parliament to be excluded from the ratification process.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the Seville programme which you, Mr President, referred to: we have often condemned the great imbalance in the strategy agreed in Tampere, between the repressive aspects of the fight against illegal immigration and the forced repatriation policy and the positive aspects, such as the creation of legal, controlled immigration channels, the softening of the visa policy and integration measures for third countries based on the non-discrimination principle. We hope, Mr President, that the Council will heed the loud and clear message that Parliament sent out yesterday: no signing of the extradition treaty between the European Union and the United States without clarification of the situation of the European Union citizens in Guantanamo. We are referring to Union citizens not because the others do not concern or interest us, but because we consider that, by taking this approach, we can legitimately intervene on the entire issue of the existence of a part of the world where no laws exist. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, it is now clear that a new draft EU Treaty will be presented to our EU leaders in Thessaloniki. The Convention has carried out a great deal of work since it was first established 18 months ago, and we now await the results. For the most part, we share the fundamental reason why the Convention was first established. The Union is at an historic crossroads and from 1 May 2004 we will be a Community of 25 different Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of challenges which the Union must face and which must include the following. How can a European Union undergoing enlargement organise itself to ensure continuing effectiveness? What should Europe's role be in an increasingly globalised world and how can the European Union be brought closer to its citizens?</p>
<p class="contents">The draft Treaty will form a basis for the final EU Treaty which will be put in place at the IGC in the near future. It is very important that EU governments and citizens are given time to reflect on the provisions of the draft Treaty. We are all seeking to ensure that we put in place a Treaty which can govern the operation of the Union over the next 50 years.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that recent Treaties, including the Amsterdam and Nice Treaties, have imperfections. However, these European Union Treaties guarantee that the Union can operate effectively for the time being. Before the terms of a final EU Treaty are agreed upon, we must ensure that cautious, careful and wide-ranging discussions take place with all interested parties from both the large and the small countries. The European Union is a union of states and peoples and the success of the Union as an economic and political entity is premised on the fact that both smaller and larger Member States are treated in many respects as equal partners within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that each Member State should retain the right to nominate one member of the Commission or, at a minimum, ensure that there is an equality of representation on the Commission from both small and large states. I share the broad concerns that the present system of rotating presidencies may not be an effective model to operate in a Community of 25 Member States, but I strongly believe that more discussion is certainly going to have to take place on how the European Council is going to carry out its business in an enlarged Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am satisfied that some sensitive issues of national concern will remain the preserve of individual Member States. It is clear that the issue of tax harmonisation is not high on the agenda of the work of the Convention. This is the proper approach as taxation matters are best left to be decided by the individual Member States' governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bonde (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, the Laaken Summit asked the Convention to bring the EU closer to the people. With the Praesidium’s draft constitution, Chairman Giscard d’Estaing will instead put a greater distance between the EU and the people. A French sun king is leading the Convention in contravention of all the democratic ground rules. We are unable to have proposals translated and debated. The EU rules on transparency do not apply to Chairman Giscard d’Estaing. He is not content with leading the meetings; he also tells us what to think and is apt to draw conclusions that are clearly opposed to the views of the majority. He does not permit any votes that might upset his so-called consensus method, the same consensus method that he now wants to introduce, in place of unanimity, as the European Council’s form of decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft constitution is not progress but a large step backwards in history to the time before the introduction of democracy when the king asked for advice but took the decisions himself.</p>
<p class="contents">Chairman Giscard d’Estaing’s draft constitution may be likened to a large removal firm. It would transfer power from the electorate and elected representatives in all the countries to officials, ministers and lobbyists and from the legislature to the executive and judiciary, with the EU Court of Justice becoming the supreme interpreter of the constitution. Power would also be transferred from smaller countries to larger ones and from medium-sized countries to the largest ones. It would be transferred from ordinary party members to transnational party bureaucracies and from living democracies to a stronger Commission, a stronger European Parliament and the strongest power federation of all: the prime ministers of the largest Member States who would be at the very centre of power in the form of a directorate revolving around a French-German axis. They would be given power because of their countries’ size, not because we had elected them. None of them were elected for saying what their plans were for the EU. The prime ministers would, then, meet after each election to the European Parliament and divide the posts among themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">When Mr Blair could no longer be elected in Great Britain, he could become President of the EU, and Mr Fischer could become the EU Foreign Minister when his prospects in Germany dwindled. Mr Aznar could be made President of the Commission, or Vice-President with responsibility for justice and home affairs. Someone else could become the EU minister of finance and economic affairs, and a third person could become supreme commander of the armed forces. The constitution would create good jobs for outgoing prime ministers when they could no longer be elected. It would not be the electorate that would be given power over the institutions and their top people, as in federal states such as the US and Germany. In our case, 13 prime ministers could vote down 12 in the European Council, and the prime ministers of the three largest countries could vote down the 22 others in one go on the basis of what is termed their double majority, in which countries with 40% of the inhabitants are given the right of veto.</p>
<p class="contents">The electorate in countries large and small would lose all power over the laws. Our democracy would be reduced to something very local. We should no longer be able to reward or punish our elected representatives at the next election, for most laws would be adopted behind closed doors by a working party under the aegis of the Council of Ministers or by the Commission, which would be given increased independent legislative power.</p>
<p class="contents">Our national governments and parliaments would be like large, powerless local authorities in an EU writ large. Voters would be able to go to the polls in elections to the European Parliament, but it would not be possible in this way, either, to change the laws of the EU or replace the people running it. The European Parliament would obtain the right of codecision in quite a few areas, but it would not gain all the power lost by the national parliaments. The Commission would be given the sole and exclusive right to table many more proposals and to prevent others from being tabled. That power would be taken away from voters and elected representatives in all the countries. Officials and Council ministers would assume most of the power, for without their consent it would not be possible for any laws to be made. The power that, in all democratic countries, resides with the electorate would, in the case of the EU, be apportioned through an inscrutable power game involving prime ministers, meetings of the Council and of the Commission and a European Parliament potentially dominated by powerful supranational party bureaucrats.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the electorate, it has an extremely remote role to play in the draft constitution to be debated at the Thessaloniki Summit. Greece was the cradle of democracy, Mr President-in-Office of the Council. The Thessaloniki Summit ought not to become a burial chamber. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we follow the Convention experts, the mixture of Community and intergovernmental, the distribution of legislative, executive and so on, we will find ourselves in a period of total decadence, where we do nothing but destroy any remnants of the classical which brought us to this point.</p>
<p class="contents">I hold up to you the Europe of Altiero Spinelli and Ernesto Rossi. Why? Because these Europeans conceived the European federation inside Fascist prisons. This is just one name: the prisons were Fascist, Communist, Nazi, Clerical, Counter-reformist, of all kinds. Their dream was to eliminate the monsters of nationalist degeneration, of minority groups which wanted to establish themselves on a legal basis to the detriment of others.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would just like to make one, very brief point: this debate is an affront to the parliament which has chosen to hold it. We should have discussed this on 18 June during the mini part-session. The President-in-Office of the Council could have given us hard facts then, and we would have known what they would actually have discussed at Thessaloniki. Today, they are simply telling us what is in the papers. Parliament is demeaning itself. We should have refused to hold a debate when it is not known what the proposed decisions will be, and I am very disappointed that none of the other Members have made this point. We would have met on 18 and 19 June, and the Council would have taken place in Thessaloniki on 20 and 21 June. Things sometimes happen better by chance than by Europe’s political logic.</p>
<p class="contents">This time I greatly appreciated Mr Wurtz’s speech, for the first time in 20 years, I think. When he said that ‘we are facing an identity crisis’, he was right. But what defining parameter does the identity crisis refer to? How do we define our identity? Either we place ourselves in the history of continental Europe, which over the past 100 years has unceasingly produced all kinds of monsters, including our institutional monstrosities, which bear no relation to the transparency of the rule of law and its functioning, or if not, you are already creating a new anti-liberal, anti-democratic, anti-humanist monster out of this Europe of counter-reform and of a thousand violent and murderous tendencies. It was not by accident that we, or rather you, found yourselves on Saddam’s side in actual fact, as regards Iraq. Let us admit that Mr Solana still sees Mr Arafat, despite the fact that there is another possibility, that of Mr Abu Mazen, created by Mr Sharon and Mr Bush. As in the forties, you are the heirs of a Europe that the England of the past and America freed. We need to free ourselves of you, and we shall! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Evans, Jonathan (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I congratulate you, President-in-Office, on the progress on enlargement that has been made during the Greek Presidency. The special Athens Council in April was a landmark in the history of Europe, following the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and we look forward to the ten applicant states taking their rightful place in the new Europe. However, if we look at the priorities set by the Greek Presidency, two of them in particular have proved to be something of a disappointment.</p>
<p class="contents">First the Lisbon process. After three years, this agenda is stalled, indeed it is going backwards. It is disappointing that the presidency has been unable to persuade governments to get their act together on issues which are as fundamental as this to the prosperity of people across Europe. As a result, many EU countries will be facing a future of economic stagnation and deflation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the presidency wanted to see the new Europe as an international motor for peace and cooperation. Of course, the Iraq crisis was a difficult one; however, in my view the way in which during the Greek Presidency the 'gang of four' convened in April in Brussels to consider alternative defence structures to NATO merely reinforced anti-American sentiment in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Thessaloniki will mark the end of the European Convention when former president Giscard d'Estaing presents his conclusions, as we have heard during the course of this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">At Laeken Heads of State and Government said that within the Union, the European institutions must be brought closer to its citizens, but if we look at the draft articles in the Convention document, we find this ambition has not been achieved. Indeed in many ways it heads in precisely the opposite direction. The Convention is proposing a European Union which, in my view, is more centralised, more bureaucratic, in many ways less democratic and certainly more federalist than is currently the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I am well recognised in my country as a longstanding supporter of Britain's committed membership of the European Union, but the document that Heads of Government are likely to see in Thessaloniki is one that changes the nature of the relationship between Member States and the European Union. In summary: a Constitution, incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, legal status for the Union, a President, a Foreign Minister, the collapse of the second and third pillars, a common foreign security policy, the eventual framing of an EU defence policy, the requirement that both economic policies and taxation be harmonised and the establishment of a European public prosecutor.</p>
<p class="contents">The British Government has been calling all this in the UK just a tidying-up exercise and therefore not worth putting to the people in a referendum. In contrast the Danish Prime Minister has made it clear that he will be submitting the Constitution to a referendum, because the EU Constitution is so new and large a document that it would be right to hold a referendum on it. I can tell this House that 80% of the British public agree.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not just a case of the British Government dismissing the right of its own people to have a say on their future, it is rather that the Convention proposals fundamentally change the relationship between the Union and Member States and the way in which we are all governed.</p>
<p class="contents">For those who cherish the concept of a United States of Europe, the blueprint set out in this Convention is based on this fundamental fact, and this has been honestly and sincerely articulated by President Prodi and many speakers in this debate today. When the Inter-Governmental Conference begins its work later this year, my party is determined to see that the accession states not only have a right to contribute to the discussion, but have a vote in the Council on the crucial decisions that it will take. The outcome of the IGC will impact on the people of Warsaw, Prague and Budapest, just as much as London, Paris and Berlin, and it is outrageous that they should in any way be excluded from having a proper and democratic role in the outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I say this; we have long been the most ardent supporters of enlargement and the right of accession states to take their place at the European top table, but our Europe is one where diversity is celebrated, not one where countries are forced into an institutional straitjacket. We want a Europe that is democratic and prosperous and works with the United States to defend our freedoms and confront common threats. The Convention takes us down a different road to a Europe where the nation state is no longer the foundation upon which the Union rests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Napolitano (PSE).</span></span>   –<span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(IT)</span><span class="bold"> </span>Mr President, I too want to focus solely on the contribution that the Thessaloniki Council can make to a positive outcome of the Convention and hence to useful preparation for the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, it is not easy to foresee at what stage the Convention will have reached on the eve of Thessaloniki, what text the Chairman, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, will submit to the Council or what level of consensus will have been reached in the Convention. I do not think that everything will be clarified and settled before Thessaloniki and, in any case, it is down to the Council to provide further stimulus towards fully attaining the objectives set by the Laeken Declaration of December 2001, the main points of which have already been listed by President Prodi.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I would like to recall the content and tone of that declaration, especially in relation to the duties that the European Union must perform and the challenges that it must meet. It would be worrying if the conclusions, firstly of the Convention and then of the Intergovernmental Conference, did not live up to those expectations. I feel that I need to sound the alarm here: were the questions raised by the Laeken Declaration on the European Union’s global role or on greater coordination of economic policies and so on, merely rhetorical questions? Beware! If we failed to meet the expectations that these questions raised among European citizens and world opinion, we would bear a heavy responsibility. The risk exists now, and it can be inferred from the text adopted thus far by the Praesidium of the Convention, yielding to the growing pressure from certain heads of government of the larger countries, particularly with regard to the Chapter on the Institutions, the Council’s decision-making procedures and also the future procedures for reviewing the Treaty. In various regards, it would perhaps be instructive to reread the Treaty for which Altiero Spinelli was rapporteur, which was adopted by Parliament in February 1984.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi has already said a great deal in very clear terms regarding the serious contradictions and the shortcomings of the text adopted so far by the Praesidium on institutional matters. I would just like to reassert the positions expressed by Parliament, which as an institution has not kept quiet, has not relied solely on its 16 representatives at the Convention – unfortunately only 16 out of 105 – but, through the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, it has made many contributions and sparked major debates during which – I want to stress this above all – a clear position was taken against the idea of a full time President of the European Council. In order to strengthen the authority of the European Council as a college, we have put forward other proposals, without excessively customising them and not just concentrating on having a President-in-Office for two and a half or five years. Mr Poettering pointed out that we must delete the idea of incompatibility envisaged between holding the mandate of President of the European Council and holding other European mandates. It is essential to remove the idea of incompatibility with holding a national mandate too, because if we establish a full time President of the European Council – albeit calling the post ‘chairman’ or trying to draw up a restrictive job description – all the elements of duplication, or dualism in the leadership of the Union, which have been condemned for being extremely confusing with regard to executive functions, will inevitably come about.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as Mrs Frassoni and Mr Bonde have already said, it must be stressed that Laeken did indeed appoint a Chairman and a Vice-Chairman, but it granted a collective mandate to the Convention as a whole. I believe that the Thessaloniki Council must issue a warning in this respect, so that we do not take a path where the personal opinions of the Chairman of the Convention or the compromise opinions of the Praesidium override majority opinions, supported by a broader consensus in the Convention plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am glad that during this Presidency the Parliamentary Conference on the Stability and Association Pact in relation to the countries of South-Eastern Europe has been able to take place since it has allowed us to improve our neighbourly relations with the Balkan countries. Winston Churchill said that the Balkans had a very great and very full history which hardly fitted within its territory.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Union must manage and improve this relationship, and promote cross-border cooperation between the Balkan countries, as a method for preparing them for their future integration into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This cross-border cooperation is based on knowledge, understanding and trust in one's neighbours and eventually on cooperation with them. To be able to work on the creation of a free trade area between states, firstly by means of unilateral agreements, progressing towards the disappearance of visas between states and eventually also the disappearance of visas with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">These countries must be integrated into the common foreign and security policy and they must be able to participate in programmes such as Socrates or Leonardo, in order to bring their integration into the European Union closer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Balkans is a complex region. At the Thessaloniki Summit the European Convention will also be presented. I believe the Convention has not dealt with the complexity of certain European Union Member States, which are not nation states but rather multinational states. We must establish mechanisms to allow these nations without a state, as in the case of Catalonia or the Basque country, to be represented in the bodies of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I believe that Mr Napoletano’s report has been very positive, but certain points, such as the right to bring cases before the High Court of Justice, do not appear in the draft Convention. I believe this is necessary so that the citizens in question can feel directly represented within this European Union, which must be a Europe of the citizens, but also a Europe of the peoples it contains. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would make the same wish if Mr Karamanlis, the leader of the opposition, happened to be president-in-office, in the face of the concern which I truly feel at the advent, not of the Italian Presidency in general – I have a great deal of respect for the Italian people – but of Mr Berlusconi. I think that this is not the time to transfer American kitsch to the European Union and for us to become even more farcical than we were on the issue of Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say that the Greek Presidency, in my opinion, has been methodical and has made serious preparations. I wish to congratulate Mr Yiannitsis on the way in which the Presidency has behaved in cooperating with the European Parliament; I think, however, that, despite this, there are serious political problems, especially on the major issue which has arisen, the issue of relations with the United States and the war in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek Presidency followed a ‘foot in two camps’ policy and I think that the Presidency is closing with Europe in confusion. Which precise stance are we following? The stance expressed by Mr Blair, the stance expressed by Mr Schroeder, the stance expressed by Mr Aznar or the stance expressed by Mr Chirac? It is a huge problem and I think that it is a new given which will not allow us to start building on sand, because I hear everything being said about what we are going to build as regards our foreign policy, Ministers for Foreign Affairs etc. and I wonder on what ground, on what policy, we are going to build them.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I finish, I shall just say that I believe that the Greek Presidency, because there was the Iraqi dossier, the most important and difficult dossier dealt with, should demand explanations, just as explanations are being demanded in the United States and in the United Kingdom about the weapons of mass destruction, which was the basis for the invasion of Iraq and was supported by eminent members of the European Council, such as Mr Blair, Mr Aznar and others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have once again seen proof that the presidencies of the European Union’s small- and medium-sized States are better and more pro-European than those of the larger countries. I wish to congratulate the Greek Presidency in particular on the way it acted during the crisis triggered by the war in Iraq, launched by the United States and the United Kingdom and supported by the government of the Spanish State. The presidency did its best to achieve peace and to combat the idea that transatlantic relations must involve the subordination, and even the humiliation, of Europe by the United States, a prospect that is all the more dismal because that country is currently governed by the militaristic far right.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, we hope that the Convention presents the European Council with a draft Constitution that continues constructing a Union that is respected on the world stage as a body working for peace and solidarity, unlike the militarism that currently prevails. I hope that the Constitution will give this Parliament all the democratic powers that it needs, including codecision and a role in electing the president of the Commission. We are, therefore, in agreement with President Prodi’s ideas on the Council presidency. In any event, we must be able to have confidence in the future of the Union. Only recently, following the failure that was Nice, just one small group in this Parliament was calling for the Union to have a Constitution. As a European and as a political representative of a nation-state such as Galicia, of course I want the Constitution to respect the national and cultural diversity that constitutes the fabric of Europe. This is what we are calling for because Jacobin tendencies clearly still exist on our Continent. We must ask ourselves why Slovakia, Luxembourg, Estonia and Malta are recognised as European nations, but Galicia, Scotland and Catalonia are not.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall make one final observation: I hope that the Union’s institutions are courageous enough to end the criminal chaos that dominates international maritime traffic and which leads to disasters such as that involving the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. We must prevent the appalling deaths, such as those that occurred the day before yesterday just off the Spanish coast, of illegal immigrants seeking work in Europe. We must ensure that joint policies such as the CAP and the CFP or cohesion policy are fair and non-discriminatory. We hope that this will happen, so that everyone can benefit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The forthcoming Thessaloniki Summit is of considerable importance for the future of the Union, both in the medium and the long term. It is important to lay the foundations so that Europe, or rather the Union, soon to complete an enlargement process which is unprecedented in its history and in the history of the world, can increasingly combine economic power with political dignity. It is to do justice to the latter that I would like to talk about the policies neglected by that same Union, something which is even more serious as it grows in importance. Health, for example, is one such policy. With reference to Article 152 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, I acknowledge national autonomy for health issues, but a Europe which is heading for enlargement to include 25 countries cannot underestimate the impact which the social and healthcare problems of these countries will have on the political and social economy of the Europe of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the UEN Group recently met in Turin and discussed precisely these enlargement-related social and healthcare issues, producing a document that has already been submitted to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi. The results of this work were not reassuring, so much so that our hope is that, during the six-month Italian Presidency, public health will be included among the Union’s priorities as soon as possible. The globalisation process could see ill people and diseases knocking loudly on Europe’s doors, finding us lacking, as has already happened with regard to SARS infection: a situation which tested our health coordination and cooperation abilities, a matter which the forthcoming Italian Presidency must address if it truly wishes to prevent emergencies and tackle the health service divide that the individual nations are experiencing and which will induce people to travel <span class="italic">en masse</span> to countries with health service facilities and centres of excellence, which, in turn, might be in danger of paralysis. I hope that the Union will decide to give consideration to this and that the next Presidency of the Union will put forward proposals in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe this proposal should be given careful consideration. It is vital that the governments should not allow themselves to be caught between a delayed closure date for the Convention and a fixed deadline for the end of the IGC. The Convention is certainly an interesting forum for debate, but, nevertheless, only democratically accountable governments should have the final say at the Intergovernmental Conference and they must not allow their hands to be tied in advance.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, we do not at all agree with the Commission’s request, made earlier, for the Convention to provide the Council with a single text with no alternative. That amounts to saying that the Council would have no freedom of choice, that democratic power would be transferred from the governments to a Convention without democratic legitimacy. We do not want that kind of Europe. We want precisely the opposite: to re-establish the roots of Europe in its nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the work of the Convention – drawing up a complete European constitution – is vast, but it was the Convention that wanted it that way. The mandate given by the Nice Council did not involve drawing up a constitution and the Laeken Council only made this a possibility in the long term, in other words, not an immediate concern. We agree with these Councils. Europe is not suited to adopting the constitution of a super-State and that is why the Convention is currently encountering so many difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of this is that we will end up with a lengthy, unmanageable minefield of a document which will need to be refocused on what is in fact Europe’s current priority, which has been pushed to one side since the beginning of the Convention: that control of it by national democracies be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">To do so, we might need to go back to the original Community method, which is now long forgotten, based on two pillars: fostering cooperation, in particular with the Commission, and respect for national sovereignty, in particular with the Council. The main flaw in European integration today is the lack of emphasis on this second pillar. That is what we now need to strengthen if we want to recreate the link with the people and with national democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the Convention is constantly moving backwards. Control of subsidiarity by the national parliaments has lost all meaning. The Congress of Peoples is no more. The stable presidency of the Council is strongly contested by the Commission. We must stop this constant, disastrous evasion of national democracies by returning power to the Council and granting national parliaments the right of veto. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Similarly, what has happened to the recommendation for a European border guard. This issue has stagnated and so far there is no agreement between the Member States. I would even say that guarding external borders would be an important step for the common foreign policy, the security and defence policy, because it is not possible for us to want to adopt a common foreign security and defence policy unless we have adopted common external borders; we have the opportunity to make a start on illegal immigration by guarding these borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, I would say, as far as economic solidarity and an equal division of the burden in the immigration sector is concerned, which was also an important priority of your programme, that we have no indication that it is moving in the right direction. I must say to you that the Treaty expressly provides for measures to be taken to seek a fair distribution of the burden between the Member States, as far as receiving and dealing with the consequences of receiving refugees and displaced persons is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point which I would like to emphasise is that the question of public health was given an opportunity with the SARS epidemic. There is unanimity here in Parliament that the Commission should promote the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, so that the European Union can respond in a coordinated manner to health threats and to terrorist threats. Of course, I did not see any progress in the Council of Ministers of 2 June, but we shall come back to this when we have another disease or another situation such as the mad cow crisis, and I cannot see the reason why the opportunity should not be taken to promote this centre.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to a perhaps more important issue which the Thessaloniki Summit will address, the text to come out of the Constitutional Convention. I would say, as you too rightly said and others have pointed out, that this text contains very good points, excellent points, such as the incorporation of the Charter, increased powers for the European Parliament and codecision. It also makes provision in foreign policy for a Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would highlight three points, however: the first is that the preamble is of course satisfactory, because it makes note of our heritage from the Greek and Roman civilisation, but I find it incomprehensible that it makes no note of our Christian heritage. There are thousands of paintings in museums all over the world which are the product of inspiration and cultural products of Europe. There are musical oratorios, there is an abundance of works of art, a cultural treasure which clearly reflects the Christian heritage. We are talking about history, we are not talking about the future. No one knows what will happen in the future. But our heritage is from the Greek, Roman and Christian civilisation. The second point, on which we totally disagree, is the fact that there may be a Member State which is not represented by a Commissioner. We believe that all the Member States should have a Commissioner. It is not right that a Member State should be missing from the body of Commissioners and from the table around which, essentially, Community developments take place. It is unthinkable! It will upset the balance between the small and large states, a balance which is very important in my opinion. The third point, which is also unthinkable, is the saga about the presidency of the Council. This is a haze, it is incomprehensible. The current system is a thousand times better. Provision could be made for improving the current system. I prefer the current system, under which each country has the ambition to make its own contribution to European developments. We can see that your Presidency contributed and the Belgian presidency contributed and the Danish presidency contributed. So what is it that now makes us call for some person, who will be appointed goodness knows how and who, I foresee, will cause friction in the working of the institutions, because the balance between the institutions, between Council, Parliament and European Commission needs to be maintained. I fear greatly that the system of the presidency of the Council will upset it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Again for historical and cultural reasons, we should remember that it did not simply host the large Sephardic Jewish community, but that it hosted it because it was expelled by the Spanish inquisition. Just as the Balkans hosted hundreds of thousands of gypsies, again expelled by the Inquisition. So much for those who want to keep talking about the cultural burden of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Every Presidency is characterised by certain important elements. The Thessaloniki Presidency has two characteristics: first, it closes the cycle of the presidencies of the 15 and opens the cycle of the presidencies of the 25. Secondly, precisely for this reason, it is characterised by the results of the Convention on the Future of Europe which is under way. In this sense, therefore, it has two very important elements which it must promote, in order to open prospects for the future. The war in Iraq made us all, possibly to our slight surprise, discover a great many lacunae in connection with the development of Europe. It may also have had positive results, because it ultimately showed everyone, even if they do not say so now, that Europe cannot remain an economic giant but a political dwarf. The President of the Commission is absolutely right.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings us to the Thessaloniki Summit. However, I should like to add two things, despite the fact that my speech appears to be going off at a tangent, to the second leg in Thessaloniki, the stability pact. The stability pact concerns the crisis in the western Balkans, in former Yugoslavia. It is an issue on which the efficiency and essence of European policy is being judged. In this sense, it is a telling issue and we cannot deal with it as a secondary issue, because, whether we like it or not, we consider the future of Europe and the Convention to be a primary issue.</p>
<p class="contents">To come back to the subject of the future of Europe, it is obvious that the peoples are demanding democracy, efficiency and transparency. Democracy means parliamentary control. Efficiency means the ability to control what you are applying and transparency means that every citizen can see where his money is going and if the political objectives are being served. In this sense, the Community method and its variations must be reinforced. I believe that the Greek Presidency, by combining the dialectic of Socrates and Plato, which a number of speakers referred to, with the highly efficient Aristotle, will provide positive prospects and that a six month presidency of exemplary and exceptional efficiency by a country of medium size but with most able political cadres will be ratified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ludford (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, I want to talk about two matters on the summit agenda. The first is migration and asylum, the second is the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to say that yesterday the Commission gave a cool response to the British proposals to set up refugee detention centres in places like the Balkans because the difficulties of that would be considerable. I agree that there is a need to combat smuggling and trafficking through the orderly and managed arrival of refugees. Ideas like allowing asylum applications to be lodged in the home region, and then to have protected entry or resettlement schemes, are useful to pursue, but these must be complementary to the individual right to seek asylum, not replace it. We must not deny asylum seekers access to European Union territory.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission sensibly suggested looking at ways of allowing legal routes for migration. I warmly congratulate the Greek Presidency on its conference on managed migration in Athens last month, because the statistics are stunning: Europe is set to lose 15% of its population by 2050. The US population is going to increase by 40%. Our economies want migrants. The problem is that our societies do not and politicians have to lead an honest and brave debate on all the ramifications of immigration. We must at least agree – and I want the summit to do this – on an integration strategy, including better rights for long-term legal migrants.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also remove asylum and immigration from the clutches of interior and public order ministers, because those ministers are preoccupied with internal security and repression. They do not have the proper mindset for discussing legal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">We have got ourselves into a mess and every repressive measure risks making matters worse. In fact hard borders may have increased the number of illegal immigrants and made them permanent because of the difficulty of going backwards and forwards. So to get order and control back into our asylum and immigration systems, we need three sound policies, not quick fixes and gimmicks: firstly, genuine sharing of responsibility, not shifting responsibility, but sharing both within the European Union and through partnership with countries of origin and local reception countries with substantial financial investment there; secondly, frontloading through investment in better-quality and therefore faster asylum decisions, as the Commission suggests; and lastly, access to legal immigration channels.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know the <span class="italic">quid pro quo</span> envisaged by the British Government to tempt the Balkan countries into having these refugee camps, but I would like to suggest one topic that requires active and early consideration with the Balkan countries and that is a review of visa policies. As the presidents of the SAP countries said at their summit on Monday, the process of integration could be assisted greatly by offering a genuine hope to their citizens that soon they will be able to travel freely in the whole of Europe. I hope we will look at that soon.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I want to talk about the International Criminal Court. Romania, and now Albania, have signed US immunity agreements and Bosnia is under pressure. If we are to have a fruitful stabilisation and association process, how come the European Union and associated countries cannot work together to stop the US getting these agreements? Can you assure us there is no intention for European Union states to sign bilateral immunity agreements and that you will not let this process undermine efforts to persuade the Balkan countries to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague? I am sorry to say that other European Union countries have left the UK and the Netherlands holding the line on not ratifying the association agreements until Croatia cooperates. There has been no solidarity among European Union countries and that is disgraceful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On 17 February, it was declared that the problem with Iraq was its disarmament, and this provoked Mr Bush's congratulations. The disagreement with the USA was not over whether violence should be used, but when. Besides, Greece and other Member States did not articulate a single word of criticism of the Anglo-American invasion; on the contrary, they helped it in any way they could. The declaration by the Presidency on 16 April legitimises the attack after the event, acknowledges the sovereignty of the attackers in Iraq and gives the UN the role of mediator in the distribution of the booty. So what if no weapons of mass destruction were found. So what if American officials are saying there were none. If the facts prove you wrong, too bad for the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">Another of your great achievements was that the European Union swallowed up nine-and-a-half new countries. I say nine-and-a-half because Cyprus is joining as a divided country, but that is an insignificant detail, which we should not allow to overshadow the glory of Great Europe. Seriously, what is the European Union doing to oust the Turkish occupying army from Cyprus?</p>
<p class="contents">As for your policy in the Balkans, what do you have to say about the subsidised relocation of companies such as SISER-PALCO, which leave thousands of unemployed in Greece and elsewhere?</p>
<p class="contents">Nor has it gone unnoticed that your policy has forced hundreds of thousands of angry workers on to the streets, today in France, the other day in Austria, before then in Greece, in almost every country of the European Union. This is their response to the attack on all the rights the working classes have acquired over the last 100 years.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be an oversight on my part not to refer to the farce of the Convention, with the careful election of its members so as to drown any voice of opposition to the European Union, which the President of the Convention is openly leading by the hand. The rape of democracy has created a freak which is redistributing power to the powerful and laying the foundations for the militarisation of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece condemn, together with the thousands of protestors who will descend on Thessaloniki in two weeks' time, the policies of the European Union, which are becoming more and more dangerous for the security and standard of living of the peoples and which the Greek Presidency has served in the best possible way. However much of a fiesta they become, however many repressive measures are taken to protect the leaders from the love of the crowd, however far from the city the summit is held, the thunderous voice of protest will not be muzzled, the resistance of the gathering anti-imperialist, anti-monopolistic forces will not be repressed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That would be quite wrong and extremely foolish. Your starting point is, I think, correct. The question is not <span class="italic">if</span> the countries of the Western Balkans will ever join the European Union, but <span class="italic">when</span>. Before they can join however there is much that needs to be put right. This conclusion is in itself nothing new.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999, after the Kosovo war, the European Union set up the so-called stabilisation and association process, based on an analysis of the problems in the 1990s: ethnic violence, extreme nationalism and the need to develop democratic structures. This approach has – as we have said here many times – been a success. Think of European Union action in Macedonia. But we have reached a point where the European Union’s policy cannot simply be based on an analysis of the 1990s; it must also be based on an analysis of the current and the future problems of the countries in the Western Balkans. These problems are increasingly resembling a problem the present Member States are also having to face, namely socio-economic stagnation. In my opinion this means that we must retain the good points in our current policy in respect of the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">The return of refugees, still exceptionally important, the tackling of organised crime – think of the murder of Djindjic, unfortunately still very topical, active cooperation with the International Criminal Court in The Hague, these are all elements that we must retain. Other elements must be added to them however. As I see it, these are elements from the pre-accession strategy as the Union has known it to date, such as the strengthening of the unilateral trade benefits for the countries of the Western Balkans, the opening of a number of European programmes which has often been mentioned such as the education programmes Leonardo and Socrates and the introduction not only of the logic, but also of the methodology of the cohesion funds as we currently know them. This too is possible in the Western Balkans, as is the step-by-step introduction of the change in visa policy, which Baroness Ludford has previously mentioned. The Greek Presidency has rightly begun with an exchange of students, which is a good start, but it is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is not a repeat of the way in which we have so far drawn the countries of Central and Eastern Europe into the European Union. We now need a tailor-made strategy with elements of our old policy and elements of the new policy that must be added to it. This – and I say this direct to the Council – this needs money. My appeal to the Greek Presidency therefore is to ensure that the new policy, which I warmly support, is feasible in financial terms as well. The trick will be in not creating any new illusions, but bringing the Balkans closer to the European Union. If we fail to do so, we shall regret it dearly later on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pack (PPE-DE).</span></span>   –<span class="italic"> (DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I welcome the Greek Presidency's statements about the Balkans, and unlike Mr Alavanos I am also pleased that in the second half of this year the Italians will have an opportunity to pursue this excellent policy further. There are in fact two neighbouring countries that have a vital interest in seeing stability in the Western Balkans, that is to say in south-eastern Europe. It is a fact that these countries – Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Albania – are at very different stages in their development. They will ultimately have an opportunity, as already promised in Zagreb and as will once again be confirmed in Thessaloniki, to become members of the European Union depending on their own individual progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The road they have to travel will be a difficult one, as the 10 accession countries have discovered. It will place great demands on their citizens. We recognise the different rates of progress that exist, which are chiefly due to the fact that these countries have all had different opportunities to develop. Until just two years ago, Serbia and Montenegro still had Milosevic. We therefore need to take into consideration those opportunities of which they were unable to take advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of these problems are, however, common to all these countries, such as the fight against corruption and organised crime, and above all the fight against traffic in human beings. In many of these countries the judicial system is still very poor and deficient. Another cause for regret is that cooperation at regional level is not as good as it is always made out to be. If an appeal is being made to us to grant these countries visa freedom, then, in my opinion, they should first come to an agreement between themselves to allow their own citizens to travel freely. It is not that simple to get from Serbia to Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that these countries should first put their own house in order before they start making further demands on us. I also believe that bilateral free trade areas are a good thing. However, they can only be truly effective if they are extended to create a multilateral free trade area.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention three points contained in our motion for a resolution. It is reasonable for the Stability Pact to be closely linked with the stabilisation and association process. It is important that the CARDS programme, for which ever less funding is available, should be given more money. The money is available; we do not need to create new funding. The pre-accession aid has not been fully used, and I regret that the Commissioner mentioned a figure of EUR 200 million. You probably do not want to exceed that figure, but I believe that we need more, because economic development is a prerequisite for our co-existence, for the development of this Community and for the ultimate solution of the problems of refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to touch upon one final issue, and that is the question of young people in these countries. Without their youth, these countries will have no chance of developing favourably. If they are not given a signal now that Europe will not become a reality just for their grandchildren, but now, for them, there will be problems. They are all trying to leave these countries and to emigrate to other countries, such as New Zealand, the United States and Canada. We must open up our Socrates and Leonardo programmes to them. As the rapporteur for the Socrates programme, I know what a difficult business that is. I appeal to the Greek Presidency to play an active role here in ensuring that we really give the young people of these countries a signal that they can take part in our educational programmes. If I rightly understood the communiqué issued by the presidents of these countries on Monday, it contains many good things – many promises and many valuable insights. I only hope that something will be done in Thessaloniki to give these countries a real incentive to translate those promises into action.</p>

It is true to say that the Balkans are at present not in the public eye, that they are not hitting the headlines. Thank goodness, you might say, because it is usually only bad news there that makes the front pages. Nevertheless, there are far-reaching problems. Growth in the Balkans is too weak for them to catch up. They have high unemployment, low inward investment, and there are still open wounds from the armed conflicts that marked the end of the former Yugoslavia. The process of refugee return remains to be completed and the process of nation building is still incomplete and uncertain – we only have to think of Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Macedonia or Bosnia and Herzegovina. Added to that, the area is characterised by international crime that is also spilling over into Western Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore the job of the Presidency and of the Thessaloniki Summit, the ‘Zagreb II Summit’, to make a clear offer to these countries, but also to spell out the conditions very clearly. We already have the Copenhagen Criteria, and there is no reason to bend the rules they stipulate. But we also need to help these countries carry out their economic reforms. It has already been mentioned that the CARDS programme alone is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to move towards pre-accession instruments and pre-accession aid, just as we did with the other enlargement countries, and secondly –as has also already been mentioned by others in the ‘Balkans brigade’ – we need to build up the rule of law. There can be no avoiding that. This means that the refugee problem must be solved, and that respect for minorities must be clear in people's hearts and minds and not just laid down in the law. There needs to be consistent prosecution of all crimes, and in particular, it should go without saying, of crimes against humanity. And there must be cooperation with The Hague. Like my fellow Members, I regret the fact that the United States is giving ambiguous signals: on the one hand strong pressure for cooperation with The Hague and on the other hand equally strong pressure to sign Article 98 agreements in connection with the International Criminal Court. That is untenable for us, and I believe and hope that the European Union – both the Council and the Commission – will make it clear to these countries that such agreements run counter not only to the spirit of the Common Foreign and Security Policy but also to the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>that we have created in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am hoping for three things from the Thessaloniki Summit. The first is to give these countries clear membership prospects, which is essential; the second is to extend the support instruments not only quantitatively but also qualitatively, as part of preparations for an accession strategy; and the third point is strict monitoring. I agree with those fellow Members who have said that this is not about being particularly benevolent. We need to be able to tell those countries exactly where there are still problems, but we also need to be able to tell them where progress has been made. I hope – and this, Mr Prodi, is a job for the Commission – that Europe will react swiftly to the application by Croatia, the first of these countries to apply for membership. In principle, we should be giving a positive reply, at least I hope that things are moving in that direction. But there are also still certain things that Croatia needs to address, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe not only that the Thessaloniki Summit should be described as ‘Zagreb II’, it should also be a kind of pre-Copenhagen, that is to say a Copenhagen I, in that it gives clear signals. Something can also be done as regards visa policy; it can simply be made more flexible, without having to lift visa requirements at this stage. Mr President-in-Office, I hope you will take on board that although we in this House are watching these countries with an extremely strict and critical eye, we also share the belief that we should give them reasonable European prospects. If you do that in Thessaloniki, then you will be able to chalk up a great success.</p>

First of all, to congratulate the Greek Presidency, which, in a troubled and difficult period for Europe, has achieved a great deal, showing once again that there is no correlation between the size of a country and the quality of its European presidency. Secondly, to note that the management of the serious European and world events in the past six months has shown the limits of an economic Europe that is too liberal in its foundations and not sufficiently democratic in its functioning. Lastly, in particular, to call once again for political debate towards another Europe, a social, people’s Europe, nourished by its diversity, rather than a Europe that seeks to banish this diversity.</p>

<p class="contents">The President-in-Office and President Prodi have described the workings of the Convention – this is not the Convention I have been attending. The minister referred to 'consensus', but not to 'majority'. We have found a 'consensus' on one issue where there were five speeches in favour of a project and 49 against, but President Giscard d'Estaing felt that was a consensus in favour! He also said that the IGC will 'take into account'. What does that mean? For me that confirms that the Praesidium has actually been working as a kind of pre-IGC. President Prodi said that the deliberations were taken in the full light of day – but not the meetings of the Praesidium, nor the private meetings between Giscard d'Estaing and some Heads of Government, nor the leaks to <span class="italic">Le Monde</span>, putting very extreme positions from which Giscard d'Estaing could then be seen to negotiate to merely difficult or mildly impossible positions.</p>
<p class="contents">I fear we have missed an opportunity. We were told that all subjects were open to start with, but the subject of reform of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> has been closed. There is no mechanism for reviewing current legislation and the regulatory regime – that has been refused. There is to be no rewriting of Nice – that has been refused. This is not something that you can say is open.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made progress, but in which direction? I fear we have made progress in the direction of the Council of Ministers and in the direction of national governments, not in the direction of this House and the people we represent.

<p class="contents">These institutional questions are all very important, but in my view must really only come into play when we have reached agreement on the content of European policy areas. Europe must become important for its citizens. It must also ask these citizens for an effective policy in the area of foreign affairs, a policy in respect of social issues such as pensions, employment an economic policy, a security policy, a policy in the important area of asylum and migration and, let us not forget, an environmentally friendly and fair agriculture policy. In all these areas we must move away from paralysing vetoes and towards truly effective decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe, that means making a policy for European citizens so that we can create an area of security, solidarity and prosperity for all. Europe is about content and not about window dressing. Institutional questions are very important, but first we must give Europe back to its citizens. Only when we are sure that where European policy is needed it can also be effectively structured can we start the debate about the architecture. It has to be simpler, more understandable, more effective and closer to the citizen – more democratic in other words. That means a President of the Commission elected by the European Parliament and a troika presidency of the European Council that guarantees both continuity and the involvement of individual countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on both the European Convention and those government leaders who will shortly be attending the IGC to persevere and to opt for an effective and democratic, that is communal, Europe. It is precisely in areas such as migration and asylum policy that we have seen the lack of results when policy is made by way of intergovernmental back rooms.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Mr President, make the policy communal, excluding the right of initiative for the European Commission and with decisions taken by both the Council, by qualified majority, and by Parliament. Start by ensuring in particular that the content is in order and then provide for an adequate democratic structure through a debate about the institutions. Only in this way can a credible Europe be created for its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Give Europe back to its citizens by allowing them to express an opinion on the European constitution through a referendum. That will force the political parties and the public at large into an active and political debate about Europe. I call on my Dutch colleagues in the CDA and the VVD to support this idea and to distance themselves from Dutch back room politics. The European citizen deserves better, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The future of the European Union is at stake – nothing more and nothing less. That is why the Convention has had to present a draft constitutional treaty for the European Union under enormous time pressure, a constitution that will prevent the European Union from becoming an impotent giant when it admits 10 new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This enlargement presents the European Union with an enormous historical opportunity, an opportunity that we must seize. However, we can only take full advantage of this opportunity if we try to take into account the principles of equal rights for all Member States, the balance between the institutions and the ability of the European Parliament to play a full part in the legislative process. There should not be any attempt to make the European Union artificially smaller, to create a core EU of the original six members with the remaining members outside this inner circle. A multi-speed Europe in which the influence of Member States varies would weaken the cohesion of the European Union. The criteria for the future treaty of the European Union should not be large or small nor old or new. This applies in particular to those accession countries where referendums are still to be held and where there is a very definite scepticism about a European superstructure.</p>
<p class="contents">Austria has therefore worked successfully for the interests of the smaller Member States – not that these countries needed us to act as their advocate. However, in politics conformity of interests is a valuable means of achieving legitimate demands. The hallmark of an EU constitutional treaty should therefore be that it does not unilaterally strengthen the intergovernmental approach at the cost of Community institutions like the Commission and Parliament, that it should not paralyse the EU by creating artificial functions that do not necessarily bring the EU any closer to its citizens and only eat up taxpayers' money, and that it should strengthen the EU's ability to act, both externally and internally. I therefore welcome the <span class="italic">de facto</span> agreement on the European Foreign Minister. Although the dual presidency concept has not been totally abandoned, we need to seek models which prevent paralysis of the EU and which at the same time grant every country a Commissioner's post and which strengthen the President of the Commission and provide for that President to be chosen by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">At least as important as the draft constitution is the fight against illegal immigration, which is very closely linked with the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice. With 500 000 illegal immigrants entering the EU every year, we need to find ways of tackling this real problem, in other words we need to create means of offering support to refugees on the ground and to provide for rapid decision making in the asylum process. Asylum policy must be based on the Geneva Convention and on common minimum standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I personally do not dream of Europe as a great power in world affairs, becoming policeman and teacher to the rest of the world. I dream of a world governed by international law, based on cooperation between all States, large and small.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is currently experiencing a few problems. Nonetheless, thanks to Community cooperation, our Europe is certainly the fairest, most egalitarian society in the world. Our ambition should be to eliminate the last inequalities in Europe, enabling every individual to work and live decently. To do so, we need to share: share within the Union, share with the new Member States, share with developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Politically, our Union must be able to speak with one voice. This means that the most original institution of the Union, the Commission, must represent all the Member States. The Commission must remain the driving force, with which each citizen must be able to identify. This politically more united Europe, however, is not a goal in itself. The aim of political action is to satisfy the economic, social, environmental and cultural needs of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention has devoted far too much attention to the institutional architecture, which will serve no purpose if we do not provide ourselves with the political means to achieve sustainable development and economic growth in order to ensure full employment. Currently, the European Central Bank’s interpretation of Article 105(1) of the Treaty is too restrictive, limited to the sole objective of combating inflation. Although stability is necessary, the fight against deflation and for growth is equally essential. Hence the need to specify the ECB’s mission as follows: ‘the main objective of the European System of Central Banks is to maintain price stability. While combating inflation and deflation, the ESCB should support the other economic and social policies of the Union’. This clarification of the mission of monetary policy is vital if Europe does not want to suffocate in formal stability, which, ultimately, is unproductive.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end, Mr President, by thanking Greece for an exceptional presidency. This shows, once again, that the smaller countries generally accomplish a better presidency than the larger, more conceited countries, which, out of personal vanity, want to abolish rotating presidencies.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to mention a few issues regarding foreign policy in the Convention. The new document presented to us here defines the objectives of the European Union's foreign policy. It goes without saying that we wish to use our foreign policy to promote human rights, democracy and environmental protection. But there is one thing that is rather skimmed over here. For me, it is self-evident that the first and most important objective of the European Union must be the Common Foreign and Security Policy, in other words effectively representing the interests of the EU's citizens and the interests of the European Union itself on the world stage, and in particular our citizens' desire to live in peace and security.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some things in this field that should not be allowed to happen again. We as the European Union should not be left without a voice, as happened on Iraq. Hence our demand that we should introduce majority voting in this area, because only in that way can the European Union act effectively in the field of foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">What we also need is an EU security strategy as a counterpart to the security strategy published by the American administration in September last year. We as Europeans need to adopt a clear position on a number of issues here – first the United States' claim to leadership and second the statements made here about a preventive war. We know that Mr Solana has been charged with the task of presenting a proposal to the Heads of State and Government for Thessaloniki. However, that can only be a first step in this debate. The debate needs to be an open one and it needs to be held in the European Parliament, because we Europeans must, on the basis of a wide-ranging debate, reach a common position on these important issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to ask ourselves what the position on a division of labour with the United States is. Do we want a situation in which we leave military intervention to the United States, with Europe looking after the financial mopping up, as people sometimes call it? Or do we want to agree that Europe should play a regional role here, for example the task of guaranteeing peace and security in its own geographical region? These are important and vital decisions in which Parliament, too, should be involved. Above all, we Europeans should make it clear that the EUR 160 billion spent by the 15 EU Member States on defence need to be spent more efficiently in future, and if we want to be up there with the United States we will also need to spend more money, hard though that may be!</p>
<p class="contents">Now, what is Parliament's role in all this? For example, the Military Committee in Brussels is discussing intervention in the Congo. That should not happen without Parliament being consulted. We should be kept informed about that; we should have an opportunity to deliver an opinion on it. If war and peace are at stake, things like this cannot be decided without consulting a directly elected parliament, and in this case that is this House. As a consequence this House needs to adopt an opinion on this important subject at the very least next week and beyond that, because careful consideration is needed as to whether with its present organisation the European Union is in a position to take on such a role. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Thessaloniki offers you the opportunity to strengthen the Union's immigration policies and to improve the measures for offering security to European citizens. These are two essential, but different, objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">You must confront the new threats resulting from organised crime, whose tentacles stretch throughout and beyond the European Union, and you have instruments for doing so, such as the European arrest warrant and Europol. Strengthen them and use them to combat large-scale international crime and also small-scale crime, the crime which fills our streets with beggars, children and prostitutes, victims of human trafficking, but please do so using the instruments necessary for each issue.</p>
<p class="contents">A member of Al Qaeda is not an illegal immigrant who indulges in terrorism, but an international criminal. And you must manage immigration, which is a different thing, a complex social phenomenon which should be dealt with from different angles.</p>
<p class="contents">Do that, please. Return to the global and integrated vision laid down at Tampere. Return to the map drawn up by the Commission, adopt the legislative framework envisaged, apply the measures proposed by the Commission with regard to third countries, integration, employment, with regard to all the issues relating to this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the majority of illegal immigrants enter the Union legally. The majority of illegal immigrants are domestic employees working in our homes. A danger to the European Union? To whom? And above all, please, please call things by their real name. If the leaders of the European Union are going to persist in mixing international organised crime with immigration we are going to have a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">If we tell the citizens that immigration, even if the adjective illegal is added, is one of the new dangers to be confronted by the Union, we should not be surprised if it leads to excessive reactions, we should not be surprised if it creates a problem with the citizens of the Union and their perception of immigration.</p>

That requirement is clarity: clarity when it comes both to the distribution of power and to well-defined competences.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Swede, I have an unhappy experience of the devising of constitutions. When the Swedish constitution – our fundamental law – was adopted, far too many questions were left unanswered. The Swedish Parliament – the Riksdag – was given more or less unlimited power to take decisions on just about every issue on the basis of a simple majority. Thanks to a unique Swedish tradition, freedom of expression and freedom of the press retained their strong position, but the political authorities were given the go-ahead to put their fingers into every pie.</p>
<p class="contents">This mistake of Sweden’s must not be repeated in a constitution for the European Union. The most important thing must be to devise a clear catalogue of competences explaining which tasks are to be carried out by the EU and which are to be carried out at national, or some other, level. There are proposals to make social issues with shared competence matters for the EU. As I see it, that would be an historic mistake. Such issues are best dealt with by each individual Member State. Moreover, I see no other way of proceeding in an enlarged EU with a huge range of economic conditions from one country to the next.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, all essential aspects of economic policy must remain the responsibility of the Member States. The euro is the Member States’ common responsibility, implying budgetary discipline. Taxes and decisions on expenditure must, however, remain the responsibility of the individual nations. There are large differences between one country and another, and flexibility is required. Low taxes will be the new Member States’ only chance of gradually catching up economically with the current Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of the distribution of power, it is important for us not to provide the EU with several presidents or institutional chairmen. That would scarcely contribute to a more effective EU. The rotating Presidency of the Council is also important if the Member States are to be able to feel they belong together. It is also a unique opportunity for small Member States too to influence the work of the EU. I therefore want to urge the Convention and the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to be very careful in establishing the shape of the future EU and the way in which it is to operate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of particular importance is the fact that the fundamental rights of EU citizens are to be determined as a binding component of the work of the Union. There are still shortcomings, however, in the organisation of the division of duties and responsibilities among the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It was the task of the Convention to put forward proposals to make decision-making more effective, clearer, more democratic and more transparent than before. This mandate cannot include the setting up of new institutions. The work of the Council does indeed need reforming, decisions must be taken openly and its work must have continuity. This cannot happen, however, with a permanent president who is beyond democratic control, or by reducing the Commission’s power of initiative and its executive power. Public support is absolutely essential for the future of the EU. One very conspicuous institution in all Member States is the Commission. In the name of equality, therefore, there must also be a Commissioner from all the Member States in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of the Convention has gone in the right direction with regard to the development of EU legislation. I support the appeal made today by President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, that the right of veto should be relinquished when the EU is making a decision. Using the right of veto does not achieve anything worthwhile as it only hampers and prolongs the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">One EU priority this term has been food safety. We have not succeeded in deciding where to locate the Food Agency, however, because the right of veto has been used. At Thessaloniki it will be necessary to sort this out and decide that the permanent home for the Food Safety Agency should be Helsinki. Helsinki is already totally equipped for the Agency to be able to start its work immediately after the decision has been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to say a special thank you to Greece, the country to hold the presidency, for the way it has helped the progress of matters to do with safety at sea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The agenda for Thessaloniki includes a series of burning issues which divide both the Member States and public opinion. The draft Constitutional Treaty is of primary importance and we hope the Convention will arrive at an integrated proposal which will get the European Union out of its identity crisis, rather than merely at a list of alternative solutions. I also hope, together with thousands of women's organisations throughout Europe, that the Constitutional Treaty will fully consolidate equality of the sexes in all sectors, abolish any exclusion on the basis of gender and safeguard the balanced participation of men and women in the European democratic institutions. Women will never accept a constitution which excludes equality of the sexes from the Union's values and objectives. Women will never accept that the escalating violence against them and the outbreak of trafficking and sexual exploitation cannot be dealt with due to a lack of clear legal basis in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of asylum and immigration, the thinking behind the United Kingdom draft on asylum reform, which literally leaves the 1951 Geneva Convention in tatters, should be rejected. Any political decisions in Thessaloniki will need to take serious account of the proposals of the UN High Commissioner for refugees. As Mrs Terrón i Cusí also said, most immigrants in the European Union come in through legal channels. We therefore need to manage immigration flows better, not to further reinforce our borders, apply repressive measures and/or link immigration with the activities of criminal networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think the agenda of the EU-USA summit should include: first, the abolition of the death penalty in the United States, secondly, the treatment of the prisoners in Guantanamo and, thirdly, what we called here in this House the lie of the century, by which I mean the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.</p>

<p class="contents">This is the last day the Greek Presidency and I personally shall attend the European Parliament. We still have about three weeks, which covers our programme, and I have also noted the points in which there is particular interest in our making a last effort, so that we can see if we can resolve matters which have been outstanding for some time. As far as issues relating to the Presidency's review and developments on a series of issues which are not so closely connected with Thessaloniki are concerned, that is the job of the Prime Minister, Mr Simitis, and is scheduled for 1 July. Ladies and gentlemen, I shall refer briefly to the three issues – and perhaps a few others – to which I referred in connection with Thessaloniki.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the issue of the western Balkans. Yes, indeed, it is very important to the Balkans to receive a political message from the European Union, that there is support for their European prospects, that they will be assisted in their European prospects, that they too must make a series of efforts and reforms if they are to move forward successfully, and that we are close by and we have their course towards integration in prospect. Our Presidency considers that the Balkans are not some far off place. They are in Europe, which is why it is very important for the European Union to treat this fragile region with care. Consequently, we want the outcome of the meeting to give impetus to the integration procedure, to signal policies and, of course, for there to be appropriate funding to support the efforts of these countries in moving forward. We all know about the tragic incident involving the prime minister of Serbia, Mr Djindjic, a few months ago. At least one might say that one positive element to come out of this tragic development was that it woke people up. There is greater understanding and effort on numerous sides.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the issues of immigration are concerned, this is a huge problem for Europe which, if not overshadowed by political developments concerning Iraq over the last six months, will continue to be a heavyweight issue, as it was at the end of the last Presidency. Nonetheless, we believe that it is a major issue, irrespective of political developments. Efforts must be made. We are also expecting initiatives from the Commission and Council this month, so that we can see what else can be done. We must strike a balance between immigrants living in the European area legally and our societies. We must find ways of dealing with the problem of illegal immigration and fears in society. However, we must also find funding methods for dealing with these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, major reference was made, and logically so, to the issue of the Convention, which will be a top issue at the summit. Indeed, Thessaloniki will be important for this issue and we, the Greek Presidency, want it to be a success. Laeken signalled the prospects and terms within which the Convention must act. In Thessaloniki, if we act appropriately, we will achieve a satisfactory result, which is important to the future of Europe and European integration and we hope that the time left until then will be used by all players so that we can safeguard this productive result.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close by saying that, a few months after the start of the Greek Presidency, Europe was at a very important and different stage. We are an area with 25 Member States. We are an area which, for the last two or three years, has a single currency. We are a union which has progressed and realised the need for institutional changes, which sees it needs a stronger presence in the field of foreign policy and defence. What has happened in the meantime, during these months, has been catalytic for these issues. We are a Europe which is now discussing new policies, such as the so-called Wider Europe New Neighbourhood policy, the issues of the Balkans, of the Mediterranean, of the Middle East, the issues of economic intergovernmentalism and immigration. All these mark ... or rather give a different bearing for the course of Europe. We are an area which, I believe, within all this, must create conditions for confidence in the future of this area in its citizens, conditions for confidence in democracy and human rights, conditions for confidence in social achievements, employment, growth and, in general, conditions for confidence in our ability to respond to the serious problems of our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">I can see, within this philosophy, the answers which must be given by us by the end of this month and, of course, by subsequent Presidencies from next month onwards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this has been a very heated, highly interesting debate; I have noted all the issues raised, vital issues for our future: from the Balkans question to equality of the Union’s citizens, to safeguarding the Institutions. During this brief reply, I will restrict myself simply to making an appeal, which I consider absolutely necessary and indispensable today when, at Thessaloniki, we will have to take fundamental decisions for our whole future.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to appeal to the Convention to give us the response that many of you – starting with Mr Wurtz – have said that the Convention has not yet provided. There is a very simple reason for this. We decided to form the Convention during our institutions’ deepest crisis; we decided on it all together after the night of debate at Nice, when we saw that the intergovernmental method of negotiations between States – precisely, during the intergovernmental nights of talks – did not provide satisfactory results; we decided to take that path in order to restore to our people and our parliaments the sovereignty which befits them.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the Convention has got down to business: it was to be a finite process; the Convention was to give the Intergovernmental Conference a finished product. Instead, a parallel process has emerged: a kind of Intergovernmental Conference parallel to the Convention has come about, which has divided into various fragments and which is in danger, at this time, of further fragmentation. I repeat what Mrs Frassoni said: currently a false impression is being given, a false message that the Convention is split on everything. Therefore, my appeal is very simple: we want the Convention to carry out the Convention’s work fully, autonomously; we want it to produce, as you have all requested, a clear, systematic draft, because the Convention Assembly represents all the citizens, all the countries, all the institutions of Europe. We need its voice, we need it to carry out its role in full.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent months, we have been divided over basic policy points and we have also suffered humiliation in our foreign policy. Do we wish to deny ourselves the instruments we need to restore our dignity? Do we wish to deny ourselves the courage to advance proposals which are becoming instruments necessary for our survival? I can summarise with great satisfaction the contribution of all the leaders of the main political groups – whom I have the pleasure of seeing here before me – who, as one, have put forward coherent, courageous proposals on the coalition rules, on Parliament’s role, on the future dynamics of the Institutions. They have put forward courageous proposals for both today and tomorrow, such as combining the President of the Commission and the President of the Council. They have given us, all working together, a single framework of what they want for the Europe of the future. And so, just as I am calling on the Convention to express a single, strong opinion and to present it to the Intergovernmental Conference,</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am calling on you, chairmen of the largest European parliamentary groups, to tell our friends and fellow Members in plenary to speak out loud and clear, to make clear the conditions under which they will agree to sign the new agreement upon which Europe must be built. This is my appeal to you, because, at this time, we all need the Convention’s voice for the new Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">The problem is this, Mr President: what happens when a State, abusing the concept of <span class="italic">in flagrante delicto</span>, clearly violates the parliamentary immunity of a Member of this Parliament and eventually, through a series of criminal proceedings, deprives them of their mandate? That is the case of Mr Le Pen: whatever we might think of Mr Le Pen’s opinions, the fact remains that the French Government did not ask for his immunity to be lifted before instigating criminal proceedings, which initially were against the law and were then artificially corrected in order to be able to deprive him of his mandate. I believe that, in such cases, our Parliament should refuse to give legal effect to these criminal sanctions and their indirect consequences, which are achieved illegitimately in such circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
