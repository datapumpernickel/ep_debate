Equally sincere thanks go to all the shadow rapporteurs for the optimum cooperation there has been, and thanks, too, to the Commission officers, the representatives of the various associations and all those Members who have contributed to improving this important and sensitive directive with excellent amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive fills a void which has existed in Europe up to now around standards of blood quality and safety. The objective of this directive is primarily the protection of donors and patients, finally making it possible for all the Member States to have the same standards which ensure the maximum possible level of quality and safety of blood and blood components, not only for blood available in the countries of the European Union but also for blood imported from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive provides for continuous updating, at least annually, of laboratory tests to identify bacterial or viral pathogens and other infective agents, as well as upgrading to the most sophisticated technology for safer and more effective sterilisation of blood and blood components. There are also recommendations to the Member States to strengthen scientific research in the sector. The existence of a new European directive which provides for the same standards of quality in the individual Member States will facilitate the free movement of blood from one European Union country to another and remove uncalled-for restrictions on donors moving between countries.</p>
<p class="contents">High standards of quality and safety must apply during all stages in the transfusion chain, from donation to inspection by means of specific laboratory tests, collection, processing, storage, distribution and utilisation of whole human blood and its components.</p>
<p class="contents">The quality and effectiveness guarantees must therefore cover the suitability of blood donors, plasma and their components, the transfusion structures, the qualifications and training of medical, technical and nursing staff and the checking, inspection and control mechanisms, as well as a system for ensuring the traceability of blood from donor to recipient. The European Parliament provides for the person responsible to have a qualification in medicine, preferably with a specialisation in haematology or transfusion medicine or related medical specialisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to gain a better understanding of the importance of monitoring each stage in the process, it is worth considering the unfortunate, terrible, adverse reactions which have occurred and which we hope will never occur again, for example AIDS, hepatitis B and C and other, sometimes fatal infections, like anaphylactic shock or endotoxic shock.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has accepted the rapporteur’s proposal to delete the annexes, as they cover extremely complex technical matters. They should be updated periodically by a simple and flexible mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the principle by which all donations should take place on a voluntary non-remunerated basis has been strengthened by numerous amendments from Parliament. However in my opinion, Commissioner, the priority is to safeguard the needs and requirements of patients. In fact, in view of the sadly limited number of donors still, and Europe’s lack of self-sufficiency in blood, if all forms of incentive for donors were immediately banned it would create enormous, even fatal, difficulties for patients. The shortage of blood and plasma is a well-known problem in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I hope the House will approve the amendment by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party which upholds the principle of free and voluntary donation on the one hand, but allows a transitional phase for achieving that principle on the other. An oral amendment by Mr Lisi states that by the end of December 2008 all donations must be voluntary and non-remunerated. Individual Member States must encourage the achievement of that principle, but sufficiently gradually to avoid any possible catastrophic effects on the public.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards imported blood – Amendment No 43 – it should be specified that the criteria this amendment refers to relate to the quality and safety of the blood.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, the guarantee of high standards of quality, effectiveness and safety of blood provided for in the directive will mean greater peace of mind for European Union citizens about any treatment with blood, as well as greater confidence in the European institutions and the national authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore warmly welcome this directive with its inclusion of quality and safety norms for collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of blood and blood constituents.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to compliment Mr Nisticò on his report and the way in which he has also improved the structure of the bill. However, on one point I disagree with him. In my view – and this is also the view of Mr Nisticò for that matter – there are two important principles to which we in Europe must adhere and which I have constantly championed, in this House from 1989 and before that in the Netherlands. What are those principles? Besides self-supply within the Union, this is the voluntary and unpaid provision of blood and blood products.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments show that, as regards free provision, it is quite possible to give the donor a small consideration for his/her trouble. Recently there has been much talk about the no-payment principle in particular. I should like to make a few remarks about this. First and foremost, for me the safety of blood and blood products carries top priority. This cannot be overlooked. Voluntary and unpaid donation is a question of safety and not just an act of human benevolence. The safety of blood obtained free of charge is greater in comparison with other kinds of donations – and that has been demonstrated scientifically and not only in my own country.</p>
<p class="contents">Should shortages of certain products arise that are needed, for instance, for haemophilia patients, there is absolutely nothing against making up for those shortfalls by importing other blood. If we start meddling with this principle, that will have a disruptive effect on the public bloodbanks which we are familiar with in a number of Member States. Therefore I believe, unfortunately, Mr Nisticò, that in the compromise that you have struck, there has been too much tampering with the principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lund (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the Commission for now having led the way by implementing the new provisions in the Treaty of Amsterdam establishing quality and safety standards for, among other things, human blood and blood components. I should also, however, like to thank Mr Nisticò for the work he has put into the report. I think it is a fine piece of work, and I am very pleased that, through the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we are able to help improve the directive. With the improvements proposed by the Committee, we can make for greater safety and ensure blood of a higher quality, from collection right up to distribution. I also think that we shall have some crucial issues settled: firstly, that blood is not a commodity subject to the usual rules governing free trade.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, with regard to self-sufficiency too, it is important for it to be said that, by means of these rules in the individual countries and in the EU as a whole, we can prioritise the issue of self-sufficiency. Blood donated from a country’s own population is clearly the best solution, and I would therefore urge all countries to establish large pools of donors who see it as their task, both personally and as members of society, to give blood and plasma to help other people in their own societies. Many countries have already established pools of donors. It can be done in actual fact, and there is therefore no excuse for those countries which have still not established such pools. It is just a question of getting them going. If such a large corps of donors is obtained, so too is a larger quantity of blood and, thus, the opportunity of genuinely becoming self-sufficient in blood of the highest quality. That also leads me to say a few words about the extent to which blood donation should be non-remunerated, which is of course the major issue here. I believe that blood donation should be non-remunerated, as also recommended by the Council of Europe in its guidelines and by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. I think there are two reasons for specifying this. The first reason is ethical. In my view, a person’s blood, tissue and organs ought not to be commodities. That is one reason. The other reason is that non-remunerated donation provides blood which is safest and of the highest quality. Countless investigations show that blood donated for no remuneration is of a higher quality than blood otherwise obtained, and I think we have to tell it like it is: a pool of donors based upon voluntary and non-remunerated blood donation is different from a pool based upon remunerated donation. In that connection, I am delighted with the broad support given by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to the Council of Europe’s definition of voluntary, non-remunerated blood donation.</p>
<p class="contents">There are sectors of industry which have lobbied powerfully against non-remunerated blood donation and, as usual, patients have been elbowed out of the way in the process. I find that unsavoury, and I think that, in reality, industry is quite cynically helping to prevent the ideal situation for patients who have to be given blood, namely that blood and plasma are donated without remuneration and thus from an established and stable body of donors. I think it provides food for thought that those countries in which there is non-remunerated donation by a large and stable body of donors are also, in actual fact, self-sufficient in blood and plasma.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to add to what Mr Nisticò has said by pointing out that I am pleased with the oral amendment to Mr Nisticò’s Amendment No 75 and that, in my view, there is no one at all in this House who could dream of putting a patient in a situation in which he was unable to obtain blood or plasma. Naturally, all patients must be able to obtain these, but I believe that we serve patients best by having non-remunerated blood donation and thus securing blood of the highest quality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ries (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, first of all, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Nisticò, for his thorough and excellent report, and for his open-mindedness and willingness to cooperate with the shadow rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is essential. For the first time, it lays down in Community legislation quality and safety standards for blood products, whether they are intended for transfusions or as starting materials for medicinal products. I should also say that it also provides for the free movement of donors and blood products within the Union. I regard the proposal as being both ambitious and satisfactory overall. I would like to add that the main improvements approved by the committee all seek the same thing: to strengthen checking, inspection and monitoring measures throughout the transfusion chain, in order to protect donors from human error and to protect recipients against the risks of being exposed to donated blood that may be contaminated.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, patients now face another threat: the shortage of plasma and plasma derivates in the Union. That is why the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is opposed to the absolute and immediate obligation to make donation non-remunerated, that is to Amendments Nos 55 and 56, which, I would like to say in passing, also seem to run totally counter to the whole principle of subsidiarity. I say that first of all because non-remunerated donation is in no way under threat. We have never questioned the principle of voluntary donation or the essential social role played by voluntary donors. So it is not the principle of non-remunerated donation that is being questioned, but compulsory non-remuneration.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also and above all opposed to these amendments because they totally disregard the concerns of patients. We consulted in depth patients who are particularly concerned, and here I am using a euphemism, about the ever-increasing dependence on imports of American plasma in particular. This especially applies to haemophiliacs who remember that non-remuneration in no way protected them against viral contamination. We do not want the better to be the enemy of the good here. It is clear and it is vital that blood should not be a source of profit. This is repeated in several places, in several recitals, in the compromise amendment which we have tabled together with the PPE Group. This is an objective imposed on the Member States in accordance with the conditions and timing laid down in Amendment No 75, but making non-remuneration an absolute condition for donating blood would be a disaster for patients, and I mean patients and not industrialists, Mr Lund, because we have had in-depth discussions with haemophiliacs in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">What really counts here is that blood should be of the highest quality and the directive ensures this, but what is the use of ensuring quality and safety if the blood is not available? Let me remind you that Europe has 7 million blood donors out of a population of 360 million.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, that is why I am calling on all the political groups to support this compromise amendment which ensures free access on the part of patients to blood and to medicinal products, both of which each day save thousands of lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From this point of view, Mr Nisticò’s report, which has been enhanced by various amendments adopted almost unanimously in committee, is a step towards improved human health protection, in particular because it calls for better medical checks on donors and also increases the responsibility of doctors and establishments dealing with blood at all stages, from collection through to storage and including the point at which blood is converted into blood derivates.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have seen, there remains an important question on which there is no consensus between us: whether donation should be remunerated or not. We believe that the principle of non-remunerated blood donation is very important, a principle applied in many European countries without leading to shortages, and we cannot accept that this principle should be undermined, for two essential reasons. Firstly, from an ethical point of view, we cannot advocate the idea of selling blood or any body part. The human body is not a commodity. Furthermore, we find it extremely shocking that companies should be able to profit from blood donated without remuneration. Secondly, remunerating blood donation could be counter-productive in terms of quality. Donors attracted by a financial inventive may want to conceal possible health problems, which could have dramatic consequences for their own health and the health of the recipients. Recent information on the hundreds of thousands of Chinese now affected by AIDS because they have sold their plasma is a tragic illustration of this and we do not want the same situation to occur in Europe tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is essential that this directive creates uniform standards for the safety and quality of blood and plasma in the Member States. To this end, identical procedures for testing blood and plasma must be adopted which comply with the most recent techniques. Trained personnel should ensure the highest safety standards for donors and recipients alike. A transparent system of traceability and labelling will allow blood to be traced from donor to recipient and back. This also helps to minimise the risk of infection.</p>
<p class="contents">Voluntary, non-remunerated donation is, and should remain, a basic principle. Unlike Mr Lund, I believe that there is certainly no direct link between non-remunerated and remunerated donation and safety/quality. The key issue is the selection of donors and testing by qualified personnel. However, reimbursement for plasma donors must not be ruled out in the European Union in future. Europe can only cover 50% of its plasma needs. The shortfall is made up from plasma from the US, for which the donors have received payment. The import of plasma from paid donors must not be prohibited by the new directive. This would inevitably lead to supply shortages, which would also affect the manufacture of medicines from these products. Plasma is required to produce vital medicines such as coagulation factor 8 and coagulation factor 7 for haemophiliacs, and immunoglobulins to prevent infection in patients with congenital immune deficiency. A shortage would put many patients’ health at risk. I would ask you to bear this in mind when voting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every week we hear across the EU story after story about this issue. I believe that every Member of the House wants to be reassured with the knowledge that there is a level of safety and quality of blood and blood products throughout the transfusion process in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">For our citizens it means that in the unfortunate situation where, for instance, you have had an accident on holiday and you require a blood transfusion, you can guarantee the quality and safety being the same, whether it is on a Greek island or on a Scottish island. As we all know, the main area of difference between Members has been on the issue of remunerated and non-remunerated blood products. I believe that the preferred option should be that blood is given voluntarily. As the European Blood Alliance outline, voluntary and non-remunerated donations of blood and blood components are considered to be a gift from healthy citizens to those in need. But more importantly, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights prohibits the making of the human body and its parts a source of financial gain.</p>
<p class="contents">We as a parliament, and within the institutions, have consistently advocated voluntary, non-remunerated donations. Evidence shows that the prevalence of viruses and diseases which may be transmitted through blood is higher in those donors who are remunerated than those who donate without receiving payment.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, one issue which I would like to highlight. That is Amendment No 43. In Scotland and the UK we have a specific issue with CJD. Many haemophiliacs and those with immune disorders depend on blood products from the US, the reason being that in Scotland and the UK we no longer use plasma from UK donors to make blood products because of CJD and rely instead on imports of plasma from the US.</p>
<p class="contents">The oral amendment advocated by Mrs Korhola to Amendment No 43 is greatly welcomed. I hope Members will support it tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the safety, quality and standard of blood and blood products is an important issue which we have to get right. Perhaps in the second reading the rapporteur could organise outside this Chamber an opportunity for Members to donate blood. After all, as Members, we should lead by example. Giving blood is a positive act of citizenship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know the risks and dangers and the importance of quality and safety in our blood supplies. That is why I welcome this proposal, particularly the work of my colleague Mr Nisticò.</p>
<p class="contents">But it would be a tragedy if it was spoiled by one amendment, an amendment which exacerbated the known shortages of rare blood groups and plasma. It would be a tragedy in a very real sense because the WHO points out that there are 80 primary immune deficiency conditions in our world and it is estimated that some 50 000 to 90 000 people in our Europe suffer from those conditions. Most are treatable, most people can lead fairly full lives but only if, every three weeks of their life for as long as they live, they have an infusion of immunoglobin which comes from human plasma and that keeps them alive.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe uses 7 million litres per annum, and 4 million litres come from compensated donors. Of course we would all prefer all donations to be voluntary. In the United Kingdom they are all voluntary but in the United Kingdom, as we have heard, there is no plasma coming from UK donors for blood products because of the theoretical risk of variant CJD being transmitted by blood. Nor can we take any from other countries in Europe. It does not matter about blood banks or plasma banks in Europe – we cannot take them from countries in the EU where there has been BSE or new variant CJD so we have to look elsewhere, and we and others rely largely on the United States’ supplies. The United Kingdom Department of Health has said there are no acceptable alternative sources. Of course, such imports include remunerated donations and there is no evidence at all that they are any less safe than unremunerated ones. Amendment No 43 would ban the import of such literally life-saving plasma and I urge the support of this House for the rapporteur’s compromise amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The primary objective in introducing new rules is to update the legislative framework, so that it covers areas not covered by Community legislation, by tightening the requirements for suitable blood donors, plasma and blood tests and creating a Community quality system for blood donation centres.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight two points where I have tried to improve the Commission text – and hence safety – for both the donors and the recipients of blood or blood components. I refer to Amendment No 33, requiring the manager of the blood donation centre to have at least a medical degree, preferably specialising in haematology or some related discipline. The second important point is that blood is in ever shorter supply. In Greece, the demand has increased to the point at which about three in ten patients require blood and, despite the increase in the supply of blood from volunteers, more and more blood has to be imported. The aim of Amendment No 75 is to ensure that the ban on blood donation incentives is not an absolute ban because it is wrong, for medical and scientific reasons, to be dogmatic on such an important health issue. The fact that we want blood donors to be volunteers should not be expressed in absolute terms. We must give the Member States and blood donation centres the facility to offer incentives to cover the collection, testing, storage and distribution of rare blood groups and their components as and where necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate Mr Nisticò on his really excellent work and to ask the House to vote in favour of Amendment No 75 which, while adhering to the principle of voluntary blood donation, really does give the Member States and blood donation centres the facility to meet any requirements and, medically and scientifically speaking, this is exactly how it should be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I tabled an amendment regarding the non-remuneration of donor services together with my colleague, Mrs Grossetête, and the committee adopted it. I appeal to my colleagues to maintain this position now also. Various patient groups and authorities have appealed to us here in Parliament not to allow blood donation to become commercialised. Firstly there is a safety risk. Allowing remuneration will mean the donor profile will change and the overall risk increase: comparative studies show that the state of health of remunerated donors is poorer. The importance of tests has been emphasised here, and that is good. But with HIV tests, for example, there is a certain window period, as it is known, when the virus still does not show up.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also an ethical risk. I want to stress that we also have a responsibility for how the rest of the world might imitate our practices. If we permit the trade in what is part of the human body, i.e. blood, we have to remember that the less developed countries will follow Europe’s example. This will not only lead to exploitation but increased risks. We already know of a case in China where an absolute catastrophe related to blood quality occurred when blood donors were paid what were for them vast sums of money. In Austria 200 schillings is a nominal amount for the donor, but in Eastern Europe it is a considerable income. Is this what we really want for others and ourselves?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the risk of being guilty of inconsistency. Many EU countries have signed the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine, which categorically prohibits the financial exploitation of the human body and its parts, including blood.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not dispute the need for plasma, and its shortage is very much a reality. It is nevertheless intellectually dishonest to open up this whole area to market forces just because there is a shortage of plasma. Amendment No 17, however, makes adequate guarantees regarding the possibility of reimbursing costs incurred in donating plasma including travel expenses, and of offering compensation for lost working time. At the same time I would like to ask my colleagues to support the oral amendment I intend to propose for Amendment No 43. It would allow exceptions to be made in cases where the plasma shortage really is an insurmountable problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the hundreds and thousands of haemophiliacs and all those patients with the whole range of immunodeficiency diseases, these are life threatening issues which they are faced with on a daily basis. While I agree – and no one disagrees in this House – that we must foster a culture of voluntary donations as the norm, as the ethos, in all our Member States, I plead with this House not to specifically exclude paid donations. Let us not exclude them for the rare blood groups and for the very scarce plasma and plasma products if they are needed to pay to ensure adequacy of supply.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a question of ‘if there is a shortage of supply’. There is one already. Today 40-50% of plasma products used each year by European patients come from plasma donors who are compensated for their time and inconvenience for this lengthy process. These plasma products, particularly in the UK and Ireland, are largely imported from the US from paid donors.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments to this directive, which were voted and passed by the Environment Committee, will have a major impact on public health. They will prevent the remuneration of donors in any circumstances and preclude importation of plasma and plasma products from paid donors. There is no longer any public health justification for imposing an absolute requirement for all donations to be non-remunerated. This was the case in the seventies and eighties but it is no longer with our screening and sterilisation process.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Byrne, I would like to put a question specifically to you and maybe you could answer it in your reply: do the amendments which were passed in the Environment Committee violate EU law, particularly various sections of Article 152? I draw your attention to Article 152(5) which prevents Community action from affecting national provisions on the donation of blood. Do the amendments actually violate EU law? The doctors’ organisations, the patients’ organisations throughout Europe are pleading with us not to specifically exclude paid donations.</p>

Important, as it constitutes our first directive based on the new and strengthened provisions in Article 152 of the Treaty, and ambitious, as a crucial element in our overall health strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I turn to the details of the directive on the table today, let me pay tribute to the successful and valuable work of the Council of Europe in the area of blood safety. Our proposal for a directive builds on these achievements.</p>
<p class="contents">This new directive will cover blood and blood components not considered medicinal products in so far as it will ensure a comparable level of quality and safety throughout the blood transfusion chain in all Member States. In addition, the directive lays down provisions at Community level for a quality system for blood establishments and for the training of blood establishment staff.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to note that the amendments debated today in general are very supportive of the basic approach of the Commission to issues related to blood safety and the way these should be addressed at Community level. I appreciate the very valuable contribution of the European Parliament. A greater part of the amendments constitutes improvements, clarifications, and useful additions to the text and I thank Mr Nisticò and all his colleagues for their contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">We can accept in full 29 amendments. There are in addition a further 23 amendments which include valuable ideas that we can endorse, but which, as drafted, are not fully acceptable. This is either because they contain specific points of substance which conflict with the approach of the directive, or because they raise legal or technical difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">With so many amendments. it is not feasible for me to make specific comments on each of them. I will therefore concentrate on four key areas, where there are several amendments which we cannot accept, and where I believe that some clarification of the Commission’s position will be helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">First, ethical questions. We all agree that the principle of voluntary, non-remunerated blood donation is of a very high ethical value. As Mrs Stihler said, the EU charter of human rights demands that no financial gain shall be made from parts of the human body as such. Therefore I welcome, and will actively support, any contribution the Community can make to achieve comprehensive application of this principle. But we have to carefully analyse all aspects of the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I am determined to ensure that this new directive will not unwillingly contribute to shortages of life-saving therapies. The supply of blood and blood derivatives, such as plasma-derived drugs, is a matter of life and death for many patients, as many of you have said. Much of the plasma used for these drugs in Europe does not come from donations which can be considered ‘voluntary, non-remunerated’ in the strict sense of the words, and it is difficult to see how these donations could be replaced in the short term. There is a clear danger that a ban on them might result in severe shortages of these products.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently I consider it premature to effectively ban any donation which is not fully in line with the definition of ‘voluntary, non-remunerated donation’ provided for in Amendment No 17 and to this extent I agree with Mr Nisticò and with the contributions from Mrs Ries, Mrs Müller, Mr Bowis and Mrs Doyle. I endorse their views and I accept what they said in relation to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I have doubts about the legal basis for a provision determining the way donations should be carried out, and this issue was also raised by Mrs Doyle. Article 152 of the Treaty does not allow the Community to adopt measures which ‘affect national provisions on donation’. Whether an obligation to accept voluntary donation only can be justified in terms of increased safety seems questionable. Particularly in the field of plasma-derived products, safety nowadays depends far more on sophisticated screening tests and inactivation steps. Such a provision might therefore be challenged before the Court of Justice due to lack of an appropriate legal basis or on the grounds of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, I can only partly accept Amendments Nos 55 and 56. As already indicated, I am prepared to discuss any solution that would make it clear that a comprehensive application of the principle of voluntary, non-remunerated donation is a central long-term aim of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 1, 3, 7, 8, 12, 60 and 61 aim to introduce declarations or requirements of enhanced ethical standards in one way or another. All of them are certainly worthwhile discussing and studying in detail, but from our point of view they are not really suitable for this directive, because they are either not directly linked with its objectives or do not have a legal basis in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you said that remunerated donations have a greater risk from a safety point of view. Many of you referred to studies. All the advice I receive is that these are old studies. All of the modern studies run to the contrary. In view of the fact of what I said earlier in relation to other safety measures like screening tests and inactivation steps, these provide the degree of security that is necessary having regard to this particular debate. It was also suggested that if we did have a shortage of supply, that this could be replaced by imports, but I have to point out that the imports will be from remunerated sources, so this undermines the very purpose that people wish to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ries also mentioned that she had been contacted by haemophiliac associations and indeed some others made the same point. I should say that my services and I have also been contacted by haemophiliac and other associations urging us not to go down the route of eliminating from the chain donations from remunerated supply. I would urge Parliament to take this very much to heart when considering voting on this issue tomorrow and to follow the views that I am expressing on this. I fully endorse and fully agree with the views of many of you who have already spoken on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The next issue I want to touch on is the scope of the directive. The last part of Amendment No 13, together with Amendment No 72, aims to extend the scope of the directive to the collection and testing of blood and blood components as starting material for medicinal products. The Commission can accept this in principle, but legal clarity has to be maintained as to the respective fields of application of this directive and Directive 89/381/EEC on blood and plasma derived products. Therefore, it will be necessary to review the wording of both amendments in the light of the final compromise to be agreed with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments introduce the term ‘blood derivatives’ into the text of the directive; this cannot be accepted, because it might lead to confusion with ‘medicinal products’.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be clear: Everything made from blood and used in human therapy should fall under either this directive or the existing Directive 89/381/EEC. If any doubts exist the Commission will reconsider the definitions used.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point relates to the technical standards. The rapporteur has proposed to remove the technical annexes from the directive, and to adopt technical standards later by comitology.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate this approach and I am very grateful for the trust in the work of the Commission shown by this move. Members of Parliament will know that this is an issue that I have spoken on before in Parliament and I am particularly pleased that this approach has been adopted on this occasion. If the Council can accept this solution, my services will immediately start to draw up proposals for technical standards in order to ensure that they are adopted before the directive comes into force.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also reassure you that my services will not try to reinvent the wheel when preparing the regular adaptation of the technical standards according to scientific and technical progress. We will fully use the pioneering work of the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">To add to and further complicate these procedures would not be feasible in an area where quick decisions may have to be taken to protect public health. For this reason, I can only partly accept Amendments Nos 68 and 71, and I cannot accept Amendment No 69.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 39 and 41, which refer to another directive or ISO standards as reference for standards introduced under this directive, cannot be accepted. When proposing updated standards, the Commission will take into account all relevant external and EU standards by default. To mention some at the expense of others could cause legal problems in the application, or force the Community to apply standards established outside its legal framework.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also unable to accept Amendment No 22 introducing a definition of traceability, which in my view is not only too general but also not covered by the Treaty. Amendment No 44, introducing a universal donor identification system, which is both costly and over ambitious and unnecessary, is not acceptable either.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the qualifications of blood establishment staff. Amendment No 33 would restrict the qualifications of the ‘responsible person’ to that of a medical doctor. This is too restrictive and cannot be accepted. The ‘responsible person’ is, according to the proposal, charged with administrative and management tasks in relation to the application of the directive, and does not have medical responsibilities <span class="italic">per se</span>. But again Member States are free to impose further demands as to the qualifications of the ‘responsible person’.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, for the reasons I have set out, 19 amendments are not acceptable. These are Amendments Nos 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 19, 20, 22, 30, 33, 39, 41, 44, 47, 60, 61, 69 and 73. 52 amendments are acceptable in full or in part.</p>
<p class="contents">The following 23 amendments are acceptable in part: Amendment Nos 2, 5, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 21, 27, 28, 32, 35, 43, 46, 55, 56, 62, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71 and 72. The remaining 28 amendments can be accepted in full, including Amendment No 75, the so-called ‘compromise amendment’.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me, finally, repeat my appreciation for all the constructive work done by the rapporteur and the committee and indeed all of you present. Many of the amendments will improve the proposal. And for those elements where difficulties remain, the Commission is ready and willing to assist in finding solutions quickly. Indeed, the fact that the Commission can accept in whole or in part 52 of the 71 amendments shows our willingness to take on board Parliament’s substantial policy contributions and our confidence that together we will be able to bring forward this important objective and have it adopted as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The intention seems to be that this House should have a debate on blood at about midnight when the werewolves are out, but be that as it may, at precisely midnight, I heard Commissioner Byrne say – but it may have been an error of interpretation, which is why I should like to have it repeated – that he did not believe that blood from stable and voluntary pools of donors, familiar to us from a number of Member States, was safer and of a higher quality than that obtained from people who supplement their income by donating blood. I am shocked that this is how the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection views the situation, so I hope that he will deny having said these words. It is absolutely certain that blood from a voluntary and stable body of donors who readily make their blood available to their fellow members of society is of a better quality than blood obtained from people wishing to supplement their income in this way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whether the donation is voluntary or not does not affect safety. Safety – and Mr Trakatellis, another man of science, has confirmed this – depends on the quality and sophistication of the tests. Today we are concerned about prions because there are still no very advanced tests: there has only been one article published in <span class="italic">Nature</span>. I hope that soon, through the flexible and rapid updating mechanism, those tests too can ensure safe blood, but certainly that does not depend on whether a donor is a volunteer or receives an incentive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
