<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Franco Frattini, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, as you know, the European Court has stated that the Council and the Commission decision on the transfer of PNR data to the United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection serves the purpose of protection of public security and concerns public activities in the area of criminal law. Therefore, these activities are excluded from the scope of the European Data Protection Directive and Article 95 of the European Treaty, even when the data being processed was originally for the supply of commercial services.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in general concerning legal bases underlines the need for a single system of legal bases for justice, liberty and security issues. This is what I call the ‘Communitarisation’ of the so-called Third Pillar; therefore, I called upon the Council of Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs to ensure a clear legal framework for justice, freedom and security by favouring the use of the so-called <span class="italic">passerelle</span> clause, Article 42. I know that the European Parliament shares the Commission’s point of view on this very important matter, which I will raise again during the informal Council in Tampere in a few days’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this new agreement under negotiation with the United States should have the same content and include the same level of safeguards regarding legal certainty for air carriers, respect for human rights, notably the right to privacy, and the purposes for which the PNR data may be used. In addition, it could integrate the current undertakings, as requested in the draft recommendation attached to the annulled Commission decision, and which the United States currently implements.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, these undertakings provide for rules and procedures, which effectively restrict the use of PNR data by the United States authorities. In order not to endanger public security, all efforts should be made to ensure that this agreement replaces the current one at the time when it expires, by 30 September at the latest. The Commission is doing its utmost to start negotiations with the United States as soon as possible. In accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 24 of the EU Treaty, negotiations are led by the Council Presidency, assisted by the Commission. The negotiations should start tomorrow in Brussels. A draft text has been transmitted to the United States authorities by the Presidency, which, as I said, is leading the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of your request to the Presidency to make the text of the draft agreement available to you. I am personally in favour and I can assure you that for its part the Commission intends to fulfil its obligations under the Framework Agreement between our two institutions and therefore I will keep Parliament informed throughout the negotiations. It is indeed my intention to report to Parliament regularly on this issue and, as you probably know, I shall be participating in a meeting of the LIBE Committee next week, on 12 September.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to recall that, should no new agreement be in place on 1 October, air carriers flying from Europe to the United States risk legal complaints from citizens based on divergent national legislation on the transfer of PNR data to the United States. For that reason, it is extremely important to ensure legal certainty through an agreement concluded at European level as of 1 October, whilst continuing to ensure a high level of security and at the same time privacy protection for our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sophia in ‘t Veld (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, today we are discussing the PNR Agreement with the United States. However, we are all fully aware of the fact that this issue can only be debated in a wider context, particularly in the light of the information received last night to the effect that President Bush has finally admitted that secret CIA detention camps actually exist. We should look at this issue in the wider context of the methods used to combat terrorism – the methods that we in Europe want to use in the fight against terrorism and the methods that are used by our friend and ally, the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The case of the CIA detention camps and rendition flights and the case of the PNR Agreement demonstrate very clearly the urgent need for Europe to speak with a single voice. We urgently need a single European policy in this area. I welcome what Commissioner Frattini has said, because in my view a common EU policy is not one designed by a handful of ministers that meet behind closed doors, in informal meetings. An EU policy is one made following a proper democratic procedure that involves Parliamentary scrutiny, i.e. in codecision with Parliament. You therefore have my wholehearted support for the proposal on the bridging clause. I hope that the governments too will now realise how urgent that is.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the PNR issue itself, we should distinguish three phases. One is the short-term renegotiation of the current agreement, which is very urgent and needs to be concluded by the end of the month. I have heard rumours which seem to indicate that the US is in no great hurry to conclude the Agreement and might actually ultimately prefer bilateral agreements. It is therefore very important that all European countries and the EU institutions close ranks and adopt a united stance.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome the much more forthcoming attitude adopted by the Council and Commission this week. That is the best way forward. Were there to be no agreement it would be absolutely catastrophic for the European Union and for the protection of our citizens’ personal data.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this agreement, we all seem to agree that the substance of the agreement should preferably be left untouched. We would have preferred to improve the agreement, but the US would like to move in another direction. I therefore feel that the best we can achieve at the moment is to have the same agreement but on a new legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">During the negotiations, however, you should insist that the undertakings made in the current agreement be implemented without delay, because assessments have shown that even if there is an agreement it is not being fully and correctly implemented. I would notably point to: the switch from the ‘pull’ to the ‘push’ system, which is long overdue; information to passengers, which is key but which is apparently still not happening; and purpose limitation – which is a more difficult issue, but an absolutely crucial one. I hope you can see to it that the undertakings are integrated into the agreement rather than being a sort of appendix that is not legally binding.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the medium and long term – i.e. the post-2007 review – we very much hope that by then the <span class="italic">passerelle</span> clause will have been adopted, that Parliament will have secured codecision and that everything will be dealt with as part of a proper democratic procedure. At that point, Parliament will insist on proportionality, which is to say that there should be data-sharing, because we all want a safer world and to fight the scourge of terrorism, but that this should be proportional. We should not share more data than is strictly needed to achieve our purpose. It goes without saying that there should be adequate protection of personal data and procedural safeguards. That is quite clear.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the proposals in the report, which fortunately received the support of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, is that we start a parliamentary transatlantic dialogue. I feel that this rift with the US needs to be healed. We must fight terrorism together. It cannot be that while we call the Americans ‘cowboys’ they call us ‘cowards’, and we are deeply divided.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, there are proposals circulating on a European PNR policy. I am rather unhappy that we only learned about this through the media. We have heard that this idea was presented at an informal meeting in London a couple of weeks ago. That is not the way forward. If there is to be such a policy then we would prefer that it were presented here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to make a very urgent appeal to the Council to adopt proper arrangements for data protection under the Third Pillar, along the lines set out by our rapporteur, Mrs Roure.</p>

We want to cooperate with other countries in the fight against terrorism, not least the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">One of our citizens’ greatest concerns at the moment is their security and the more united the Union is in this regard the more effective the response will be. It is therefore preferable to have one agreement between the Union and the United States of America than 25 bilateral agreements. This will put the Union in a stronger position as regards not only the prevention of, and fight against, terrorism, but also the protection of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that there is no legal vacuum at European level after 1 October 2006 as regards the transfer of passenger data. Mr Frattini took the right option, in light of the decision taken by the Court of Justice, to condemn the existing agreement, and at the same time to open negotiations on a new agreement with the United States. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has lent its firm backing to the Commission’s request to the Council to grant it a mandate to reopen negotiations. We know that this is a short-term agreement to fill in the gap between the obsolete agreement and a new long-term agreement, which is something that can and must be considered at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the future negotiations. I should like to underline the example of the agreements with Australia and Canada, which we find acceptable in terms of proportionality, which sets appropriate limits as regards scope, time, and amount of data, and which is subject to monitoring by a judicial authority.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support the idea of starting dialogue before the year is out between the EU and the USA, Canada and Australia with a view to jointly preparing the 2007 review and to setting up a global standard for forwarding passenger name records.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to welcome the desire expressed by Mr Frattini to maintain close cooperation with Parliament. I hope that this desire is translated into practical action and is not restricted to rhetoric, and that the Council follows suit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We want a two-stage strategy: the conclusion of an interim agreement by 30 September, in order to guarantee continuity and not to cause any inconvenience to Europeans who travel to the United States, and the negotiation of a new, better-founded agreement, during the review, which is initially planned for 2007. Two stages are therefore required.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the agreement to be concluded before the end of the month must not be hastily negotiated. Mr Frattini is proposing that we keep the same text and just change the legal basis, as denounced by the Court. We can accept that, but only on two conditions. Firstly, the European Parliament must be fully informed of the debates under way with the Americans and must provide a political input. What is more, the national parliaments must also be kept informed. Secondly, we must be certain that all of the undertakings will actually be complied with and implemented by the US authorities. I am specifically referring to the possibility of shifting from the PULL system to the PUSH system, as provided for in Undertaking 13, and of establishing judicial review procedures in the event of misuse, as provided for in the agreements concluded with Australia and Canada. In the longer term, the new 2007 agreement must offer European nationals the same level of protection of their private lives as that guaranteed in Europe, and that is indeed a minimum requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, during the informal meeting in London, Mr Frattini made several practical proposals concerning a European PNR and a biometric positive profiling system, to be used on a voluntary basis. I should like to know what exactly is the status of this meeting, in which important proposals were discussed without Parliament’s having been informed of them. As regards a possible European PNR, it is quite clear that we will be unable to accept any proposals that allow Community legislation and national laws on the protection of Europeans’ personal data to be circumvented. Nor will we be able to accept a procedure that bypasses the role and the democratic function of the national parliaments in this sector. Furthermore, I would point out that the Commission proposals on these issues cannot be accepted without the framework decision on the protection of data under the third pillar being adopted. My fellow Member, Mrs in't Veld, pointed this out, and this is an aspect that we will not lose sight of. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In his article ten days ago, the US Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff complained of being handcuffed and prevented from using all available resources. He wants to analyse PNR records in conjunction with current intelligence, to identify high-risk travellers who are ‘unnamed threats’, and to share the information routinely with other homeland security sections, such as immigration, as well as the FBI and, indeed, ‘our allies in London’. So we do not need a European PNR system: we will get it by the back door.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chertoff vision is of data-mining and profiling on the basis of past and assumed future behaviour and stereotypes of potential terrorists. This takes us well beyond the simple checking of people against watch lists, for which APIS data – i.e. name, date of birth, nationality and passport number – is quite sufficient. We have not begun to tackle the risks of this, so we need a very good explanation of what PNR data is being used for in the United States and what profiling techniques are being used. We need strict and legally-binding purpose- and access-limitation provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Similar concerns arise in the context of the EU plans for European PNR and so-called ‘positive profiling’. Under the 2004 EU APIS Directive, governments gave themselves the power to use the personal data for law-enforcement purposes ‘in accordance with their national law and subject to the data protection provisions under Directive 95/46/EC’. Surely the Court judgment on the US PNR agreement has shown that Directive 95/46/EC cannot be the legal basis for data used for security purposes? Therefore we need the third-pillar measure. Has the Commission thought about this?</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Commissioner Frattini and Mrs in ‘t Veld on the need for a coherent EU policy. If you look at this PNR topic, the SWIFT scandal or CIA rendition, you see a pattern of a disunited Europe: Member States running round like headless chickens, subject to divide and rule by the United States. We are not even a reliable partner: we are not even ratifying the agreements like Europol protocols, which would allow cooperation with the FBI. We are ineffective, dysfunctional and we are letting our citizens down. We must stop this incoherence and achieve a clear and assertive EU competence, but that policy must be determined to safeguard our privacy. Can we trust the Commission on that? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The attacks on major European cities teach us – as they have done before – that the European Union and the United States need to collaborate, not least in security matters, but – and I am sure that this is the fundamental criticism that most in this House would make – what is required of the agreement on the forwarding of passengers’ personal details as part of the war on terror is that it should be rational and coherent. What has been put before this House can certainly not be described in those terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Members from various groups have already spoken to address the fundamental problems that there are with it, the first of which is the use to which the data is to be put, and second the legal basis by reference to which the data is to be forwarded. My group is not alone in having fundamental doubts about both of these. The data should be used solely for the purpose of combating terrorism, and not with any other ends in view, and, in the final analysis, it is highly problematic in legal terms that citizens of the European Union should not be on an equal footing with citizens of the United States; it is not acceptable that our citizens should enjoy fewer rights than do their American counterparts.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed is an even-handed and consistent agreement that guarantees the protection of data and deliberately restricts its use to the combating of terror and terrorism. Political ends must not be treated as superior to fundamental rights. That which underpins the rights enjoyed by all the citizens of this European Union of ours is something inalienable, and it is with grave concern that we see them being slowly eroded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament is excluded from these talks about a problem that involves all of Europe’s citizens. This is the first paradox in the affair. My group strongly endorses what Mrs in’t Veld is proposing, particularly the need to change to a ‘push’ system for an agreement in the short term, and the need to avoid the direct transfer of data to the judicial authorities for an agreement in the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand the need to use the agreement rejected by the Court as a basis, partly because the United States is demanding even more from Europe. We need, however, to consider the absurdity of certain proposals contained in the agreement rejected by the Court. I am thinking of the 34 data items that have to be transferred to the United States, when we know perfectly well that most of these items are useless: the US authorities themselves say that they have only been using seven or eight of them. Then we ought also to consider the need to establish real, legally binding protection for passenger data, because it is a duty of the institutions to safeguard European citizens’ personal data.</p>
<p class="contents">Systematically keeping a check on people in the name of the fight against terrorism is an authoritarian distortion of the rule of law and, paradoxically, by doing so we are helping to achieve precisely what the terrorists want. Systematically keeping a check on people is an outcome of the same authoritarian attitude as the CIA’s secret prisons, which President Bush at last decided to announce to the world yesterday rather than continue to hide the evidence. Let us hope that the countries of Europe will also stop trying to outdo the US. We must avoid taking the same stance on this subject and being more extremist than the US in keeping a check on people in the name of this phoney war on terrorism.</p>

Well, what a reference standard to have! It is already an embarrassment. The European Court of Justice has annulled the original agreement, and yet the replacement agreement only differs in its legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament challenged the original agreement between the US and the EU because it believed that the legal basis was wrong and disagreed with the substance. However, despite this Parliament appearing to win the case in the European Court of Justice, nothing substantial has changed. The legal basis will be altered, but since the European Court of Justice did not comment on the substance, in real terms nothing has changed except, of course, the fact that the European Court of Justice will not have competence over the new agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the Council is going to continue with this agreement in its original form, just changing the legal basis but still ignoring Parliament in the process. So why is this Parliament again indulging in pointless activity by writing, debating and voting on this report? It will be ignored by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In-fighting within the European institutions brought about the premature termination of the original agreement.

<p class="contents">It is for that reason that we support – and I personally do – Commissioner Frattini's intervention in these negotiations, which should involve an amended legal basis in accordance with the ECJ’s ruling, but with the substance of the former agreement, covering precisely those things we proposed then and those that have been added.</p>
<p class="contents">For the benefit of all those who have not read the agreement, let me say that it includes the reduction of the data units to 34, the restriction on the use to which they are put, the requirement that passengers be informed, the requirement that the data be forwarded to only one department, namely the Department of Homeland Security, the right of review, and also the right to lodge complaints and appeals, not to mention the requirement that the European Union be notified where terrorist involvement is suspected – in short, it brings us greater security, and that, above all, is something we should make use of.</p>
<p class="contents">That, I think, is why it is now necessary that Commissioner Frattini be supported, be encouraged to embark on these negotiations, in which he should of course seek a resolution of those matters where our demands have not yet been completely met – that much is clear, but what is fundamental is that we must not end up without any treaty: fundamental, that is, in the interests of our citizens’ security, of those who travel by air, and of the airlines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Taking account of the seriousness with which the questions of anti-terrorism and fundamental rights must be addressed, can anyone tell us exactly what this informal meeting was of certain ministers of the Member States in London in the middle of the summer, which was even attended by the European Commission, a meeting during which, it would appear, serious new anti-terrorism measures were proposed? With what jurisdiction was it held? Who convened this meeting? Who authorised the eager participants to then issue a press release, 'allegedly' with the new European measures needed?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as regards the PNR agreement itself, please tell us what it contains, Mr Vice-President, as you expressly promised. Are there any material changes and, more importantly, will the USA's voluntary commitments become binding? You said here, ‘they could become binding’, you did not say, ‘they will become binding’.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States have given the acute impression over the last few days that they preclude negotiation, that they are threatening not to sign a bilateral agreement and, instead, to conclude even worse bilateral agreements on the PNR with the Member States. In other words, they are blackmailing us. Why do you tolerate this blackmail from a country which admitted a short while ago that it had secret prisons all over the world, in infringement of every concept of international law?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, could you please tell us, Mr Vice-President, the story of the European PNR which, it would appear, you discussed in London? What does it mean? Why is it necessary? Why is it proportionate? Will it be an effective measure when the United States, even today, refuses to tell us if use of the PNR with America was necessary or effective? How would it have prevented the British or Danish citizens now being accused of being presumptive bombers? How would it have prevented September 11 or the attacks in London or Madrid?</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament therefore needs information immediately. No one here denies that an anti-terrorist policy and cooperation are needed.

That should give the other institutions something to think about.</p>
<p class="contents">The ruling by the European Court of Justice has not got us much further. While it does tell us that we chose the wrong legal basis, it does not tell us how we could have made a better job of it, although that, indeed, is not what the Court is there to do; it is for us to take care how we go about doing things.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say something about the things we need to do in order to put this into practice. I think we are going to end up in a whole load of difficulties if we carry on as we are doing. For a start, and quite apart from the fact that we would rather do this at the European level, rather than having the nation states doing it each off their own bat, I would like to express my doubt as to whether we really do have the legal power to do it. I have to say, quite honestly, that I am not sure about this. Even if we do, the question arises of whether we can do it within the time allowed for implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">If we in fact do opt for either the third pillar or a combination of second and third pillar as a means of moving this process on, we will meet with problems of implementation, in most Member States at any rate. We will have problems with their constitutions; I can say that in the case of Germany, and I am sure that most of the Member States will find further obstacles in terms of their constitutional law when it comes to implementing this agreement, and so it is in the individual Member States that the necessary conditions must be put in place first of all.</p>
<p class="contents">There will also be problems relating to the laws on the protection of data, since the European Union – with the exception of the first pillar – has no really effective means of data protection, which means that it is the Member States who will have to prepare the ground where data protection and the legislative process are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">What I fear, then, is that the entry into force will be delayed for a bit by quite a few cases brought either before the European Court of Human Rights or the ECJ itself – provided that that is a legal possibility, which will depend on the legal position – or before the national constitutional courts, and so we should, leaving considerations of substance to one side for the moment, apply the greatest of care when dealing with the formal aspects in order to save ourselves further embarrassment of the kind that we cannot afford on the international stage, and certainly not in relation to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, one has to consider the economic damage that would ensue if the United States were to threaten to prevent our airlines from landing there if we did not sign this agreement, and I would also like to ask why nobody within the European Union has ventured to remind our trans-Atlantic partners of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I might add that I think that the directive on data retention might well end up suffering the same fate.</p>
<p class="contents">What is meant – or required – to happen now, following the judges’ ruling, is the conclusion, in a very short space of time, of a new agreement absolving all twenty-five Member States of the need to conclude bilateral agreements with the USA on an individual basis, which would certainly not be in the interests of a high – and above all else uniform – level of protection for the European public.</p>
<p class="contents">It will not, of course, be possible, in so short a time, to hammer out a whole new agreement, but there are things that have to be done if we are to have, as intended, a short-term agreement for one year. I believe, then, that the EU must make it its priority to insist on the USA at last doing what it has repeatedly undertaken to do and allow its engagements to be incorporated into the body of the treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, the practice adopted over the past two years has shown that the Americans do not take these engagements particularly seriously and, indeed, simply disregard them. That is particularly the case when it comes to the principle that data be used only for a specific purpose, and it is very much in the interests of European citizens that their personal data should not be allowed to be passed on indiscriminately as the American customs and immigration authorities think fit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is only normal that we, as Members of the European Parliament, seek the protection of our citizens’ rights as we fight against terrorism. These two things do not exclude each other; on the contrary, they are complementary. But I also endorse our other criticisms. Of course, we need full parliamentary involvement and a free, open and transparent debate. If we cannot even honour the principles of democracy when we decide on the fundamental rights of our citizens, then when can we?</p>
<p class="contents">But let us face it, even though all these things are, as we say in Holland, ‘completely open doors that do not need to be kicked in’, the PNR case is becoming a bit of a farce. It somehow seems incredibly difficult to solve the problems and make sure that the rights of our citizens are adequately protected. Why is this? Is it Mr Frattini’s fault? Is it due to the Council? After PNR, Swift, the CIA scandal and various other recent problems, I believe that it is highly unlikely that the current United States Government can be persuaded to be sensitive to our very simple and logical demands.</p>
<p class="contents">Maybe we, as a parliament, should change our tactics. Maybe we should take up the issue directly with the United States Congress – I have much more faith in our democratic counterparts on the other side of the pond. I hope for a joint session of the European Parliament and the United States Congress, as I am sure that American parliamentarians are more subject to reason than the Bush Government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I support what has been said, particularly by the rapporteur, Mrs in ’t Veld, but the problem is that we – the European Union and the European Commission – have given up our negotiating power: that is why we should feel pessimistic.</p>
<p class="contents">We gave up our negotiating power four years ago, when for a year and a half passenger data were being transferred to the United States completely illegally. An agreement was reached, which later proved to be unlawful and in fact served merely to acknowledge the illegality and remedy just a tiny part of it. We should actually have enormous negotiating power, but it is a question of deciding whether, as Europe, we want our law to be observed on our own territory, which is a principle of the rule of law. On the strength of that, we can then negotiate with the United States. If, instead, we give in, the United States will clearly be in a position to say, ‘Well, if no agreement is reached within a month, we shall do as we like.’ The small detail is that, if we are determined, they cannot do as they like.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasoning of people who say, ‘What is at risk here is that US airlines will be prevented from flying’ is completely false from a legal point of view: our privacy laws do not protect according to an airline’s nationality, but according to the country where the personal data are gathered. Data gathered for commercial purposes cannot be systematically used for security purposes either in the United States or even in Europe, not even if we wanted our data to be used in that way.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, if we begin to enforce our law, we shall succeed in having the negotiating power to conclude an agreement with the United States. An agreement of this kind means that only data relevant to security should be transmitted, and not absolutely irrelevant data as happens today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, the provision of details of the SWIFT transactions of millions of citizens is denounced while, at the same time, in plenary at the European Parliament, a report is being voted on which legalises this provision.</p>

<p class="contents">Fourthly, the protection of personal data and democratic rights is discussed while, at the same time, Parliament is approving the setting up of a mammoth electronic database with biometric data known as the Schengen II system, and so forth.</p>

After what has happened, this has of course been necessary, but we must engage successfully in that fight without undermining fundamental democratic ideas and values. It is important to have rigorous security procedures, but to overstep the line and forgo the balance between combating terrorism and respecting fundamental rights would benefit none of us in the long run.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the decision by the European Court of Justice in May to cancel the Passenger Name Record agreement, we are now to have a new agreement with the same content. Unfortunately, there will be no input from Parliament, meaning that citizens will be unable to influence issues concerning the way in which they are kept track of and their behaviour systematically monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">The freedoms of the individual should be protected better in the new agreement. Under the PUSH system, American authorities should, I would emphasise, make requests on a case-by-case basis. The legal protection afforded Europeans is inferior to that enjoyed by Americans. I would therefore call on Mr Frattini to make political innovation his goal in the necessary cross-border dialogue. Otherwise, we are unlikely ever to make any progress on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and the United States are able to reduce the gap between their respective positions. This has already been shown by the discussion between the parliamentary groups – or interparliamentary dialogue - and by the discussion between our delegation for relations with the United States and the Americans’ corresponding delegation. This dialogue should progressively contribute to an increase in quality, including where content is concerned. It is important for Parliament to participate in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish to congratulate Mrs in't Veld on her clear and unambiguous message. She has said what had to be said.

We must remember that we are not talking about travel within the EU: we are talking about travel to the United States. We are talking about travel through US air space.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe an agreement is essential if we want to protect the fundamental rights of the EU. But if we are to have this agreement we have to be willing to negotiate, we have to move. We have to recognise that in the absence of any agreement, the Americans will do quite legally what they have done in other instances: they will say to every passenger travelling to the United States of America, ‘we wish you to sign a data waiver, i.e. that your data can be transferred to the United States’. Let me tell colleagues now that if that happens, any notion of EU-wide data protection is absolutely and fundamentally lost.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, let me say that America is not the problem. An attack upon the United States, an attack in Germany, an attack in Denmark, an attack in Madrid, an attack in the United Kingdom, or attempted attacks, are attacks upon every single one of us because we have common values. The United States wants to make the world a safer place. We need to work with the United States to make that a reality. America is not the problem: terrorism and extremism are the problem. My colleague Mr Coelho cited some brilliant examples of negotiations and agreements currently in place. We should look at those agreements, we should emulate them and we should give our citizens their fundamental rights and their fundamental freedoms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What that means in this specific case is that if the EU concludes an agreement on the forwarding of air travellers’ personal details, any such agreement must include adequate protection for those details as an essential component. The agreement we reached did not do this, and it appears to me that the new version does not do so either.</p>
<p class="contents">That information has to be exchanged as part of the fight against crime and terrorism is not, of course, a matter of doubt, but there need to be binding legal provisions governing who may have access to the data, where they may do so, and in what manner. That is why this agreement with the USA needs to be completely renegotiated over the coming year.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else that is plain to see is that if the forwarding of passengers’ personal details really is intended to result in better protection against terrorist attacks, this measure cannot be restricted to flights to the United States, Canada or Australia. An international agreement will be needed to improve air transport safety worldwide and, in so doing, regulate the protection of data; this is where the European Union can be a front runner. Only in this way can we secure freedom to travel as an outstanding characteristic of our society without imposing needless restrictions on it.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude with another observation for the Council’s benefit. Following the Council’s, and the Commission’s, embarrassing performances before our Committee on Monday, I think it highly lamentable that the Council should not be present today, for it is under its presidency that these things are meant to be negotiated. For this, the Council is in disgrace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In some speeches I heard a plainly mistaken interpretation of the Court of Justice ruling, which in fact made the agreement an issue. I heard some Members refer to that ruling as if it were a victory. That ruling rejected the agreement: someone said exactly that.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, that ruling was a major setback for Community interests; it was a major setback for this Parliament and for the European Commission. That ruling established that the matter is not a Community matter; it is not a matter that can be negotiated by the Commission, so much so that the negotiations are being conducted by the Presidency; it is not a matter to which the privacy directive applies, Mr Cappato – it does not apply, whether we like it or not; yet we have to abide by the ruling even though it was a setback for us all. To be quite frank, we cannot be grateful for a ruling that rejected the agreement. That ruling, as Mr Alvaro said, was a backward step for Community interests.</p>
<p class="contents">That is our starting point and we move on from there. Clearly, when we are talking about having to reach an agreement in a hurry, by 30 September, and then negotiating another agreement with the United States by 2007, we need to take the realistic, accurate, pragmatic view expounded just now by Mr Cashman.</p>
<p class="contents">The real problem is that, if this agreement does not come about, millions of European citizens will accept lower guarantees of protection for their personal data in order to continue flying to the United States. They will be forced to do so in individual declarations, and Europe will have lost any power to protect them to a suitable degree. The real problem is this: each of us who has tried to do his or her duty cannot even think of challenging the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an interpretation handed down by the Court; I personally do not like its interpretation, but it is my duty to abide by it and to enforce it. I must also say quite frankly that, if an agreement is reached, the protection of our citizens’ individual rights will at least not be left just to the discretion of a particular airline: bilateral negotiations between the United States and the individual airlines will reduce protection levels, and certainly not raise them. That is the realistic view that we must accept as a starting point.</p>
<p class="contents">The second consideration – again, I agree with Mr Cashman and Mr Coelho – is that our problem is certainly due not to the United States but to the terrorists. The terrorist threat is real: what happened this summer in London did not constitute a half-secret or semi-informal meeting of ministers of internal affairs with the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We were informed about what could happen in the United Kingdom – I shall say this later in my information for Parliament – and we were concerned to realise that there was a clear and current threat. Obviously, having seen a major operation by the police and security services in Denmark only a few days ago, we are sure that the danger and threat are real and are hanging over the European Union’s territory.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we need? We need more cooperation among ourselves, among the European Union Member States; we need more cooperation among the Union’s institutions. That is why I said in my introduction that Parliament will be kept informed, politically informed, even though institutionally and legally it cannot take part in the decision because of the ‘legal basis’ (and I use inverted commas on purpose). In any case, Parliament will be kept politically informed by the European Commission. We also need stronger cooperation with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">At this juncture we must cooperate more, not less, but on a clearly equal footing of course. The European Union proudly insists on this principle. I also agree with Mrs Roure in particular, who mentioned the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">You see, ladies and gentlemen, if we succeed in concluding the agreement – the talks are taking place in two parts and we start tomorrow; I cannot say whether an agreement will be reached, but I hope it will – we shall in any case need it to enter into force straight away, even while we wait for certain ratification procedures, which in some countries will take time, as Mr Alvaro pointed out. Since we shall invoke a rule in the treaties that provides for the agreement to enter into force straight away – otherwise it would be totally pointless – it is right that the national parliaments be kept informed from now on, in the same way as we shall be keeping the European Parliament informed, since many of them will be called upon to act once the immediate transitional implementation of the agreement has already begun. It is also a question of cooperation and, as you know, the European Commission agrees with that in principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and last consideration is: what points need to be worked on in the next few days, say, if not in the coming weeks?</p>
<p class="contents">The first point is to persuade the Council – we shall make a start during next month’s Council – to approve the framework decision on personal data protection. This is a commitment that I have made and one that Parliament supported. I am making a further appeal to the Council for certain countries to tone down their reservations when the framework decision issue is discussed again at the next Council of Ministers in the coming weeks, so that a document can finally be put forward that really shows the European Union’s determination to guarantee the protection of people’s personal data.</p>
<p class="contents">The second goal to achieve within a very short time is the implementation of what was termed the ‘push’ system by the rapporteur, to whom I am grateful. I can supply some detailed information about this. Some companies providing technical services for the major European airlines have already presented the technical solutions available for implementing the ‘push’ system. Some of them – I can mention just a few: British Airways, Air France, Iberia, Lufthansa, Alitalia and KLM, nearly all of them, in fact – have submitted concrete proposals to the relevant offices of the US Administration. Under the agreements that we had reached with the United States, the ‘push’ system could start operating without any need for changes within just a few weeks. Technically, there is already a proposal on the table and, in some cases, it has also been formalised. This is recent information that I have been given, showing how things are moving precisely in the direction that we all want.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point is positive profiling. Mrs Roure has asked for general information about the London meeting: I shall be pleased to provide it to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs next week, when I shall go into much more detail. Positive profiling is an initiative that was not started today or yesterday, but rather a few months ago. It is an initiative aimed at identifying accelerated border control procedures at airports. There are two elements: firstly, as it is reserved just for international flights, it does not concern data exchange for European internal flights, where we would have insurmountable problems with freedom of movement, the Schengen area, etc. The system covers international flights from the European Union, to the European Union and across the European Union. It is just for passengers who, on a voluntary, individual basis, agree to supply their data, particularly biometric data, and in exchange they benefit from using an automatic identification channel, which will evidently take less time at passport control. This is on an individual and voluntary basis, using biometric data.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are we considering such a system? To avoid what has been said about ‘negative profiling’, which is profiling on an ethnic or religious basis. Clearly, we could not accept any system of that kind, whereas we can imagine – since the Council has called for it – that each of us may agree to supply our biometric data to a database that guarantees privacy, in exchange for faster departure procedures. Think about frequent fliers. This is a system that we are examining, and we expect to table a proposal within a few months, perhaps by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I shall be pleased to inform the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs about what was said in London regarding procedures to enhance methods for detecting explosives, particularly liquid explosives, as well as on Internet use, positive profiling and everything else. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
