It would be very timely to discuss this even in more depth <span class="bold">−</span> not now, but later on <span class="bold">−</span> because on 11 July this year the Commission adopted a White Paper on sport. This was a very important contribution, which stressed the importance of promoting the training of young, talented sportsmen and sportswomen in proper conditions, which is crucial for the sustainable development of sport at all levels. This was an institutional and very political contribution to the question and to cooperation on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I quote from the paper: ‘Rules requiring that teams include a certain quota of locally trained players could be accepted as being compatible with the Treaty provisions on free movement of persons if they do not lead to any direct discrimination based on nationality and if possible indirect discrimination effects resulting from them can be justified as being proportionate to a legitimate objective pursued, such as to enhance and protect the training and development of talented young players.’ I think this is a very important clarification of how to understand this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently in the process of evaluating the compatibility of UEFA’s measures on home-grown players with Community law, with a view to striking the right balance between the need to comply, on the one side, with Community law and the autonomy of sports organisations, and with the interests of European football on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">This is done in the light of the declaration annexed to the Amsterdam Treaty, the so-called Nice Declaration of the European Council in 2000, and the White Paper on Sport, which specifically mentions, as action number 9 in the Pierre de Coubertin Action Plan, ‘to complete the analysis of rules requiring that teams include a certain quota of locally training players’. This comprehensive comparative information on football academies in Member States and on home-grown players is not available at present.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2006, the Commission launched a study on sport academies in Member States, including the issue of home-grown players. The results of this study are expected to provide valuable input for its analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the second part of the question – because it consists of two sentences on the specificity of sport – Chapter 4 of this White Paper develops the concept of specificity of sport within the limits of existing EU competences. As described in more detail in our Staff Working Document in the annexes, decisions taken by the European Court of Justice and the Commission show that the specificity of sport has been recognised and taken into account in the past. The Commission shares the view that certain values and traditions of European sport should be promoted and will continue to recognise the specificities of this sector, while respecting EU law. However, a case-by-case approach remains the basis for the Commission’s control of the application of EU law, and in particular competition and internal market rules. This is in line with the current Treaty provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to provide legal clarity for all stakeholders and to contribute to the improvement of governance in European sport, the above-mentioned Staff Working Document and its two annexes explain in depth this issue of specificity. It concerns sport and EU competition rules and sport and internal market freedoms, and takes stock for the first time of European Court of Justice case-law and Commission decisions in the area of sport.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to underline that, for the first time, the specificity of sport is set out in our policy document much more than it has been at any time in the recent past in the EU context. That is one of the most important contributions – not only to this answer, but also to the promotion of sport in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a vital scheme. Yet the Commission, on this point in its White Paper, has not come off the fence in saying that it is a scheme that is acceptable under the Treaty and now, Commissioner, you say it could be, if... – and you are still investigating. May I ask the Commission, why is it taking so long? When will the Commission be in a position to endorse this welcome scheme? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the answer I quoted, which is part of the communication, of this policy paper, is an important assurance that we want to support the specificity of sport, particularly of football, in terms of the protection and promotion of young people and the training of, and investment in, young people.</p>
<p class="contents">The study has not been completed, because we do not have all the data we would like to have. I hope that with the complementary questionnaire we are now working on we will get the remaining figures. It is very important that partners from Member States’ associations, federations, clubs and leagues, work with us. Hopefully in a foreseeable time – I would like it to be early next year – we will be able to give a definitive answer. In two weeks’ time we will meet with all stakeholders from the world of sport in Brussels to debate the content and implementation of the White Paper. I believe that this part will be very crucial for concrete action and the promotion of the values of sport.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Commission, I can tell you that we remain committed to these issues, and all the sensitivities must be dealt with duly. Before we take any decision – not only in this area, which is quite specific – we have to carry out a thorough analysis and then take real decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If they were there more often, they would notice that we are currently at the start of the European Cup season, in which we have teams playing against each other in which often just one member at any one time is a member of the national squad. We have therefore witnessed the nurturing of new blood being totally neglected and we attribute an exclusively economic dimension to it all.</p>

I use football as a great example, because in a way Europe is the best in the world in football. I think we can be the best in many other areas like, for example, higher education, which is usually not seen as the best of Europe. No, what Europe needs is not only to refer to its successes or to refer to the importance of football or sport for its historical developments and current achievements, but also for the future. A balanced approach to sport activities is one of the answers, which means it is not about money in the first place, but about the rules and values that govern the world and money to support healthy investment.</p>
<p class="contents">I know about the imbalances, the problems and doubts about the credibility of competitions and about corruption, and too much money deciding who is really a strong partner or strong competitor.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1999, with the Helsinki Report – you remember, maybe, even better – and then the Nice Declaration, there has been, I think, a new momentum. The Commission had never come forward with a policy paper. If we come forward, not just with a paper in hand, but to offer actions – and there are 53 actions offered under the name of the Pierre de Coubertin Action Plan – then we can do a lot. If we stay credible in implementation, I think we can prepare also the first Treaty article on sport, because we do not have a legal base now, and that is why we cannot define some of the actions, and that is why we have to decide case by case, on individual problems.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many collateral issues in this answer, so more credibility means cooperation of EU institutions, national legislators, but also governing bodies in areas of sport. They set the rules, they govern and they have to be also credible in governing individual disciplines or games or competitions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say a sports forum, which we will organise under the Portuguese Presidency, could be one of the answers for permanent or regular transparent and credible dialogue on all problems and possible solutions, whether on a small scale, in Europe or in broader international cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Now, we urge more common action, including the possible inclusion of sport in the Reform Treaty – it is in the mandate and in the draft. We are not asking for power; in the White Paper we are asking for cooperation, for very concrete actions, which range throughout many areas – education, training, social inclusion, public health – but also, on the other hand, repressing phenomena such as violence, racism, corruption in sport or individual organisations or events. We cannot just wait for the next Treaty, or even take any consensus reached today for granted in the future. We should act today for a better future, whether in football or in other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council can address many of the problems, and, as I said, together we can do a lot. It does not mean that we have to intervene at EU level. For example, if we agree in October at ministerial level on the content of an amendment or improvement to our code on anti-doping convention or rules within the World Anti-Doping Agency, then this is the action against doping. I recall Mr Mavrommatis and many colleagues who claimed urgent action from the Union when I became Commissioner in 2004 against doping, which was the problem of the Olympic Games.</p>

<p class="contents">I can clearly say that the next two months will be crucial for the Doha Development Round. Negotiations have now re-started on the basis of the proposals that were submitted in July by the chairs of the respective negotiating groups on agriculture and on industrial products.</p>
<p class="contents">The chairs, in producing their negotiation proposal, have done an honest job. I think we can say that they have distributed the pain fairly. They put pressure on each of the key players on each issue of the so-called negotiation triangle – AMA, NAMA and domestic subsidies – which is most sensitive for the different players.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious as well that the text of the chairs is not cast in stone. The WTO membership had a chance to offer preliminary reactions to these texts before the summer break.</p>
<p class="contents">But now negotiations really have to get down to specifics. A further round of discussions on modalities kicked off at the very beginning of September, taking place in Geneva. The objective of the WTO Director-General, Pascal Lamy, and the chairs is to be in a position to issue a revised paper some time in October to serve as an ultimate basis for a final deal on modalities, to take place no later than this autumn. Whether this will be the case, whether there will be a final paper, depends entirely on the negotiating engagement of the different players.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States should now translate President Bush’s political commitment at the APEC Summit into concrete negotiating moves to try to clinch a deal. It is imperative for the United States to be seen to engage and to move on agricultural subsidies, not least in respect of its objective to ensure access to the developing countries’ agricultural markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Brazil, India and, by the same token, other emerging economies have to move in the right direction and deliver their side of the bargain, and that means cutting, to some extent, their actual tariffs on industrial products.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality of these talks is that the distance to the finishing line – if we talk in economic terms – is fairly short at this stage, certainly very short compared to the road that we have been travelling until now.</p>
<p class="contents">The value of remaining concessions that both developed and some developing countries need to bring into the final package is small compared to the systemic gain of doing the deal, especially as global economic conditions are becoming more and more uncertain.</p>
<p class="contents">But the clock is ticking. If there is no agreement on modalities in the autumn, an early conclusion of the DDA becomes very unlikely. The United States presidential campaign will pick up speed and the round might then be put into the deep freeze for years.</p>
<p class="contents">For the round to succeed now, all parties need to show flexibility and willingness to reach a compromise. The European Union will continue to reach out to the various constituencies of the WTO membership and their key members to ensure their constructive engagement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From an industrial point of view and from an export point of view, they cannot be classed as developing countries. Yet at the same time, from a cultural point of view, they are classed as developing countries with regard to the benefits that they will get.</p>

<p class="contents">The negotiations, or discussions, are ongoing, so it will be extremely difficult to say where the final game will end up. But I have to say, the difficult issue for the European Union is, as far as the agricultural sector is concerned, of course the tariffs. But even more important than the tariffs is the way that we treat our sensitive products. This is simply key and more important, actually, than the reduction of the tariffs in the different bands which we are operating.</p>

<p class="contents">I can only say again that, unless a breakthrough is achieved before the end of the year, I find it very difficult to see a possibility of finalising the negotiations, because of the upcoming presidential elections in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, current offers made by some of our negotiating partners are still falling short of what could be required to obtain a balanced outcome to the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the scope of a final EU offer, the ongoing common agricultural policy reform constitutes clearly the limits of the Commission’s negotiating mandate, and this means that we cannot accept a deal that means that we have to reform our common agricultural policy again. It is clearly in accordance with the mandate given by the Council, and the negotiation limits that we have will also be, of course, the equivalent concessions from our WTO partners in agriculture and elsewhere, resulting in improving market opportunities for our exporters.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that when we talk about the reduction of tariffs we sometimes fear that our agricultural sector will come under immense pressure from imported commodities. We have to remember that the coin has two sides, which means that a reduction of tariffs will also take place on the new emerging markets that could be <span class="bold">−</span> and I am sure this will happen <span class="bold">−</span> of huge interest for European producers to enter into, such as, for example China, and India. So we are still striving towards a positive outcome of the Doha Round. It is obvious that a multilateral solution is to be preferred, whereas a bilateral one could be supplementary to the multilateral discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are doing our very best at this stage, but it is crucial, if we find a solution, for it to be a balanced solution <span class="bold">−</span> within the three pillars of agriculture but also between agriculture, industrial products and services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Amendment of the CMO in wine</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 4 July 2007 the Commission unveiled a proposal for a Council regulation on the common organisation of the market in wine (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2007&amp;nu_doc=0372">COM(2007)0372</a>). Funds for the 'national envelopes' are allocated according to a key which is based to 50% on the historical input of Member States, 25% on area and 25% on production. Moreover, adjustments have been made in favour of certain Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission say which criteria were used in the selection of the specific allocation key and why the funds are not allocated on the basis of the historical payments of Member States over a representative reference period, as occurred in the case of all those CMOs which have so far been amended? Furthermore, given that the overall amount of resources is limited, how was it decided to adjust input for the benefit of some Member States, which necessarily results in a corresponding decrease for the others? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The weighting between these three different areas is 25% on area, 25% on production and 50% on the budget for the envelopes and the transfer into the rural development policy. 50% for area and 50% for production for that part of the envelope which is specifically related to promotion in third countries, which I consider to be a new and very important forward-looking policy for the wine sector. When we had this discussion on the redistribution between Member States’ envelopes, we made a positive correction for three Member States so as to limit their reduction in view of the important divergence for these Member States between their share in historical expenditure and their share in the two other criteria. This correction was not made to the detriment of the amounts allocated to other Member States, meaning that we did not cut other amounts to find money for these three Member States, so we simply increased the total budget. This makes it possible to share Community support equitably by taking into account, on the one hand, the respective reductive capacity of each Member State and, on the other hand, effective implementation of the new measures proposed within the framework of the reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think it is important to say that the single farm payment <span class="bold">−</span> the direct payment to the farmers <span class="bold">−</span> is not at risk. The possible destruction of the crops, of animals or of buildings, has no consequence on the decoupled payment since there is no obligation to produce.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards cross compliance, one important rule is that the reduction of direct CAP payments under cross compliance can only be decided as a result of actions or omissions directly attributed to the farmer. Therefore, forest fires like the ones we saw in Greece this summer would not result in the reduction of payments.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as wine is concerned, in the event of partial destruction, vineyards could be eligible within the restructuring scheme, under the current Regulation, and within the national envelopes that will be foreseen for the new CMO.</p>
<p class="contents">The reformed CMO for fruit and vegetables foresees new crisis prevention and management tools. However, this new regulation will only be in place from 2008, and there is no retroactive clause.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the last question, the financial rules do not allow the Commission to transfer possible savings from the market organisation budget to specific national programmes to support Greek farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the specific question on non-governmental organisations, monasteries or environmental bodies, the Commission does not have the possibility to directly support these for the purpose of environmental restoration activities. European Union assistance is only possible through specifically designed programmes and interventions which are drawn up by Member States following the principle of subsidiarity and submitted to the Commission for co-financing.</p>
<p class="contents">I want just to mention some specific possibilities in our rural development policy which could be used to help as well. I referred to these in my previous reply. The first option concerns the programme 2000-2006, and can involve modification of the programme complements of national operational programmes and the regional operational programmes in order to reconstruct agricultural potential after national disaster measures. This can, for example, mean that a farmer can get money for buying cattle, fruit and olive trees or to restore buildings that have been destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have to repeat very strongly that it is not possible, via rural development policy, to compensate farmers for lost income.</p>
<p class="contents">The second option is the new rural development programme 2007-2013, which includes measures for restoring agricultural production potential, as well as forestry potential, following natural disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be noted that interventions through these two options would be limited to reforestation and reconstruction of production potential, and again cannot be used to compensate for loss of income.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to conclude with the possibilities that will be available within state aid schemes. A disaster like the forest fires in Greece would normally be considered exceptional occurrences, which actually allows Member States to grant support to compensate for material damage.</p>
<p class="contents">Nationally funded assistance to agriculture and forestry may be given following notification of a state aid scheme, and is subsequent to approval by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also remind you that there is a much easier possibility, which is to use what we call <span class="italic">de minimis</span> state aid, which means that Member States can pay farmers, with the new changes that have taken place, EUR 6 000 <span class="bold">−</span> and you can do that every three years. So, without asking anyone, you can actually pay direct to the farmer up to EUR 6 000 to help immediately, if necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank the honourable Member for the question concerning the funding for research. Her question refers clearly in the first instance to research funded by the European Union and in my answer I shall deal with these aspects. However, the need for increased investment in research at national as well as European level, private even more than public, is central to achieving the Lisbon goals. At the same time we have to make sure that this money is well spent to ensure the maximum effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is essentially in four parts and I shall reply to each of them in turn. At the same time, we must bear in mind that it is still very early to draw definitive conclusions and lessons from the sixth and seventh framework programmes. But before turning to the four aspects of the honourable Member’s question, I should like to recall that European Union cohesion policy, especially the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund, also makes an important contribution to the development of the European research area. The Commission estimates that cohesion policy support for research and innovation will more than triple in the programming period 2007-2013 compared to 2000-2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the first element of the question, what are the sectors of research that the Commission considers to be lagging behind in funding provisions under the plans 2007-2013? The Commission believes that it has a good balance between the more top-down thematic areas in the programme and other, more bottom-up activities in framework programmes, such as frontier research and fellowships. It would not be appropriate to single out specific areas in particular need of funding. The closer you look at our 10 thematic priorities, the clearer it is that we need more funding and more research in practically all of them. But, to give you an example, I could mention the research infrastructures of pan-European interest, for which the final budget in Framework Programme 7 is much less than the Commission had originally proposed. This is an important area where we have real added value in Europe. We are seeking to combine funding from many sources, especially from national and regional sources and the European Investment Bank. It is also evident, following the first call for proposals of the European Research Council, that we are faced with serious oversubscription. We have received many more excellent proposals for fundamental frontier research than we have money to fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at thematically orientated research, we can clearly see the need to better support research areas such as energy and climate change. Here, Member States can help not only by increasing investment in research but also by exploring ways of combining research efforts rather than allowing them to remain fragmented. This is also one of the areas which we advocated in our Green Paper on the European Research Area.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the general criteria, the thematic priorities for funding are set out in the Cooperation Specific Programme. These research areas are the ones which will be supported through calls for proposals during the 2007-2013 period. Our proposal was made after an extensive consultation with stakeholders during 2004, including a web-based consultation on the cooperation themes as well as input from industrial stakeholders through the European Technology Platforms. It was also based on an extensive ex-ante impact assessment. Results from ex-post evaluation and monitoring exercises also form an important element in determining the priorities for research funding. This learning from past experience was indeed a key element in defining the priorities in the Framework Programme, as you suggest in the third part of your question to which now I turn.</p>
<p class="contents">You asked how assessment of the usefulness and effectiveness of the research that was funded under the sixth framework programme influenced the selection of new research projects. Here we have to distinguish two different ways of making that link. First, at the more detailed, operational level, we should note that the several thousand FP6 projects are monitored by the Commission services. These colleagues are in frequent contact with the research community and their up-to-date insight into the progress achieved within this project is an important element in preparing the Framework Programme 7 work programmes. But, in the second place, at a more global level, in 2008 the Commission will organise the ex-post evaluation of FP6. This assessment of the overall impact of the different research activities will be carried out by high-level experts. The results of this FP6 ex-post evaluation will be a major input in the forthcoming mid-term review of FP7 in the year 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, turning to the last part of the question, when considering the priorities for funding in each research sector, the topics to be funded are specified in the annual work programmes and the call for proposals. Each year, we undertake consultation with the right variety of stakeholders in drawing up the work programmes. We also call on the assistance of external advisory groups, key specialists in the area, who provide input on ensuring that the work programmes contain the most essential areas of research, taking into account ongoing projects that have been funded in previous calls for proposals. Once the individual proposals have been received in response to the calls, they are evaluated by expert peer reviews using a standard set of evaluation criteria. The proposals funded are those which receive the highest overall mark for the call or part of the call they address.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe that it is fair to say that for research funded through Community instruments we have a transparent system which allocates funding to the most relevant areas and also ensures it is then awarded to the best proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since its inception during summit discussions in the late 1980s, Europe has played a leading role in the successive preparatory stages for the project.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can be justly proud of the confidence shown by the ITER partners in according Europe the central role of the host party to the joint implementation of this project.</p>
<p class="contents">The JET facilities, designed and built through the joint action of Euratom and its members, provided an outstanding example of what can be achieved when leading fusion research organisations pool their expertise and resources. The ITER project extends this principle from the European to the global level of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">ITER technical objectives and design are based on the steady and scientifically rigorous prospect process of development, in fusion research worldwide which has witnessed dramatic increases in the performance of experimental fusion facilities over recent decades in an atmosphere of international scientific cooperation that has transcended political barriers.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond JET, ITER extends the experimental side to the level where the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion energy can be demonstrated.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the signature of the ITER Agreement in November 2006, the ITER partners have all handled properly the commitments that they accepted through the ITER negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">At the political level, all the partners have pursued to completion their respective constitutional requirements for ratification or acceptance of the agreement, which is now accepted to enter officially into force within October this year.</p>
<p class="contents">In the mean time, the partners have properly honoured their undertakings to abide by the terms of the agreement to the fullest extent possible until it enters into force.</p>
<p class="contents">The staff of the international ITER team and the ITER site in Cadarache in France is building up with representatives of all partners now present.</p>
<p class="contents">The partners are providing their financial contributions to the budget of the ITER organisation and are pursuing conscientiously the necessary joint technical preparations for the technical and scientific contributions to which they have committed themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union, a joint undertaking for ITER and the development of fusion energy was established by the Council Decision of 27 March 2007. Its role is to prepare and coordinate activities for the construction of the demonstration fusion reactor and related facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">To date, its supervisory body, the governing board, has met twice and adopted a first work programme and the administrative decisions necessary for the joint undertaking to be operational early 2008. In particular, the headquarters agreement with Spain has been signed. The governing board also appointed the director, the chief executive officer of the joint undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">ITER is indeed an ambitious project. In bringing it to fruition we shall be pushing back the boundaries of our experience in the scientific, technological and organisational domains. It is the nature of experiments that the results cannot be forecast with certainty. But ITER is not an enterprise that we have entered into lightly or in the expectation of serendipity. ITER consists of long-term international partnerships and commitments, bringing together partners that represent over half of the world’s population to address issues central to our common future, the development of sustainable, non-polluting sources of energy at the service of humanity. The prospects for ITER rest on the strong scientific and technological foundations of the project and on the enthusiasm and commitment demonstrated to date by its partners – by all of them; or rather, by all of us. There was never such cooperation in the world as we have gathered in ITER. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What legislation is in preparation for the sectors in which products containing nano-materials are used and are already on the market, such as cosmetics, skin care products, medicines, cleaning materials and other consumer products?

The Commission takes the question of safety and consumer protection very seriously and it is working to ensure that the public can benefit from the innovations that nanotechnologies may bring while being protected from any adverse impact.</p>
<p class="contents">Much effort is dedicated to addressing safety issues. Something like EUR 28 million from FP5 and FP6 has been dedicated to projects expressly focused on environmental and health aspects of nanotechnologies, and such research is planned to increase significantly in Framework Programme 7 too, both in size and in scope. As you know, the Commission adopted an action plan for nanosciences and nanotechnology for Europe 2005-2009 and Parliament adopted a resolution on it, in which the action plan was well received.</p>
<p class="contents">In the communication published this month on the implementation of the nanotechnology action plan, we fully address the second part of your question. A wide range of European and wider international, especially OECD and ISO, approaches are pursued, both regulatory and non-regulatory, to address the potential adverse impact of nanotechnologies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is performing an assessment of regulatory aspects in relation to health, safety and environmental aspects of nanotechnology-based products. Preliminary results indicate that, overall, the existing Community regulatory framework gives good coverage with regard to nanotechnology-based products developed today.</p>
<p class="contents">Different aspects of production and products, such as the ones mentioned in the question, like cosmetics and medicines, are already subject to various Community provisions, albeit not specific to nanotechnology. Consequently, there seems today to be no need to develop new legislation for nanotechnology-related safety risks or to propose major amendments. Nevertheless, on the basis of scientific development or regulatory needs in specific areas which the Commission closely monitors, regulatory changes may be proposed where necessary. It is not nanotechnology as such where regulatory aspects should be considered but rather nanotechnology-based products.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is convinced that the moratorium on nanotechnology would be severely counterproductive. Apart from denying society the possible benefits of such technologies, it may lead to the emergence of technological paradises outside Europe, where research and innovation are carried out without regulatory frameworks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention another Eurobarometer survey, which was about new technologies and was carried out in 2005 on a sample of 25 000 people. If you compare it to the NanoDialogue exhibition, which you mention in your question, this one was based on 700 respondents. Eurobarometer found that, on the whole, Europeans supported the development of nanotechnology, with approximately 55% in favour. These technologies are perceived as useful to society and morally acceptable. Understandably, as many as 42% of respondents were uncertain about the effects of this new technology, but according to the survey almost 70% of the respondents who expressed an opinion as to its effects were optimistic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: London buses</span></p>
<p class="contents">According to figures released by the Greater London Assembly in June, the so-called ‘bendy buses’ (long single-deckers with two carriages) found in many European cities and introduced in London in 2002, were involved in 1 751 accidents in 2006. This is 75% more than other types of bus, and represents an average of almost five accidents per day or more than five accidents per year for each ‘bendy bus’ in London’s fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this clearly unacceptable situation, particularly in comparison with other types of bus, what steps is the Commission taking to ensure that there are adequate safety measures for the operation of ‘bendy buses’ and that drivers receive the necessary level of training? How can they be considered safe enough for operation in crowded urban conditions? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, Community legislation addresses the problem in several ways.</p>
<p class="contents">Directive 97/27/EC relating to the masses and dimensions of certain categories of motor vehicles and their trailers lays down the standards for the manoeuvrability of buses in general, as well as specific standards for articulated buses.</p>
<p class="contents">Directive 2003/59/EC on the initial qualification and periodic training of drivers of certain road vehicles for the carriage of goods or passengers is aimed at improving the level of driver training. In this respect, it would be desirable for national legislation transposing the Directive to make provision for special training programmes for drivers of articulated buses.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of driver vision, European legislation addressed the problem of heavy goods vehicles by Directive 2007/38/EC on the retrofitting of mirrors to heavy goods vehicles registered in the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission is aware of the need to take account of other categories of vehicles, such as urban buses. That is why, as requested by the legislator in the abovementioned directive, the Commission will submit, when the time comes, a report on the results obtained, accompanied, if appropriate, by a proposal for the revision of existing legislation.</p>

<p class="contents">Romania and Bulgaria, as well as the other countries concerned, are making considerable efforts to construct this railway line so that eventually their respective capitals and the port of Constanza will be linked to the rail network of the rest of the European Union. These efforts should continue during the period 2007-2013. These projects are potentially eligible for Community funding through the Cohesion Fund or the Structural Funds, or even via the trans-European networks budget.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, Romania is prioritising the development of the Curtici-Brasov-Bucharest-Constanza railway line. A 92 km section to the north of Bucharest has already been built. Projects are under way between Bucharest and Constanza. These should be progressively completed between now and 2010. Romania has indicated, in its transport operational programme for 2007-2013, that it plans to develop the Curtici-Brasov-Predeal line using EUR 1.1 billion from the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the Sofia link with the EU network, a major step was taken with the signing of the contract for the construction of the road and rail bridge over the Danube at Vidin-Calafat, financed by the ISPA Fund. The bridge should be completed in 2010. In addition, Bulgaria plans, in its transport operational programme for 2007-2013, to develop part of the Vidin-Sofia line. The cost of the work to be carried out up to 2013 comes to EUR 320 million, out of a total of EUR 1 380 million for the entire line.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania is committed to completing, by 2013, all preparatory studies for the upgrading of the Craïova-Calafat line to the north of the Danube bridge, so that it is ready to carry out the work shortly after 2013.</p>

<p class="contents">On 19 July 2007, an agreement was signed between Mr Tiefensee, the German Minister for Transport, and the authorities in the Federal State of Bade-Wurtemberg, the region and city of Stuttgart and <span class="italic">Deutsche Bahn</span>. This agreement is a key phase in the elimination of the bottleneck represented by the Stuttgart-Ulm section, since it includes funding for the work to start in 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is keeping a close eye on the modernisation of the sections between Stuttgart and Ulm. In July 2005 it appointed a European coordinator for this line, Mr Péter Balázs, who has already submitted his second report. This report was sent to the Chairman of Parliament’s Committee on Transport and Tourism. It is available on the website of the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport. The coordinator, Mr Balázs, is continuing to give great attention to the Stuttgart-Ulm bottleneck, which must be eliminated. In his report, the coordinator analysed the progress of the Paris-Bratislava priority project and concluded that most of the project could be completed in 2015. However, given the complexity of the Stuttgart-Ulm section, this section will not be built until 2019.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that a priority project does not exclude continuation to other destinations. Other priority projects, such as the Athens-Sofia-Budapest-Vienna-Prague-Nuremberg-Dresden axis, will extend the Paris-Bratislava project as far as the Black Sea and Greece, while the Eurocaprail priority No 28 project will link Brussels to Strasbourg via Luxembourg.</p>
<p class="contents">In July 2007 Member States submitted their proposals for Community cofinancing. These proposals are currently being evaluated. Based on this evaluation, the Commission will propose the RTE-T budget allocation for the period 2007-2013 to the European Parliament and Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the answers I wanted to give you, Mr Posselt. Personally I am extremely interested in the Paris-Budapest axis, and I can tell you that Mr Balázs and I are really keen for every effort to be made to complete this major project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission has taken note of the Greek court of arbitration’s decision of 13 July 2006 on flights carried out as a public service requirement, and of the decision of 6 December 2006 concerning the relocation of Olympic Airways to Athens International Airport. The Greek authorities have already informally consulted the Commission on these decisions on compensation, which were the subject of a preliminary examination.</p>
<p class="contents">Based on that preliminary examination and the documents submitted at this stage by the Greek authorities, the Commission is still unable to adopt a position on the nature of these decisions under EU rules on State aid. If these decisions were to involve further aid, they would obviously have to be notified under Article 88(3) of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s services informed the Greek authorities of this preliminary evaluation and we are awaiting their response.</p>
<p class="contents">Broadly speaking, the Commission is doing everything in its power to ensure that the aid which it has ordered to be recovered are actually recovered. That is the information I can give you, Mr Papadimoulis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
