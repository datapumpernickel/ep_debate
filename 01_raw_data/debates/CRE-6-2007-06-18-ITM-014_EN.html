<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gunnar Hökmark (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The internet and broadband emerged, in the way we know it today, in the middle of the 1990s; it was, then, only about 10 years ago that these phenomena started to change the world. No one at that time could have foreseen the impact of this change or how it would transform societies and change the pattern of the world economy. No one at that time could have predicted what would come of it and what opportunities it would give to individuals all over the world. I think it is important to say the same thing today. No one knows how big the changes will be. We only know one thing: the changes arising from broadband development will be much more far-reaching this time than those of the last 10 years because the speed of change is greater today than it was then.</p>
<p class="contents">This provides important grounds for decision-making in the European Union. It is important to have stable rules and institutions that allow for new entrepreneurs, new ideas and new technologies to come along, and that allow for the dynamic, not only in the economy, but also in society, to make full use of broadband.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the development of broadband is a unique opportunity above all for the European Union, because it combines growth, and opportunities for growth, with the cohesion of different regions. It binds people and regions together at the same time as giving new opportunities for growth and new jobs. It distributes opportunities for growth in different areas, and we can see from globalisation what this brings us. It brings countries and regions closer to each other, but also provides a huge number of new opportunities. For the European Union, this is a special thing, because we can be at the forefront of the development of e-health, e-learning, e-government, e-trade, e-medicine etc. if we ensure that we are the region in the world that is moving most in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some important points of departure that must be based on the fact that the value of broadband depends on the number of users. Therefore, it is of utmost importance for us to get people all over the Union connected as soon as possible. It is of importance to us all, wherever we live. The second thing is that the value of broadband is also dependent on the content, which is why it is important that it is open to as many as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">There are five points that I would like to highlight that are underlined in the report. First of all, the more competition there is, the faster the markets today develop the deployment of broadband. In those countries and regions where there is a lot of competition, the deployment of broadband is faster than in other parts of the Union. That means it is important not to distort competition but to open up more competition in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, there are few areas where it is better to use European funding than in this area, provided certain preconditions are fulfilled: for example, where the market cannot provide for deployment or when it is a question of increasing the level of advanced technology in this area – which is not just about deployment as such but ensuring that we are in the technological lead.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that the EU can be the leader but that also means that we should highlight some other points. First of all, two preconditions for EU funding: there should be a level playing field where we are funding, and we should use the funding in such a way that it will increase the technology, not only deployment. We do not need the old technologies, we need the new technologies because they are the best, especially for outlying regions, where costs decrease the more advanced technologies are.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we need to have neutrality between different technologies, different operators, different content providers and different services. If we do that, we can make full use of what this technology can give the European Union. We can be at the forefront technologically and in terms of making use of opportunities and we can ensure that we combine growth with cohesion, which will make European citizens stronger in the society and the world in which they live. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is incredible; we cannot even begin to suggest how things might be 10 years from now. The European Parliament supports you, and your report contains very interesting points.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the other committee members involved – Mr Harbour, Mrs Bourzai and Mr Sakalas – for contributing to this work. It is a united effort, so to speak. Last but not least, let me thank all those who took an active part in our ‘Bridging the Broadband Gap’ conference, held in Brussels in May: Mr Hökmark, Mrs Bourzai, Mr Harbour, Mr Goepel and Mr Chatzimarkakis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s vision is for it to be the norm for European citizens to be connected to broadband and to have a choice of services at their disposal. Competition is the main channel for delivering investment and innovation. However, there is a ‘but’: as we are aware, rural areas and disadvantaged regions are struggling. These are economic areas where ICT is not an option. Rural diversification and economic growth require the diffusion of innovative technologies and the adoption of an active ICT policy by regional authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Commission has built this aspect into regional policy and into agriculture and rural development. We estimate that in the new programming period – 2007 to 2013 – about EUR 65 billion from the European Regional Development Fund will be devoted to rural areas. Furthermore, 4.4% of cohesion policy resources – EUR 14 billion – will be invested in priorities directly linked to the information society.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, we recognise both the primacy and the limits of the market in pushing broadband forward. Several public initiatives are being undertaken where the market does not work. It is a fact, however, that the gap between urban and rural areas is increasing rather than closing.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you some figures. Thirty percent of the rural population is excluded from broadband coverage, compared to an EU average of 10%. Only 10% of the rural population subscribes to it, compared to 17% of the EU population. The most common speed in rural areas is below 512 kilobytes per second, while the average in the EU is as much as one megabyte per second. Poor broadband access widens not only the digital divide, but also the economic and social divides.</p>
<p class="contents">Local and regional authorities have a key role to play in bridging that gap. Public policies, however, must respect state aid rules. Broadband markets are highly innovative and governments need to take care not to pre-empt them or to distort competition. But if a government believes that current services are inadequate, it can step in. Under state aid rules, the Commission has taken 26 decisions clarifying when public intervention is acceptable from the point of view of competition policy because it tackles real market failures.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hökmark’s report has highlighted the fact that broadband is increasingly a service of general economic interest. The Commission faces the question of whether broadband should be part of universal service obligations. To date, broadband is not included, as you are aware. We must think about what we mean when we call for broadband for all.</p>
<p class="contents">We may also need to look again at funding issues. We need proper consideration of this issue, which is why the Commission will publish a Green Paper early next year to launch a wide-ranging policy debate on the issue among all stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important aspect of this policy is radio spectrum. Wireless technologies are crucial for rural areas, but wireless technologies will become reality if – and only if – radio spectrum is available and accessible to market players ready to invest. We need a spectrum policy that is more flexible and, where appropriate, market driven. We need a more coordinated approach. This is the line the Commission will take in the forthcoming review of the telecom rules. That review will be fundamental to the further enhancement of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, where market failure is clear, public authorities should step in and equip their territory with the appropriate broadband capabilities. In any case, we will continue working on the exchange of best practice and make sure that all regions are up to speed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Legal Affairs fully understands the importance of broadband links for the economy of the European Union and, therefore, the committee does not dispute any of its important economic aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is still the legal side. Today broadband links are in the hands of private capital, and private capital organises it only wherever it yields a profit. The profits are to be made in the larger urban concentrations, the larger cities, but not in the villages or remote rural areas. However, it is the Committee on Legal Affairs' opinion that every inhabitant of the European Union has the right to use broadband links regardless of whether he lives in a city or in a remote rural area, and he should have the opportunity to exercise that right. Therefore, the Committee on Legal Affairs recommends to the Commission that wherever private capital has not provided broadband links, Structural Funds should be used for the introduction of these links. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just as she predicted, the Regulation on roaming is to enter into force by summer. This represents a great achievement on the part of the Council, Parliament and the Commission. We have solved a problem together, and can be proud that the Regulation will enter into force under this German Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Friday, when I flew out from a German airport, I saw the first brochure from German operator T-Mobile presenting its mobile roaming rates under the protective tariff. It is clear that this is working. We are also proud that, if European consumers conclude new contracts before their holidays, these European protective tariffs will of course apply from the first day of entry into force of the Regulation. It was hard work pushing this through, but we have managed to do so before the summer, and I believe that the development of competition in this field will also be extremely positive. It will take us another three months to achieve transparency in the field of broadband, too; and so more time will be needed to achieve it for the use of UMTS. We should attempt as soon as possible to offer a ‘flat rate’ or a standardised tariff in this field, too, so as to enable comparison of the costs of broadband across Europe and worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">In Africa, for example, there are already 15 countries among whom no roaming charges are levied. In Europe, too, there are already telecommunications operators who do not charge a roaming tariff across a number of borders, and there are also operators offering special charges on their own network in a certain region. It is clear, therefore, that there is a very positive trend in competition. Accordingly, for the future, we can envisage having billing systems that charge customers on a bit basis, and we can envisage promoting bilateral agreements at international level that enable us to enjoy this broadband technology at reasonable prices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having access to this sort of technology at a reasonable price does in fact appear to be an essential throughout the EU, firstly in order to guarantee high-quality service, secondly in order to promote competitiveness and productivity throughout the EU and to do so at the same time as respecting the environment, since certain physical displacements become superfluous; and finally in order to facilitate the development of a knowledge-based society by including everyone in a society founded upon information and communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hökmark’s report does contain some good things, for example when it stresses education and providing schools with computer equipment. The fact is – although older members of the public must not be forgotten – that everything starts with the first learning experiences and with access to tools in the places where basic education is provided. I am thinking in particular of such places as universities and training centres, although the development of health services on the Internet is another particularly important line of development, making treatment protocols and individual follow-up procedures easier. Another line of development is the work being done to make government services accessible on line, which makes them approachable, results in time benefits and brings the services available closer to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate the attention that the rapporteur has given to the comments we made and which were primarily aimed at taking practical account of the expectations of our fellow citizens, and in such a way that the technological response would improve their day-to-day lives. We have tackled the broadband issue in the context of the goals of the EU and in accordance with the mandate given to us by Parliament, and this with a view to enabling everyone to have access to broadband and enabling it to play its part in bringing about economic, social and – of course – territorial integration.</p>
<p class="contents">I do find it regrettable, however, that greater emphasis was not put on regional development and that more research was not done on access for the members of the public who find such access most difficult, such as elderly people and people with disabilities. We need to do everything possible to improve access to the digital culture and to offer content that meets the needs and expectations of all members of the public. However rapid the technology, it is always the way in which it is used that gets the best out of the service.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a good thing, then, that broadband should be accessible by everyone, but public places – free of charge if possible – are also needed where people can access broadband and familiarise themselves with these technologies. The fact is that ICTs are particular goods that can be considered as resources on the grounds that they perform a real social and cultural role, and we have just heard Commissioner Kroes say that they could be regarded as a service of general interest. I shall hold on not only to the idea, but also to the prospect that she holds out, as installing broadband is a matter of political will and is not just about developing competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have worked out various compromises together.</p>
<p class="contents">The development mentioned by Mr Hökmark in his report covers all the relevant technical areas in the field of broadband. He covers all aspects excellently; the most important being developments in rural areas, of course – where we can see a great divide. Basically, we can speak of the ‘broadband paradox’: urban areas, where broadband is not actually necessary, have a high proportion of broadband users, whereas rural areas do not. We must therefore find ways of increasing the proportion there.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also discussed the ‘digital dividend’. In the European frequency landscape, frequencies are becoming free that can be used for mobile broadband solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must also discuss the major task of who should develop the relevant infrastructure and how to deal with the private operators investing in this and expecting a return on their investment. As a Liberal I would willingly leave everything to the market, of course – and I know that Mr Hökmark, too, has a liberal soul – but we must also recognise that this is not happening in rail transport or education, and so even the Liberals have to admit that other ways must be found of obtaining investment in this.</p>
<p class="contents">A bonus system has been mentioned. I am glad that the report leaves this option open and allows this kind of bonus as a means of bridging the broadband gap, particularly in rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I felt like calling out to Commissioner Kroes, who is now responsible for competition, that not everything can be looked at from a entirely puristic, theoretical angle. Sometimes, particularly in a world developing rapidly at global level, it is necessary to abandon introspection and adapt our competition rules to global conditions. This is a small field where we can do so. For this reason, I am particularly pleased that support policy is being changed, that resources from the European Regional Development Fund and the European Agricultural Fund can be used for the development of infrastructures. What is even more important as regards competition policy, however, is technology neutrality: in this regard the Commissioner has taken the right course – on which I also congratulate Commissioner Reding.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one further aspect I should like to address. The development of broadband infrastructure in Europe can only be achieved by having a ‘man on the moon’ objective. In my opinion, this objective could consist in enabling the maximum number of people possible to vote by e-mail in the 2009 European elections. This would exert pressure on Member States to achieve participation of 25% or perhaps even more of their population in this wonderful instrument, which will take Europe forward. E-mail voting for the 2009 European elections – I believe that would be a significant new challenge!</p>
<p class="contents">Once more, thank you for the constructive cooperation I have enjoyed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We openly support the Commission’s initiative in which it urges all of the Member States to address the broadband imbalances, because broadband should be a general and universal service, and it is the only way to overcome the digital divide, not just between cities and rural areas, but also certain areas of cities and other less-favoured ones.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve this objective, however, we need to clarify various aspects. Firstly, the technologies to be used in order to achieve this end, because we all have the right to use the same kind of connection, an interoperable kind. We are therefore emphasising the fact that, in order to achieve technological neutrality, we need free standards and the extension and involvement of broadband.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the Commission’s initiative should consider wireless broadband mobile services as a solution for the regions for which access is most difficult. There are legal and technical problems standing in the way of this wireless access. Some courts have said that it is not possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like a response from the Commission with regard to issues relating to competition and the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Another thing I would like to know is whether the fact that broadband distribution may be carried out in a particular way could create specific technological dependence on particular companies. What we mean is that we cannot create technological dependence on a few companies, and regions must therefore be educated technologically with a view to promoting the use of free standards in all of them.</p>
<p class="contents">We must welcome the fact that Mr Hökmark has included in his report a proposal for funding that is full, clean and neutral in terms of competition. Nevertheless, I would like to know what mechanism will have to be used in order to achieve that neutrality and how we can incentivise innovation in order to achieve our final objective, which is the distribution of broadband to all of Europe’s users. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As such, this opportunity should be accessible by everyone. In fact, extending access to all is a prerequisite for social development, better public services and knowledge-based economic growth. In order to achieve universal access to broadband, the European Union has a duty to ensure that all citizens can access it, allowing the consequent benefits to spread throughout Europe and in particular to developed regions. In other words, we must bridge the digital divide. The market alone is not enough. In addition to market forces, it is important for Member States, and regions and local authorities in particular, to establish incentives to promote the development of broadband in disadvantaged regions.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, broadband, the spectrum offered to wireless links and to satellite mobile communications, must be made available via free, transparent and open tendering. The authorities must also leave room for experimentation in part of the spectrum, which can be used by new technologies and new types of organisation. Only if we are able to make the spectrum an asset available to all will it be possible to invest in the future for a better society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It can be a great benefit, but it can also be a great challenge. We must remember that there are those people who may not be able, or who may not wish, to use the internet.</p>
<p class="contents">I suggest that achieving our dynamic knowledge-based economy is not so much about access to knowledge as what we do with it.

A society that fosters growth and employment is not possible if it is unable to exploit and develop broadband thoroughly. It is of benefit in many areas: small and medium-sized companies, the school system, public health care, and so on. On the other hand, the revolution in the entertainment industry is now under way and technology there is changing more quickly than legislation. A knowledge-based economy, however, will not succeed by following the circus. Broadband is a pre-requirement for a more equal information society. That is why to use it in its basic format should be free, like the social services when you are checking through your own patient records. Moreover, although search engines are effective, we have a lot of work to do to improve services.</p>
<p class="contents">Information and communications technology is the fastest growing sector of industry in the Union. Nevertheless, many Member States are not investing in it, but are letting the rest of the world pass them by. It makes you wonder what decade, or perhaps what century, they are living in some places. The Nordic countries, for example, are an exception.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to make it a basic assumption that all new buildings will have broadband. In addition, Member States must enlighten their citizens as to the opportunities afforded by broadband. Not only that, but we have to open our eyes to the new and huge task that lies ahead. We have to create a new democracy for the information age. It will differ from the present one in that, for example, the electorate is present the whole time.

<p class="contents">Ireland, with approximately one-third of its population living in rural areas, has poor broadband penetration. This matter needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency and state aid may well need to be part of the package.</p>

I would primarily like to highlight a problem concerning access to these networks in rural, remote or less densely populated areas.</p>
<p class="contents">This problem is apparent in most of the new Member States. Underdeveloped regions, in particular, need much more attention than has been accorded them so far by the European Union and, particularly, by national governments. The challenge is to encourage and motivate broadband operators to invest more into these regions. In my opinion, national, regional and local authorities should come up with new systemic incentives, including tax measures or easier access to public funding by means of public-private projects, primarily focusing on building up the technical infrastructure for broadband networks in such areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Public funds invested under such schemes will be recouped very rapidly, as business is promoted through the knowledge economy and public services are provided more efficiently, for example, by means of <span class="italic">e</span>-government, <span class="italic">e</span>-health, <span class="italic">e</span>-learning or <span class="italic">e</span>-procurement. On the other hand, I would like to call on the European Commission to seriously consider these aspects when formulating European policy on broadband connectivity and conceiving a regulatory framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Paradoxically, too tight a regulatory policy in an area so important in terms of boosting European economic competitiveness could cause a slowdown in economic development as well as larger disparities between regions. I, for one, believe that at this stage of developing broadband connections the potential implementation of unbundling may play a rather negative role by decreasing the rate of private investment into less developed regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I found Commissioner Kroes’s commentary most fascinating; I am sure that what she said was all agreed with you.</p>
<p class="contents">I have some questions in this regard. The Commissioner mentioned that it will be possible to consider drawing funding from the European Regional Development Fund for the promotion of broadband. I should like her to tell me how she envisages that this will take place. Will it be the subject of a communication? What will the criteria be? How is it to be announced? What procedure will be followed? Will it come under traditional State aid, according to the current definition, or does she envisage a special communication in this regard? If a special communication is issued, what will be the procedure for agreeing this? How does she plan to verify that these enterprises are really installing broadband capabilities in accordance with the competition rules and not simply producing a costing and saying, ‘That is a great idea, and we would like to help ourselves to this aid in all regions that are ‘uncompetitive’, as it were’? I would be grateful if the Commissioner would explain this once more.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a second comment from the Commissioner’s colleague, who mentioned that the Commissioner is contemplating a Green Paper dealing with public services in this field, which may, among other things, include broadband. I have some questions about this, too. When does she plan to issue this Green Paper and what kind of consultation procedure will be applied? When will she be bringing the consultation procedure to public attention?</p>
<p class="contents">My final question is as follows. Can she perhaps provide an overview of the extent to which financial support is already being provided to the field of broadband development from the structural and regional programmes? If I am not mistaken, this is already taking place. I would be grateful if she could provide me with written information on this – it does not have to be today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This divide is particularly prevalent between generations, enterprises and areas. The problem is even more acute in remote and inaccessible areas, such as island and mountain areas, and in rural areas, where demand is particularly weak and, as such, there is little commercial interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, competition <span class="italic">per se</span> is not the solution to the problem. Targeted actions need to be taken to bridge the broadband divide in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The following are some of the actions which I consider important: the Member States must step up the learning of information technology in compulsory education and give greater support to the development of content in their language. This will assist penetration to larger sections of the population. I believe that subsidies for financially deprived citizens to acquire broadband connections and suitable equipment will be of equal help. The citizens themselves must also learn the major practical applications of broadband, such as teleworking, new medical diagnostic and treatment services and contemporary education and public services.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course all this is also hugely important to the development of European competitiveness, offering opportunities for new pioneering small and medium-sized enterprises and increased productivity in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I consider that public financing and public private partnerships should be further developed in poorly served areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The high cost of broadband networks and services and the lower returns from investments in island and sparsely-populated regions must never be a justification for restrictions to access. Any possible lack of incentive amongst providers as a result of scant commercial interest must be offset by strategies based on greater technological development and more innovation in order to provide operators with better opportunities for entering the market.</p>

In this spirit I welcome the resolution we are debating today and which the European Parliament will adopt tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union the desire to become the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world was established as the main goal of the Lisbon Strategy. We have found, however, that we are not entirely fulfilling the goals we have set ourselves. I also regard this document, which was drafted by the European Commission and which is inseparably linked to the Lisbon Strategy, as the identification of a problem, and at the same time as an inducement for us to take a forward step in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost we must encourage the balanced development of a suitable infrastructure, which will enable every inhabitant of the European Union, regardless of his geographical location or social status, to have access to high-quality broadband connections. These connections must have the functional capacity to ensure that users can reach the entire range of services offered. In this respect I wish above all to highlight the raising of the threshold in defining what broadband is. Indeed we must exploit its potential in the area of data transfer, distance working, the attainment of digital literacy, and its use in educational processes and so forth. So broadband services do not only provide opportunities for entertainment, but also for the creation of new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">On both the European Union level and the Member State level we need measures to encourage investment in this area on the principle of public-private partnership and equal access to those providing services and those using them. At the same time these measures need to ensure the transparency of the market, equal rules for all participants and the adequate protection of consumer rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally may I thank the rapporteur for his cooperation and his excellent report. With this resolution, members are demonstrating a desire to fulfil the strategic goals of the European Union and to contribute to its credibility, as well as to the integration of its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without fast, permanent connections, it will certainly not be possible for us to create a competitive and dynamic knowledge-based European economy. We must therefore give the green light to support for free Internet access through the construction of free-of-charge networks supported by the structural funds and other public funds.</p>
<p class="contents">We also feel, however, that the towns and cities are closest to the citizens. The local authorities in towns and cities can best assess needs and adopt the best ways of supporting broadband at a local level. In practice, however, local governments often fall foul of the conflict between, on the one hand, the rules on public funding, and on the other hand effective support for free Internet access through the development of free-of-charge networks supported by the structural funds and other funds. If a city decides, for example, within the context of developing services for its citizens, to support a free-of-charge wifi site, businesses offering Internet connection will immediately accuse it of distorting economic competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should therefore look carefully into the rules governing the use of structural funds and the rural development fund for developing broadband. It should then adopt more precise rules to handle situations where broadband services are developed with the help of the structural funds and public funding in areas where there is already a partial provision of these services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I want to thank the rapporteur for incorporating almost all elements of our opinion, including some of our suggestions, into his report. His report is to be commended, because it takes a very broad view of the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The report quite rightly emphasises that the provision of broadband is an extremely dynamic and evolving market. Many comments have already been made in the debate about the importance of spreading broadband, particularly into rural areas, where it is more difficult to provide services. However, the new wireless and satellite technologies are opening up those markets at a far lower cost than ever before, which is important.</p>
<p class="contents">I would caution colleagues who have been calling for local authority or state support for infrastructure. Frankly, the problem is that if you invest in infrastructure it will soon be out of date and it is not characteristic of state enterprises to sustain investment, or even to sustain consistent policy. We do not want to crowd out the private providers of competing technologies. Where there is a market failure, it would be far better, as our opinion states, for authorities to act as the lead customer and to aggregate demand, e.g. from their education and social services, and offer those launch contracts to private providers, ensuring that competition is kept in place.</p>
<p class="contents">I know the Commissioner is extremely keen on this approach to broadband provision. We fully support her desire to sustain competition as the main medium of delivery.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to pick up on an earlier comment by my friend Erika Mann: as the lead committee for universal service end-users’ rights – and having dealt with that directive before – we await the Commission’s Green Paper on this subject with great interest. Our opinion and the Hökmark report indicate some directions we wish the Commissioner to look at. It is quite clear that the issue of universal service needs to be looked at, but we should be very cautious about applying a new rigid formula given the dynamic state of the market and the fact that broadband demand will continue to increase. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are concerned here with what is in fact a people-focused policy, in view of the fact that neither the economy nor the market can, on its own, provide people in the regions with access to broadband, and we all know that broadband accelerates development and reduces inequality insofar as people have access to it. This access problem, then, needs to be addressed by us.</p>
<p class="contents">My use of the pronoun ‘us’ indicates the obvious – that the Commissioner within whose remit this dossier falls cannot handle it alone, and that is why we in the Commission have combined our forces, so that Mrs Kroes has started work on it – and I will take this opportunity to thank her for that, and for having positively immersed herself in it – while it also has to be said that state aid is an essential feature. The Commissioner responsible for rural development is also working on it, however, as are the Commissioner responsible for regional development and the Commissioner with responsibility for consumer affairs, so responsibilities really are being pooled within the Commission in order to resolve these problems. I believe that Commissioner Kroes has already spoken to you about state subsidies and told you that she has decided that such aid should be given subject to very clear and precise conditions, at the point at which the market is unable to resolve these problems on its own.</p>
<p class="contents">Broad-based debate will be of use to us in considering the universality of service provision; does it really need to be extended at a time like the present, when it does not include broadband, or is it not necessary to extend it? In the course of this evening’s debates I have already heard some very divergent positions articulated, and we will need to clarify these; that is why we are going to use the Green Paper that I intend to put before you in early 2008 as a means of launching a broad debate that will enable us to see how to legislate on these matters, or what sort of legislation is to be avoided. </p>
<p class="contents">Concerning quite specific elements, it is clear that the Commission will not only make speeches or organise conferences, such as the conference on bridging the digital divide in rural areas some weeks ago, but will also take specific action. For instance, we will launch a website before the end of this year to act as a central information platform publishing calls for tender and providing a one-stop-shop for exchange of best practice. We hope that this website will become a virtual meeting point between suppliers and local governments.</p>
<p class="contents">The second action concerns the new programming period of the Structural Funds and it includes the initiative ‘Regions for economic change’, which aims to help Member States implement the new Lisbon Strategy through action aimed at economic modernisation. This initiative includes two thematic networks on ICT, broadband and e-government. Finally, there will be the European transnational networks initiative that will help authorities planning transport and energy infrastructure and make them take account of the telecom needs as well, because deploying DACs and DAC fibre alongside this infrastructure may reduce the future telecom costs by 80 %, so it will be very important to foresee the exploitation of synergies when making this kind of investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I am also very conscious of the fact that technologies such as WiMAX or satellites will be an alternative to fibre and DACs, for instance.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been asked whether we can provide more precise guidance regarding the use of Structural Funds, in particular, where a partial supply of such service already exists. Since 2003, there have been guidelines for the use of Structural Funds in the electronic communications, but 2003 is a very long time ago in a field where technology is very fast-moving. That is why, over the past two years, the Commission has developed the consistent decision practice of applying state aid rules to broadband support measures. Most of the measures assessed contain Structural Fund co-financing. We have already issued 26 decisions in this area and those clarify further under which conditions public funds for broadband can be granted.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I would also like to say that these EU funds are not allocated to private enterprises: they are allocated to public authorities and it is those public authorities, for instance the regional authorities, which define their operational programmes. The Commission does not supervise those projects except for the large projects over EUR 50 million. Those then undergo examination by DG REGIO, DG COMM and/or DG INFSO.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point which has been made is the question of our citizens who suffer from some form of disability during their lifetime. Now these may be disabled people, but we will also have an ageing population. We have calculated that about 50 % of our citizens will be disabled at least once during their lifetime. Therefore, at the end of last month we issued a communication on ageing well in the information society. Here we focus on making all ICT services accessible to citizens and to help most of all those with special needs. I believe that this will go beyond the regional questions and the digital divide and will be one of the problems we will have to solve in months and years to come. I would really like Parliament to come in on this question, which will also be an important topic for discussion with our citizens, above all in the prospect of the European elections to come.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one last point. All this is wonderful, but we need spectrum and that is why we are working on having spectrum available for all these services which will be needed by one technology or another in our rural areas for our ageing society. I am, of course, referring to health, but also to the questions of education and of e-government, which are crucial elements. As regards e-government, we will be holding a big ministerial conference, together with stakeholders, in September and will discuss how to make better use of the services in order to reach the population, important above all for the ageing population and for people who live far away from urban centres.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission is working on making spectrum available for example for the 2.6 MHz band. I am really counting on the positive effect of the digital dividend when we switch from analogue to digital, where we should be looking at the spectrum below 1 MHz. This is very interesting indeed for the new services which we will need in order to have broadband for all.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, rapporteur, for the important work which has been done. This is only the beginning of the work we have to do together in order to make Europe a place of equilibrium between all citizens allowing them to access the new technology without a digital divide but, rather, with a digital dividend for our society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In relation to the Lisbon Strategy, we are increasingly drawing attention to the fact that in terms of competitiveness, it is becoming ever more glaring how far Europe is lagging behind compared to other regions in the world. The fact that broadband solutions are gaining more ground could significantly reverse the trend towards declining competition. On the one hand, it would make Europe’s economy operate more efficiently, while it could also give a boost to research and development, another area where the EU is also lagging far behind.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that it is essential to create a strong, effective Community regulatory framework, to harmonise regulations in this sector, as well as dismantle the various barriers distorting the operation of the market. We also need to encourage Member States to devise effective local development programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the spread of broadband technology in the new Member States is concerned, structural funds will play a vital role in this, especially as these countries lag considerably behind compared to the old Member States. Supporting broadband solutions is not simply an economic issue. The diffusion of these solutions will also promote the principle of solidarity. Establishing broadband connections in the more sparsely populated areas may help to encourage the local population to remain in their villages and to connect the less mobile sections of society to the EU’s economic and cultural vitality.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, it will also help to protect the environment. This is precisely why we can say that the spread of broadband Internet is in Europe’s common interest, extending far beyond its intrinsic significance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
