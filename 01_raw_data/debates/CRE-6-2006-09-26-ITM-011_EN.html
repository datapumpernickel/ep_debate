Our conclusion is that both countries are in a position to take on the rights and obligations of European Union membership on 1 January 2007.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The accession of Bulgaria and Romania will mark an historic achievement: the completion of the fifth enlargement of the European Union, which further pursues the reunification of our European family.</p>
<p class="contents">On this occasion, I would like to congratulate the peoples and authorities of Bulgaria and Romania for all the efforts they have produced in order to fulfil the conditions for accession to the European Union. I would also like to thank you, honourable Members, for the constructive role played by Parliament. The European Parliament has always been a staunch champion of the political, economic and cultural benefits of enlargement. Your support has helped to spread peace, stability and prosperity in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent enlargement, like others before it, has proved to be a great success. It has confirmed that the enlargement of the Union, if carefully managed, produces a win-win situation for both the existing and the acceding Member States. Enlargement stimulates economic growth and social cohesion and reinforces the role and influence of the European Union in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The readiness of Bulgaria and Romania is a direct result of the sustained progress both countries have achieved over the last few years and particularly since our last report in May. The Commission takes its responsibility as guardian of the treaties very seriously. First and foremost, we must protect the functioning of the European Union. This endorsement of the 2007 accession date for Bulgaria and Romania is based on a rigorous, fair and objective assessment, as Commissioner Rehn will explain in detail in a few moments.</p>
<p class="contents">Bulgaria and Romania have found the right answer to our strict conditionality by addressing the areas we highlighted in May. In doing so, they have achieved considerable progress. However, today’s report also outlines some areas where both countries need to achieve further progress by sustaining the current reform drive until accession and beyond. The Commission has drawn up a number of measures to accompany the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the Commission will set up a mechanism for cooperation and verification of progress in the areas of judicial reform, the fight against corruption and organised crime. The mechanism contains specific benchmarks that have to be met. The Commission will report regularly to Parliament and to the Council on the progress achieved. On that basis, the Commission may, if necessary, invoke the safeguard measures set out in the Accession Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has further accompanying measures at its disposal, which will ensure the proper functioning of the Union up to and beyond the accession of both countries. European Union rules provide us with a comprehensive set of measures that allow us to combat potential risks in acceding and in current Member States and to address concerns such as food safety or the management of European taxpayers’ money.</p>
<p class="contents">The rigorous application of these accompanying measures underlines the emphasis we have placed on conditionality throughout the accession preparations for those countries. We are therefore convinced that, once again, enlargement will proceed smoothly in a way that will strengthen, not compromise, the functioning of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to ensure that, as we enlarge, we are still able to function efficiently. I should like to use this opportunity to state my position concerning future enlargements. After the completion of this fifth enlargement, with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, I believe that an institutional settlement should precede any future enlargement. This is the way to ensure that our enlarged Union will function in an efficient and harmonious way. In any case, the Nice Treaty already requires us to adapt our institutional set-up following the accession of the 27th member. Last June’s European Council conclusions have set the course for that institutional settlement and I hope that by the end of 2008 we will succeed. In following that timetable, we will respect our commitments towards countries for which we have opened up the possibility of accession and fulfil our strategic goal of consolidating peace, democracy and prosperity on our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">We are looking forward to Bulgaria and Romania’s historic achievement of European Union membership in 2007. I expect both to contribute energetically to the process of European integration.</p>

Over the past months, both countries have demonstrated their readiness to join the European Union. The key to this success was a combination of substantial Bulgarian and Romanian efforts with the strong encouragement and support of the Union. Let me also join President Barroso in thanking the European Parliament for its continuous support for the gradual and carefully managed accession process to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s assessment is based on an even more rigorous system of conditionality than the one applied in the past. Over the past two years in particular, Bulgaria and Romania have responded strongly to our system of conditionality. This has resulted in a remarkable transformation, with reforms in several sectors peaking over the past three to four months. Thus, the strategy we devised together last May has worked well, to the benefit of Europe, Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s report focuses on those areas which required further progress in May. The majority of Bulgaria’s and Romania’s overall preparations had already been completed by that time.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the political criteria, Bulgaria has continued the reform of the judiciary. The legal framework has improved, for instance, through the adoption of rules that establish objective procedures for the appointment and evaluation of magistrates, which is very important for the independence of the court systems. The ongoing preparations of constitutional reform in that regard are also very welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Efforts to combat corruption have resulted in more officials having to declare their personal assets and in the establishment of internal fraud inspectorates. The Prosecutor General has continued to be proactive in terms of requests for lifting the immunity of members of parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In the fight against organised crime, more specialists have been recruited and some successful actions have been registered against criminal networks. However, at the moment the number of successful prosecutions is still low and the implementation record still needs to be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania has made further progress in reforming its justice system and the results are tangible and positive. The interpretation and application of the law is being further harmonised and staffing levels in the judicial system are increasing.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been definite and tangible progress in the fight against corruption. Criminal liability has been broadened to legal persons and rules on financing for political parties have been tightened. This has led to further non-partisan investigations and indictments of high-level corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">The report outlines a limited number of areas where we need to see further progress in the months leading up to accession and beyond. Therefore, this report also spells out accompanying measures which the Commission will initiate upon accession, unless the remaining concerns have been remedied.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will set up a mechanism for cooperation and verification of progress in the areas of judicial reform and the fight against corruption and organised crime. For this purpose, as President Barroso said, benchmarks have been established which refer to the particular circumstances of each country. The mechanism allows the Commission to help the countries to continue the reforms with vigour and rigour, and to verify that the expected progress is taking place on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also ask both Bulgaria and Romania to report bi-annually on progress in addressing these specific benchmarks until they have been met. The first report should be submitted by the end of March 2007. We will then report to the European Parliament and to the Council by June 2007. The Commission will also apply the safeguard measures of the Accession Treaty if either country fails to address the benchmarks adequately. The report also underlines that EU rules contain the necessary guarantees for the proper management of EU agricultural and structural funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The new regulation on structural funds provides the mechanisms to ensure that these funds, which are of course EU-taxpayers’ money, are spent properly. Payments can be interrupted, suspended or cancelled, if the Commission suspects or detects cases of irregularities or fraud, including corrupt practices. Moreover<span class="bold">, </span>further to this range of safeguard measures for the EU funds, financial corrections can take place if individual or systemic irregularities are found in the regular financial controls.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still a risk that preparations for the management of agricultural funds may not have been completed by the time of accession. As a precaution, we have adopted specific provisions to ensure the proper management of these funds by Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">This gives both countries time to complete preparations in 2007. At the same time, failure to do so will enable the Commission to reduce the payments in 2007. Of course, we hope that we will not have to resort to this mechanism, which should be seen as an incentive for both Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the third safeguard measure, food safety, some measures are currently in place because of animal diseases. These will be maintained after accession. Restrictions may also need to be applied upon accession on the use of certain animal by-products. Non-compliant food establishments in the milk, meat and fish sectors will be denied access to the internal market, but will be allowed to produce for the national market bearing a specific label. After three years, they will have to comply with EU rules or close down.</p>
<p class="contents">I have outlined the sufficient guarantees offered by the <span class="italic">acquis </span>and the Accession Treaty. I am therefore confident that Bulgaria and Romania will enrich the Union without compromising the proper functioning of EU policies and institutions. The interests of the EU and our citizens can be assured and EU taxpayers’ money protected.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, Bulgaria and Romania should be commended for their far-reaching efforts and achievements to adapt their legislation and administration to the laws and rules of the European Union. On the basis of the progress made, our report shows that both countries will be ready to join the Union in 2007. The suggested accompanying measures will ensure the continuity and irreversibility of the reforms in the two countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that we can count on your support for facilitating a swift and successful ratification of the Accession Treaty in the remaining Member States. Bulgaria and Romania have undertaken remarkable efforts to join us in the European Union and they deserve our congratulations and a very warm welcome.</p>

It is well known that it has been our aim to welcome both countries as Member States on 1 January 2007. In this respect, the communication from the Commission can be greeted with satisfaction.</p>
<p class="contents">During the entire enlargement process, the views of the European Parliament on how well prepared Bulgaria and Romania are to join the Union have been taken into consideration. On behalf of the Presidency, I wish to thank the European Parliament for its considerable input with regard to both countries’ accession to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has closely followed the progress that both countries have made in finally adopting reforms and meeting their membership obligations under the Treaty of Accession. While the European Council that met in June commended Bulgaria and Romania on the reform measures they had recently implemented, it appealed to both countries to make even more of an effort to solve, decisively and without delay, the problems still remaining, which were mentioned in the Commission’s last progress report produced in May.</p>
<p class="contents">The Finnish Presidency has encouraged both countries to deal with unsolved issues. These include in particular the reform of the judiciary, organised crime, corruption and administrative initiatives in several key areas. The meetings of the Association Council have been an opportunity to evaluate the progress made with respect to the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and have clearly demonstrated that the reforms that are needed must be finally adopted and implemented immediately. The meetings of the parliamentary joint committees have also had a key role in this work.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency notes the recommendations in the Commission’s reports. We would like to commend both Bulgaria and Romania on their endeavours to fulfil the demands of accession. Bulgaria and Romania should now address all outstanding problems without delay. I know that these countries are already trying to resolve these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council notes the Commission’s plans regarding protective measures and stepped-up monitoring that may be introduced on the basis of Articles 37 and 38 of the Accession Treaty, should there be insufficient progress in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council now proposes to undertake a thorough examination of the Commission’s communication and recommendations and a comprehensive assessment of the main issues. In undertaking these tasks, the Council will of course also take account of the views expressed by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Accession Treaty’s ratification process itself is now well underway, and we trust that it will be completed on time.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, although the Union’s future enlargement has more to do with the next topic on the agenda, I would like to say here that the European Council confirmed in June 2006 that it would adhere to existing commitments. The Finnish Presidency will act on the basis of these decisions.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hans-Gert Poettering, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner Rehn, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes the Commission's proposal that Bulgaria and Romania should join the European Union on 1 January 2007. Bulgaria and Romania are two major nations with a European culture, and on accession they will become members of our European family. Our group – like the others – already has national Members from Bulgaria and Romania: the Bulgarians are represented by Mrs Cappone, and the Romanians by Mr Marinescu, and over the past few months we have developed a good level of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I should like to express our appreciation to both Bulgaria and Romania – to the governments, but in particular to the people in both countries – for the huge efforts they have made since the fall of Communism. When a country was ruled by Communism for forty or fifty years, when there was no rule of law, no administration governed by it and no independent judiciary – when we look at all these facts, we can see just how much work both populations, just like those of the other former Communist countries, had to do. When we in so-called 'old' Europe take a critical view of these countries, I sometimes wish that we would remember, and express our recognition of, the huge achievements of their people.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">All in all, we consider the proposal that you have submitted, Mr Barroso and Mr Rehn – and I would particularly like to thank Mr Rehn for his very honest efforts over recent years – to be a balanced one. On the one hand, membership is planned for 1 January 2007, but on the other hand we must not lose sight of the fact that there is still much work to be done. It would be irresponsible, not only with respect to the people of the current European Union but also with respect to Bulgaria and Romania, to gloss over all the work that still needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Both Mr Barroso and Mr Rehn stated that there were still major deficits in the use of European money, that there was a risk of corruption and that there were still major problems in the fight against organised crime and with internal security. Indeed, Commissioner Rehn specifically said that the implementation of criminal prosecutions needs to be improved. In other words, the laws are in place, but they still need to be enforced. Serious breaches of the law must also be pursued through the courts, and those responsible must be held to account. We will be reminded of this by the fact, amongst other things, that both countries will have to present a progress report in six months' time.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Rehn was, in my view, very wise to say that the 'safeguard clauses' – which could also be described as transitional provisions – will hopefully not need to be invoked. Whether or not they are invoked depends on the progress made in the reforms. If these reforms, which must be continued with full commitment after 1 January 2007, are not made, then the safeguard clauses will come into effect. We must bear this in mind at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">To the people of Bulgaria and Romania I have to say, in the midst of all the joy at accession, that the European Union you are joining on 1 January 2007 is not some kind of heaven on earth. We have seen in other countries how, once they have become Members of the European Union, their enthusiasm has waned considerably. Of course, you do not have to be enthusiastic about Europe, but you should always stand by it, and we must all be aware that we in the European Union can only have a shared future in the 21st century as a Union based on shared values that is capable of taking action. I hope that this awareness will never be lost in the two countries that are now joining, Bulgaria and Romania, or in the other countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso quite rightly spoke of the institutional consolidation of the European Union that must precede each enlargement. On behalf of the European People's Party element of our group, I would like to say 'yes' to institutional consolidation, but we have great ambitions in this field. We want the principles and substance of the constitutional treaty, including its values, to become a legal and therefore political reality. That is the main agenda for the months and years ahead of us, so let us work together to that end. In this spirit, we would like to extend a warm welcome to Bulgaria and Romania.</p>

That is the job of Commissioner Rehn, and he has done it today. There are still several issues that need to be resolved in Bulgaria and Romania. Several problems need to be described that require the governments to work towards a solution, and to convince the people that reforms are needed. All of this is being done and all of it is necessary. The shortcomings must be remedied.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the time or the place to discuss the various problems, however. The accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the EU on 1 January 2007 will continue the integration in Europe that is unparalleled in the world. Our grandfathers and grandmothers were proud of Western European integration. Why can we not be proud of the pan-European integration we are furthering with today’s debate? Bulgaria and Romania are part of Europe, and I agree with Mr Poettering when he says that we should welcome them. On behalf of my group, I say ‘yes, they are welcome’.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What is at stake is nothing less than putting an end to the division of our continent that ran counter to its historical development, and became bitter reality after the Second World War. I was born in Western Europe. I was born in a country that was divided, and that was overjoyed when it managed to restore its unity: and rightly so, as Germany had deserved it.</p>
<p class="contents">What Germany deserved, the whole continent has deserved. The men and women who fought against the communist dictatorships in Bulgaria and Romania, the people there who, over the last sixteen years, have had to go through a process of transformation harder than the burdens faced by people in Western Europe in recent years: for all of this, these two countries have deserved to be rewarded with a welcome into the EU. After all, what problems would become easier if they remained outside? Which of our concerns would be easier to solve if they did not join? The answer is that nothing would be better if we left them outside. The reverse is true: the uncertainty in these countries and the whole Black Sea region would increase if we did not let them join. For this reason, it is also common sense to welcome them into our ranks.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything that has been achieved in European history, that has had to be fought for, has been achieved in the face of scepticism. I am fairly sure that there was no standing ovation in store for the Heads of State or Government of Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and France when, in 1950–52, they told their people of the need to include Germany in the European Coal and Steel Community, as it was then. There were very many people who said: Germany has just destroyed our country twice, and now we are supposed to welcome it into our Community? Now we are supposed to give it money? Yet the Heads of State or Government firmly believed that Germany’s integration into the European Community would bring peace and economic growth, and that integration would help to overcome the hatred and enmity – and it has.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are doing now is no different. The people of all our countries are asking whether we are taking on too much, whether we are spending too much money on this, whether this is costing too much, whether all of this is too uncertain. We can only reply that our goal is to increase economic strength and social cohesion, and to export the integration of culture and peoples as a peace-building project. It is to extend what was realised internally in the old Europe to those countries that have been unable to benefit from it before now. All this cannot be achieved by signing a treaty, but must be fought and worked for – and we have to start somewhere. This also means having the courage to speak out in the face of all the scepticism and opposition and say that European integration is the right course to take in Eastern as well as Western Europe, because this integration brings peace, economic growth and greater scope for economic development in the internal market. Every country we welcome into the EU enriches our internal market. It creates social cohesion, and it helps Europe attain the proportions it needs as an economic area to withstand intercontinental competition in the long run.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, there are plenty of small things we could find fault with: such and such a thing has not been put right, more reform is needed here, administrative reform is needed there, judicial, police and agricultural reforms elsewhere. All of this is true and it all needs to be done, but this does not change the fact that Bulgaria and Romania should be welcomed among us, as we need them.</p>

It means where there are two or more, we are stronger. Well, there are two: Bulgaria and Romania recognise that they will be stronger in the European Union and the European Union will be stronger with Romania and Bulgaria.</p>
<p class="contents">Size matters. With the supranational challenges we face in today’s world, the more countries that share our values and practise good government and democracy within our Union, the more able we will be to promote those values beyond it. So I salute the people of Romania and Bulgaria. I salute their governments, in which Liberals and Democrats are proud to play an important role. I salute, in particular, Meglena Kuneva and Anca Boagiu, who have conducted the detailed negotiations on behalf of their countries like a pair of swans, apparently gliding serenely across the surface of the water but with their feet paddling away ten to the dozen underneath.</p>
<p class="contents">I express my thanks to the European Commission, and in particular to Commissioner Rehn, for a difficult task imaginatively tackled and accomplished appropriately under a Finnish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">We all recognise that there is unfinished business. The European Union is a moving target with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> constantly evolving. Bulgaria and Romania are developing themselves. We know that democracies are sometimes run by crisis management: often problems are often not solved until they have to be solved. We acknowledge that there is only a certain elasticity in the management of public affairs. Moreover, we recognise that there is a need, as in previous enlargements, for transition periods and safeguard clauses.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the governments and people of both countries to continue their reforms, but to those who doubt their readiness I ask, would they be better off and would we be better off with them outside? Should we say ‘no’ or ‘not yet’? As the American commentator Mencken once said, that ‘For every complex problem there is an answer which is clear, simple and wrong.’ Leaving them outside the Union would be the wrong answer.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased, however, that the Commission draws attention in its report to the need for greater efforts in the fight against crime and the need for more serious efforts in improving the situation of the Roma people in both the countries joining us. The rule of law and social inclusion are fundaments of our Union. More action needs to be taken by the governments of both countries and the Commission needs to monitor that action on our behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters to the health of a society is less what it possesses than the direction in which its face is set. It seems to me that the direction of both countries is the right one. To quote from the hymn to St Cyril and St Methodius: ‘March ahead, oh revived people, to your future march ahead, forge your destiny of glory ...’. Forge it with us.</p>
<p class="contents">There is work to be done in Romania and Bulgaria to make the European Union a reality. We build the European Union together. It will never be built purely from the top down. It must be built from the ground up. That was perhaps summed up by the Romanian writer Adrian Marino, when he wrote: <span class="italic">‘Sa aducem Europa, din nou, la noi acasă’</span> – ‘We must bring Europe into our homes’.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is work to be done in the European Union, too, to convince our citizens that the cost they are paying for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria is not a net negative. To explain to them, as the Špidla report showed us, that those countries which welcome new countries as partners gain economic benefits. To point out to them that unless we let low-cost labour come to where the investment is, then the investment will go to where the low-cost labour is. It is a win-win calculation in bringing new countries such as Romania and Bulgaria into the Union. We will all be winners.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some who ask whether this will be the last enlargement. I believe that our Member States will be obliged to sort out Europe’s constitutional challenges before new countries are taken in. I hope that is what the Commission President meant when he said that this might be the last enlargement. We owe our citizens and the citizens of these two future Member States the duty of sorting our Europe’s constitution before we take in further countries. In conclusion, let us welcome Romania and Bulgaria today, not in a spirit of triumph but in a spirit of satisfaction with work well accomplished.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, this Parliament has nothing more to say in any case. We decided to say yes a year ago. Well, you can say to me: ‘they have delivered us 150 pages’. For my part, I can assure you that with the 100 pages we have here you would have said no a year ago, but you have to say yes today because you said yes in any case. This Parliament’s hands are therefore tied and it is happy for them to be. Well done, the ball is in your court!</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr Barroso has just said something extraordinary: ‘an institutional settlement should precede any future enlargement!’ We said that when there were ten of us. We said it when there were fifteen! We said it at 17, we said it at 25, we are saying it at 27 and I am sure that when there are 30, 35, 40 or even 45 Member States we will be saying it will be the last time, and we will all be dead and it will be the last time, next year in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="contents">I have had enough! I have had enough of hearing such lies because, with Mr Schultz’s arguments, with Mr Watson’s poetic arguments, how will you be able to say no to the Balkans? You have talked of peace, but it is obvious that the Balkans have a future in the European Union, it is obvious that Romania and Bulgaria have a future in the European Union. They must become European. The problem is: how? On what terms, how quickly and in what way? Poetry will not organise everyday politics, not poetry, and today I ask you one thing: to be serious. I say to you in all seriousness, if this report had been for Turkey, you would all have said no!</p>
<p class="contents">Whereas the arguments about peace, the future, the market, my grandmother, my grandfather would have been the same, but no ... because you have a very simple ideological bias, and one that is right: the European Union must enlarge. There is a funnel effect. The Commission and the Council decide, the Council decides, the Commission follows, Parliament does its yes man act, you get the funnel and everything slides, slides, slides and in it goes. No one can do anything any more because when you have a funnel effect you can no longer stop it ... and you have no way of raising political problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Just read: so far as the media are concerned, the conditions of fairness are not guaranteed, but it does not matter, it will come. In one case the judiciary is not independent, but it does not matter, it will come; the machinery for protecting minorities is not yet in place, but it does not matter, it will come. When and how will it come? How can you know it will come? The fact is, <span class="italic">we</span> have got problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, for the problems of immigration the Council is incapable of getting the justice and law policy through, of getting it through in the first pillar. Unanimity is not required. It will be much easier with 27! You will see, it will be much easier to get everything through with unanimity.</p>
<p class="contents">The German Government promises us it will all be sorted out with the Constitution. But how? How will you get this Constitution approved in the 27 Member States? No one knows, absolutely no one; but you will see what you will see.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I think we are hypocrites. Yes, Romania and Bulgaria have a European perspective. Yes, the Balkans, but as for us, we are incapable of making Europe a real Europe, and the worst thing, and I will finish with this, is that with enlargement as we are doing it we are heading towards a renationalisation of how States think, of politics and of practices. You saw that in the last Council; well, I say to you we are impotent, but as Parliament we are proud to be!</p>

There was no doubt that, given time, they would be treated as equal to them. The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has always backed them in their endeavour, being guided by the principle that those countries should not in the first place be assessed in terms of privatisations, cutbacks, good relations with internationally active large enterprises or of their NATO membership. Instead, our focus is on human rights, good democratic governance and good environmental policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2005, I voted to support, in principle, the future accession of Bulgaria and Romania. The question then remained as to when and how this enlargement could be achieved effectively. This House has insisted on Romania having the right to defer, whilst for Bulgaria, the application of that possibility was left entirely in the hands of the Council. That happened at a time when the disquiet surrounding shortcomings in Romania was at its peak and it was expected that Bulgaria would yield the least problems. Since then, in fact, it has been Bulgaria that has been the cause of increasing disquiet.</p>
<p class="contents">In both countries, the plight of the Roma people is worse than in most of the other states that have recently joined us. In a number of cases, the places they have called home for a long time have been declared illegal and they have been driven away. The people belonging to the Hungarian minority in Romania or the Turkish minority in Bulgaria also have problems to contend with, even though those to a lesser degree than in the recent past. The government is no longer intentionally putting those people at a disadvantage, but there is an attitude of apathy in respect of the discrimination by ultra-nationalists against those groups. Nor, indeed, has anti-Semitism yet ceased to be a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">During previous debates on this topic, my group tabled proposals for improvements, among others, further to the illegal payments that are demanded from EU residents of Turkish origin passing through Romania. It is unfortunate that a majority could not be found in this House to back these demands, although a majority did express concern about the use of a dangerous toxin in mining preparations in Rosia Montana. In a communication issued by Romania on 23 September, it was reported that an environmental impact report had been launched and that its neighbour Hungary is being consulted in respect of the risks concerning toxic waste water moving in its direction. Since there is no outcome as yet, we will be unable, unfortunately, to incorporate it in this House’s final verdict on Romania’s membership on 11 October.</p>
<p class="contents">My group fears that, after accession, many problems will still need solving, and that in the event of any mishaps, a further enlargement of the European Union will be seen as ever more controversial by public opinion in the current Member States. Despite this, it looks like a majority of my group will, following preparatory discussions, be voting in favour of accession on 1 January 2007, an important argument in favour being that other Member States have joined before despite their unresolved problems, and that a year’s delay will not yield any significant improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should share with you that the Dutch Socialist Party, to which I belong, has been led by these many problems to join, in the Dutch Parliament, with the Christian Democrats in speaking out against 2007 as an accession date. We think that a host of problems have yet to be resolved, but the real vote will be on 11 October. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Despite all the difficulties, what has actually been achieved in both those countries in the last 12 to 13 years is phenomenal: the change of culture, the change of attitude, the willingness to engage, the openness and transparency. The enormous sea change in legislation alone to comply with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> is something that no existing Member State could achieve in such a short time.</p>
<p class="contents">We can speak about the theoretical importance of this enlargement and the abstract and political arguments. But the most important argument of all is for the 7.5 million people in Bulgaria and the 22 million people in Romania to be given the same opportunities that all of us in the European Union have today, which we got when we were weaker or smaller countries or poorer economies with less developed judiciaries or economic and educational spheres.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there is more work to be done. Ongoing reforms are needed; constant vigilance is necessary against the ability of mankind to interfere with, interrupt or corrode public life. That is why the safeguard clauses are there. But let us celebrate what has been achieved so far.</p>
<p class="contents">I have only one small query and that concerns the ongoing difficulties in both countries with abandoned and orphaned children and children and young people with disabilities. They still do not get the levels of support, independence and protection they need.</p>
<p class="contents">Many years ago, a greater Irishman than I am said, ‘Nobody or no group has the right to put a stop on the march of a nation’. We do not have the right to stop the reunification of Europe to correct the mistakes of history. Like all good families, we should encourage those within our family who are trying to achieve more to pursue common ideals, goals and standards.</p>
<p class="contents">We should welcome Romania and Bulgaria, congratulate their officials, their governments and their people for what they have achieved so far, remember the horrors that they have come through and look forward to the bright future that lies ahead for them and for us.</p>

We are inside the ramparts, able to look down patronisingly on the newcomers trying to get inside the EU castle of which they have been dreaming. We peer at them and lecture them. Luckily, we in the Czech Republic have very recent direct experience of this degrading, patronising behaviour and of having to face a constant stream of pointless new conditions and quotas, as well as one-sided restrictions. For this reason, we are able to express our solidarity with both of these countries. We also know that many of the problems that beset Romania and Bulgaria are not of their own making, but the result of half a century over which, like us, they were deprived of natural development, of market economics and of free, representative democracy. Like us, they were handed to the wrong half of Europe by the decision of the post-war powers, and the people of both countries went through hell under the Communist dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that this is why we in the Czech Republic have resisted the temptation to impose more humiliating restrictions on them concerning movement, employment and services. This is clearly what the protectionist western EU Member States are seeking. I believe that our relationship with them will be the same as we expected from the 15 western countries when we became fully-fledged Member States. We are still second-class Member States, and I feel that, for this reason, we will not turn the two new countries into third-class Member States. All the less so for the fact that while the EU is lecturing Romania and Bulgaria, two countries with European traditions, culture and values, it is at the same time playing a dangerous game over the accession of Turkey, turning a blind eye to Turkey’s attitude to minorities, to democracy, to the plurality of faiths, to women's rights and to its own brutal history. I believe that these two most European of countries, Romania and Bulgaria will soon become fully-fledged EU Member States alongside the rest of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As an MEP representing Slovakia, a country that joined the EU just two years ago, I am pleased that on 1 January 2007 Rumania and Bulgaria will become members of the European Union, and I fully support their accession. It is also my wish that no one in the Union will regard these new Member States as inferior, and that their sound economies and democratic institutions will continue to show robust growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the shortcomings that have often been mentioned in connection with these countries, I would like to focus on Romania’s new legislation banning international adoptions. International adoption is both a global and ethical issue. Trafficking in children under the mistaken notion that this is in the interests of the children is unacceptable in the European Union. A state which trafficks in its own citizens, who represent its future potential, is playing into the hands of organised international crime. Such a state must revise its priorities, and should do so not only on paper but in actual fact. It should think hard about the means for achieving these goals. The selling of children amounts to a counterproductive waste of a country’s potential, undermining the very meaning of family support.</p>
<p class="contents">As a full member of the European Union with all of the rights that ensue from such membership, Romania should be in a position to take care of its citizens from the cradle to the grave, as the Romanian Prime Minister put it last week. It is necessary to improve social work and to train qualified professional staff for adoption counselling in Romania, as well as simplifying adoption within the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite several well-known problems concerning the implementation of this law, I consider its enactment to be a very welcome step in the right direction. This law can undoubtedly be regarded as complying fully with the standards for European legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Romanian and Bulgarian friends are warmly welcome here! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should bear in mind that we had concerns about many accessions, yet all of them turned out to be political and economic successes. They turned into a win-win situation. There are also several transitional rules for the benefit of both sides, to enable accession to take place without great controversy from the point of view of the EU. Examples are rules concerning the free movement of workers, and the fact that border controls on persons have not yet been lifted, since these countries are not yet members of Schengen.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst welcoming the new States, however, we must make it clear that each enlargement only works if the rules are observed. The Commission’s statement today that benchmarking and monitoring processes are in place to resolve the issues of legal systems, corruption, money laundering and organised crime, is very important. We shall then have to wait and see whether, if the need arises, these are actually used. The same goes for the legal conditions and controls for the Structural Funds and agricultural funds, and also for the opening of the foodstuffs markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission bears a great deal of responsibility at this time, because only if this works and the Commission makes credible use of its mechanisms will the future of the EU be assured, and only then can we think about future enlargements, too. It is extremely important that we welcome these countries, but also that both sides comply with the rules, so that we are not faced with serious problems at the end of the day as a result of failure to do so. For this reason, I shall be monitoring very closely the way in which the Commission makes use of the possibilities it has mentioned today in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The last thing I want to say is that the Constitutional Treaty was drawn up for the Union of 25, or rather of 27 following this enlargement to include countries that suffered so unspeakably under Communism. It is not the size of the EU that will enable it to play a role in this world, however, but only its inner strength. Size is not an indication of strength. I should like to remind the House at this juncture, therefore, that the EU has not yet done its homework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt that Bulgaria and Romania have been subject to a degree of scrutiny probably unparalleled in EU history. The reasons for this are not just related to the countries concerned but are also a reflection of the growing scepticism about enlargement in certain political quarters. This is a pity. Enlargement is, I hope, a vehicle for reform and change in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome the Commission’s confirmation that Bulgarian accession should take place on 1 January 2007. Postponement would have served no useful purpose. At the same time, we are under no illusions that much remains to be done. Continuing reform is needed in Bulgaria, not just because of EU accession but for the sake of Bulgaria and its people. The key word now is ‘transparency’ in every sector, whether it is public procurement, the appointment of officials and magistrates or whether it concerns the reasons why a particular investigation is suddenly stopped dead in its tracks. Citizens need to have confidence that those in authority are acting openly for them and in their best interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, many measures are still being put in place by the Bulgarian authorities. I particularly welcome the recent announcement that the services of the Dutch former Prosecutor General have been enlisted to assist Bulgaria’s own excellent Prosecutor General and I would encourage other countries to come forward with similar assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of migration of workers, many of our countries, not least the United Kingdom, have seen the consequences of a decade and more of failed and catastrophic immigration policies, largely unrelated to the European Union. It is a pity that Bulgaria and Romania may now suffer the consequences of this.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been a colossal task for Bulgaria to recover from the effects of 50 years of communism. Now we see a stable democracy, a buoyant economy, 5% growth, record foreign direct investment, a factor of regional stability and a contributor to NATO. Well done Bulgaria – and welcome!</p>

Allow me to start by extending warm congratulations to both countries on the conclusions which the Commission presented today on Romania's and Bulgaria's accession date. I should like to extend a warm welcome to both countries, but to Romania in particular. After everything that has happened, that country’s history, 50 years of dictatorship, 15 years of hard work, it is now being rewarded by the European Union in the shape of membership.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has been consistently in favour of both Bulgaria’s and Romania’s accession. It is the different governments, not just the current ones but also previous ones, that have generated the dynamism in Romania which has, in turn, led to the Commission reaching its conclusion. It is an enormous achievement on the part of both countries, and an historic day in Bucharest and Sofia, in Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased with the President of the Commission’s remark that on the basis of permanent progress those two countries have made, it can now be decided against using this delay option, but simply to make a start on 1 January of next year. The Commission has indicated that there is plenty of scopefor it to cooperate with these two new Member States in ensuring that the outstanding issues will be carefully resolved in the next few years in a process of verification and cooperation between it and them, on the basis of clear and precisely formulated goals to which both the Commission and the two governments will commit themselves. The treaty provides plenty of guarantees that the Commission will be able to ensure that the EU’s interests will be protected in that process. A year’s delay would probably have meant that both sides would no longer make the effort and it would lead to automatic membership of some sort. Instead, the progress and dynamism present in both countries is now being drawn on in order to get what is left of the accession process out of the way in a thorough manner and to clear the desks as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, congratulations, and thanks, to the Commission, thanks to Commissioner Rehn for all the work he has done over the last few years and congratulations once again to Romania and Bulgaria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
