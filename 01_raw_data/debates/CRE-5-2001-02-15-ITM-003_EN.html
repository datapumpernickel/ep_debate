<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Izquierdo Rojo (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, this proposal concerns fruits in shells or pods: that is, nuts and locust beans. We are therefore dealing with walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, pistachios and chestnuts. These products are generally found alongside other fruits on the table and in supermarkets. However, when it comes to decision making, they are not treated fairly and reasonably in relation to other fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p class="contents">Through this proposal, the European Parliament is being consistent with itself. On two previous occasions, 16 June 2000 and 26 October 2000, Parliament already came out in favour of maintaining support and proposing an extension until the introduction of a new aid system. On both these occasions the vote was carried by unanimity. Furthermore, in my view, Mr President, this aid is justified because it benefits the agricultural workers who need it as it helps to compensate for a reduction in their income. I do believe that granting over-generous aid in favourable market situations should be avoided. Cereals are a case in point. Both the Commission and the Court of Auditors have stressed that undue compensation was awarded. In fact, in the period between 1993 and 1997, the Commission estimates that excess compensation worth EUR 8 500 million was granted to the cereal sector. The Court of Auditors puts the figure for excess compensation awarded at EUR 13 100 million. I am not in favour of granting aid as if it were a lottery. The aid we are proposing now really is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, this proposal is in line with the provisions in Agenda 2000. When the latter was adopted Commissioner Fischler himself stated repeatedly that the intention was to maintain all aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council agreed with the European Parliament’s position. Hence, on 17 July 2000, it invited the Commission to extend the aid. The Commission’s proposal is on the right lines, because it redresses the earlier error of attempting to cut off aid. It is right to do so. However, that alone is not enough to ensure a future for the sector. It does not even cover the cost of projects under way this year. The budget has to be ready in June, and programmes relating to plantations in the first part of this year would not be included.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an obvious shortage of these products within the European Union. Walnuts are imported from the United States. I have to tell you, Commissioner, that last Christmas, <span class="italic">El Corte</span> <span class="italic">Inglés</span>, a major department store in my country, strongly promoted Californian walnuts, but walnuts from Extremadura and other European walnuts were sidelined. We import products of this nature to the detriment of the agricultural workers I am speaking for.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you ought to be taking note of what I am saying because this constitutes a precedent. We are in favour of opening up markets and coming to multilateral agreements and to bilateral agreements, with Turkey for instance. We are happy to show solidarity. Nevertheless, the Commission cannot condone European agriculture abandoning these crops as a result of commercial agreements which have caused the collapse of such an important sector. Will the Commission allow European aid to the agricultural sector to be cut off? And does this mean that European agriculture will no longer receive preferential treatment?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I speak for a sector which diversifies agriculture and which truly has great potential for economic development. Mr Fischler is not well acquainted with the Mediterranean area. He ought however to make it his business to become acquainted with the benefits of this sector. It is important for the processing industry, has a most favourable impact on the environment and arrests desertification. Commissioner, I call on you to amend your position and come into line with the spirit of the Council’s agreement.</p>

<p class="contents">Our group’s position is that we support Mrs Izquierdo Rojo’s report whilst also congratulating the Commission insofar as it is simplifying the procedure. It is important to note that simplification. Simplification is often heralded but rarely achieved. I think something will be achieved this time, because a need which has been mentioned in Parliament on numerous occasions, adopted almost unanimously and accepted by the Council has been recognised. For example, the resolutions dated 16 June and 26 October are in that spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now proposing that the improvement plans be extended. We do not merely wish them to be extended for one year only. Instead, we would like the amendments unanimously adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development requesting a two-year extension taken into account. We trust the Commission and the Commissioner will be sensitive to these proposals. They are necessary and the Commissioner is perfectly well aware that a year is not long enough to assess the report on the future evolution of the COM in fruit he is due to submit. Nor is it long enough to find a permanent solution for the shell and pod fruit sector, which will have to become part of the fruit and vegetable sector under special conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that all this will prove costly, and that current funding for this major problem is inadequate. However, we cannot allow sectors which are so important to their regions to be written off as a result of agreements signed earlier. Community preference arrangements in those agreements made it hard for the sector to survive, not to mention a whole range of points already made concerning its environmental and social significance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s resolution of 16 June contains an ongoing appeal for the search for a solution which will provide for direct support for farmers’ income to be awarded, enabling production to continue and preventing the depopulation of very underprivileged areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight how these crops contribute to environmental conservation in the most desertified areas of the Union. This is true of almonds and hazelnuts, for example. As for chestnuts, they are produced in indigenous Community forests, which are preserved for that purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore called upon to put forward proposals offering clear support to the sector. A flat rate of aid per hectare to be administered by producers’ organisations should be introduced and the structural crisis in the sector should be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the present arrangements should be extended until the introduction of permanent support measures for these products. They are of regional importance, offer a high level of food safety, are a source of energy in the Mediterranean diet and make a valuable contribution to safeguarding the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The only specific aid from which they have benefited in the past and from which they benefit today is limited to cofinancing under plans to improve quality and marketing which expired at the end of last year and which the Commission is now proposing to extend by another year.</p>
<p class="contents">This Commission proposal has come about as a result of the acknowledgement, as made by the Commission itself in the preamble to its proposal, that other measures, for which the sector is also eligible, have not been sufficient or directly applicable to nuts. The Commission therefore promised to present new proposals in a report that it would publish by the end of 2000, which it has still not done.</p>
<p class="contents">It makes no sense to extend the already scarce measures in place by another year and to say nothing else about the future of this sector, still less so in that the sector is undergoing a particular crisis due to the extremely strong competition from third countries. What would make sense is for nuts to be treated as a separate sector within the Common Organisation of the Markets in fruits and vegetables. This was why, as a matter of fact, at the time of the proposal on the new COM in fruits and vegetables, the European Parliament adopted an amendment requesting the Commission to present proposals that would provide the nut sector with permanent measures and aid of the kind that exist for other agricultural sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what the rapporteur is proposing and this is what we hope the Commission will put right. In the short term, until these future measures materialise, the most prudent course of action to adopt would be to extend existing aid not by one year but by two, as the European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has suggested. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before I deal with these, allow me to say a few brief words on the basic principles that underlie our proposal. The present regime for nuts and locust beans has been in place for ten years, and the first quality-improvement plans expired in the year 2000. During this ten-year period, 92 producers’ organisations have been awarded a total of EUR 750 million in Community funding to improve the production and marketing of nuts and locust beans.</p>
<p class="contents">Successful restructuring has indeed been effected in some cases, and producers have become more competitive. As a result, they are generally in a stronger position than they used to be when it comes to securing markets for their goods and competing successfully with suppliers from countries outside the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">An amount of EUR 250 million is earmarked once again for the agreements and measures that are still in force. The Commission believes that the ten-year plan has, in principle, adequately achieved the goal that was set ten years ago, namely the creation of a stable basis for economically viable producer organisations. The Council, however, asked the Commission to propose the continuation of the payments to nut and locust bean producers in the 2001 financial year. This was the basis on which the Commission drew up its proposal. Your amendments show that this proposal does not go far enough for your liking. The amendments, some of which refer to resolutions adopted by the European Parliament in June and October of last year, chiefly relate to three areas.</p>
<p class="contents">One group of amendments, comprising Nos 14, 15, 17 and 20, seeks to maintain the aid for quality and marketing-improvement plans beyond the year 2001 and to treat as eligible expenditure all money spent on work that is carried out by the end of 2002. Amendments Nos 10 and 11 refer to the modest level of funds required for this purpose. The purpose of the second group of amendments, comprising Nos 8 and 18, is to maintain the special aid for hazelnuts through to the end of 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Both groups of amendments are at least partly motivated by a perceived need to protect EU producers from imports. As far as these amendments are concerned, let me make the following points: firstly, the framework of this proposal is confined to the funding of programmes under the budget for 2001. It was never meant to be extended to the 2002 financial year, because that would entail additional costs amounting to EUR 82 million. Secondly, specific aid for hazelnuts is not covered by the proposal. Its inclusion would generate a further EUR 110 million in additional budgetary expenditure over and above the cost of the present proposal, which is assessed at EUR 24 million. Amendment No 16, which deals with chestnuts, does not fall within the scope of the regime we are debating here.</p>
<p class="contents">The third group of amendments, comprising Nos 6, 7, 12, 13, 21 and 22, are designed to secure the long-term future of nut and locust bean production by means of other support measures. In addition, Amendments Nos 9 and 19 propose the continuation of support within the framework of the Common Organisation of the Market and of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96. With regard to this third group, allow me to tell you how the Commission sees the future of this area of economic activity and the support it should receive. If we consider the present situation with regard to the production of nuts and locust beans, we see, on the one hand, economically viable and very definitely competitive producer organisations, which are, in a manner of speaking, the Union’s flagship producers. It is they who grow new varieties and who use modern production and marketing methods. These producers have made good use of the money we have provided over the past ten years and a number of them will surely also be able to benefit from the extension that is under discussion today. On the other hand, unfortunately, there are also producers and producer organisations that have to operate in extremely difficult conditions – in disadvantaged areas, for instance, many of which are in remote mountainous regions – with no irrigation facilities. In these areas there are literally thousands of families who remain partly or totally dependent on nut and/or locust bean production for their livelihood.</p>
<p class="contents">On account of the natural disadvantages that their geographical location imposes on all of these producers, they will always find it difficult to compete with importers from countries outside the EU. For this reason, we believe it makes far more sense – and this, indeed, is one of the aims we set ourselves in 1999 – to support this latter group of producers, whose problems are primarily of a social nature, in the framework of rural development. That is why we built this second pillar of the common agricultural policy, and so it is right to make use of it in this context. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, responsibility for rural development has also been shifted to the Member States, which must include measures of this type in their programmes and accord them due priority. Having done so, the Member States are then free to decide on the precise nature of their rural development projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
