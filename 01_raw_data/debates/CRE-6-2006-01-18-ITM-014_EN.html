<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gérard Onesta (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, you have a copy of our current Rules of Procedure in front of you. According to those rules, you should have your ushers throw me out immediately, because I am wearing a T-shirt with a small political slogan printed on the front and back. According to our Rules of Procedure, it is completely forbidden to display political opinions visually, regardless of the medium. That just goes to show how absurd the current system is, all the more so given that the current Rules of Procedure do not allow us to intervene in cases of violence, invective, defamation or insults, in the Chamber or elsewhere. Our current tools in this matter are very weak: it is a case of nothing or an atomic bomb, and you, Mr President, are the atomic bomb. You can move that Parliament penalise the offender but, as the offender has practically no rights, you hesitate about doing so and, by hesitating, you are the one who risks being penalised, Mr President. That is why neither you nor any of your predecessors have ever used this atomic bomb, and that is all to the good.</p>
<p class="contents">Things therefore needed to change and I would like at this point not only to thank you – I am really very touched by your last-minute arrival to chair this debate – but also to congratulate the four shadow rapporteurs who have helped us to reach a consensus: Mr Méndez de Vigo for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Corbett for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mr Guardans Cambó for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and Mrs Kaufmann for the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. This report gives us an opportunity not only to develop more reasonable, more appropriate, more flexible and more proportionate Rules of Procedure, but also – and this is all to the good – to increase the basic individual rights of each Member.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time, thanks to these new Rules of Procedure, our protection by primary law is now enshrined in the Rules. We are also protected by the Statute for Members. For the first time, an offender will have the right to be informed individually, and he will have the right to explain himself to you, Mr President. The penalty must be justified in writing. There will be no more discretionary powers. The offender will have the right to an internal appeal, in addition to the right to an external appeal, and that appeal will have the effect of suspending the penalty. If our appeals body acts too slowly, the penalty will be deemed null and void. Even better, Members will have a new right of visual expression. I will finally be able to wear this type of T-shirt without your ushers intervening, Mr President, provided that what I am wearing is not offensive or defamatory and does not disrupt the sitting, which I hope is the case this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">Also for the first time, we will enshrine in the Rules of Procedure the right to vote. Currently, if a Member is suspended for a few days, he loses his right to vote. That means that we are penalising not only him, but also all of his constituents, who have done nothing wrong. We have therefore decided to say that democracy is strong enough to go that far, in order to protect even the worst Members of this Parliament: those who do not respect democracy. Democracy will respect every single one of their rights, which I think is very much to Parliament's credit.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for enabling us to reach this consensus. There is a safeguard built into the Rules of Procedure themselves, which will in future include the following sentence: 'The application of this Rule shall in no way detract from the liveliness of parliamentary debates nor undermine Members' freedom of speech'.</p>
<p class="contents">I have kept one example to finish with. You may remember that, a year ago, one parliamentary group caused a major disturbance in this Chamber during the vote on the European Constitution. You yourself, Mr President, had some difficulty restoring order in the Chamber and enabling it to continue its business. You remained extremely calm, but the situation was very difficult and the pictures of that disturbance shown outside did no credit to European democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly to be expected that the same group will stage another demonstration during tomorrow's vote on the topic concerned, but it will be quite different in nature. Some of them have told me that they have already taken on board the spirit of the new Rules of Procedure. They intend to use some puppets, and display ostriches; it will not be violent or disruptive, and it will certainly not be aggressive. The simple fact that they have already taken on board the new Rules of Procedure shows that we are moving in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I think that, thanks to the efforts of all Members, we will be able to have a Parliament that is dignified yet lively, lively yet dignified, and you can count on me, Mr President, being widely known as a political agitator, to ensure that Parliament remains very lively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These have been redefined and aspects of the rules that had hitherto been couched in very non-specific terms have been clarified: that is, the difference between the ‘normal’ Chair, the Chairman of a delegation or committee, or a Vice-President chairing this plenary assembly, and the one President – who is of course present in person today. The ‘normal’ Chair may issue a reprimand, exclude from the Chamber a Member guilty of continuous disruption, and suspend a sitting, but the really unpleasant penalties may only be imposed by the President. At first it sounds surprising that the President alone, without plenary, may impose an effective penalty thus, but this is corrected or balanced out by the introduction of a right of appeal, so that Members who consider that they have been unfairly treated by the President may appeal and any penalty wrongfully imposed can then be rectified.</p>
<p class="contents">A genuinely new aspect is that breaches of the rules governing confidentiality may now also be penalised. Another new aspect is that there has been some increase in the possible penalties. Up to now, it has been possible to suspend a Member from his or her duties for two to five days, but the new period would be between two and ten days. I share Mr Onesta’s opinion that this is a balanced draft, a proposal that permits liveliness and nevertheless ensures the smooth conduct of business. Our group will therefore support this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not that the rules ever need to be used, maybe they will never be necessary, but it is important to have them as a democratic safeguard.</p>
<p class="contents">What our committee is proposing today is a modest set of proposals. They would give you, Mr President, powers that are far smaller than the powers of, for instance, the Speaker of the House of Commons; they are strictly circumscribed and are combined with safeguards to reassure those colleagues who feared that we were going to clamp down on any kind of behaviour that was in any way colourful or lively. That is not the case. But we are right to bring in a coherent and proportionate set of rules to protect ourselves if necessary. After all, at the last European election, a Member was elected who seems to have disappeared now, but who, at the time of the election, said his ambition was to come here to disrupt Parliament, to prevent it from working. In the end, he did not manage to do that. But, who knows, he might, in combination with others, have made a serious effort to stop us from working. That is why it is necessary to protect the democratic process, or at least to have the instruments just in case we need them.</p>
<p class="contents">I notice that some members of our press are saying that these rules are aimed at silencing those who oppose the European Union, silencing a minority viewpoint. That is not true and anyone who looked at the proposals would know that viewpoint is not plausible. We have gone out of our way to say that the pluralism of Parliament – the right to express yourself, the right of freedom of expression and even, within proportion, visual expression – is safeguarded and guaranteed. So, this is not to stamp down on any minority. Those who are saying it are aiming at gullible journalists or at the Eurosceptic press, hoping to get a story making us look silly or ridiculous. Unless they think it targets them, and I can scarcely believe that, those behind this story must either be planning to disrupt our work – and I hope that is not the case – or they are paranoid. Given their general attitude to the European Union – that anything coming out of our institutions is necessarily an evil plot – I rather think it is paranoia that is governing their actions in telling the press the story about this very reasonable report.</p>
<p class="contents">My group will support the proposals of Mr Onesta and I hope that this gives our Parliament a proportionate set of rules that we need, just in case we need to safeguard ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The previous speakers have explained this very well and it would be impossible for me not to repeat some of their points.</p>
<p class="contents">This text basically rationalises the current system − which in itself is quite a task − it codifies but rationalises, it makes each person’s role much clearer and, above all, it achieves a balance between two extreme views.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is to see this as a parliament and not a school, nor a church and − please take this as a joke, Mr President − nor is it an opera house. It must have its vivacity, its movement, its people. Nevertheless, its operational rules must be obeyed and Parliament must be able to preserve the dignity of its role at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">It is intolerable − and I am going to give an example which scandalised me in particular, if you pardon the expression − to interrupt a formal sitting with a President, a Head of State, during his last speech, and probably one of his last political actions in Europe and in his political career. I am referring to the speech in this House by President Ciampi. That is intolerable. Other similar actions are totally unacceptable, too.</p>
<p class="contents">It is that that should be penalised, much more than a Member displaying some poster or other, or some little pamphlet, which in no way disrupts the work of the House.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, therefore, vivacity, energy and contrasting ideas are fine – and these are sometimes expressed through shouting and other reactions that those of us from Latin Parliaments even believe are lacking, because simultaneous interpreting makes it difficult for us to laugh spontaneously or to react to a comment – but not to the point of losing the dignity of the role entrusted to us and of what each of us represents, which is much more than any one of us means individually. That is why we are here even at this time of night.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this balance is well reflected in the report that is going to be put to the vote tomorrow. There are proportionate penalties, there are guarantees for those who may be penalised, there are powers for the President, which are balanced against a right to appeal to the Bureau. I believe that all of this is a step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">My hope for this text is the best one can hope for a text of this nature: that it does not have to be applied. I hope that it stays where it is, that we all practically forget that it exists and that it goes unnoticed because it is not necessary to apply it. That would be the best possible result of having clear rules with regard to the internal discipline of this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the credit side, penalised members will not lose their right to vote and will be able to appeal. I still think that this proposal could be counterproductive. It is an invitation to MEPs to make the headlines by proclaiming their own punitive measures and thus to present themselves to the public as martyrs. It also prompts frightened Presidents to come down unnecessarily hard on the people they do not consider to be their friends. Moreover, every incident will lead to even stricter rules so as to rule out all unanticipated irritations.</p>
<p class="contents">Interruptions in debates and a visible display of different opinions are part and parcel of normal parliamentary practice. This House would expose itself to possible ridicule if this were to lead to exclusion from a number of sittings or even to Members being suspended. If that were the case, the media would not be reporting as much about the content of the debate and the decision-making as it would about the lack of tolerance. Since that is sending the wrong message to the voters, it would be preferable if a regulation of that kind were to confine itself to preventing and penalising physical violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My concern is that the proposed measures may be used to try to stifle the voice of national independence and opposition to the European Union. If that is the case, it will not succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to offer some constructive suggestions to improve the proceedings. Firstly, the presiding Presidents should ensure that speakers are kept to their allotted time: pro-EU speakers are given much more leeway to overrun than anti-EU speakers. Secondly, during the vote some presiding Presidents need to slow down a little. In that way we might have time to vote properly. At the same time, the Presidents might not make so many glaring mistakes in estimating the vote and there would be less call for electronic checks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very grateful, Mr President, that you are present for these questions, and I am also very grateful that you are a President who endeavours to keep in check the good many abuses by some Members in invoking the Rules of Procedure. I do not wish to discuss now whether the status of a number of Members is perhaps being enhanced by penalising their questionable conduct in the Rules of Procedure. Nor do I wish to discuss whether several members of the Presidency of Parliament perhaps simply have less sovereignty, which even an amendment to the Rules of Procedure cannot confer on them. I expressly support the inclusion in this text of breaches of the rules governing confidentiality. I do feel somewhat uneasy, however, that the Committee on Legal Affairs, which is responsible for the mandate of Members, could not be consulted on this text.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Constitutional Affairs is responsible for the Rules of Procedure with good reason: the matter is in good hands there. Sometimes, however, Members’ rights do conflict with provisions in the Rules of Procedure. Naturally, Members’ rights are not restricted to merely the right to vote: we are a parliament and not a ‘votament’. It is with good reason that, if Members are absent and cannot present their arguments, courts may declare a vote unlawful. If the Legal Affairs Committee had been involved, I would have raised an issue that goes to the heart of the matter. Up to now, a Member who had been penalised could request five minutes’ speaking time in Parliament – this was decided by Members – which is also why no right of appeal was necessary. That procedure, which would have been a public one, is now to disappear into the parliamentary bodies, to an extent, which I consider a step backwards. Nevertheless, I support it, albeit with some misgivings. I would ask, however, that, in the event of future discussions that venture beyond merely organisational procedures, where the mandate could even theoretically be affected, the Legal Affairs Committee be included in the consultation process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
