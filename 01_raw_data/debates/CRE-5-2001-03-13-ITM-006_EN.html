In Tampere in 1999, the government leaders may have been brimming with good intentions, but they never got beyond drawing up a wish list. The European Commission’s scoreboard, dating back to 2000, lists the necessary measures in a more readily understood format. However, it already appears that the Council meeting of Ministers for Justice will fall short of the goals which have been set. This also applies to the setting up of a reception scheme for displaced persons. The present draft directive is the third proposal which is being presented to the European Parliament, no less than four years after the first one in 1997. The European Parliament endorsed the first two, but the Council of Ministers is struggling to reach a decision on these. It has never been exactly clear which Member States thwarted the proposals, as everything is done behind closed doors. The Council of Ministers has remained silent, and that is once again European asylum policy at its worst.</p>
<p class="contents">This attitude is reprehensible, for we would do well to remind ourselves of what is actually at issue. This proposal provides for situations such as those which occurred a few years ago in Bosnia and later on in Kosovo, situations in which the mass influx of displaced persons has to be absorbed by the European Union, situations in which people are being driven away from house and home, where villages are burned to the ground and where people are at their wit’s end. This affects hundreds of thousands of people at the same time. Of course, they deserve a dignified reception. Of course, the European Member States should share out the responsibility fairly and squarely by making sound agreements. This has not happened to a satisfactory level in the past. And we can already foresee that, when a similar tragedy soon strikes Macedonia or maybe Algeria, the European Union will, once again, not be prepared.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the European Commission has done a good job. The present proposal outshines the previous two proposals. The sharing of responsibility among the Member States has now been included in the scheme and is now inextricably linked to it. That aspect, therefore, will enter into effect at the same time as the rest of the scheme. And there are many other aspects which have been arranged far more efficiently than in the previous proposals but which I will not elaborate upon at this stage. That is the good news.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to mention a few aspects where there is room for improvement. The first thing that springs to mind is the link with the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees, particularly the key principle of it, namely the <span class="italic">non- refoulement</span> principle, the principle that refugees cannot simply be returned home. This must be spelled out more clearly in the proposal. The Council of Ministers must be tied down to deadlines when it takes decisions on the implementation of the temporary protection of displaced persons, and the European Parliament – this, too, is an old complaint, Mr President – must be more involved in the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal falls short in one area: that of the sharing of responsibility – we used to talk about the sharing of the burden, this is now referred to as the sharing of responsibility – between the Member States. What is at issue here is which Member States make what effort with regard to the reception of the large numbers of displaced persons. In the case of Bosnia and Kosovo, countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Austria received large numbers of displaced persons, whilst other Member States did too little. The Commission now proposes, first of all, to share the financial burden on the basis of the Refugee Fund. Mr President, it is my conviction as your rapporteur that this aspect really needs to be reinforced. This is first of all about implementing the EC Treaty which expressly stipulates that the Council must help strike a balance between the efforts of the Member States in this field. The word ‘balance’ encompasses more than the word ‘solidarity’ which is in the proposal at present. More than anything, we need to distribute the displaced persons across the Member States proportionately: hence Amendments Nos 4 and 11. I naturally hope that these will be adopted by this House. Also, the provision must be deleted whereby Member States can opt out altogether from receiving displaced persons. Quite the reverse: every Member State must be able to justify its supply of reception facilities very well, and that is set down in Amendments Nos 31 and 32.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, all things considered, we have a reasonable proposal before us which this House will hopefully be able to accept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nassauer (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, behind the incredibly complicated title of the draft directive lies a relatively straightforward problem. What we are dealing with here is the issue of sharing the burden of receiving refugees from civil wars. It is as if the awkwardness of the title in itself makes it clear just how uncomfortable the underlying issue is for Europeans. The way in which Europeans have so far handled the issue of burden sharing can only be described as a complete tragedy.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is one that we have been familiar with for many years. We know from painful experience what happens when civil wars break out in an area such as the former Yugoslavia, and people flee in their tens and hundreds of thousands – and, of course, they go wherever they can be sure of being safe from persecution and war. In the past, this has meant especially Austria, but also Italy, the Netherlands and Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Bosnian war, for example, my country received more than twice as many refugees as all other countries put together. This is the reason why those concerned have been pressing for a solution to this problem for years. But so far this has not been enough to make the Council produce anything more than declarations of solidarity with those receiving refugees. May I remind you of the very unfortunate attempts of Commissioner Vitorino’s predecessor, Mrs Gradin. Those interested might care to take a look at these.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I am grateful to you, Mr Vitorino for taking up these problems energetically after Tampere. I would like to add that, unlike the previous agenda item, this is not an initiative by a Member State but an initiative of the Commission and the Commissioner responsible. To that extent, you are also responsible for it. Much as I welcome what you have done in principle, I also have some objections concerning particular details.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of burden sharing is tied to one single problem. Will it or will it not be made a rule that all Member States must receive refugees? If, Mr Vitorino, you adhere to the principle known as two-sided voluntary action, meaning that refugees should be able to decide for themselves which Member State they wish to enter, and that Member States should only take in refugees voluntarily, then everything will remain exactly as it is and absolutely nothing will change. The burden of receiving refugees simply cannot be offset by financial contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">The first thing that has to happen is that Member States should not to be able to back out by making a financial contribution; instead it should be obligatory for all Member States actually to take in refugees according to a certain system. This system would, of course, take into account the absorptive capacity of each country and all other conceivable viewpoints; it would also, of course, ensure that families are not torn apart and also, of course, on a quota basis, take into account the wishes of the refugees themselves. But it must be laid down in writing that every Member State has a duty to make a personal contribution in terms of receiving refugees. This is the first weak point in your draft. Thankfully, this has been corrected by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and I hope that Parliament will go along with the opinion of the Home Affairs Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point, Mr Vitorino, relates to family reunification. The indeterminate concept of the family that you use cannot be imposed upon all the Member States. Those wishing to permit the entry and residence of all eligible relatives in addition to the core family may do so. Member States cannot, however, be forced to do this; it must be included on an optional basis. This is our second serious objection.</p>

(PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Wiebenga, on his report, which gets to the heart of the problem we are facing at the moment: temporary protection for people in the most difficult circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that Mr Nassauer has ignored what the rapporteur said about the use of language and has talked about "burden sharing", because the issue is actually how different Member States accept their responsibilities and try to treat people in very desperate circumstances fairly.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur also referred, quite rightly, to the Kosovo crisis, in which Member States failed to take on their responsibilities and poorer states, such as Albania, were left to deal with large numbers of refugees. With the new mechanism that should be avoided. If there is a mass influx of refugees into the Community, Member States will have agreed in advance to share the responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">This temporary protection needs to cover not only spontaneous mass influxes into the Community territory but also non-spontaneous influxes, when people have been airlifted out of difficult areas by Member States, or perhaps other parties, and possibly assisted to come to the EU. We must ensure that appropriate provisions are in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Another very important point on which my group has tabled an amendment, Amendment No 44, concerns the speed and the workings of the directive. When a refugee crisis occurs, it is absolutely imperative that the Member States act as quickly as possible. I applaud the rapporteur for introducing a time limit for the Council decision. However, my group has tabled an amendment to bring that forward. We do not believe that three months is acceptable. We are asking that it should be one month. I am fully aware of the logistical and organisational difficulties that this presents, but action needs to be immediate and an emergency Council meeting is a small price to pay for ensuring that those in need receive protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 45 and 46 concern the rights of individuals. When they are in Member States they have the right to asylum and protection. We should ensure that these people are not forced to return to their countries if that is going to create desperate problems for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States must try to do more to integrate refugees into society. Young people should be put into education and adults given the opportunity to work as quickly as possible, so they can be seen as active and useful participants in society.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that situations like Kosovo will not happen again, but if they do we must ensure that we are prepared. My group will be supporting this with the amendments to which I have just referred. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Wiebenga has added some useful, strengthening amendments to the clause already in the Commission proposal: for instance, on insisting on <span class="italic">non-refoulement</span>, to insist that the Dublin Convention shall not apply and that the host Member State shall consider the asylum application, and on the involvement of UNHCR. All these are to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry that the PPE-DE Group insisted on forcing amendments to the article on family reunion. I feel the clause about unmarried partners which says that Member States may admit an unmarried partner if the legislation of the Member State treats unmarried couples in the same way as married couples is slightly perverse. I would have thought that it would be rather odd to treat them differently if domestic legislation did not.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point I want to make is the contrast between Mr Wiebenga's report and the previous one by Mr Kirkhope. Mr Wiebenga's report is based on a Commission proposal in line with the Tampere conclusions and the scoreboard. It passed through our Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs constructively, without major dissension and results in a report which sensibly improves the Commission proposals. What a contrast to the series of Members States' proposals. Mr Vitorino said politely what many of us in Parliament are saying rather more rudely, that the Council and Member States need to get their act together on asylum and immigration. Mr Wiebenga's report has been a model of how we can work constructively between the Commission and Parliament. All we need is the Council to work as constructively with us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the mass influx of immigrants who escaped the conflicts and the attendant dangers in former Yugoslavia, Europe was, for the first time since the Second World War, faced with forced migration on a scale which was, both qualitatively and quantitatively, outside the range of our experience hitherto.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft legal framework for temporary protection in the case of mass immigration has been developed in the past decades and varies from Member State to Member State. They apply different social rights schemes which people enjoy during temporary protection. Some Member States recognise the right to work and family reunification, others do not.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Commission proposal includes all the conclusions of the Treaty of Amsterdam’s implementation and reproduces the discussions in the Council, as well as the response of the Member States to the refugee crisis in and around Kosovo. The proposal forms part of the recent Commission initiatives with regard to the asylum policy on account of the new Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the NGOs have expressed concern that a temporary protection scheme might undermine the international policy for the protection of refugees if no guarantee is given that sufficient precautionary measures have been taken to prevent misuse. The Commission recognises this risk when it states that temporary protection is a responsibility which is of crucial importance to the European Union, but it needs to spell out that it does not intend to undermine the protection of refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore share the rapporteur’s opinion that the proposal for a directive contains a considerable number of improvements on the previous two proposals. The sharing of the burden among the Member States is no longer separate from the stipulations. Despite this, I would like to quote a critical example: let us not forget the refugees in Sangatte and Calais, who are desperate for temporary protection provision for displaced persons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And I was so glad to hear Mr Nassauer use the word solidarity. I thought it was a good word until I realised what he meant. It was solidarity with ourselves. It is interesting that Mr Nassauer – and the PPE-DE Group, I assume – think that this proposal should primarily be about distributing the burden. I thought it was supposed primarily to be about saving people's lives, that is to say the lives of people who are victims of war or civil war or other similar events leading to mass displacement and the need for aid. It is, of course, absurd, really. The world's poorest countries in Asia and Africa do not need special rules on mass displacement, but that is what we need in the rich, well-organised EU. That is how matters stand, however. The authorities in our countries have not been able to demonstrate sufficient flexibility within the present rules, and this proposal is therefore clearly necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still a few problems with the proposal, I think, but, when all is said and done, my group will end up supporting the report and, thus, this initiative, because it is so patently necessary that we get it implemented quickly. And I will, at any event, do everything I can to prevent the issue of burden sharing’s being made into something which can turn victims of catastrophe into hostages in our own internal battles and our solidarity with ourselves. There is a need for solidarity in this world, not with ourselves but with the world outside. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Austria has always played an important part when it comes to receiving refugees and displaced persons, and has also contributed more than its fair share to solving the resultant problems. I would particularly like to thank Mr Nassauer for adding to what the rapporteur has said in this respect. However, it is high time a satisfactory pan-European solution was found to this problem. It is not enough just to call for solidarity between all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards reception of persons by the Member States, the Commission proposal only talks about Community solidarity, but this concept needs to be firmed up in the spirit of Article 63(2)(b) of the Treaty. The purpose of the directive as described in Article 1 should also include the idea that displaced persons should be allocated to the Member States with due regard for their absorptive capacity. However, the solidarity mechanism operating between the Member States should also cover both aspects, that is to say both the financial and personal aspects of solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is the issue of dual optionality in the allocation of refugees from civil wars, that is to say the possibility that a refugee has to select a country, and a country's right to reject any refugee.</p>
<p class="contents">The founding fathers created the ‘European home’ as a place for solidarity, above all. This solidarity can still be seen today, for example when European funding is used to support structurally weak regions. So not only is the call for more equitable burden sharing as regards receiving refugees justified, but also burden sharing itself is an expression of solidarity between the peoples of Europe. As various Members have already pointed out, only a few Member States bore a share of the burdens resulting from the civil wars in former Yugoslavia. It is all very easy for Mrs Frahm to talk big, because she comes from a country which has not, so far, exactly distinguished itself when it comes to such acts of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike the governments at the Nice Summit, we, as directly elected Members of the European Parliament, are obliged here to overcome national differences and to opt for a European solution founded upon a quota-based allocation of refugees in accordance with Member States' absorptive capacity. Otherwise, dual optionality will render the positive approach adopted in the Commission's proposal superfluous.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important point is family reunification. Here, too, a fundamental principle of our Community is at stake – subsidiarity. Today it will be decided whether the EU should reserve for itself, in a centralist way, the process of defining and regulating what constitutes a family, or whether in the first place the concept of a nuclear family, which is common to all Member States, should be taken as a basis, with regulations going any further than that being at Member States' discretion. The compromise amendment tabled by the rapporteur, Mr Wiebenga, provides for the latter. This follows this House's tradition of fighting the attempts of the Brussels bureaucracy to arrogate to itself the powers of the Member States. Today, you have a chance to demonstrate what this concept of subsidiarity means to you. I urge you to vote for the fair traditions of this House and for the fundamental principles of our Community of values, and not to be swayed by purely national interests and party political calculations. I urge you, when it comes to these important issues, to vote for Mr Wiebenga's compromise amendments.</p>

<p class="contents">In recent years, Europe has had to face situations which we thought had been eradicated once and for all in our part of the world. In view of these events, I believe that we can no longer ignore our moral and political obligation to establish mechanisms to deal with a humanitarian catastrophe, when all other prevention mechanisms fail.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must act as one on this. I wish to say on behalf of my group that we are in favour of distributing responsibilities amongst the Member States. I am not going to use the word burden because, having seen the faces of men and women in refugee camps in Macedonia, who are just like you and me, Mr President, it seems to me to be horrendous and repugnant to call them a burden. I believe that it in doing this we must take clear account of the situation and show a degree of flexibility, which the rapporteur acknowledges, simply to listen to the will of the refugees and to prevent them, as a result of their temporarily weak position, from effectively becoming a burden to be transported to where we, completely regardless of their views, decide.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur on the effort which he has made to clarify the time periods, to clarify that, in this case, it is especially important to respect the time periods within which things are decided, and to support the amendment which our group has presented in order to specify and to reduce these time periods.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to family reunification, I wish to say to Mr Nassauer that I do not understand this obsession you have. The Right has convinced us, even the most stubborn of the Leftists, that the family is a necessary asset and an important pillar of our society. Is this only the case for Europeans? Mr Nassauer, are you on the Right going to leave your mother or brother in a situation of special need if a violent situation arises in your countries? Can we not, for temporary protection, take account of these especially serious situations which can cause particular anguish, and bring these people to the European Union together with their families? I truly believe that we can take account of them. With regard to the definition of the family, it seems to me that the Commission’s position that each Member State should apply its own definition of the family is more than reasonable and we are going to support this position.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Council does not make us wait another four years for a decision on this issue. I believe that Mr Wiebenga did not realise that he was taking on such a great responsibility when he produced his first report and that he will not mind being rapporteur for this issue for life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can tell you that it is a very rare occasion indeed when all Dutch groups agree on refugee policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we offer our unqualified support to the report as a whole, my group would now also like to make a few observations, of which I should like to mention two.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns the much-debated Article 13(1). The Commission suggests that Member States which equate unmarried couples with married couples in their national legislation should also do so in the case of family reunification. It is not, therefore, a matter of imposing family law standards, but about equal treatment within a Member State. It is, in my view, a modest proposal, but it touches upon an important principle. I am, therefore, disappointed that this is being played down in the report, more specifically in Amendment No 22, which turns this modest proposal into an empty statement. It now claims that Member States are entitled to reunify unmarried couples. That does not require European agreement, for that is already the case now. The Commission proposal relies on solidarity among Member States and their generosity in offering reception capacity, but there is no big stick. The rapporteur attempts to make the reception scheme less non-committal, and I support him on that, but solidarity is not given any financial leverage. Like the rapporteur and some others here, I am convinced that a sharing of the financial responsibility at European level is necessary to prevent Member States from passing the buck to one another. I also believe that it is unwise to start moving people around unnecessarily. Pursuant to Article 24, the Refugee Fund has to provide for financial solidarity. But this fund has a maximum of EUR 10 million annually at its disposal for displaced persons. That just about covers the cost of two tents and a hot-water bottle. Unless this fund grows substantially, I fear for Europe’s hospitality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, although today's proposal is more flexible on certain points, it remains open to several serious criticisms. The first is that to introduce this temporary protection comes down to creating a second status. That status is parallel to the status of refugee, of beneficiary of political asylum recognised under the 1951 Geneva Convention, but much broader than that. The beneficiaries under this new system would not just be persons who satisfy very specific criteria for the grant of political asylum but also very broad categories of third-country nationals who apparently had to leave their country of origin for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 63(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam does indeed provide for the introduction of this kind of regime, but it refers only to temporary protection. The Commission proposal, however, although theoretically confined to protection for not more than two years, risks creating <span class="italic">de facto</span> situations very likely to continue for longer than that, since provision is made only for the voluntary departure of the persons concerned. We regard that as a serious defect of the Commission's proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second major criticism is that although the States must give their assent to the physical allocation of the protected persons – which represents some progress over the earlier version – the new text seems, in fact, to absolve the Member States of their responsibility. This problem could have been avoided if the basic decision by the Council to launch the temporary protection regime had been taken unanimously. But the Commission proposal only provides for a qualified majority decision, which, in our view, was not legally necessary and basically seems quite inadequate for such a serious issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let us not lose sight of the fact that we are dealing with a humanitarian problem of the highest order. Nobody wants to abandon their land, their culture or their family. The first question is therefore how to understand and show solidarity, so that we can assist these people and make their terrible situation less burdensome.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as immediately meeting their humanitarian needs, we also face the problem of where to place these refugees, as this debate is demonstrating. Is it a proper solution to distribute them numerically according to a system of quotas, thereby replacing the two-fold principle of respecting the will of the Member States and of the refugees themselves? I sincerely believe not. Would it not be fairer to use the European Fund for Refugees, as Spain proposed, and give it more financial resources than it has at the moment, in order to help the Member States receiving more refugees? I believe so.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is also that a great number of asylum requests are rejected because they do not come from genuine political refugees, but from economic immigrants. As is also being demonstrated here, we are facing a very confused debate in which there is no definition of the different types of economic immigration as opposed to those involving asylum for humanitarian or political reasons. The issue is to resolve the problems created by the current asylum procedure, and thereby make the number of asylum seekers much more reasonable and make the distribution of responsibilities fairer.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that those people who have committed criminal acts for supposedly political reasons have been excluded from temporary protection. This is a further step by the European Union in the fight against terrorism. The amendment presented in committee by the Spanish delegation of our group endorses a vote in favour of the report despite some of our reservations on certain aspects of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But we are a long way off the ultimate goal, not least because the Council has hitherto appeared unable to reach decisions on Commission proposals. As far as I am aware, there is still no agreement on the directive on family reunification within the Council’s working party. The Council will perhaps be able to deal with this temporary protection directive more promptly, as it is not being ‘hindered’ by a codecision procedure in this case. It is, however, questionable how much further problems have to escalate before the Council can rise above the mutual differences and can adopt a truly European approach. Despite this, I should like to identify two positive aspects today.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the drive with which the Commission acquits itself of its task as legislator in the European Union and the care it applies to keeping the balance between the national interests and the ultimate goal of Tampere are quite remarkable. Commissioner Vitorino deserves every support for his excellent helmsmanship in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the content of the directive itself is balanced and therefore by and large acceptable. First and foremost, it is stated that the rights and duties of displaced persons should as far as possible approximate to those of people with a different residence status. In addition, further to its debate, the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has called for more light to be shed on the relationship between the displaced persons status and the regular asylum procedure. They should not be mutually exclusive. At the end of the day, the use of the temporary protection instrument is merely a contingency measure which should not undermine the individual right to asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I am delighted that it has been clearly laid down that all Member States have to contribute their proportionate share to the actual reception of displaced persons. I thank Mr Wiebenga for amending the directive to that effect. However, I also share Mrs Terrón’s and Mrs Buitenweg’s severe criticism of the compromise, which is very disappointing indeed and should not really call itself a compromise, as far as the definition of “the family” is concerned. We have not heard the last of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The tragedy of people cut up in civil wars, which is the main focus obviously of Mr ­­­Wiebenga's report, is only one of the issues we are facing. Many colleagues today have spoken on the basis of experience in their own countries of how these issues are handled.</p>
<p class="contents">For far too long the Commission or the Council, holding its meetings in secret and expressing solidarity very often between themselves about these issues, have covered up what we really need to know about future policy on immigration, asylum, refugees, etc., within the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming as I do from a small country on the periphery where very often the difficulties of getting there have prevented us from being a focal point for those seeking asylum or refugee status, I sometimes feel uncomfortable when having to debate these issues with colleagues who have much greater experience and whose countries are called upon very often to share a huge amount of the responsibility for people tragically displaced by civil war, as has recently happened.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we share our responsibility. We have to. It is our duty as one human being to another, but what we must absolutely insist on in all our immigration policies, not just in the context of mass displacements of people in the event of civil war, is that we must have a much better thought-out, much more humane and generous, and, above all, merciful policy towards those who come to us for help in these tragic situations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also believe it is fair to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino, because it is evident that the proposal for a directive, the draft presented to us today, greatly improves on the proposals which have previously been presented to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Although other Members have highlighted important aspects of the issues we are dealing with, I do not wish to ignore certain aspects which I consider to be fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is important to stress the guarantee of the right of these displaced persons to family reunification on the same basis as holders of residency documents and, although this may be a personal view, I believe that the issue of unmarried couples has not been sufficiently dealt with. We understand the difficulties which have arisen in studying this problem and we will support any steps which may lead to a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue which I feel to be important is clarity on the distribution of responsibilities between the Member States in the event of a massive influx of displaced persons. The Member States must deal with this type of situation in a homogenous and cooperative way.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to make it clear that people who have benefited from the temporary protection system also have the right to make a request for asylum and that the Geneva Convention must be respected to the full, including its principle of not returning asylum seekers to their country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the European Parliament must be strengthened and, in cases of temporary protection, it is essential that it be consulted. We must all prevent visa restrictions, which were imposed in the case of Kosovo, for example, which brought shame on every one of us.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that on this occasion Parliament has done its job. The Commission has also demonstrated its will and done its job. We just have to hope now that the Council does its duty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in our view the Commission's proposal for a directive on temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons forms part of a global vision of how to establish a European asylum system. The European Union needs an exceptional mechanism at its disposal so that it can react rapidly to mass influxes and respond immediately to the need to protect displaced persons, a situation we have seen in Bosnia and Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">The object of this mechanism is to ensure that the asylum system can work over the long term, while also ensuring that it is consistent with access to the normal asylum procedure and with the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">We based our proposal on the idea that Member States must grant temporary protection on the basis of a Council decision, adopted by a qualified majority, that confirms the existence of a mass influx. That protection is granted for not more than two years, but the Council may also at any time, if the conditions are right, terminate it by joint decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that while the directive gives the Member States a degree of flexibility in managing their asylum system for the duration of the temporary protection, it also guarantees the beneficiaries absolute access to the asylum procedure, and at all events does so at the moment when the protection period expires. We have finally established not only equal rights for those enjoying temporary protection but also principles governing returnees.</p>
<p class="contents">In Tampere, the Heads of State and Government emphasised the need to ensure solidarity between the Member States on the question of temporary protection. And we know that the European Parliament is extremely concerned with this principle. I believe I discussed it with Mr Nassauer more than seven years ago. That is why the Commission has endeavoured to give a clear form to the concept of Community solidarity and greater depth to the content of Article 63(2)(b), on the balance of effort and responsibility between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This solidarity is reflected first of all in the financial aspect, thanks to the links created with the European Refugee Fund. I know that the financing of that fund is not very ambitious, but perhaps this is an area where it would be more rational to ask how the fund can help to strengthen financial solidarity. At the same time, let me emphasise, in this proposal we have adhered to the principle of sharing the burden with regard to the physical reception of the refugees. This solidarity between Member States with regard to reception is reflected in the principle of voluntary action by both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand Mr von Boetticher's problem and even agree with his comment about the difficulties. The idea of ensuring voluntary action by both sides first came up during the German Presidency and has gained ground. Of course, it presupposes both that the Member States are willing to take in refugees and that the beneficiaries in their turn are willing to go to the territory of the Member State in question. That is why, from the outset, the decision to grant temporary protection specifies either the capacity of Member States to absorb refugees or the exceptional reasons that prevent them from taking in any more displaced persons. But I do want to emphasise that these really must be exceptional reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, refusal to accept new refugees where a decision has been taken to grant temporary protection must be quite exceptional. Moreover, the concept of voluntary action by both sides introduces a transparent system. And that transparent decision-making system is essential, for peer-group pressure has a role to play here: it must persuade everyone to agree to cooperate in the matter of reception, including the physical reception of beneficiaries of temporary protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot guarantee that the system will work. But at least we have tried to design an instrument that will guarantee the principle of solidarity in the matter of physical reception, and the principle of financial solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I warmly thank the Members who have taken part in this debate. Let me draw particular attention to the contribution made by the rapporteur, Mr Wiebenga, with his excellent report. If I am a little nervous today it is because he taught me a great deal about the subject and I feel rather like a student facing his professor. I am a teacher by profession. So you know what I am talking about. But in any case I want to say that we have taken careful note of all the amendments that were tabled. I regard these amendments, even those on solidarity, as a source of inspiration for the several weeks of negotiations that lie before us in the Council, which should produce a final result in May. At least I hope we will reach a conclusion by the May Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of your amendments modify the level of beneficiaries' rights and the Commission remains very keen to see a fair level that cannot be revised downwards. As for solidarity, we note that some provisions have been strengthened, especially those concerning reception between Member States. Despite the delicate nature of this question, we are doing our best to find a realistic, fair and, in particular, viable solution. Once the principle of voluntary action by both sides is respected, some amendments, in spirit if not literally, could, as I said earlier, help bring the negotiations to a final conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
