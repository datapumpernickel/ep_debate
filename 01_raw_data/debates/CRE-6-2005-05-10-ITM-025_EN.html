<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Franco Frattini,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has today adopted a draft communication, drawn up by me, consisting of a plan of action to implement and put into practice the priorities of the Hague programme to make Europe an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication contains a first draft of the political objectives and an annex indicating the main practical measures, together with dates by which each initiative must be adopted. We have prepared a programme comprising 84 initiatives for the whole term of the Commission’s mandate: 32 of these 84 measures will be implemented by the end of 2005, which will be the most important year for the action plan to take off. We believe that with this programme we have launched a second stage in Europe’s freedom, security and justice policy.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we shall be equipping ourselves with the means to organise and plan future actions more effectively. We are aware, of course, that there may always be some unpredictability in matters of security due to external events, but it is important to work to a strategic plan and to avoid emergency measures. These are areas – the security area as well as those of justice and freedom – where we should not be thinking in terms of individual, isolated measures, but instead we should be thinking in terms of a European approach that responds to the people’s demands and can make a difference, compared to the individual actions of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect of our work will be to monitor the way the Member States implement individual initiatives. We have prepared a specific reference guide, a chapter of the communication concerning the preparation of a yearly report – a kind of management chart. It would, in fact, be a comparative outline of the measures that are adopted at national level to implement and comply with the orientations given in the document. I believe that such a report is important, and the first one will be issued in December this year, six months after the Commission’s adoption of the action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">The three major objectives that the Commission intends to pursue are, first of all, the promotion and protection of people’s fundamental rights. We see that as a core aspect of European citizenship, one that we must fulfil organically but which requires that Europe should, both internally and externally in its international actions, be a promoter and not just a passive defender of people’s fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">That aspect is clearly linked to the high-priority need for security, as the people of Europe are demanding. Security means decisive action against terrorism and organised crime, with particular regard for the victims of crime. We shall be giving this aspect special attention, but, as I have already pointed out, our measures to strengthen security must not come at the expense of everyone’s freedoms and fundamental rights. The guiding principles will be more security, more respect and more protection, as well as the promotion of individual freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">An important chapter is devoted to various aspects of solidarity. Solidarity means considering issues such as immigration at a European level and no longer at a national level. We have to separate the aspect of illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings, against which we must fight hard, from the aspect of admission rules for legal immigrants, those who are entitled to have proper access to social services – that means a policy of integration based on legality and obeying the law. In this area, solidarity clearly also means striking a balance between our fellow citizens’ right to be given guarantees against people traffickers and protecting the victims of people traffickers, in other words the immigrants or asylum seekers themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">This point is linked to the one on the European area of justice. I am, of course, summarising these aspects as much as I can, but you will find the details in the communication: civil justice and criminal justice. We cannot just think about criminal justice, but rather we must emphasise the fact that civil justice and the harmonisation of rules, or at least the solution of common problems, can help the people of Europe with serious problems in their everyday lives. I am thinking of certain points of family law, such as inheritance among people of different nationalities, or the execution of orders for payment where the creditor is from one country and the debtor from another: in civil law, too, we can find solutions that improve or resolve certain problems in people’s everyday lives.</p>
<p class="contents">All that certainly requires a commitment by the three European institutional players: Parliament, the Council and the Commission. It is our intention to work hard to strengthen this action, to strengthen this interinstitutional partnership, and we shall make every effort to expand the areas of codecision with Parliament wherever possible. In this action plan we have taken account of many points that Parliament had highlighted, and I shall mention just one of them: the greater role of the European Union Court of Justice in certain areas. We found the Council’s reaction somewhat problematic at times, but equally we feel committed to continue working until all three institutional players agree on how to put this plan’s lines of action into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, of course, familiar with the report drawn up by the chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr Cavada, after a hearing and a thorough debate precisely on our priorities regarding security, justice and freedom. As you will see, the document takes up many of those recommendations and suggestions. I strongly hope and trust that on this occasion, in the course of Parliament’s work, you will be able to find some agreement with the Commission’s strategy in terms of lines of action.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by saying that of course we are counting on Parliament’s support. We are counting on it because freedom, justice and security are among people’s fundamental needs, because they are pillars of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and of the Constitutional Treaty in the European Union, and also because they are subjects that have a strong political dimension rather than a bureaucratic one. That is why the European Parliament, as a political player, will be able to make contributions, proposals and suggestions for additions that we shall certainly take into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem, as mentioned, is that the decision as to how many migrants coming from third countries can be admitted to the European Union remains a national decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission suggested that an area of free movement demands a common immigration policy, and we agree with that. How will the Commission try to overcome the contradiction embedded in the fact that, on the one hand, the European Union is developing a common European asylum system, a common European visa system and common European border control, while, on the other hand, legal migration, which is a very important part of migration management, remains a strictly national question? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have put a written question to the European Commission. I also raised the matter orally in the debate at the April part-session, but I have not received a reply to date. We may be looking at an infringement of the agreement between the European Union and the United States, so it is urgent that we receive a reply.

European citizenship will, in my view, be the synthesis of all our common values, the European principles in which we believe and which we have set down in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">That is precisely why we are not aiming in the action plan at strengthening the arsenals of repression – that is to say, we want to avoid a merely repressive and punitive approach. Instead, we are attempting to strike a balance between the need for investigation – the need to identify the perpetrators of crimes, especially terrorists and members of organised criminal gangs – and the protection of individual rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">That means, for example, strengthening legal and procedural rights, and an initial proposal is already before Parliament. It is not enough, as it is just an initial proposal for discussion, but others will follow to reinforce the concept of protecting people’s privileges, freedoms and rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Of these, the topic of personal data protection is the one that stands out, of course, and we shall be giving it particular attention. In this respect, I recently had a meeting with the European Data Protection Supervisor. I assured him that it was my intention to consult him in advance before submitting proposals, precisely so as to ensure that the various concerns about personal data protection, including those of the so-called Article 29 Committee, could be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Such cooperation goes beyond the purely formal aspects, that is to say when the legal basis allows us to acknowledge him explicitly in the procedure, but extends to cases where we want to make sure in advance that the personal data protection rules are being observed. I have renewed an offer of informal collaboration with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">That applies to many areas. It applies to the dossier on the agreement signed with the United States during the last session – by the way, as I mentioned earlier, we are waiting for a decision from the Court of Justice before making our assessment. It certainly applies to the matter of their complying fully with the existing agreements with the European Union – I am referring to the specific incident that was mentioned today of a KLM flight that was not authorised to cross US airspace. I shall give an answer precisely about that incident in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The last subject to have been mentioned is immigration. The subject of immigration certainly has to be addressed as a whole: illegal immigration on the one hand, and Europe’s integration and legal immigration policy on the other. The honourable Member who spoke on this subject mentioned national competences. We all know that national competences only cover the number of people who can be allowed to enter a particular Member State, but there is a willingness among the Member States to agree on certain common rules, and that is the aim of the Green Paper that we issued in January.</p>
<p class="contents">Action by the European Union – rather than by individual countries – is therefore needed with regard to legal immigration as well, and not just illegal immigration. Of course, the number of immigrants to be allowed in is still left to the Member States’ discretion, and the Constitutional Treaty itself confirms this principle, as you all know.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the specific matter of the KLM flight, we have received some information which will be the subject of a written reply that will soon be arriving from the Commission, from Mrs Ferrero-Waldner’s office to be precise. As I have been asked, I can, however, reveal the gist of the information that we have received. It says that the passenger data for that flight had not been forwarded on a Passenger Name Record (PNR) basis – on which basis the Commission would have been able to intervene – but on the basis of a bilateral agreement between Mexico and the United States known as the APIS agreement. In such a case, therefore, the Commission cannot interfere in an agreement between the United States on the one hand and Mexico on the other, precisely because the PNR agreement was not invoked, on which basis we could, of course, have intervened. These are the initial points that I have been given, but the written reply will, of course, be much more detailed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that what he has told us reveals a number of good objectives, but all too often the means for achieving them are not the most appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">I refer in particular to the need to fight illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings. All too often the fight has been carried on by means of summary judgments and expulsions, at times violating the non-refoulement principle and even denying people the right to asylum. I am referring in particular to the fact that on 14 April this year Mr Frattini met the EU Home Affairs Ministers to strengthen cooperation with Libya for the purpose of fighting illegal immigration. I have personally witnessed the treatment to which illegal immigrants are subjected in Libya – including those who are sent back there from a European country – and I have witnessed blatant violations of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask whether the European Union intends to make use of such measures to fight illegal immigration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem is, Commissioner, that there is a gap between your personal good faith, which I recognise, not to undermine privacy and data protection – and, indeed, the good faith of the Commission that, in the search for security, you will not forego that – and the reality of what is happening on the ground. Your pledges are under great strain, not least from the culture in European law enforcement communities, which is, at times, somewhat cavalier about data protection. In the context of the implementation of the principle of availability, of interoperability, of databases, of transfers to third countries – which become transfers to fourth countries – I do not see how you are going to be able to hold the line, because it is not happening at the moment. We have been waiting for years for rules on data protection in the third pillar, which we were promised at the end of this year. What can you do to create a climate of truly reinforced respect for strict data protection observances in this context of a huge pressure to dilute it, as we have just heard with regard to the PNR case? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That report is available – it is certainly not secret – but precisely because of the issues and questions that arose during the meeting with the Home Affairs Ministers we decided to send a second technical mission to Libya to visit places where there are people who have been repatriated or are waiting to be able to come to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of this second mission are not yet available, but the mission has already completed its work and I shall be referring to it at the next Council of Home Affairs Ministers on 2 or 3 June – I do not remember exactly when. There I shall put forward practical measures which will certainly be based on the need to provide protection <span class="italic">in situ</span> – therefore in Libya as well – for the fundamental rights of people who have entered either legally or illegally and who in any case are entitled to be treated with dignity as human beings. Parliament will, of course, be kept informed on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding data protection, Baroness Ludford, you are well aware of the extent to which this subject is a constant concern of mine. One way to point out the right road is to say that personal data cannot be accessed except for the specific purposes for which access is permitted by law. We must not allow extensions by analogy: as it is permitted for certain purposes, we can extend it to other purposes too. That cannot be allowed.</p>
<p class="contents">If we start being specific about this and saying, for instance, that only certain authorities are allowed access to people’s private data and not others, we will be starting to set out some guidelines. I shall just give one example, of which you are aware: the Home Affairs Ministers have asked me to give the investigative authorities greater powers to access existing databases. My reply is that access rights may be extended if in parallel we increase protection for those data through a proposal under the third pillar, which, I assure you, we are going to submit by the end of this year. In my view, the answer is ‘we have to be clear’.</p>
<p class="contents">There are purposes that must be interpreted strictly, as lawyers say, so that if access to the data is allowed for one purpose, it cannot be allowed for another. That is the initial basis on which I have begun to work.</p>
<p class="contents">My final topic is the victims of crime: we shall also submit proposals for giving financial assistance, not directly to individual victims, but for instance to organisations and institutions concerned with providing care – including psychological care – for those escaping from violence or people trafficking or fleeing from traffickers. There are many forms of assistance, including practical assistance, for individuals who have been victims of crime; we cannot maintain individual financial relationships, but we can develop them through specific institutions and organisations. We shall concern ourselves precisely with alleviating the effects on those who have suffered the tragic consequences of crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
