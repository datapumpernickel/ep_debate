<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Casaca (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, thanks to the dedicated hard work of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and that of various individuals in the European institutions, it has finally been possible to put a stop to serious wrongdoing in the European statistics body, Eurostat. The audit carried out by the Commission’s internal audit service, and by Eurostat’s audit department, deserves our praise and was crucial in obtaining this result.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan presented by the committee, aimed at concentrating on the most important statistics, at reducing the amount of work outsourced by the institute and at making statistical data available to the public, addresses our main concerns. It also ensures that the motivation for such work is not purely commercial and increases transparency and responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall, however, carefully monitor how this plan is executed and how all the work carried out is revised and audited. Community institutions will be increasingly concerned with analysing and auditing the effectiveness and the simplification of procedures, the quality of work, and the relevance and value of the matters concerned. In any event, it is now obvious that the current process of reform of the Commission has not sufficiently clarified the relative responsibilities of the Directors-General and the Commissioners and has given no guarantees of respect for the golden rule of democracy: that accountability and ultimate responsibility rest with political office-holders.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerns have surfaced regarding the manner in which we have proceeded unchecked towards outsourcing a wide variety of EU administrative functions and in which more complexity has been introduced, due to the implementation of more bureaucratic rules, which are a long way from fulfilling the aims of public spending efficiency. These concerns are not, however, confined to Eurostat. It is clear that in most contracts awarded by Eurostat to third parties, other Commission departments or even interinstitutional bodies were also involved. There is particular consternation that, unlike Eurostat, nothing appears to have changed in the departments that monitor external help and that are responsible for authorising spending in some of the most contentious areas. The accounting system must be modernised and assurances must be given that the system is indeed capable of addressing the most glaring problems in managing and monitoring external contracts and Community money administered by third parties.</p>
<p class="contents">A further area in which progress appears to have been either very slow or non-existent is that of the common agricultural policy. The framework drawn up by the excellent special reports by the Court of Auditors regarding export refunds is a cause for concern. It is unacceptable that, on key points, the 2003 report does no more than repeat what was said in 1990 because absolutely nothing has changed in 13 years. It is unacceptable that the Commission has not yet implemented its policy of moving irresponsible employees in the area of export refunds, when this is an area in which urgent action is required. It is unacceptable that export refunds for sugar continue to be awarded to countries from which we import sugar that is duty-free. The Community budget demands transparency, yet the Commission still refuses to make public the list of payments made to commercial undertakings, particularly in this area of export refunds and surplus disposal mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">In a recent opinion poll, food product adulteration came top of the list of concerns among European citizens, both in the Europe of the 15 and the Europe of the 25. The Commission, however, continues to neglect its duties in this area. Community money finances extensive operations to count olive trees and evaluate their productive capacity, an activity that is neither worthwhile nor effective, while it neglects the fight against the adulteration of olive oil. The budget imposes heavy fines on farmers who produce more than their quota of milk, yet the Commission refuses to intervene when large European commercial undertakings sell, and receive EU subsidies for, surplus butter adulterated with lubricants and beef tallow.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to say a word about the challenges facing us. The Commission is preparing to propose an increase in the sums earmarked for research and development, an area which, as I have said, has been synonymous with red tape and inefficiency. If the mindset in this area does not change radically, if it does not streamline its underlying philosophy, if it persists with the unwieldy mechanisms it has used to date, the Commission will transform a good idea into bad policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should say that I can only take up your final comment for the next Financial Perspective in those areas where the regulations are actually to be revised.</p>
<p class="contents">This report has been prepared with the greatest care and was presented to this House on behalf of the committee. In the report, the rapporteur discusses all the key issues dealt with in the Commission's follow-up report – Eurostat in particular – and the necessary conclusions to be drawn from them. I would also particularly like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, for her great commitment as well as the rapporteur, Mrs Avilés Perea, and Mr Bösch and Mr Sörensen for their constructive contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">It was in 2001 that the Commission embarked on the implementation of the administrative reform measures. We have now successfully progressed a considerable distance along the reform road. However, along this road, we frequently encounter obstacles that require adjustments and improvements. In two weeks’ time, the Commission will present the next progress report on the reforms. In it, we will also provide detailed explanations of the measures announced by President Prodi last November. At the same time – that is, in two weeks’ time – we will also present proposals for the revision of the OLAF Regulation, which we have discussed here in the context of the Bösch report. In the coming week, the Commission will also adopt the progress report on the modernisation of the accounting system and improvements in the early-warning system. Last week, the Commission adopted a Eurostat action plan as the follow-up to the restructuring agreed last year; the rapporteur has mentioned the various measures arising in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has learned the lessons of experience, especially from the Eurostat affair. The grave irregularities occurred before this Commission’s term in office. The Prodi Commission has been criticised for failing to respond to this situation more swiftly, but, once it was fully informed – in July 2003 – about the seriousness of the situation, the Commission did take action, and we intend to implement President Prodi's Eurostat action plan. This applies especially to measures ensuring that in future, the Commission is informed more quickly about problems requiring political action.</p>
<p class="contents">The annual activity reports and the Directors-General’s statements form the cornerstones of a new and transparent system of internal control. For the third year of the activity reports, we have already agreed various further improvements concerning, for example, the timeframe as well as the more precise presentation of reasons and facts giving rise to concerns. We have agreed uniform norms for internal control and in future, the Central Financial Service of the Directorate-General for Budgets will provide information twice a year of the work undertaken by their internal-audit staff on the implementation of these norms.</p>
<p class="contents">The progress report which I have mentioned, and about which my fellow-Commissioner Mr Kinnock has already informed the Committee on Budgetary Control, reaffirms that all Commissioners must reassure themselves that the systems of internal control adopted and administered by the Director-General operate satisfactorily. It also states that the Commissioners must reassure themselves that audits are accompanied by appropriate follow-up measures. If this is not the case, the Commissioner must issue instructions so that improvements can be made. New financial regulations have also been in force for the last thirteen months, and these substantially reduce the risk of fraud, especially the new rules on the allocation of subsidies and allowances and the strict rules excluding conflicts of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards accounting, the new financial regulations have restructured the system. They charge the Commission’s accounting officer with the task of validating the systems used to produce accounting data. However, it is not his task to carry out central <span class="italic">ex ante</span> and <span class="italic">ex post</span> random checks, and nor does he have any staff available for this purpose. The authorising officers are responsible for this, and the Directors-General are responsible for ensuring that the control systems are established in line with the financial regulations and the sectoral rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Under Article 60 of the new financial regulations, authorising officers bear full responsibility for financial procedures. The Prodi Commission has thus implemented the recommendation set out in the second report by the independent experts, which was approved by this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Important lessons which the Commission has learned from the Eurostat affair concern the exchange of information and inter-service cooperation, for example, between the internal audit service, the internal audit capabilities, and the horizontal directorates-general, for it must be ensured that information about irregularities penetrates as far as political level and results in the adoption of immediate measures. This Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control has rightly placed the greatest emphasis on this aspect throughout the entire debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Eurostat affair made last year a very difficult time, and I think that applies to the Commission as much as to the work of the Committee on Budgetary Control. The President of the Commission made a very detailed statement on all aspects here in this House on two separate occasions, and then joint work was undertaken to develop the necessary conclusions and changes. Let me assure you that the Commission, which launched and implemented the administrative reform with great commitment, will be consistent in implementing the necessary additions to that reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only because of the document itself, but also for the preparatory work that went into it: finding a consensus, harmonising, exercising caution, and bringing all of this together in a report which, first and foremost, is complex. Complex because it is a follow-up report, in the strict sense of the term, while at the same time the subject matter is new and deals with something that shook us and which is now shaking public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight a few elements of this follow-up aspect, such as the eagerness to implement fully the internal control standards, to complete an audit of the Commission’s treasury system, to introduce the payment of interest accrued in the case of Community advance payments, to address the question of recovery payments and also subjects which were already common currency in the Committee on Budgetary Control: the reform of the accounting system, for example, or the common agricultural policy – which is mentioned specifically by the rapporteur – and, above all, in relation to export refunds and the prevention of fraud in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, as I said, this report marks a first: it is the first time the question of Eurostat has been dealt with in a report. We have been surprised by some of the questions which have come up in relation to this subject. Let me go through them. Firstly, the fact that the rules on exchanges of information, which have been in place since the beginning of this parliamentary term, have not been implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is surprising that there is no register of the owners of all the companies that have been awarded contracts and that apparently it would be virtually impossible to establish who is behind the companies participating in calls for tender issued by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">So now, at this late stage, we still have our doubts about the scale of the problem and who is responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, when we tried to contact certain sources, we encountered the incredibly valuable contribution of the auditors and the whistle-blowers, on the one hand, who filled the gaps in our knowledge about what had happened, and at the same time, we found a glaring lack of information from OLAF, which is what has led – as was stated in this House barely a month ago – to the call for regulatory reform. In particular, reform to prevent OLAF becoming a pretext for holding discussions about any given topic behind closed doors and reducing transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the measures which have been adopted, I think they are constructive and useful. For example, the decision to establish a mechanism for information flows between the auditors in each Directorate General and the internal Audit Service, the desire to establish and give structure to each Commissioner’s responsibilities, to protect whistle-blowers from potential reprisals and a review of the early warning system – also known as the blacklist – to prevent companies that have behaved fraudulently or inefficiently in relation to the Commission from receiving further contracts and subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, Mr President, this is an open report which also offers a link to the report on the approval of the financial management for 2002, which will provide an opportunity to evaluate some of the measures proposed in this report. It will also be the time when we will be able to plug certain gaps in our knowledge, which we hope will be filled in by OLAF. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We Social Democrats have repeatedly said, over these past months, that the priority for us – over and above the media’s one-day wonders such as calls for resignations – is the issue of how to bring about structural changes in the Commission and in relations between the Commission and OLAF. In my view, this position remains fundamental to our policies. Of course we can discuss the Commissioners’ individual political responsibility – I have no objection to that – but in light of all that we have learned from the Eurostat affair, we have to recognise first and foremost that we must put the Commissioners in a position to exercise this political responsibility in the first place. After all, what we encountered in this particular instance were hair-raising conditions as regards responsibilities, structures and information processes.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing I am pleased about, although I do not endorse it politically: I am pleased to see that it establishes clarity. Admittedly, there is the amendment proposed by the Liberals – I can assure Mr Mulder that I would be happy to talk about this – which, as it were, flies the flag for political responsibility. At the same time, however, I welcome the clarity with which the Liberals propose a deletion, namely of the very paragraph in the Casaca report which calls for the directorates-general to answer to the Commissioners at long last. That is a clear alternative. Structural changes are needed so that we do not face the problem, every five years, of which Commissioner we call upon to resign, while the apparatus is allowed to carry on blithely as before. That is not the alternative that we Social Democrats want to see, to put it bluntly.</p>
<p class="contents">That does not mean that all that glitters in the Commission is gold, however. Frankly, the opposite has generally been true. The things we have witnessed there: we have been presented, to great fanfare, with a proposal which now finally states in writing that the officials must inform the Commissioners about any landmines that might be lying around. Well, that is wonderful, I must say. I was under the impression that this was already standard administrative practice. If we have to put this in writing from the outset, what does that say about conditions in place? That is one thing that has absolutely astounded me – although perhaps I should not have been too surprised. I think we really have to say that there must be an end to the Commission always coming up with too little too late. We are fed up with it; Mr Bayona de Perogordo has already mentioned the 2002 discharge. By then, if you do not mind, you have to come up with the goods. As I have said before, if you fail to do so, we can look forward to some entertaining days together between now and the end of your term in office! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In contrast to the Committee of the Regions – the previous item on the agenda – we did grant the Commission discharge in April of last year. At that time, too, I was the spokesman for my group and was able to put our arguments forward. One of the arguments was that the Commission was on the right track to reform. We still believe that to be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Scarcely had the ink dried on that resolution when the Eurostat affair erupted. That was no small matter. Eurostat is not just any old branch of the Commission. It produces extremely important statistics on the Stability and Growth Pact, on the contributions of the Member States, and, if things are not going well there, how reliable are the statistics themselves? Thus, it was not for nothing that many people became very worked up over these revelations. We think that, on the whole, the Commission has shown vigour in righting the wrongs at Eurostat. A number of problem areas remain, however, and, indeed, several people have already alluded to these.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, how are we to deal with the role of OLAF? I always thought it strange to be told by the Secretary-General that OLAF had asked that we should keep things secret and not pass them on. I do not know many officials who are required to keep things of this nature secret for their political superiors; in not one administration does such a thing happen. Officials should keep their political superiors fully informed, and I think that that is clearly the lesson to be learnt from this affair.</p>
<p class="contents">What is essential as far as the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is concerned is political accountability. The fact that a Commissioner does not know something cannot mean that he or she is not politically accountable. We have sought to raise this point in an amendment to the resolution, on which, indeed, we shall be voting tomorrow, and we also think that, when the hearings of the new Commissioners are held shortly – although it will depend on the new Parliament – we will have to question them on this point. After all, as far as we are concerned, this affair has shown President Prodi’s words at the start of his term about the individual accountability of Commissioners to be not entirely satisfactory. We hope that this will be raised at the new hearings, as I have said, because we must be able to declare to the European political elite, in particular, that someone in Europe is accountable for something. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very possible that the decision would have been otherwise if we had known what we know today. There is no doubt that what took place that year were serious offences against the Financial Regulation: secret accounts, embezzlement and obvious conflicts of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Casaca’s report is not bad. It is critical, but what is missing is a conclusion. We think it fair that the Commissioner responsible for Eurostat should have taken the political consequences and resigned. In many ways, this scandal resembles those that caused the Santer Commission to resign. A systematic and organised misuse of EU funds has taken place, and there has been a failure to intervene in time. Mr Solbes Mira says that he was not informed until April 2003, but we all know that there had been many warning signs before that date in auditors’ reports and in the press, as well as warnings by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">When Mr Prodi began his term of office, he was very clear about political responsibility. The Commissioners were responsible for what happened within their Directorates-General. That proud watchword, issued at the beginning of the term of office, proved to have little substance when it came to the Eurostat affair. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must, however, emphasise that the picture that emerges from reading the report is altogether worrying. What emerges is the image of a European Commission shrouded in secrecy and a lack of transparency, which does not communicate with the other institutions; a stratified Commission with a bureaucratic complexity of functions, delegations and offices which is in fact manifested by a failure to shoulder administrative and political responsibility, both on the part of Director-Generals and the Commissioners. An example of this, as other Members have mentioned, would be the Eurostat affair for which no one has to date completely assumed responsibility. On the contrary, we have, on several occasions in recent months, seen attempts by the Commission to swiftly close the case, to settle it as if it were nothing, as if Parliament’s calls for clarity were in fact a real nuisance and as if the Commission were indeed a class of untouchables above everyone, MEPs and citizens included. It is also surprising that President Prodi, so diligent in ensuring that rules are strictly complied with – I am thinking, for example, about the recourse to the Court of Justice on the Ecofin decisions on the Stability and Growth Pact – dealt so lightly with such an abominable scandal such as the one involving Eurostat.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that, over and above the naïve and vague declarations of principle by the Commission – declarations that we have again heard this evening– we are waiting for a strong signal, a rigorous reform that will really change the system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The facts have now confirmed beyond any doubt that this was justified. Just weeks after the vote on discharge, information that the Commission had withheld on the Eurostat affair came to light.</p>
<p class="contents">The combination of a seriously flawed accounting system, an excessively slow process of administrative reform and insufficiently independent internal audits was the last straw. Like President Prodi, Commissioners Solbes Mira and Schreyer have demonstrated in both word and deed that they have not learnt sufficient lessons from the enforced resignation of their predecessors five years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Time and time again, the Commission seeks to talk Parliament round with fine words and promises and with hefty reports, with no visible results as regards its own internal reform.</p>
<p class="contents">It was not until the second half of 2003, when it could procrastinate no longer, that the Commission finally began to act. We can only conclude that this Commission cannot keep abreast of the facts in its budgetary management, and is not meeting its political responsibility. Finally, I should like to mention that we in this House owe a great deal to the brave Commission whistle-blowers Paul van Buitenen and Marta Andreasen. They have the right to see their names fully cleared.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not forgotten that there are many dedicated, upright officials working for the Commission. It is unfortunate, though, that they are being thwarted by an internal hierarchy that seeks to serve its own interests rather than those of Europe’s citizens.

They relate to openness, to the provision of prompt and comprehensive information from the Commission to Parliament and within the Commission itself, and to the assumption of responsibility by the Commissioners for abuses that have arisen. It seems that the shadow of the past is catching up with us. The rapporteur, Mr Casaca, has worked hard to produce this painstaking report. I would like to thank him in particular, as well as the committee as a whole for its outstanding work.</p>
<p class="contents">The main issue in this report is to investigate and address the improper practices in and around the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat), such as slush funds, cronyism, violations of the financial regulations, lax treatment of the mobility rules, and various other things. If the Commission had taken seriously Parliament’s warnings about Eurostat in its reports of February and March and investigated what was going on, and had informed Parliament accordingly, the discharge would have been postponed from April to October. This would not have been serious, but would have given the Commission enough time to adopt the measures that it is now trying to rush through with astonishing speed.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet again, the bottom line is that what we have is an information shortfall. What, too, about political responsibility? So far, not one Commissioner has admitted any responsibility. Admittedly, some errors have been acknowledged, but a clear admission has yet to come. That is regrettable, in my view. Claiming ignorance is no defence against responsibility. We are therefore pushing for this supposed ignorance to be removed by ensuring that the Commissioners finally close the yawning information gap between the officials, even to the highest ranks, and the Commissioners themselves. As early as 1999, the Commission equipped itself with rules on this issue. It is apparent that they still only exist on paper, unless what Commissioner Schreyer has just told us becomes reality. I would be delighted if that were to occur.</p>
<p class="contents">OLAF, too, cannot serve as an excuse for the Commission’s inaction. The duty to exercise proper and thorough supervision lies, after all, with the Commission. Are the internal audit reports produced by the directorates-general being disregarded and the valuable audits carried out by the internal audit service being ignored by the Commissioners? What also concerns us deeply is the way in which the whistleblowers have been treated. They have drawn attention to numerous abuses. The current rules do not guarantee them protection. Faced with all this harsh criticism, why has the committee not proposed the dismissal of the entire Commission or individual Commissioners? This is my response: it is of no benefit to Europe if the irregularities continue at Eurostat. They must be cleared up – and that means now, by this Commission. We want to support the action plan and cooperate so that there is no repetition of these incidents in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On this issue, Commissioner, you are disavowing your own President. As early as September last year, and again on 18 November, President Prodi announced to this House that he would submit an action plan before the year’s end. In December, we were fobbed off until January, and now it is the end of January and we are still waiting for the proposals which have been announced and which are primarily intended to achieve a rapid improvement in the OLAF Regulation. Yet the Commission knows perfectly well that this is a race against time, and I can tell the Commissioner that time is precisely what we do not have.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not possible to have two readings on 10 February. How do you see this working? Action is needed. This House has tabled appropriate proposals for your attention. I have the impression that it is the same old story in the Commission: Who is Commissioner, under which Director-General? I say this in all clarity. Yet the differences of opinion could be addressed relatively quickly. We need clear priorities for OLAF. It was your institution that said that OLAF had failed in the Eurostat affair. I say that in all clarity as well. We need priorities. We need a priority as regards protecting the subjects of the investigations, and I think we also need some amendments to the financial regulations. The responsibility of the authorising Directors-General is a case in point. It is right that the Directors-General should bear full responsibility for what happens in their directorate-general, but it is also true, especially in light of the Eurostat experience, that control is better than trust. You have not upheld this principle so far, and I think it is high time you did. I would remind you of that, Commissioner. Ultimately, that will be the key benchmark against which your work is measured at the end of this Prodi Commission’s term in office. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems, however, that most of those present are concerned about one subject in particular: the fraud uncovered in Eurostat just when we were finalising the discharge of the budget management for 2001, and therefore just when Mr Casaca’s report was being drafted. Unfortunately we did not pay much attention at the time, and it was only in the summer, July to be precise, that the Commission really registered the gravity of the matter in hand and began to react.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately the Commission did begin to react and to set in motion a series of internal reforms which were completely necessary and which seek to do away with a culture and approach which are outdated, inappropriate and have generated a great many problems. For example, we need to reduce external involvement, since this leads to even less control, and in turn to even lower reliability in terms of how contracts are concluded and in terms of the final outcome anticipated when they were put up for tender.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem which has become apparent in the Eurostat case is the very poor internal information system within the Commission. Information exchanged between different levels – namely between the Directorates-General and the Commissioners – is limited, and totally absent in some cases, although this Commission did establish a code of conduct in 1999, which it has not implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I presented a report which the rapporteur has incorporated more or less in its entirety, with a view to improving internal information flows within the Commission because, in my view, if internal information channels had worked properly, many of the problems could have been avoided and we would not have ended up in the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe the internal reform of the Commission needs to be reviewed. At the outset there was a great deal of enthusiasm for the reform, fully supported by Parliament, but it has proved a slow, difficult and sometimes inefficient process. This is why, Mr President, we have to conclude that the Eurostat revelations show that we need to seek a solution to this problem and also to other internal problems in the Commission, with a view to everything working better, which will benefit all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So I started off well, but then I suddenly had to slow up because I thought about the kinds of cases that have been in the papers recently – the Eurostat case obviously springs to mind. The problem there is that there <span class="italic">was</span> a scandal going on and it is difficult to rebut it. The Commission sat on the report, the General Audit Service did not open the box and look at the report and we have to ask why Mr Solbes did not keep a closer eye on his department.</p>
<p class="contents">I can rebut it by saying that the procedures for stopping this kind of thing were already in place, but the departments were overworked and there was no time for the system to work through. It was during the early days of the reform process. It is important, however, that we do not continue to allow the Directors-General to take all the responsibility. We have to see political responsibility by individual commissions. They have to shoulder this.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be worth people taking note of the outcome of the Hutton report today: we have seen the BBC found guilty of incompetence. It is interesting that it is not the Director-General of the BBC who has gone, but the Chairman of the BBC. It is the political head – not the administrative head. We should bear that in mind and think about what that means in this context. The accounting system has also, of course, come in for criticism and I could explain at this point that there are only two countries in the whole of the European Union that have implemented the kind of accrual accounting system that we want to see. This Parliament and the Court of Auditors, however, asked the Commission to get on with it. Of course, we must also look internally at the kinds of problems we have here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We are just about to enter an electoral campaign and many of us are enthusiastic about the whole European Union ideal, but we have to sell it in the face of a really difficult press, so you must help us to do more to counteract these allegations of fraud. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is firstly important to emphasise the excellent work that Mr Casaca has done as rapporteur, which deserves praise, as it will certainly leave a positive mark on the current legislative period. It also underlines the fact that Parliament is far from being a spent political force. Among the many areas that he could have examined, the rapporteur wisely chose to concentrate on the accounting system, the operations and monitoring of Eurostat and the implementation of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the accounting system and the implementation of the CAP, the situation has developed in a far from satisfactory manner. The Commission must therefore speed up the introduction of measures to standardise and streamline the accounting system and must pay special attention to monitoring financial flows relating to refunds, exports and management of stock.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Eurostat, given that most serious wrongdoings were committed prior to 1999, it is worrying that, in all probability, contraventions of financial regulations have continued beyond 1999. It falls to the Commission to learn the appropriate lessons from this, which do not end at financial irregularities, but in fact take on political dimensions that undermine the very workings of the institutions. While the report does not call for any kind of witch-hunt, which would be most unwelcome at the current stage of the European process, it does make it quite clear that Eurostat might not be the only case and, worse, might not be the most serious case detected in the Commission’s activities. I shall conclude, Mr President, by saying that we must not lose sight of the essence of the political message sent out by proving irregularities and that the rapporteur’s prudent, sensible and workable recommendations must be duly adopted, complied with and enforced.</p>
