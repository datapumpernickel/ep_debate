<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lisi (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this recommendation for second reading on the Council common position on the proposal to amend the ‘Seveso directive’ warrants a brief synopsis of its history. In the sensitive climate of the tragic accidents which have affected the chemical industry and, in particular, the communities living in the areas surrounding these sites, as well as the environment, the Commission presented to Parliament and the Council its proposal to amend Directive 96/82/EC of 9 December 1996, which lays down provisions, of course, on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances. The proposal had the merit of being based on very thorough scientific work and of providing a constructive analysis of this sensitive matter. At first reading, I and other Members explained why it is necessary for the European Parliament to send out a signal loud and clear. My aim – which I confirm today – is, as far as possible, to ensure that such accidents are never repeated, ensuring both the safety of the citizens and workers at these plants and, of course, environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has produced a common position which essentially takes into account many of Parliament’s concerns, but a number of grey areas still remain, and these are the following. Firstly, the inclusion of mining activities and land-fill sites, an issue on which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has decided to retable the amendments from first reading, in other words the inclusion in the scope of the directive of all types of preparation and processing of dangerous substances in these sites – not just chemical or thermal preparations, that is, as envisaged by the Commission. I would point out, moreover, that we are only talking about active plant. We are aware that the Commission has, just recently, launched a specific proposal for a directive on the management of waste from mining activities, the terms of which will, moreover, have to be decided together with the European Parliament at the appropriate time, but, until then, there is and will continue to be a gap in the law which, given the recent accidents which have alarmed public opinion, cannot be tolerated. However, I am not excluding the possibility that the progress of the new directive on mining activities through conciliation might make it easier to reach agreement on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question is that of staff training. Here too, taking the same line as the Commission this time, we have proposed specific training measures on managing emergencies for all staff, including the staff of sub-contracting firms. Indeed, it is appropriate to provide for adequate measures not just on the handling of dangerous substances but on managing emergencies too, in order to limit potential damage as far as possible and to guarantee workers’ safety fully. However, as rapporteur, I feel it is unnecessary to include the list of training measures in the notification provided for in Article 6 of the directive, which is why I would urge you to vote against Amendment No 3, as at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">The third question is that of urban development planning. In this area, the Council has already taken into consideration Parliament’s desire to lay the foundations for definition at European level of methodological criteria which are necessary to assess compatibility between the sites in question and the areas at risk, not least by means of Union funding. However, given the great diversity of rules, regional situations, competences and responsibilities which characterises this aspect of safety – situating plant in terms of urban development planning – I believe that we must, of necessity, invoke the principle of subsidiarity and leave it up to the Member States to decide on the minimum distances. That is why I have called for a split vote on Amendment No 6, and will only vote for the first part of the amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the map showing risk areas, the committee believes that the pictorial representation of areas adjacent to the establishments subject to accident risks would be an effective, easily comprehensible measure for all the citizens concerned, who are entitled to greater clarity in this regard. To this end, the rapporteur has incorporated the wording used by the European Commission in the amended proposal for a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has proposed once again that a distinction should be made between forms of potassium nitrate, with new thresholds, in order to avoid farmers who use a form of potassium nitrate which could not be classed as fuel, falling within the scope of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these are the main points. Clearly, we are on track for a conciliation procedure. Indeed, the Council was unable to reach agreement on a compromise package and it did not, if the truth be known, seem to me to be particularly interested in achieving such an agreement with Parliament. I remain confident, however, that, with a constructive debate, it will be possible to achieve a solution which ensures maximum safety in these plants. I would like to thank all the members of the Committee on the Environment and the staff of the European Commission, who have been particularly helpful and cooperative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. Mr President, first of all, a special thank you goes to the rapporteur, Mr Lisi, for his valuable work on this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, the Commission proposal under discussion seeks to broaden the scope of the Seveso II Directive in the light of the Baia Mare and Enschede accidents. Furthermore, it seeks to incorporate the recommendations of two studies, one dealing with carcinogens and the other with substances which are dangerous to the aquatic environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the Commission proposal did not originally contain measures related to the Toulouse accident, a number of amendments proposed by Parliament have been incorporated into the Commission’s amended proposal and subsequently into the Council’s common position. I would like to stress again that it was not the intention of the Commission to effect a major overhaul of the Seveso II Directive. I shall now comment on some of the proposed amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 9 to 11 on risk mapping and potassium nitrate were already accepted by the Commission during the first reading and consequently they figure in the Commission’s amended proposal. These were the only three amendments that were fully rejected by the Council when adopting its common position. The Commission continues to support these amendments and can furthermore accept Amendment No 8 related to training for emergencies.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to tell you that a proposal for a directive on the management of mining waste was adopted by the Commission on 2 June 2003. The measures in the proposal complement those outlined in the Seveso II Directive and include the establishment of a major accident prevention policy and a safety management system. These measures will apply to those waste management facilities that present an accident risk but will not be covered by the revised Seveso II Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, the Seveso II Directive should only apply to the most dangerous mining activities where chemical processes are involved and chemical substances are stored on site. The Seveso II Directive should not be transformed into either mining legislation or waste legislation. Therefore the Commission cannot agree to deleting the words ‘chemical and thermal’ as proposed in Amendments Nos 1 and 2.</p>
<p class="contents">We also reject Amendment No 12 which proposes making a reference to Council Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste, and Amendment No 13, which seems to suggest that there are gaps in the coverage of mining sites through the two proposals. In our opinion this is not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 3 and 4 would lead to requiring operators of Seveso lower-tier sites to include information on training measures in the notification and to inform the competent authority in the event of a modification of an installation, establishment or storage area. In our view this would introduce bureacratic burdens without improving safety. A notification should only provide certain minimum information. The issue of training is already appropriately addressed in the Directive; moreover, in the event of modifications, the reviews of the major accident prevention policy and the safety management system are important, not the notification.</p>
<p class="contents">I acknowledge Parliament’s strong wish to reinforce Article 12 of the Seveso II Directive. However, the Commission and the Council have already accepted related amendments presented in the first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 6 does not constitute an added value; on the contrary, there is no need for separate guidelines setting out a methodology on minimum safety distances, as it should be possible to derive these distances from the technical database that will be created as a tool to help assess the compatibility between Seveso sites and sensitive sites.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission continues to be of the opinion that a development of incentive schemes and/or funding for the relocation of establishments is a task for Member States – this is subsidiarity. The Commission cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 7.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, let me confirm the Commission’s position on all amendments. The Commission accepts Amendments Nos 8 to 11. Amendments Nos 1 to 7 and Amendments Nos 12 and 13 are not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that it is in our common interest to have this proposal adopted and implemented as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has just been said, tomorrow Parliament will have to vote on this report’s second reading and, as with other reports, we here are of course divided between the wish to take negotiations with the Council and Commission as far as possible and the desire to get this text finalised quickly so it can be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the first reading, the Council incorporated a large number of amendments adopted by Members, but also rejected several proposals. A few weeks ago, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy adopted by a very large majority a text which confirms the requirements to which we will have to submit if we want to make progress on prevention. On these questions, the European Union must show its unity and its willingness to improve the legislation in force in answer to the legitimate concerns of the European citizens. It is also an opportunity for us to give some meaning to this European construction which is often accused of devoting more time to drawing up product standards than to the Europeans’ well-being, let alone their health.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore glad that the Committee on the Environment has adopted the amendments concerning obligations to notify the competent authorities, because we need to be very demanding in this area without, Commissioner, being bureaucratic: there is no reason why we cannot simplify the documents. The amendments concerning training for all staff, including staff of subcontractors, seem to me to be essential, because it has been evident from several accidents that a lack of training and of information was involved.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of safety distances between establishments and sensitive areas, the terrible accident in Toulouse showed the weaknesses in the relevant legislation and we must include these things in our report, just as we must in future extend the mapping of sensitive areas.</p>
<p class="contents">One point presents a problem and seems to be meeting with stiff opposition from the Council and the Commission, as you have just said, Commissioner; it is the question of extending the scope to all mining and waste processing activities using dangerous substances. The Council and the Commission want to restrict the scope of the Seveso II Directive to the chemical and thermal processing of waste only; they justify this position by the fact that in its proposal concerning mining waste the Commission refers, in Article 6 on the prevention of major accidents, to the provisions of the amended Seveso II Directive. However, if we want to avoid a legal void concerning certain mining activities and certain methods of processing mining waste until this new legislative proposal is adopted, the European Parliament must vote in favour of Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 13 without prejudice to the scope of the future report and with no talk of redundancies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like Parliament to adopt the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, thus strengthening on-site prevention and the safety of European citizens. Like the Council, we want to reach an agreement in this stage of the legislative procedure but, I hope you understand, not at any price. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to thank Mr Lisi for his sterling work. I nonetheless entirely agree with the rapporteur that the Seveso II Directive should contain those points not approved by the Council and the Commission, partly because of the need to avoid grey areas and partly because it would make for better opportunities to remedy the shortcomings in the existing legislation. For example, all forms of mining should be incorporated, and there must be more training of staff and more information about the areas of risk that exist. Moreover, potassium nitrate should also be incorporated. That is not something in conflict with the objectives of the directive. Nor is it a question of completely changing this proposal for a directive but, instead, of tackling the problems we have seen in connection with the serious accidents that have taken place in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish above all to put the case for Amendment No 13 concerning a new recital 3a, explaining why we believe it to be particularly important for Amendments Nos 1 and 2 to be incorporated. The proposal put forward by the Commission concerning the Mining Waste Directive and published, if I remember rightly, on 2 June concentrates more upon the management of waste. In my view, it does not, however, extend to include, for example, hazardous substances produced in mining. If it is now to be possible to limit the consequences of serious accidents, I believe it is necessary for these hazardous substances actually to be included. They therefore belong in the Seveso Directive and not in the usual place for dealing with waste management. That is why I support, above all, Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 13, but also other amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We still have not succeeded in laying down an amended directive. This amendment is essential in order, as far as possible, to prevent the same accidents from happening again. We should not therefore wait any longer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council and European Commission are apparently of the opinion that Parliament tabled too many amendments at first reading. Parliament's proposals have not been adopted because they are said to fall outside the scope of this directive. According to the Council, since it would be too time-consuming to look at these proposals in detail, it dismissed them for the sake of convenience. It is, for example, beyond me why the Council refuses to accept the addition of potassium nitrate.</p>
<p class="contents">The adapted legislation will undoubtedly reduce the risk of accidents, but there will always be risks. In the unlikely event of a calamity, it is imperative to keep the consequences to an absolute minimum. It remains therefore of continued importance for minimum distances between hazardous installations and residential areas to be examined carefully. Of course, I appreciate that the implementation of this is not equally simple for every Member State. In the final analysis, the economic interests have to be weighed up against public safety. Safety should assume an important place.</p>
<p class="contents">I subscribe to the importance of well-trained staff, so that preventive and emergency measures can be taken as effectively as possible. In addition, I would like to point out that the enforcement of this legislation by central and local governments is essential. This also means providing the public with sound information. Clear danger maps, which identify the special risks to residents, constitute a sound addition to this legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council should also be able to subscribe to the above. I would therefore take this opportunity of calling on the Council, and hence the European Commission, and the Commissioner in particular, to adopt Parliament's amendments, thus enabling us to lay down revised legislation immediately without having to go through an extended conciliation procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has been thorough and consistent and has applied himself. We have moved a considerable step forward since this Directive was last considered for amendment in this House in Strasbourg in 1994 – I know because I was there.</p>
<p class="contents">Events in Toulouse and in Enschede have demonstrated the need for action to amend and reinforce the existing Directive, so as to avoid any possibility of accidents and to minimise damage should an accident occur.</p>
<p class="contents">A future directive on pipeline safety and a proposal with regard to tunnel safety will also be very welcome because they respond to promises made during the last reading in 1994 and also to events, some of them very tragic, that have occurred consequently in other parts of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position is, in fact, quite a significant step forward but it does not deal with all the problems. There are still issues that remain unaddressed – issues that are quite clear and evident to us because of events that have taken place in the recent past. Everywhere else we have responded. We responded to Enschede and Toulouse with this Directive. We have responded with directives to events that have caused us to be concerned about tunnel safety and pipeline safety. We are going to miss the chance to respond properly and completely unless we amend this common position to cover other events that have taken place in recent times within and outside the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The events of Baia Mare in Romania and Doñana in Spain demonstrate the need to take action with regard to mining safety and mining waste safety. Until we see the mining waste directive we cannot relent on amendments that we have previously passed in this committee and in this Parliament to ensure that action is taken with regard to those dangerous substances and activities, not necessarily utilising dangerous substances that clearly need regulation. Put them in the mining waste directive, Commission, and we will relent on the amendments. That is a reasonable remark.</p>
<p class="contents">Other issues have still to be addressed. In 1994 we argued very strongly the case to have some kind of discussions on distance. We still do not have a solution on that and that is why we maintain the amendments and insist they are placed in the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on safety reports and some of the technical issues, I would ask the Commission to think again. They are produced and directed at you in the light of our own experiences. Please act on them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nearly a year ago, I remarked in this House that we are locking the stable door after the horse has bolted. This was an appeal to the Council to ensure that we use the revision of the directive as an opportunity to plug existing holes, so that accidents of the kind that took place in Baia Mare, Toulouse and Enschede can be prevented in future.</p>
<p class="contents">In Enschede, it transpired that current Seveso legislation is insufficient. A fireworks factory which did not fall within the scope of the directive destroyed an entire housing estate. Human suffering was huge, and the grieving for the victims continues. Residents of this housing estate were not aware of the presence of the fireworks factory. Authorities were only aware up to a point. It is therefore logical to tighten up the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Of particular importance, in my view, is the drafting of a method for establishing minimum distances. The European Commission should set up guidelines for this purpose, because it is about time we knew exactly what a safe distance is. A safe distance in the Netherlands is considered 25 metres, in France 500 metres and in Germany as many as 1 000 metres. An objective method for establishing the safe distance is important for those living nearby but, above all, also for the local politicians. Hazardous factories do not belong in housing estates. An active policy should be adopted in order to remove them from those estates, if possible with the help of European funding. In addition, it is important for maps to be drawn up which indicate the areas in the vicinity of an establishment that could be affected after a major accident. Every citizen is entitled to this information.</p>
<p class="contents">Tightening up the rules is one thing, observing them and being accountable is another. We can lay down rules <span class="italic">ad infinitum</span>, but if they are not implemented in municipal practice, they will have little effect in the end. If nobody feels responsible, if organisations each work in a vacuum, legislation remains a paper exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">Safety is not only a matter of rules, but also of culture. It is a public task to actively promote this culture. Where safety is concerned, we should not cut any corners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
