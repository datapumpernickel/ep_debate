<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 September II part-session of the European Parliament in Brussels.</p>
<p>It is a highly technical question. That must not, however, overshadow the political aspect of the problem you raise. It concerns the working time of carers.</p>
<p>Two cases must be distinguished:</p>
<p>First, the case of carers with an employment contract: the common position the Council adopted on 15 September 2008 (following the Council’s agreement of 9 June) has just been forwarded to Parliament for second reading. It provides that the period when a carer is not actively working cannot be regarded as working time or included in the calculation of daily and weekly rest periods unless otherwise provided by national legislation, a collective agreement or an agreement between social partners.</p>
<p>As for compensatory rest periods, the Council acts on the general principle that workers should be granted compensatory rest periods in cases where they cannot take normal rest periods. In this context it is up to Member States to decide what is a reasonable period of time after which workers are granted equivalent compensatory rest periods.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the case of ‘informal carers’, i.e. voluntary workers who do not have an employment contract and do not receive pay. Their situation is not covered by European law. The political agreement the Council reached on 9 June 2008 did not amend European law. That means that the provisions on working time and on compensatory rest do not apply in the case of such carers. The French Presidency confirms that it is committed to working closely and constructively with the European Parliament in order to reach an agreement as soon as possible on this important directive.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0647"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 September II part-session of the European Parliament in Brussels.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the situation in Kosovo is now calm and stable. Over the seven months since the declaration of independence, the worst scenarios have been avoided and, at the end of a difficult initial period, the overall situation has taken a better turn than expected.</p>
<p>To a large extent, it has hitherto proved possible to avoid inter-ethnic incidents, which risk triggering an escalation in the current political climate, even if some clashes have occurred in Suvi Do, a region with an Albanian ethnic majority, north of the river Ibar, near the town of Mitrovica, as well as recently, on 27 and 28 August, in Kosovska Mitrovica.</p>
<p>On the ground, much still remains to be done in the political field, however. The Kosovar authorities, who have adopted a large part of the necessary legislation in accordance with the overall regulatory plan, must redouble their efforts to honour the undertakings they gave to the international community.</p>
<p>The situation in the north remains difficult. A number of serious incidents occurred in August, but MINUK managed to deal with them successfully and prevent the situation from getting out of hand.</p>
<p>These incidents show, however, that feelings still run high in northern Kosovo, and the international community must keep a close watch on the situation and stay in contact with Belgrade and the Serb rulers of Kosovo.</p>
<p>In the north, the rule of law remains very fragile and the deployment of the EULEX mission in that region will considerably improve the situation on the ground.</p>
<p>Given that the economic outlook is rather sombre and GDP per capita remains the lowest in Europe, the conference of donors organised by the Commission in Brussels on 11 July 2008 was of crucial importance to the stability of Kosovo.

<p>Following the adoption, in June 2005, of two regulations amending the preventive and dissuasive provisions on fiscal rules in the stability and growth pact, together with a new code of conduct for its implementation, the Council declared itself satisfied with the way the revised pact worked. The purpose of the revisions resulting from the changes to the legal framework of the pact was to adjust the fiscal rules to EU Member States’ economic requirements, taking account of the divergences in their situations and of the economic fluctuations from one period to another.</p>
<p>On 11 July 2006, the Council adopted conclusions on the functioning of the fiscal rules of the revised pact on its first anniversary. It noted that: ‘Overall the first year’s experience with the revised SGP can be judged as positive.’</p>
<p>On 3 June 2008, the Council took note of the presentation by the Commission of a communication entitled ‘EMU@10 – successes and challenges after ten years of Economic and Monetary Union’. When presenting it, the Commission confirmed that it did not envisage proposing any modification to the GSP fiscal rules.</p>
<p>The Council will be discussing that communication at its meeting of 7 October this year.</p>
<p>It should be noted that, at their informal meeting in Nice on 12 and 13 September, the Economics and Finance Ministers and the governors of the central banks supported the presidency’s proposal to give a coordinated response to the economic situation in Europe. In budgetary matters in particular, States could allow the automatic stabilisers to play their part in order to support economic activity, without abandoning the attempt to control expenditure and observe the 3% deficit limit.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0652"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 September II part-session of the European Parliament in Brussels.</p>
<p>We are following developments in the situation in Turkey very carefully. I should like to point out that the general position of the European Union on respect for the fundamental principles of democracy and human rights is perfectly clear. As a candidate state, Turkey must meet the Copenhagen political criteria, in particular the stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, respect for the rule of law and human rights.</p>
<p>The Union attaches considerable importance to those issues, which are also part of the reform process under way in Turkey. As the Council reaffirmed in its conclusions of 10 December 2007, the pace of the negotiations depends notably on the progress made by Turkey in addressing opening and closing benchmarks and the conditions laid down in the negotiations, including implementation of the Accession Partnership. Under the terms of the partnership, Turkey must continue the reform process and endeavour to improve the situation further as regards respect for the principles of freedom, democracy and the rule of law, for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p>On behalf of the EU, the Presidency, taking due note of the decision, in particular invited all those involved to resolve their differences in a spirit of dialogue and compromise, while respecting the rule of law and fundamental freedoms. The Presidency also stated in that declaration that the European Union, which was attentive to the democratic functioning of institutions, would continue to watch the situation in Turkey carefully.</p>
<p>The Council welcomes the fact that the Turkish Government, reaffirming the commitments already made to that effect, has indicated that it intended to continue the reform process and address the existing shortcomings and expresses the hope that those commitments will quickly be translated into effective concrete measures. The long-awaited reforms, particularly in the key areas of freedom of expression and religion, are matters on which Turkey must move ahead without delay. As the Council noted in its conclusions of 10 December 2007, significant further efforts are also needed in other areas such as judicial reform, the fight against corruption, minority rights and the strengthening of cultural rights, women's rights, children's rights, trade union rights, and the civilian control of the military. Those issues are also regularly discussed in the political dialogue with Turkey, most recently at the Ministerial Troika in Brussels on 15 September.</p>
<p>In the light of the above, the Council can assure the honourable Member that the European Union will continue to monitor the situation in Turkey closely and that the Council will continue to raise these issues at all levels, wherever appropriate.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0656"></a>

<p>The European Union attaches the utmost importance to its strategic partnership with India. We can appreciate how much progress has been made when we look back at the last eight years, since the first EU-India Summit in Lisbon.</p>
<p>– Relations between the EU and India have changed more or less completely. In particular, we have made substantial progress since the adoption of our Joint Action Plan in 2005, which helped extend the EU-India dialogue to new areas and increase contacts between experts.</p>
<p>– The EU-India dialogue on security provides for regular consultations on security matters at world and regional level in order to improve mutual understanding and identify possible areas of cooperation. The talks on Afghanistan are part of those consultations and it is one of the spheres in which the EU considers India an essential participant.</p>
<p>– As indicated in the 2003 European Security Strategy: 'in particular we should look to develop strategic partnerships with Japan, China, Canada and India, as well as with those who share our goals and values and are prepared to act in their support'.</p>
<p>– In their joint statement after the 2007 EU-India Summit, the two parties expressed their strong support for a sovereign, democratic and pluralistic Afghanistan. They reaffirmed their sustained commitment to assist the Afghan Government in the stabilisation and rebuilding of the country, working within the framework of the Afghanistan Compact.</p>
<p>– They welcomed Afghanistan joining the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) as its eighth member at the 14th Summit held in Delhi in April 2007, and the Second Regional Economic Cooperation Conference held in New Delhi in November 2006. They noted that, although much had been achieved in recent years, formidable challenges still lay ahead.</p>
<p>– In that regard, the parties expressed concern over the security situation in Afghanistan due to the growth in terrorism and drug-related activities, and the danger those developments posed for the stability of Afghanistan and the region. They reiterated that coherent and united international commitment remained of paramount importance and agreed to continue cooperating and coordinating their efforts to impart greater strength to that process.</p>
<p>– Conscious of the important contribution India is making to regional stability in the south of Asia and appreciating its constructive and recognised role in Afghanistan, the Council pays close attention to any signals from India that it wishes to strengthen its relations with the European Union, including those in the field of foreign and security policy. As it has indicated numerous times in its frequent contacts with India, the European Union is ready to establish closer relations, for instance in the CFSP, and on Afghanistan.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0662"></a>

<p>In its communication of January 2008, presenting the second strategic review of better legislation in the European Union<a href="#defann_9_3" name="refann_9_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the Commission stated that, in the review of the Common Approach to Impact Assessment, it expected a commitment to conducting impact assessments on Member State initiatives in the area of Title VI of the EU Treaty.</p>
<p>At the moment there is no obligation on Member States taking such initiatives to present to the Council and other institutions the impact assessments they might have made when planning the initiatives.</p>
<p>The current review of the common approach to impact assessment will need to consider whether the impact assessments of Member States' initiatives should be carried out by the Member State or States concerned or by the institutions and, in that case, by which of them.</p>
<p>The Council points out that, in accordance with Article 6 of the EU Treaty, the institutions of the Union are required to respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, when exercising powers conferred on them by the Treaties, whether or not those powers are being exercised on the initiative of a Member State.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In recent years, with the steady growth of the use of mobile telephones, their standards have been changing all the time (even between models of one and the same brand). This needlessly increases the spending on accessories.</p>
<p>The main reason for this anomaly is the lack of a uniform standard for entry plug connectors of the various peripherals (chargers, headsets, transmission cables), which would be universally valid for all GSM handset brands. Needless to say, the monopolisation of peripherals impairs competition, which in turn holds back quality and inflates prices.</p>
<p>Standardisation of peripherals (say, to USB format), would reduce costs and would facilitate the mobile telecommunication service, enhance consumer protection and competition, increase the demand for mobile services, reduce waste of electrical and electronic equipment, and save energy, materials, and resources.</p>

<p>A small carpentry firm in Lower Austria has for decades had a reputation for outstanding quality. Because of an EU regulation, the firm can only go on making doors if it has a specimen certified. This currently applies only to exterior doors but will soon affect interior doors as well. A certificate costs around € 10 000 and applies to only one design. A customer who buys a door for which there is no such certificate will have a deficiency claim which, according to the product liability law, lapses only after 30 years. Since the organisation of the firm means that it produces just a small number of exterior doors which are mainly made to order (particularly for restoring old buildings), this kind of certification is not financially viable, and it cannot afford to offer a wider range of designs (cannot afford the certificates). The same is likely to happen in the case of interior doors when the legislation becomes applicable to them. SMEs, which survive precisely because of their individuality and the special nature of what they produce, are thus being forced out of the market.</p>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 September II part-session of the European Parliament in Brussels.</p>
<p>In answer to the question from Mr Rübig, the French Presidency must first explain that, under the current Community rules, namely Directive 89/106/EEC as amended<a href="#defann_12_1" name="refann_12_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, construction products must conform to the harmonised European standards, where such standards exist. That means that the producer must draw up a declaration of performance before placing a particular product on the market, which certainly incurs costs, but also provides access to the internal market comprised of the twenty-seven Member States of the European Union and the three EFTA Member States, which are party to the EEA Agreement.</p>
<p>Mr Rübig must certainly be aware that Parliament and the Council are currently considering a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products<a href="#defann_12_2" name="refann_12_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. That regulation will replace Directive 89/106/EEC. According to Article 4 of the proposal, local, regional or national authorities will possibly not lay down requirements for the essential characteristics of a product, even when harmonised standards exist. In such cases, that means that the manufacturer, whether it is a small, medium-sized or large undertaking, is not required to draw up a declaration of performance. The competent authorities may therefore not impose conditions for the placing of a product on a specific market. That would not create any problems for cross-border trade, since manufacturers wishing to sell in another area, in which the authorities have set conditions, have to draw up a declaration of performance in any event.</p>
<p>It will then be for the European Parliament and the Council to support the solution proposed by the Commission for resolving problems of the type that Mr Rübig describes, or to agree on another system.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In the case of Georgia, in 2007 the Commission arranged for an independent study of the feasibility and economic impact of a free trade agreement, the results of which were published in May 2008. The conclusion of the study was that such an agreement would be worthwhile in the case of Georgia only if it were to be a full and comprehensive agreement. Since Georgia already benefits from the GSP+ scheme, which gives it important advantages, a free trade agreement would not have a great deal of added value. The study also showed that Georgia is not at present able to meet the necessary conditions for the conclusion of a full and comprehensive free trade agreement, in view of its limited capacity to implement the necessary reforms.</p>
<p>It is obvious that, after the events in August, Georgia needs extra support from the European Union. The European Union is prepared to respond to that situation not only by assisting the rebuilding of the country but also by strengthening its relations with Georgia, in the field of economic cooperation amongst others. In its conclusions of 1 September, the European Council expressed the commitment of the European Union to establish closer relations with Georgia 'including visa facilitation and the possible establishment of a full and comprehensive free trade area as soon as the conditions are met'<a href="#defann_13_1" name="refann_13_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The General Affairs and External Relations Council on 15 and 16 September adopted conclusions on Georgia and welcomed 'the Commission's commitment regarding the strengthening of the EU-Georgia relationship, in particular by expediting the preparatory work on the facilitation of visas and on readmission, as well as on free trade'<a href="#defann_13_2" name="refann_13_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Council will continue working towards that aim, with a view to exploring the possibility of progress on a full and comprehensive agreement with Georgia, particularly in order to establish whether technical or other assistance might help Georgia meet the necessary conditions for such an agreement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>President Sarkozy has declared in a number of statements that he would like to see Morocco given special status, thereby giving the country access to certain EU bodies and a more privileged status than it has under currently applicable association agreements. The President has also stated that he considers that Morocco should remain one of the countries which receives most aid from the EU. I have previously criticised the EU's aid policy as far too indulgent towards dictatorships and that criticism also applies in this case. Western Sahara has featured on the UN's list of countries which should be decolonised since 1966 but every attempt to give the Western Saharans the opportunity to determine their own fate in a referendum has been sabotaged by Morocco. The royal family's power over parliament is so great that Morocco's form of government can at best be described as a sham democracy.</p>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 September II part-session of the European Parliament in Brussels.</p>
<p>Morocco has taken a strategic decision to establish closer relations with the European Union. The European Union and Morocco have started a process of building an increasingly close partnership in a number of fields. The partnership comes within the general framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Association Agreement between the European Union and Morocco.</p>
<p>The partnership with Morocco is also based on commitment to certain common values. Relations between the EU and Morocco are founded on respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms. Furthermore, Morocco has agreed to a human rights subcommittee being set up in its political dialogue with the EU. Those values were confirmed by the EU-Morocco Action Plan of the European Neighbourhood Policy in 2005. Morocco is also a vital partner in the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean. It has played a very positive and constructive role from the outset. We are counting on it to back the initiative started at the Paris Summit for the Mediterranean on 13 July, in regard to the definition of an institutional structure for the partnership and of concrete and visible projects on a regional scale.</p>
<p>The related problems, such as the situation in Western Sahara and its consequences, are at the forefront of all meetings held in the bilateral political dialogue. The Council fully supports the Manhasset negotiations and the process initiated last year by Security Council resolutions 1754 and 1783. The Council also fully supports the last Security Council resolution, 1813, adopted unanimously on 30 April 2008, which called upon the parties to show realism and a spirit of compromise and to open substantive negotiations.</p>
<p>The Council takes the view that it is important that the negotiations, under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, should be able to achieve a just, lasting and mutually acceptable solution under the United Nations resolutions. At the same time, the Council believes that the parties should enter into a more substantive negotiating phase and show restraint, good faith, realism, commitment and a spirit of compromise.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0688"></a>

<p>Although the Council has not discussed the matter, I would point out that the ISAF is in Afghanistan under a United Nations Security Council mandate and at the request of the Afghan authorities, to provide assistance with stability and security until such time as the Afghans themselves can take over responsibility for the security of their country. The Nato force is there for the security and freedom of the Afghans.</p>
<p>Most of the EU countries, 25 of the 27 Member States, have chosen to participate in the ISAF. Their contribution to the force accounts for nearly half its total manpower.</p>
<p>The European Union is a major actor in the reconstruction in Afghanistan in every field, through massive reconstruction aid and an ESDP police reform mission (EUPOL Afghanistan). The European countries share the aims that the countries contributing to the ISAF adopted at the NATO Summit in Bucharest last April in the presence of President Karzai, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Secretary-General of the Council and the President of the European Commission.</p>
<p>All possible steps must be taken to ensure that action by the international force does not claim innocent victims in the civilian population, at risk of casting doubt on the sense of the international action.</p>

<p>In 2007, at the initiative of the Commissioner responsible for multilingualism, Leonard Orban, a group of intellectuals (writers, experts, philosophers) was brought together with a view to ascertaining how multilingualism can strengthen Europe. In its conclusions, the group emphasised the need to strengthen bilateral language-to-language relations and proposed that countries with linguistic and cultural ties be ‘paired’. The ‘paired’ countries would have the objective of creating bilateral organisations (associations, funds, institutions, committees) that would strengthen bilateral understanding, provide language teaching services, set up bilateral exchanges and bring together academics, artists, civil servants, translators, businesspeople and active citizens from both countries. Integrating such organisations into networks would improve understanding within the Union and promote the unique nature of each country.</p>

<p>The group of intellectuals referred to in the question from the honourable Member was set up in 2007 to advise the European Commission on how languages could contribute to intercultural dialogue and mutual understanding. It presented its report, A Rewarding Challenge, at the special ministerial conference on multilingualism on 15 February 2008. However, it should be noted that, although the report made a useful contribution to the discussions at the conference, Ministers did not draw any formal conclusions from the report itself or from the specific initiatives it proposed.</p>
<p>It should, nonetheless, be added that the report by the group has proved useful in a different way since then. Apart from having served as a basis for the ministerial discussions at the conference, it was one of the factors taken into account by the Slovenian Presidency at the beginning of the year when it drew up the Council conclusions on multilingualism, which were adopted in May 2008. Similarly, the conclusions of the report will most probably have been one of the considerations for the Commission when it drew up its last communication on multilingualism in September 2008. Lastly, the French Presidency also used the report as a basis for the 'Etats généraux du multilinguisme' conference held in Paris on 26 September 2008, and in the preparation of the Council resolution on multilingualism, which it hopes to have adopted in November 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0697"></a>

<p>It is estimated that currently approx. 50 terawatt hour (TWh) of electricity, an amount approx corresponding to the electricity consumption of Portugal, are consumed per year in EU-27 by standby and off mode of electrical and electronic household and office equipment. This corresponds to 20 Mt CO2 emissions per year.</p>
<p>The technical, environmental and economic preparatory study<a href="#defann_21_1" name="refann_21_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> for a standby and off mode ecodesign measure has shown that technical solutions exist which could lead to a significant reduction of power consumption. At the same time, it will reduce costs for the consumer/user when both purchasing and operating costs are considered. The draft regulation on standby and off mode (implementing the "Ecodesign Directive" 2005/32/EC) was endorsed by the Member States on 7 July 2008. It sets demanding maximally allowed power consumption levels, which are expected to save almost 75% of the standby/off mode electricity consumption in 2020 in the Community. It will thus reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 14 Mt CO2 per year.</p>
<p>The proposed Regulation foresees maximally allowed power consumption levels for standby/off mode which come into force in two stages. The levels of the second stage are close to what can be achieved with best technology. Therefore further activities as e.g. awareness-raising targeted at standby/off mode would provide limited additional energy savings, and no such activities are planned for the moment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The "High Level Group on Nuclear Safety and Waste Management" (HLG) focuses on identifying safety issues for priority handling and recommending actions to be taken at EU level. Its mandate is to assist the EU institutions in progressively developing common understanding and eventually additional European rules in the fields of the safety of nuclear installations and the safety of the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste.</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission emphasises that the promotion of the highest safety standards and the safe management of radioactive waste represent its main priorities for the use and development of nuclear energy throughout the EU.</p>
<p>In the absence of any legally binding instrument on the management of financial resources earmarked for decommissioning and waste management, the Commission is assessing Member States' practices in the light of the Commission Recommendation on the management of financial resources for the decommissioning of nuclear installations, spent fuel and radioactive waste<a href="#defann_22_1" name="refann_22_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Commission is further elaborating this recommendation with the support of a Decommissioning Funding Expert Group in order to achieve a common interpretation which will then allow addressing the area of concern and progress towards full compliance with the recommendation. The results will be presented in the 3<span class="sup">rd</span> Report from the Commission to Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p>The UK report underlines that costs associated with decommissioning of Nuclear Power Plants are undeniably significant with nuclear waste processing and storage being important contributors. An appropriate long term framework concerning waste processing and storage can only improve the long term cost situation and could help to reduce these costs. Current estimates seem to be inflated due to uncertainty and risk linked to the absence of stable and long term national provisions. With time and increased technical experience of decommissioning of Nuclear Power Plants, it is to be expected that the real costs of decommissioning will decrease.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently involved in a dialogue with Member States to identify best practices in financial planning for decommissioning of Nuclear Power Plants, with a view to encouraging all Member States to plan to have the necessary funds in place for the time when the decommissioning of a NPP should take place.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission does consider oil as a strategic resource and is therefore following policies aimed at ensuring reliable and affordable supplies of oil and petroleum products for European consumers. Besides measures enhancing transparency and functioning of European oil markets, the Commission also vigorously follows implementation of Council Directive 2006/67 /EC<a href="#defann_23_1" name="refann_23_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>imposing an obligation on Member States to maintain minimum stocks of crude oil and/or petroleum products for use at times of disruptions of supply.</p>
<p>Prices at which oil and petroleum products are traded are formed in a global market on the basis of various factors. While the integrity of supplies and good functioning of the markets can be underpinned by regulatory measures, the public sector, and the Commission in particular, are not in the position to replace market mechanisms. The Commission can however implement policies which may aim at influencing oil prices indirectly; the Commission is fully availing itself of this opportunity and consistently takes initiatives e.g. in support of alternative fuels, promotion of energy efficiency, etc.</p>
<p>The available evidence suggests that supply and demand have been the main drivers of oil price, and are set to underpin high prices in the future. The possible role of speculation has come under scrutiny. So far the evidence is highly uncertain. Further analytical work is clearly needed to better understand what possible role speculation can have as a driver of rising prices. In any case, more transparency in the oil market, both on contracts and related financial instruments and on fundamentals would be welcome.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission proposals of November 2007 on Telecom package<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> contain elements which reflect the importance of intellectual property rights for the Information Society.</p>
<p>The proposals strengthen the obligations of operators, and propose to require them to inform their customers – both when a contract is concluded and regularly thereafter – about their legal obligation to respect copyright, as well as about the most common cases of infringements. In addition, a new clause in the Authorisation Directive emphasise that operators are under an obligation to comply with existing EU legislation in the area of copyright and enforcement of intellectual property rights, as transposed in national legislation and interpreted by competent judicial authorities.</p>
<p>The Commission welcomes the amendments proposed by M. Harbour in his Final Report which are generally supportive of the objectives behind the Commission proposals and aim at clarifying that providing information to citizens about their obligations to respect copyright, and in particular about the most common forms of infringements, is in the public interest which would be better served if public authorities were more closely involved in the process. The amendments are also likely to meet concerns of the private sector as to the possible liability implications.</p>

This Communication highlights four main horizontal issues:</p>
<p> - Availability of creative content;</p>
<p> - Multi-territory licensing for creative content;</p>
<p> - Interoperability and transparency of Digital Rights Management systems (DRMs); and</p>
<p> - Legal offers and piracy.</p>
<p>The Communication launched a public consultation in preparation for the adoption of a Recommendation on Creative Content Online during first quarter 2009 which will focus on three issues: Interoperability and transparency of Digital Rights Management systems, the fight against piracy and promotion of legal offers. Over 700 written contributions have been received and made available on our website<a href="#defann_25_3" name="refann_25_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Increasing the legal offers of content on the internet and enhancing the cooperation between internet service providers/telecom operators and content providers is crucial for curbing piracy on the internet.</p>
<p>In parallel, to the aforementioned planned Recommendation, a stakeholders' discussion and cooperation platform, the "Content Online Platform" has been set up: it is devoted to content specific or cross-industry negotiations around the issues related to the online distribution of creative content.</p>
<p>Three meetings of the Platform have already taken place on the following topics: new business models (17 April 2008), legal offers and piracy (26 June 2008), management of copyright online (18 July 2008) and another one will take place in October, again on legal offers and piracy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Regarding the question of the Honourable Member on the topics for the next Internet Governance Forum which will be held from 3 to 6 December in Hyderabad, India, the Commission would like to point out that the agenda for this meeting is currently being finalised - a round of consultations took place in Geneva on 16 September. The overall topic for the meeting is currently expected to be "Internet for all". The main themes for this year's meeting are envisaged to comprise:</p>
<p>- Reaching the Next Billion;</p>
<p>- Promoting Cyber-Security and Trust;</p>
<p>- Managing Critical Internet Resources;</p>
<p>- Taking Stock and the Way Forward;</p>
<p>- Emerging Issues.</p>
<p>The ground for each of the thematic threads should be prepared by Main Session Workshops which are expected to focus in particular on:</p>
<p> - access and multilingualism;</p>
<p> - are we losing the battle against cyber-crime?; fostering security, privacy and openness</p>
<p> - transition from IPv4 to IPv6; arrangements for Internet governance – global and national/regional</p>
<p> - the Internet of tomorrow: Innovation and the evolution of the Internet</p>
<p>In addition it can be expected that a range of other issues will be addressed in workshops, best practice fora and meetings of dynamic coalitions.</p>
<p>The European Commission considers that the activities of the Internet Governance Forum have demonstrated that it serves as a very useful opportunity for open exchanges between all Internet Governance stakeholders. The EC has participated in all the meetings of the forum and in the preparatory work. Presentations in main sessions and workshops allowed not least to present best practices in the EU and to share European views on fundamental values. In this context, it is indispensable to emphasise that the active and strong involvement of the European Parliament, noted not only by the Commission but by many stakeholders in the process, has been very appreciated. It has inspired other Parliaments to send representatives to the meeting.

<p>According to the Commission Communication on the European Indicator of Language Competences of 1<span class="sup">st</span> August 2005, pupils will be tested in the first and second most taught foreign language. The Commission proposed that in the first round, and for practical reasons, foreign language competence could be tested in the five languages most frequently taught in the Union as a whole (i.e. English, French, German, Spanish and Italian).</p>
<p>The option to test Latin and ancient Greek is not taken into consideration as the European Indicator on Language Competence is foreseen to be developed only for official languages of the European Union. This means that only living languages are concerned by this project.</p>
<p>As cultural and linguistic elements from the classics (ancient Greek and Latin) are rooted in the languages spoken today in Europe, these elements might be reflected naturally in the test materials. However, the project of the European Indicator of Language Competence does not intend to emphasise particularly these elements.</p>
<p>The choice of the variety of foreign languages taught in the educational system in each of the EU countries is not decided on the EU level but falls within the competence of Member States. At the present stage of development of Community law, the recognition of diplomas for academic purposes also falls within the competence of Member States provided that they do not apply any direct or indirect discrimination on grounds of nationality.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0648"></a>

<p>The Business Forum for multilingualism, set up in 2007 to explore how language skills can have an impact on trade and jobs in the European Union, delivered its report to the Commissioner for Multilinguism on 11 July 2008<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The report gives a clear overview of what needs to be done to help companies gain access to new markets and new business opportunities in the globalised world. It is based on research reports, case studies, interviews and personal experiences of members of the Forum, chaired by Viscount Etienne Davignon, Belgian Minister of State and former Vice-President of the European Commission. One of the main points emerging from the report is that "Europe is running the risk of losing competitiveness, as emerging economies, mainly in Asia and Latin America, are rapidly acquiring solid language skills together with other competences necessary for successful competition "</p>
<p>The report confirms the Commission’s view that gaining competitiveness does not only imply improving language skills with regard to English as one of the major languages used for international trade but also acquiring competence in other languages in order to address local markets appropriately.</p>
<p>The report is particularly important to raise the awareness of small enterprises to the importance of recognising the added value of language skills and developing in-company language strategies to make more of the EU’s internal market and to achieve a better mobility among the European workforce.</p>
<p>The conclusions and recommendations in the report have provided a contribution to the new strategic Communication on multilingualism, which was adopted on 18 September. To ensure the continued dissemination of the findings in the report and promote the implementation of its recommendations, the Commission will create a permanent platform for exchange of best practice for companies, gathering relevant information from the business community, social partners, trade organisations, chambers of commerce, trade promotion organisations, schools and education authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Multilingualism in the European Union is a central component of European diversity. In particular, learning new languages not only represents a competitive advantage, but is also culturally enriching.</p>
<p>The objective of European language policy is what is termed the '1+2' strategy, under which, every EU citizen should learn two other Community languages in addition to his or her mother tongue.</p>
<p>While this programme is to be welcomed in principle, serious shortcomings are becoming evident in practice as far as implementation is concerned. Some regions in which learning languages is especially important because of their geographical situation continue to exclude learning neighbouring countries' languages from their curricula. This omission not only has consequences for individuals' competitiveness on a globalised market, but erects long-term barriers to the free movement of workers in the regions concerned because of a lack of language knowledge.</p>

<p>The Commission shares the view of the honourable Member on the cultural importance of multilingualism in Europe and on the advantages of promoting the learning of the languages of neighbouring countries, particularly in the border areas.</p>
<p>The Commission strongly supports the 'mother tongue plus two' objective, which, as the honourable Member has pointed out, was first laid down in the 1996 White Paper and was adopted by the Member States at the European Council in Barcelona in 2002. Since then, that objective has been at the heart of the European multilingualism policy and has been developed in subsequent communications by the Commission<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Whilst respecting the principle of subsidiarity and the powers of the Member States in this sphere, the Commission has collected information and data on the implementation of the objective. The adoption of the report on the implementation of the 'Promoting Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity' Action Plan<a href="#defann_30_2" name="refann_30_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the regular publication of 'key figures on language teaching' and the preparation of the linguistic competence indicator are evidence of this.</p>
<p>The Commission supports the multilingualism policy in a number of European programmes and initiatives. Furthermore, its new communication on multilingualism, adopted on 18 September 2008, is accompanied by a list of all Commission programmes and initiatives in support of multilingualism. To reply more specifically to the question on multilingualism in border areas, the Commission would like to mention:</p>
<p>1. The Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013, in which the 'Comenius Regio' scheme initiated by Parliament will specifically promote cooperation between schools in border areas.</p>
<p>2. The Interreg Programme: one of the aims of the Italy-Austria cross-border territorial cooperation programme is to improve communication in order to create a solid basis for trade and to reduce the still existing barriers created by different systems in several spheres, notably linguistic.</p>
<p>3. The 'Citizens for Europe' Programme, which supports the twinning of towns and knowledge of their respective languages and cultures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>First of all, the Commission complies fully with all its obligations flowing from Regulation No 1<a href="#defann_31_2" name="refann_31_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. This implies on the one hand that Commission regulations and directives, as well all legislative proposals and communications formally approved by the Commission and transmitted to the institutions are translated in all the official languages including German and Slovak and, on the other hand, that replies to citizens' letters are drafted in the language of their choice. Beyond its obligations under Regulation No 1 and in line with the principles of multiculturalism and multilingualism the Commission is committed to making all possible efforts to treat citizens, cultures and languages equally and with due care and respect. It is also committed to effective and efficient communication with the public, at central and local level and over the internet.</p>
<p>Given the need for the Commission firstly to fulfil its legal translation obligations, it is thereafter necessary to try continuously to strike the right balance between making available relevant and up-to-date information to EU stakeholders in as many languages as possible on the one hand and ensuring speedy and cost-efficient decision-making and protecting the European taxpayer from a disproportionate burden on the other hand. The deployment of translation resources is reflected in the Commission's Translation Strategy, which has been continually updated since 2004 and makes it possible to adjust demand and resources in a smooth and efficient way.<a href="#defann_31_3" name="refann_31_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>
<p>Furthermore, it must be noted that German is one of three languages, together with English and French, in which the Commission usually adopts its internal decisions.</p>
<p>As regards the Slovak language, the training has been on offer since 2003. Standard training in Slovak is being offered on the same basis as for all official languages; staff can participate in training actions organised internally by the Commission as well as in external training organised in Slovakia. The Commission's Directorate-General for Translation launched an initiative in 2007 to mobilise representatives of the Slovak ministries, universities, academies and the European institutions with a view to improving the institutional use of the Slovak language and its terminological consistency. The Commission's Directorate-General for Interpretation continues its support to training institutes in Slovakia as regards the training of conference interpreters. Accreditation tests are also organised regularly to increase the pool of interpreters working to and from Slovak.</p>
<p>The Commission meets its obligations in respect of the Slovak language and the services offered are of a high quality and the promotion of the Slovak language active. Indeed, very few complaints about the quality of the texts are received.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>French President Nicolas Sarkozy has undertaken to implement a major reform of public-sector television in France. The reform, which would bring to an end all commercial advertising, is facing major resistance from workers in the sector and, in a broader context, from public opinion, with fears that public-service television would soon cease to exist as it would not be able to compete with private channels if it no longer received income from advertisements. From here it is but a short step to believing, as many people do, that France has decided to kill off public-sector television to the benefit of the private sector, which stands to gain much from the procedure.</p>

<p>The application of Community rules to State aid in the field of financing public service television is based mainly on the Communication from the Commission on the application of State aid rules to public service broadcasting.<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>That Communication sets out the fundamental principles laid down in the Protocol on the system of public broadcasting in the Member States annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, i.e. the competence of Member States to provide for the funding of public service broadcasting insofar as such funding is granted for the fulfilment of the public service remit as conferred, defined and organised by each Member State, and insofar as such funding does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Community to an extent which would be contrary to the common interest.</p>
<p>In that legal context of subsidiarity, the choice of means of financing public service television is solely up to the Member States. Nevertheless, the Commission has to verify, under Article 86(2) of the Treaty, that the derogation from the normal application of the competition rules for the performance of the service of general economic interest does not affect competition in the common market in a disproportionate manner. In particular, State aid must be proportional to the objective of the common interest, i.e. must not exceed the net costs of the public service mission, taking also into account other direct or indirect revenues derived from that mission.</p>

<p>India plays a significant role in Afghanistan and is a huge factor with regard to Afghanistan’s security and stabilisation. India's assistance in reconstruction in Afghanistan has made an essential impact in the region. The Government of India has provided more than $750 million to Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban in 2002. There are also thousands of Indian citizens in the country working to make use of these funds to improve the lives of the Afghan people through fundamental capacity-and institution-building projects such as the reconstruction and completion of the Salma Dam Power Project in Herat province.</p>
<p>In light of the attack on the Indian Embassy in Kabul on Monday 7 July what policy measures will the European Union undertake to provide its full support to the Governments both of India and Afghanistan to bring the perpetrators of this vicious attack to justice?</p>
<p>With the heightened commitment by the European Union at the International Conference in Support of Afghanistan in Paris in June this year to strengthen Afghan institutions and improve security in Afghanistan alongside a number of other vital commitments, can the Commission state how it expects to continue to work with the Afghan Government and other partners like India to produce a situation where the essential capacity-and institution-building already taking place will effectively take root?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission firmly condemned the terrible bomb attack on the Indian Embassy in Kabul on 7th July 2008, which caused many deaths among Afghan civilians, Indian diplomats and personnel and injuries to numerous other people. Indeed in the speech to Parliament on 8 July 2008, the day after the bombing, the Commission strongly condemned the attack and expressed its condolences to the families who have lost or suffered injuries to loved ones.</p>
<p>As the statement by the EU Presidency said at the time, such actions directed against the diplomatic representation of a State are unacceptable in nature. The EU gave the Indian authorities assurances of its solidarity and reiterated to the Afghan authorities its determination to support the fight against terrorism. All the people behind this appalling act of terrorism should be brought to justice.</p>
<p>The Commission is making significant efforts to enhance its relationship with India. The EC budget for India for the period 2007-2013 amounts to €260 million, in support of health and education programmes as well as the implementation of the Joint Action Plan. In the wake of the review of the Joint Action Plan EU-India, the Commission has made proposals to enhance cooperation in the fight against terrorism and proliferation.</p>
<p>Support to Afghanistan is and will remain in future a major priority. The Community has contributed €1.2 billion since 2002. At the Paris Conference on 12 June 2008 where the international community met to reaffirm its commitment to Afghanistan, it was recalled that the Commission was committed for the long term. The security situation has made it harder for the international community and the Afghan government to make the progress we so much need on the ground. However, the Community is committed to play its part in supporting the key institutions necessary to ensure rule of law and at the Rome conference on the Rule of Law in Afghanistan in 2007, the Commission announced that the Community would pledge up to €200 million in support of rule of law up to 2010. That will support the police and the judiciary. The Commission is working with the key justice institutions in Kabul, embarking on a project that aims at making them open, professional and legitimate. Progress is being made in some areas and donor co-ordination on this sector has significantly improved since Rome. The Commission is also continuing its support to police in particular through support to the Law and Order Trust fund (LOTFA). In time, this should contribute towards the strengthening of the key institutional capacity of Afghanistan.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0658"></a>

<p>Haci Bogatekin, publisher of the newspaper 'Gerger Firat', has been in custody since 13 April 2008 after writing in an article published in January 2008 that the Turkish Republic faces a greater threat from increasing Islamic fundamentalism than from the PKK. In the article in question, he also sharply criticised the army's campaign against the PKK in the region, at a time when the influence of the Islamist movement founded by Fethullah Gülen, which has close ties with the AKP, is steadily increasing. When the State Prosecutor Sadullah Ovacikli questioned him about this, the journalist published an article stating that Ovacikli himself has close links with Fethullah Gülen. On 25 June 2008 Bogatekin was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment. He may face further imprisonment for a breach of Article 301 of the Turkish Criminal Code, following the publication of another article.</p>
<p>In the Commission's view, does this sentencing of a journalist to a term of imprisonment represent a breach of freedom of the press and freedom of expression?

<p>The Commission is closely following the case the Honourable Member is referring to. This case illustrates that there are still shortcomings in Turkey when it comes to safeguarding freedom of expression in line with European standards.</p>
<p>In April this year, the Turkish Parliament adopted amendments to Article 301 of the Turkish Criminal Code, which has been repeatedly used to prosecute and convict writers and journalists. These amendments intend to strengthen the safeguards for freedom of expression in Turkey. However, as the Commissioner in charge of Enlargement has often repeated, what ultimately counts is proper implementation and visible improvements on the ground.</p>
<p>In addition, other legal provisions than 301 preventing freedom of expression also need to be addressed, in order to ensure that ungrounded prosecutions of people expressing non-violent opinions stop.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to closely monitor the situation as regards freedom of expression.

On 16 July 2008 the German Government decided that Germany will not open up its labour market to workers from the new Member States before 2011, even though the situation on the German labour market is steadily improving: for example, in June 2008 the unemployment rate stood at 7.5%, the lowest level for many years.

<p>To date, however, the German Government has not notified the Commission of the decision to extend restrictions, and under the terms of the Accession Treaty it does not have to do so until the end of the second phase on 30 April 2009.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Commission expects any Member State notifying a serious disturbance of the labour market or threat thereof to provide a full justification and convincing data and arguments. The Accession Treaty does not define how such a serious disturbance of the labour market or threat thereof can be proven. This means that it is up to the Member States to bring forward criteria and arguments which they consider to show such a disturbance. The Commission will carefully assess the arguments provided in the notification by the Member States concerned. As labour-market disturbances are country-specific, and the overall economic situation and developments on the labour market vary from one Member State to another, the Commission cannot give indications in this respect before receiving any notification.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

In pursuit of these aims, the report draws attention to the opportunity provided by the six new investment programmes for the period 2007-2013, which carry a total contribution from the European Union of 1.1 billion €. These include a third generation of the programme for peace and reconciliation, which remains unique to the region.</p>
<p>In addition, the report develops a number of leads for the region to follow-up in different European policy fields. Some of these leads have already been taken up even before the report was published or shortly afterwards. In certain cases, this has resulted in Northern Ireland competing successfully for financial aid from the European budget (see section 4 of the report), while in other cases, awareness in Northern Ireland has been raised regarding opportunities arising under new European programmes and policy initiatives.</p>
<p>The authorities in Northern Ireland have indicated that they intend to pursue the other leads, including new opportunities that may have arisen since the report was published, in a systematic way, by developing an action plan. The Commission is informed that the draft of the action plan is currently being finalised. The Commission has said that the Task Force will work closely with the region in its implementation.</p>

<p>Concerning the Khiam Rehabilitation Centre (KRC) project funded by the Commission, the Delegation monitors it closely, and as the Commissioner in charge of External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy stated in her letter of 5 June 2008 to the Honourable Member, the Commission is satisfied by the results of this project which addresses a very important subject, providing medical, social and psychological assistance to victims of torture. This use of EU taxpayers' money is fully in line with the objectives of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights as approved by Parliament. Full details of the project have been provided to the Honourable Member, not only in the Commission's replies to the questionnaire of the Budgetary Control Committee in relation to the discharge for 2006, but also in extensive correspondence with the Commissioner in charge of Administrative affairs, Audit and Anti-fraud and the Commissioner in charge of External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy, and she has provided the Honourable Member with the project's interim report on operational issues and financial matters, dated 29 April 2008.</p>
<p>The Commission condemns all forms of racism but does not link its financing of projects with an expectation that the Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO) concerned will systematically express opinions that are in line with EU external policy. Indeed the EU supports diversity of opinion and the right of expression, as long as fundamental democratic principles are not violated. In this case the material displayed on the KRC website reflected the general tone of Lebanese press coverage of the release of the detainees, and indeed was largely based on newspaper reports.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0667"></a>

<p>In recent years, with the steady growth of the use of mobile telephones, their standards have been changing all the time (even between models of one and the same brand). This needlessly increases the spending on accessories.</p>
<p>The main reason for this anomaly is the lack of a uniform standard for entry plug connectors of the various peripherals (chargers, headsets, transmission cables), which would be universally valid for all GSM handset brands. Needless to say, the monopolisation of peripherals impairs competition, which in turn holds back quality and inflates prices.</p>
<p>Standardisation of peripherals (say, to USB format), would reduce costs and would facilitate the mobile telecommunication service, enhance consumer protection and competition, increase the demand for mobile services, reduce waste of electrical and electronic equipment, and save energy, materials, and resources.</p>

<p>The Commission is fully associated to ongoing EU efforts for responding to the humanitarian and socio-economic consequences of the recent conflict between Georgia and Russia as well as for stabilising the security situation, within the scope of its institutional competences.</p>
<p>The Commissioner in charge of External Relations expressed, in a letter of 11 September 2008 to the Chairmans of the Parliament's Budget and Foreign Affairs Committees and to EU Foreign Ministers, the intention of the Commission to mobilize rapidly a financial package of up to -€ 500 million for the period 2008-2010 in order to contribute to Georgia’s economic recovery. An equivalent contribution has been solicited from EU Member States.</p>
<p>Moreover, in accordance with European Council conclusions, the Commission has started preparations for organizing an international donors conference to be held in Brussels in October.</p>
<p>Another important way to support Georgia is to accelerate the process of its economic integration with the EU under the ENP (European Neighbourhood Policy) Action Plan.</p>
<p>In this respect, it is the intention of the Commission to accelerate as much as possible the preparatory work for starting negotiations with Georgia on a Visa Facilitation-readmission agreement and on a full and comprehensive Free Trade agreement, once the appropriate conditions will be met.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Commission intends to further encourage and support Georgia for continuing the process of reforms in the areas of democracy, rule of law, governance and media freedom. The Commission believes that promoting political pluralism and more efficient democratic controls is in the best long term interests of Georgia.</p>
<p>As regards Russia, the President of the Commission on August 26, the day that President Medvedev issued a decree recognising South Ossetia and Abkhazia, issued a statement condemning the move. The European Council on September 1 issued a firm and unanimous condemnation of the recognition. The EU’s approach in the wake of the crisis in Georgia was set out in the conclusions of the European Council of September 1. As concerns the Commission, negotiations on the New Agreement that is set to replace the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement are postponed pending a withdrawal of Russian forces to positions held prior to August 7. The Commission is also contributing to the in-depth examination of EU-Russia relations, to enable the Council to draw conclusions in light of developments in time for the next Summit with Russia, scheduled for mid-November.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0671"></a>

<p>The Commission devotes particular attention to the evaluation of activities which include financing. When the European Consumer Centre network (ECCs) was created in 2005, by merging two separate networks, the Commission took into account recommendations of an independent external operational analysis.</p>
<p>Before concluding a grant agreement for the operation of an ECC, the Commission evaluates and approves applications from the centres, which contain detailed operational and financial plans. Before any final payment is made, the Commission assesses all aspects of the execution of the individual work programmes, it determines a performance category for each centre, and shares the results of this evaluation with the centres and the co-financing Member States. In 2006, the most recent financing period for which the Commission has completed an assessment, 8 centres were considered excellent (AT, DK, FI, FR, IE, LU, PL and SE), 1 was considered unacceptable (MT), 4 were considered less than average (CY, PT, NL and UK) and the remainder 14 were considered average (BE, CZ, EE, DE, EL, HU, IC, IT, LV, LT, NO, SK, SI and ES). For 2007 only an interim evaluation has been concluded as the financing period will only be completed in 2008.</p>
<p>Recently, the Commission has also introduced a performance based evaluation of the centres, which will influence the final payments made to them. The Commission routinely carries out operational audits of the centres.</p>
<p>The Commission follows up the work of the centres also through the use of an IT tool allowing the ECC centres to work together and registering all contacts with consumers. In 2007 the IT tool registered more than 55.000 such contacts between the network and consumers.</p>
<p>Since its formation the ECC network has completed only two application periods, the third is to be finished at the end of 2008. The Commission is planning to carry out an audit of the network when sufficient experience has become available. The annual report of the network provides a snapshot of its activities, services and best practices which is published on the Europa website<a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The EU policy concerning Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with the countries included in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), which include Georgia, is set out in the Commission's two Communications on the ENP, in 2006 and 2007.<a href="#defann_48_1" name="refann_48_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> These Communications, endorsed by EU Member States, stress the EU's objective of supporting political reforms and economic development in the ENP countries through strengthening their economic and regulatory ties with the EU. They recognise that so-called "deep and comprehensive" Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with these countries can play an important role in the economic integration process. "Deep and comprehensive" FTAs are FTAs providing for the fullest possible liberalisation of not only trade in goods, but also trade in services and investment, as well as extensive regulatory convergence on issues like technical standards, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, protection of intellectual property, competition, customs etc.</p>
<p>The EU's long-term objective is to conclude deep and comprehensive FTAs with all the ENP countries. At the same time, as the Commission's Communications clearly specify, a launch of FTA negotiations with a partner country needs to be preceded by a thorough economic analysis and evidence that the partner is able to negotiate, implement and sustain an ambitious agreement, that would provide for an in-depth liberalization of trade with the EU. The partner's implementation of the trade provisions of its ENP Action Plan should be seen as a prerequisite in the preparatory process for a future deep and comprehensive FTA.</p>
<p>In the specific case of Georgia, the Commission launched an independent study on the feasibility and economic impact of a possible future EU-Georgia FTA in July 2007. The study was finalised in May 2008. It concludes that Georgia could enjoy significant economic benefits from a deep and comprehensive FTA with the EU, while a simple FTA (limited only to removal of the few remaining tariffs in the bilateral trade in goods) would not have economic value. It also concluded, however, that at this stage Georgia is not yet able to sustain the kind of reforms necessary to implement, or even negotiate, a deep and comprehensive FTA. In particular, Georgia has so far made only very limited progress in the implementation of the trade-related regulatory provisions of its ENP Action Plan and will need to intensify significantly its efforts in this respect before the launching of FTA negotiations could be possible.</p>
<p>In this situation, the Commission concluded that it was not yet time to start preparing for negotiating directives for FTA negotiations with Georgia. In the light of current events, the Commission has re-confirmed to Georgia its commitment to the objective of concluding a bilateral deep and comprehensive FTA and to intensifying its support to Georgia, including through its enhanced technical assistance, to enable Georgia to enter into negotiations on such an agreement as soon as possible. It should be noted that as an ENP country, Georgia has access to such instruments as TAIEX and Twinning which have proved their usefulness and pertinence in addressing the crucial issue of regulatory convergence in the case of new EU Member States.</p>
<p>The extraordinary European Summit on the current crisis between Georgia and Russia held on 1 September 2008 concluded that, "The EU also decides to step up its relations with Georgia, including visa facilitation measures and the possible establishment of a full and comprehensive free trade area as soon as the conditions are met."</p>
<p>In line with these Conclusions, the Commission intends to further enhance its support to Georgia's efforts to make the necessary reforms in view of engaging in a deep and comprehensive FTA as soon as possible. The Commission will continue its informal dialogue with the Georgian authorities on a future FTA and further develop its assistance to them in the implementation of the trade-related provisions of Georgia's ENP Action Plan. The Commission will in particular aim at establishing, together with the Georgian authorities, additional concrete EU technical assistance projects in order to tackle Georgia's most urgent needs as soon as possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The EU and Georgia are both Members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and in accordance with its rules they grant each other most favour nation (MFN) treatment with respect to customs duties (tariffs) on goods. The MFN treatment is further re-confirmed by the EU-Georgia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. In addition, Georgia benefits from generous autonomous tariff preferences under the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+) established in the framework of the EU's Generalised System of Preferences (GSP).</p>
<p>Under the rules of the WTO (namely principle of non-discrimination), the EU does not have the possibility of reducing or abolishing its customs tariffs on selected products originating in a particular third country, for instance foodstuffs imported from Georgia.</p>
<p>However, most of the agricultural products and foodstuffs imported to the EU from Georgia – hazelnuts, mineral waters, spirits, various fruits and vegetables – are covered by the GSP+ arrangement. Therefore unlimited quantities of these goods originating in Georgia can enter the EU market without any customs duties.</p>
<p>As regards the specific case of wines, the EU's MFN import tariffs, applied also to Georgian wines, are on average very low (only around 5% ad valorem equivalent) and they do not represent a real obstacle to imports of Georgian wines to the EU. The main barriers are in fact non-tariff ones, notably the fact that Georgian wines are not yet sufficiently known in the EU market and that their quality is not yet recognised by the EU's consumers. With a view to helping Georgia overcome these problems, in July 2007, the EU and Georgia started to negotiate a bilateral Agreement on the Protection of Geographical Indications for Agricultural Products and Foodstuff. The negotiations have been proceeding smoothly and could be concluded in the near future. Furthermore, in the framework of its trade-related technical assistance, the EU offers Georgia a possibility to establish joint specific projects aiming at improving Georgian wine producers' market penetration, distribution and promotion strategies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

According to statements and studies by experts, the cause of this environmental crime, which impacts the local ecosystem and the social and economic life of the region, is waste from local factories and urban waste which have been polluting the Lake for decades because the biological purification has been out of action and because of a failure to change crop irrigation methods. The absence of any specific policy to manage and protect the aquatic resources has led to the present disaster.</p>

<p>With respect to specific action to save the lake, the Commission in 2005 approved a project submitted by the Greek authorities for assistance in the frame of the Cohesion Fund interventions, environment section (CCI:2005 GR 16 C PE 006 of 19.12.2005). The project, "Rehabilitation of lake Koronia in Thessalonica" was carefully studied by the competent services including those of the Ministry of the Environment while an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out in conformity with the requirements of Directive 85/337/EEC. The project, of a total cost of € 26.91 million and Community assistance of € 20.18 million, included works for the creation and formation of a wetland, works for the improvement of hydrological characteristics of the lake, as well as specific treatment basins for the pre-treated liquid wastes of the industrial units of the area. However due to certain technical and administrative difficulties the project did not follow the foreseen schedule and no significant progress has been reported by the Greek authorities. As a result, the Commission has not carried out any payments to this date (24 September 2008).

<p>Twenty deliberate releases of GM poplars for field trials have been approved by national competent authorities in Europe between 1991 and 2008. Four of these trials have taken place in the EU since 2002, when Directive 2001/18/EC entered into force. One trial is presently being carried out in France with a view to evaluating its properties for bio-energy production. It is also the aim of this trial to collect data on biodiversity.

<p>ACP banana producers fear that they will be squeezed out of the European market if the EU tariffs are lowered. Latin American bananas are not only cheaper, they benefit from government subsidies. Though ACP countries produce only 0.9 million tonnes of the 17 million tonnes of bananas sold on the world market, local economies depend on banana exports for income and jobs.</p>

<p>It is public knowledge that the FARC have committed criminal activities, including taking of hostages, a crime included in the EU definition of ‘terrorist act’ – some 700 of these are still in its power, even after the recent liberation of Ms Betancourt and 14 other captives.
