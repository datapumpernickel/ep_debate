<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lehne (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this too is a very important report. What is it about? It is about the fact that although the internal market in Europe is becoming ever more integrated, there are also various deficits, as we all know. The Commission, the Parliament and the Council have been trying for many years to achieve joint legislation, particularly in the field of consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In the communication on contract law which the Commission has brought forward, and which is also referred to in this report, the Commission covered in detail the position on the common body of law which already exists in the European Union, and also referred to all the directives already in existence in this field. However, if you take a closer look at these directives, you will see that they are not always necessarily consistent. It is quite conceivable for there to be a contract entered into between a purchaser and a vendor in which the purchaser may have to sign three different cancellation statements with different cancellation deadlines, because totally different deadlines are found in different directives, such as the distance-selling directive and other directives. It is pretty obvious that this does little for consumer protection and is sheer nonsense. That is why it is necessary for this common body of law to be consolidated and summarised to achieve a common result.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many reasons why this situation has come about. It can be explained, in part, simply by the fact that within the European institutions totally different directorates-general, committees and Councils were responsible for individual aspects, and of course they always looked at things from their own isolated point of view, which then led to quite different end results.</p>
<p class="contents">So up to now there has not been an integrated approach, an integrated view of the approximation of civil rights. I think it is a very good thing that following the decisions taken at the Tampere Council, the Commission now intends, just like this House, to adopt an integrated approach in future. This is a matter of urgent necessity, as the volume of cross-border trade is on the increase in Europe. There are two key factors which explain this. The first is, of course, the introduction of the euro next year. A second factor is the impact of modern technology, and I only have to mention electronic commerce. If, in the future, you order goods or other commodities via electronic commerce, you will have no idea, or, at least, you frequently will not have, of where the company you are dealing with is based. This is leading to an inevitable growth in cross-border trade. That is why I believe that it is also necessary for us to develop more common definitions of offences and a broader common body of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">The present electronic commerce directive, which we in this House supported, is not therefore, as we already know, an ideal solution. As the country of origin principle applies here, whereas in the case of consumer rights law the country of destination principle applies, this can lead in practice to situations such as a district court judge in Cologne having to apply Irish law in parallel with German law. I would not mind betting that this will lead to considerable problems when only trifling amounts are at stake and with bread-and-butter legal cases. This demonstrates that we need to develop a broader common body of law in future.</p>
<p class="contents">My report now envisages, with the support of many expert groups who have been calling for this for a long time, that the Commission should continue its work by means of an action plan covering several years. At the end of that process, and this is my belief at least, the result should be a common body of law within the European Union, for cross-border transactions at least, which is as extensive as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to transparency, I believe that this is necessary, not only for consumers, but also for businesspeople, and this also applies to legal certainty, legal practicality and the application of the law.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore wish to ask the House to give its approval to the proposal emanating from the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on this report regarding the approximation of the civil and commercial law of the Member States. This is, as it were, the starting pistol for the Commission's work. I know that the Council is currently considering this matter in parallel with ourselves, and that it is intended to deal with this subject at the Laeken Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that everyone in Europe has recognised that this issue is of a very high priority, and that progress needs to be made with this work. In order to exert a little bit of pressure, I think that we should approve this action plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The communication presented to us by the Commission referred to a limited aspect of the harmonisation of private law, specifically contract law, and the report presented by Mr Lehne deals which a much wider scope, because it refers to the harmonisation of private law in general. We, in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, considered that contract law was probably too narrow a scope and that it would not be sufficient to produce harmonisation of private law in general, which is necessary, as Mr Lehne pointed out, above all within the framework of the introduction of the euro and of the generalisation of European contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s communication is very broad, given the aspects it deals with and the questions it poses. We, in Parliament, clearly cannot work intensely and on time, as we would have liked, but we can make some observations. I will focus on one: the possibility that, in relation to harmonisation, more reference should be made to the regulation and less to the directive. Because we are seeing that every time a Community directive is adopted, it gives rise to fifteen different national legislations, which leads us to think that we are possibly not achieving the objective of harmonisation, but quite the opposite, because the Community directive paradoxically leads to discrepancies in the development of each national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that this is a difficult issue, because there is still legislative zeal of a national nature, but it is one of the possibilities for development by means of Community legislation, instead of merely indirect harmonisation via a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stop here through lack of time, but not without congratulating the Commission on its initiative and the rapporteur on his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have made a good start in what is a very politically sensitive area. Although we might see the practical arguments for moving forward because of the advent of the euro and because of e-commerce, we have to ensure that our citizens are also comfortable with this.</p>
<p class="contents">Every time we talk about approximation of core civil law subjects, I see scare stories in the English press that English common law is about to be replaced by the <span class="italic">Code Napoléon</span>, complete with a small picture of Napoleon. Last week English contract law was supposed to be under threat. However misguided some of this comment might be, we have to respect the concerns and deal with them. The process outlined in this report will allow us to do so. The Commission has made some very pragmatic suggestions about contract law, which I hope the Council will act on. It was, after all, the Council that brought forward this idea of convergence in the Tampere agenda. We must insist that the area of freedom and justice referred to there is as much about civil law as about criminal law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Tampere conclusions foresaw convergence in civil law. Convergence is a long process, not an abrupt event. It is not about imposing a European civil code. It is about channelling and guiding developments in Community law to give us a more coherent and less piecemeal approach, ultimately allowing more knowledge of the law and greater access to justice across Europe's internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">In considering these matters, we would do much better to concentrate on what draws us together in Europe's common legal heritage. All our legal traditions owe something to the early modern fusion of feudal, Roman and canon law called <span class="italic">ius commune.</span> We now have the chance to guide and structure the modern reconvergence of our legal systems. We should welcome that opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, in my own country, Scotland, that lasted until the 17th century, during which 6000 members of the Faculty of Advocates of Scotland at various times studied in the universities of Utrecht and Leiden. That kind of interaction of lawyers is one of the things which contributed most to our civilisation and from which our legal civilisation has grown. So this is a very good project and the time-tabling suggested by Mr Lehne and the Commission is feasible and worthwhile.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, as Mrs Wallis has said, legal traditions are valued objects. People concern themselves greatly about the coherence and integrity of a legal order. Therefore it must be with great sensitivity that we move forward in bringing back together again legal systems and legal traditions through the kinds of common definition that Mr Lehne is suggesting.</p>
<p class="contents">With that in mind, I have one doubt and it involves a difference with what Mr Medina Ortega has just said. Clause 14 of the report suggests that a regulation is really the best way to take this forward. The difficulty relates to subsidiarity. If these things are to be done well, common definitions will have to be sensitively adapted and grafted into what are very deep and organic legal traditions. You cannot do that by thrusting a regulation down the throats of the legal community.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the United Kingdom have two legal systems, rather distinct, and it is going to be absolutely vital for this development that both are adequately and properly represented in further discussions, as they have been on bodies like the Lando Commission in the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to specifically exclude the rapporteur's report from that comment.

However, it is my belief, and this is something that Mr MacCormick just touched upon, that the mature traditions underpinning the legal systems of the Member States impose certain limitations on the approximation of civil and commercial law, and that a failure to respect those traditions would inevitably lead to the opposite of what we are trying to achieve. However, I believe that these problems have been adequately addressed and that it is also possible to achieve this objective, which we will therefore be supporting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Would it be a million, 10 million or even 100 million? Whatever, I believe that it must be a large figure. We are in a world of what in German we call "<span class="italic">Massengeschäfte</span>" a term that is not perhaps particularly easy to translate into other languages – bread-and-butter transactions, perhaps. I am sure that only a fraction of these legal transactions will have been cross-border, and I am equally sure that these transactions, ranging from Lapland to Sicily, from Scotland to Bavaria, will have been conducted according to totally different traditions and customs. That is why we need to be clear that this is a very sensitive area and however ambitious we may be, we still need to proceed very carefully and prudently. Mrs Wallis has already referred to the reaction in the United Kingdom, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">So I think it is reasonable for the Commission to propose in its Option II that we should initially work out some general legal principles. One expert very appositely said that the problem with legal convergence is not so much the rules as the exceptions. We have discovered precisely that through our own work, in the case of warranty periods on purchases, interest on arrears, money laundering and also the takeover directive. General principles can be agreed quickly, but in contrast it is very difficult to harmonise which groups should be given special treatment and who qualifies for special protection.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we also need to set reasonable priorities for our work. The cross-border aspects should be prioritised in the first place. We need to achieve compatibility between European legislation and national legislation, but national legislative provisions also need to be made compatible with each other. Courts need to cooperate more effectively and mutual legal assistance needs to be guaranteed. I believe that these are concrete, practical steps that we can implement from one day to the next, which would assist legal transactions between our citizens within the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that in considering these matters, we should also deal with the concept of working towards a European law as an option for parties entering into contracts. They could therefore choose either to opt for a legal system created in Europe or else continue to use national law. As I see it, this would be a kind of soft harmonisation, setting in train a process of convergence which, Mr MacCormick, would be better than regulations adopted as an abrupt event, as Mrs Wallis put it.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background I would also like to say that Mr Lehne's draft does not, of course, reiterate the demands that we made in 1989 and 1994. At that time we demanded that a European Civil Code should be drawn up, but as far as I can see, that proposal has not been incorporated in the texts adopted in committee nor in the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">We have adopted a good, reasonable and cautious approach here. I would like to thank both the rapporteur and all those who helped with the hearing for their assistance.</p>

What we need to start with at EU level is coherent and homogeneous legislation. That is very often not the case, because terms are used which have a different meaning in other legal texts. Scarcely any academic research has been done into this aspect of Community law. So the first thing we should do is to ensure coherence and homogeneity in our own legal texts, and I would urge you to set up an expert committee to do this. That is one point.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point that I would like to address is how this relates to international civil law. It seems to me that Mr Lehne has rather neglected this aspect in his report. International civil law can make an important contribution to overcoming the difficulties involved in cross-border legal disputes, and as a rule, and I am choosing my words very carefully now, international civil law is certainly not inferior to Community law, certainly as far as legal culture and the quality of legal texts are concerned. So if, as in the case of the directive on electronic commerce, you take issue with international civil law, the situation becomes very difficult indeed. We therefore need to examine once more to what extent we can retain international civil law.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns national regulations. I think this is an area where we should not overreach ourselves. That will be very difficult. I believe that it would be best for us to have convincing law making in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Given the forthcoming European Council in December in Laeken, for which this report will be of relevance, I am particularly pleased that the European Parliament is discussing this report here today. The European Council will therefore have at its disposal not only the Commission's communication and the Council's report, but also the report by the European Parliament, which handles this important issue in the necessary depth.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also very much welcomes the report as Parliament's response to the Commission's consultation process, launched by the communication on European contract law. It is absolutely essential that the Commission should get as much feedback and input as possible from the other EC institutions so that it can establish its future approach in the area of contract law.</p>
<p class="contents">One fundamental question confronts the Commission, as well as Parliament and the Council as the two branches of the European legislature. Should we continue with the existing piecemeal approach of harmonising European contract law in a very sector-specific way, as has been done for the past 20 years, or should we adopt a new approach? It is obvious that if the existing approach corresponds to the needs of the European Union then we should continue it. If, however, there are problems despite, or possibly even because of, the existing approach, then we should be brave enough to change it.</p>
<p class="contents">It was in order to get a reply to this fundamental question that the Commission adopted its communication on European contract law. The choice of our future approach is highly important for the smooth functioning of the internal market and the participation of consumers, small- and medium-sized enterprises and all other economic operators, as well as for the uniform application of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already received a large number of constructive comments and reactions which confirm that the Commission's initiative is of great interest to all stakeholders. Of course not all the reactions point in the same direction, but this is inevitable with such a complex subject where so many issues are raised and different options need to be considered. The reactions will be examined in depth by the Commission. Obviously the Commission will attach great importance to Parliament's response to our communication which, once you have adopted it, will be very carefully analysed. The Commission will decide what suggestions it will make in the light of the reports from Parliament and the Council, the possible reaction from the European Council and the responses to our consultation process.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that the Council may ask the Commission to report to the Community institutions and the public on the consultation process, together with any observations and recommendations if necessary in the form of a Green or White Paper, not later than 31 December 2002. The European Parliament's proposal for an action plan is particularly relevant in this context. The Commission has taken due note of the ambitious deadlines for specific steps to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to express the Commission's thanks for the careful analysis that has gone into this report. If there are problems for the internal market and the uniform application of Community law which need to be tackled, it is obvious that whatever line we take this will be a longer term project of considerable importance. So, this is certainly not the last time that we will debate questions of European contract law in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I submitted the Commission communication to the college, together with my colleagues Mr Vitorino, Mr Bolkestein and Mr Liikanen. At the last Council meeting on the internal market and consumer affairs, I emphasised my strong personal interest in this matter, not only because I am convinced of its value but also because of my own professional background as a practising barrister and as international commercial arbitrator. For those who have expressed concern about the survival of the common law system: that is the system that I have worked in myself for 27 years and I have some attachment to it. Perhaps with that background it will be able to make sure that these issues and sensitivities are taken fully into account.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an ambitious project but it is a feasible project. When I worked on contracts where arbitration was needed or on dispute had to be resolved, the "applicable law" was – <span class="italic">lex mercatoria</span>. – What is that? Those who have to enter into contracts with a term like that will feel perfectly comfortable with something a bit more rigid and rigorous, which is what all of us in this House are aiming at. My colleagues and I are therefore looking forward to constructive dialogue with Parliament and the other EC institutions in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
