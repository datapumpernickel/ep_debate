<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Souchet (UEN), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the proposal for a regulation before us relates to the scheme specifically covering exchanges of non-Annex 1 products with third countries, the main provision of which is for the granting of export refunds in respect of incorporated agricultural products. Annex 1 of the Treaty defines the list of products eligible for a COM under the CAP. These are basic agricultural products and products that have undergone initial processing. Non-Annex 1 products are those that have been processed a second time.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem which has now come fully to light and which the Community has to deal with as from this year is the fact that, because of the consolidations granted by the Community under the Marrakesh agreements, refunds are no longer sufficient in relation to needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot be said to have been overly imaginative in seeking solutions to this difficult problem, where a lot is at stake for our manufacturers and processors of agricultural products. Other than simply withdrawing certain products from the list of those eligible for refunds and in that way causing difficult administrative problems for the sectors concerned, one solution alone presents itself, as usual: that of extending the system of active improvement which allows agricultural raw materials to be imported at the so-called world market price, as long as the processed products in which they are incorporated are re-exported.</p>
<p class="contents">No alternative solution to the system of refunds on agricultural products has been seriously looked into. Other windows onto the subject, opened by certain Member States such as Germany and Austria, were immediately closed again, since any alternative proposal was declared out of hand to be incompatible with the constraints to which we have subjected ourselves under the GATT agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">In the circumstances, we obviously have to give primary consideration to the size of the sector concerned and to the volume of exports. Rapidly increasing exports of non-Annex 1 processed products alone represent 25% of total exports of products from the food and agricultural sector as a whole, and 2.5 million jobs, widely distributed among the different countries of Europe, depend upon this single sector. For these products, additional access to agricultural product refunds at least constitutes a partial, quick fix solution which, in the absence of alternative proposals, makes it possible immediately to guarantee the competitiveness of non-Annex 1 products.</p>
<p class="contents">The parliamentary Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has maintained that the ways in which the additional agricultural product refunds were applied should be determined in such a way as effectively to enable companies to have recourse to these within the acceptable limits laid down by the supply balances. In this way, it would be possible to maintain a sufficient quantity of refunds for companies which cannot make use of these, either in order to avoid GMOs or because of the unavailability of raw materials on the world market or the lack of staff or appropriate infrastructures. </p>
<p class="contents">That said, agricultural product refunds present a range of risks and disadvantages. First of all, a disadvantage in terms of principle: agricultural product refunds do, indeed, by their nature circumvent the Community’s expressed preference. The European agri-foodstuffs industry ought to be encouraged to give preference to Community raw materials. This implies that, despite the extension proposed to us, the agricultural product refunds ought definitely not to become a structural tool but ought to remain a residual scheme and a last resort solution, to be implemented only when there is a real shortage of refunds.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are proposing a series of amendments which ought to be taken into consideration overall to reinforce this residual character of the agricultural product refunds. We believe that any extension to the agricultural product refunds should be subject to very strict supervision and follow-up. That is why we are in favour of establishing quotas for the scheme. That is why we are also proposing that, at the end of the first year in which the scheme has been implemented, the Commission should present the European Parliament with a precise interim report providing, in particular, an update on the situation regarding each COM concerned. In that way, we shall have a tool of superintendence and control with which to ensure that agricultural product refunds are of limited availability, that the amounts concerned are no more than are really needed, that they do not have an adverse effect upon our own producers of raw materials and that they are not concentrated upon a limited number of COMs at the risk of destabilising these.</p>
<p class="contents">A second disadvantage of the system of agricultural product refunds is the particular complexity and the cumbersome procedures it imposes upon SMEs in particular. The latter ought to be given easier access to these refunds, which remain more straightforward to administer, and, in this context, they ought to be exempted from presentation of certificates up to an adjustable ceiling of EUR 50 000 per year. Bear in mind that the refunds, particularly for processed food products, are far from being reserved solely for large businesses. They play an essential role where SMEs are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">These, then, are the component elements of a genuine monitoring tool which we think it essential to implement in order to ensure that the new agricultural product refunds are operating in accordance with the objectives which justify our agreeing to them. In the longer term, however, there will only be a lasting solution to the issue we are to deal with today as a matter of urgency if, when the WTO agreements next come up for renewal, Community negotiators receive clear instructions to the effect that adequate account must be taken of the interests of our non-Annex 1 products and that the close links forged by our processing industries with our producers of agricultural raw materials and their countries must be maintained and consolidated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stevenson (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, the Commission’s plans to slash export refunds will cost the EU’s food and drink processors an estimated EUR 145 million per year. It is particularly galling that the decision to impose these cuts was taken without consultation with this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Export refunds are not a subsidy. They compensate the food and drink industry for sourcing their raw materials within the EU at higher prices than can be obtained on world markets. It is astonishing that the Commission chose to single out German fruit yoghurt, Scotch whisky and pharmaceutical products for these cuts, apparently for no better reason than the belief that these are wealthy industries which do not deserve assistance. Other sectors, such as pasta, confectionery and some dairy products that also receive export refunds, have escaped relatively unscathed. This is deeply unfair. The cuts are damaging to EU industry and they will destroy the competitive advantage of our agri-foodstuffs sector and they will destroy jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s scheme to compensate food processors for losing out on export refunds, by encouraging them to seek inward processing relief on a range of commodities from outside the EU, is both muddle-headed and inept. Not only does the scheme encourage processors to import grain and other raw materials from outside the EU – once again to the direct disadvantage of our beleaguered farmers – but it also involves a mountain of red tape and bureaucratic complexity which will virtually exclude SMEs from this scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must devise a new system. Those food and drink exporters who through adding value to their products, constitute a vitally important part of the EU agricultural economy must receive alternative compensation exactly equivalent to the value of the export refunds they have lost. To do otherwise will place EU food processors at a massive competitive disadvantage on world markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Export refunds are essential to ensure the international competitiveness of non-Annex – I processed food. In addition, the food and drink processors in the EU purchase around two-thirds of all their agricultural produce within the 15 Member States. This deliberate attack on non-Annex – I export refunds further undermines our farmers who are suffering their worst recession in decades. It is also a direct attack on the fastest growing export sector within the EU, our processed food sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We are committed to 36% reduction of export refunds over six years and we are nearing the end of that period under our obligations in the GATT Uruguay Round Agreement. However, these cuts should not be targeted in such an arbitrary manner on a small number of industries, as the Commission has chosen to do. Access to IPR offers only a very unsatisfactory and temporary solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mr Souchet in drawing up a good report in the face of Commission intransigence on this issue. He is fundamentally correct in describing the Commission proposal as a temporary measure. There is no doubt that the whole system now needs to be dismantled and rebuilt in a much more sensible and less complex manner, in line with our WTO and GATT requirements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We simply have to note that, basically, the system of inward processing breaks with the principle of European preference or, if you like, the system of Community preferences. This is a very delicate area and, furthermore, the system of inward processing, in its application, is extremely complex and slow and therefore harms numerous small- and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">In this delicate area, our decisions, as politicians, should be directed towards maintaining the competitiveness of the European food industry in the world and towards strengthening the close links between the processing industry and the producers of raw materials. The greatest responsibility in this area falls to the Commission. We require a creative and flexible Commission, capable of judging changes in the markets, measured and, at the same time, imaginative. We need a Commission which gives priority to the European farm model and the defence of small farmers, but the truth is that so far all the Commission has demonstrated in this area has been its opacity, its discretionary approach to legislation and very little else.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the European Parliament, Mr President, both the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development and its chairman, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, have worked seriously and prudently on this difficult report. Mr Souchet has produced a wonderful report, and I congratulate him on his work as rapporteur. He has been correct, specifically in his proposals to limit and rationalise the use of the system of inward processing by adapting it to the situation of the markets, the regulatory framework and the budgetary framework. All of this is correct, as well as his demands for exemptions in favour of small exporters.</p>
<p class="contents">Many thanks, therefore, to the rapporteur and the European Parliament, and I hope that the Commission will improve its work in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pesälä (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FI) </span>Mr President, the Commission is proposing changes to trade arrangements for processed agricultural products. The purpose is to end subsidies and restrict them by means of a certificate. There are two fundamental courses of development behind this: on the one hand, the pressures caused by the liberalisation of world trade on reducing export aid and, on the other, the EU’s internal budgetary pressures mainly associated with external relations. The food processing chain and, ultimately, the farmers, are going to foot this bill. Already the market situation is putting immense pressure on the European producer. In addition, costs are rising thanks, for example, to higher fuel prices and increasing environmental and other obligations. Profitability in production is shaky, and this rather pointedly begs the question as to whether agricultural production in Europe makes sense any longer. </p>
<p class="contents">Our committee and the European Liberal Democrats believe that the EU must safeguard the profitability of the production chain. The Commission is proposing selective deterioration. We are, however, in a position of constraint. It may be necessary to act in this way, but certain principles have to be adhered to in this issue. The changes must take account of small companies active in this sector of industry. For example, in the country I represent large export companies simply cannot exist, owing to the country’s small population. There should be some flexibility in setting the restrictions in respect of export aid procedures. For that reason, the wording of Amendment No 8 is justified. It provides a degree of flexibility, especially for small companies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make the comment that by replacing cuts in export aid with inward processing and additional procedures the effects will be unevenly spread, in that a heavy burden will fall on the remoter EU countries in terms of transport costs. For that reason I agree with the rapporteur that, in the long run, these procedures will not work. This is a question of temporary solutions only. Our group supports the committee’s amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once I had immersed myself more deeply in the subject, I was amazed to learn what this was all about. It had been clear up until now: industry buys products produced in the EU and is then given export refunds in order to be able to compete on the international market. Now the Commission is saying that there is no longer enough money, however, because we entered into a commitment in Marrakech and now we are going to have to rethink the situation. Then they have a brainwave to the effect that industry will no longer buy agricultural raw materials on the EU market but on the world market instead, which the EU, for its part, will export its raw materials onto, and in dumping its goods will also be partly responsible for world market prices. They think that industry will now be able to buy there, local products will stay where they are, and industry will then make refined products from the aforesaid local products and bring them onto the world market.</p>
<p class="contents">We were absolutely convinced at first that there was no chance of this working. Then we gave the issue every attention in committee, but the view I have just described to you is that of the Commission. Subsequently, we tried to discuss whether or not it would be possible to sell products produced within the EU at world market prices, as the chemical and pharmaceutical industries do, so that, at the very least, the products we sometimes have an abundance of – although we do not produce surpluses overall, there is an abundance of produce in certain sectors – could be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">But no, they did not want to float this idea at the WTO negotiations. An apparently elegant solution was being proposed, which undermined the WTO negotiations somewhat. There is a passage in the explanatory statement of this regulation which states that the Community preferential arrangements must not be undermined, nor must there be disturbances to the European market. When I buy products elsewhere, which are available here in abundance, then of course I cannot assume that there will be no disruption to the market. It seems to be a compromise solution, and my group is unable to accept it in its present form.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to offer my compliments to the rapporteur. Mr Souchet is someone who can always be relied upon to speak up for agricultural interests. His approach may, from time to time, be a little on the traditional side for my taste, but I am full of admiration for him. You have done your level best for rural farming in Europe, and that is the spirit in which we will vote for the proposed amendments that we put forward in committee. We endorse your report, but we intend to reject the legislative resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">We had to draw the line at this point, at the very least, because, overall, we do not think it is a balanced and reasonable solution, and on the whole, we feel, and fear, that if this mechanism is implemented, prices within the EU will come under direct pressure once again. We will lead the next discussion we have on prices and the next discussions we have about whether prices of our products within the EU are pitched too high. But what we in fact need to discuss, is whether the sale prices on the world market call for a price discussion, because no one in the world can produce goods in an environmentally and socially responsible manner under these conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If the proposed amendments are accepted and the inward processing arrangements are opened yet further, Community preference, which has already deteriorated, will no longer apply in practice and it will be more difficult to place processed Community agricultural products on international markets; small- and medium-sized units relying on Community agricultural produce and Community export refunds stand to lose and large processing units buying cheap raw materials from third countries stand to gain.</p>
<p class="contents">The brunt of this adverse impact will be felt in the Mediterranean countries, including Greece, because these are the countries which produce these products and most processing units in these countries are small- or medium-sized. It would be an affront, having created such an unfortunate situation, if we were to accept the proposed amendments to the regulation, even on a provisional basis, i.e. until the WTO agreement is completed, on the pretext of safeguarding employment and the value added.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, despite the fact that we agree with many of the rapporteur’s findings, we disagree with his conclusion on the opening of inward processing arrangements, even on a provisional basis, precisely because we believe that, under present circumstances, provisional measures will turn into permanent measures and will exacerbate the situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Souchet is right in pointing out that it is not so much the limited budget but rather the WTO rules which are playing tricks on the Commission. In the case of shortages of raw materials on the internal European market, the food industry can import these from the world market without any import duty and under inward processing arrangements, as has been the case to date.</p>
<p class="contents">But the regulation changes the essence of inward processing. A shortage of raw materials no longer justifies the use of inward processing, but rather financial motives, namely reaching the WTO ceiling. Suppose there was a surplus of cereals on the internal market whilst the ceiling of refunds had been reached. Inward processing would then open the door to cereal imports from the world market. There is a very real danger that the relationship between the food industry and the farmer then changes from one of partnership to one of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">European farmers are not just producers of agricultural products; very often they also maintain our cultural landscape, but at a price. We should be very much aware of that price, which is passed on to the food industry. It requires creativity to find sound solutions for farmers and industry within the strict boundaries of the World Trade Organisation. It is inevitable that some industries will lose their export subsidies in the process. A number of industries process only a small proportion of their agricultural products into finished products. It is unfair in my eyes that they should complain, especially in view of the high profit margins they submit each quarter. Small exporters, on the other hand, deserve more protection. We back the amendments which have their interests in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with the rapporteur, we would call on the Commission to keep a close eye on the balance between agriculture and the food industry in Europe during the forthcoming negotiations within the framework of the WTO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall highlight just three of them. The first is that this proposal is not driven so much by the restrictions imposed by the WTO, but particularly by the well-known budget restrictions currently being applied in the European Union, specifically due to the need to reallocate means and resources to commitments that the Union has given in the field of external affairs, notably Kosovo. These objectives are not under threat. They will have to be addressed in a transparent way during the major debates on the European Union’s options. What is not acceptable is that little more than a year ago, the Financial Perspectives up to 2007 were approved, and now, a few months later, resources that had been earmarked for agriculture are being withdrawn.</p>
<p class="contents">The second risk is that the increasing use of inward processing could put us in the extremely dangerous situation of no longer producing many agricultural products within the European Union, since it would be more profitable to import them in their raw state, process them and re-export them. Only a few sections of society would benefit from this and it would spell disaster for agricultural communities. In the long term, the European Union’s dependence on external supplies in a sector as strategically important as food production would make the Union as a whole extremely vulnerable. It would therefore be a foolish mistake to think that the practice of inward processing could be a lasting solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The third risk relates to our negotiating strategy for the Millennium Round. This week, the Commission has approved a document on the competitiveness of our exports, which reveals its fundamental position on the various types of export aid. The Commission’s position is quite clear: the European Union will not in future accept reductions, within the WTO, only in support for export refunds – there will also have to be reductions in all types of support provided by our main competitors in the international markets, ranging from export credits to food aid and state-run businesses. All this will have to be "put on the table" and reduced under the GATT rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s stance on this issue is totally correct: all types of aid which have a similar effect must come under the WTO rules, not only the refund system used by the European Union. It is in this context of external pressure that the European Union is applying in the framework of the GATT, that is, the WTO negotiations, that it seems to be a mistake to have presented this proposal at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should simply like to thank Mr Souchet for the tremendous job he has done, which we greatly appreciate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This proposal has serious implications for Ireland’s dairy sector and will result in a serious loss of trade, particularly in the area of the reprocessing of dairy products.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support the rapporteur in his proposals that the measure should only be introduced on a temporary basis and that aid should be introduced to cushion the effects on the sectors which are most affected. I have given the example of Ireland’s dairy industry and would ask the Commissioner to examine the implications for this sector in particular. I also support the provisions in Mr Souchet’s report which states that we must ensure respect for the European agriculture and food production model. It is only right and proper that we negotiate a new regulatory framework for exports or products not covered by Annex I as part of the WTO Millennium Round.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Souchet is correct when he states that the decision to cut export refunds for certain products is unacceptable because such arrangements originally contributed to the management of the internal market. This situation in fact was validated by the World Trade Organisation. I believe that the proposed opening of on additional facility for raw materials that have access to inward processing arrangements will not be sufficient to cover the food industry supply and export requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Long-term, Europe needs to exercise greater vigilance in relation to world trade – which is now under consideration – and how decisions taken there impact on our processors and on our farmers. There is sufficient evidence that our competitors in the world market, particularly the United States and New Zealand, are not always as committed to adhering to the rules as are the EU Member States. With the proposed enlargement of the European Union to central and eastern Europe, we must take a strong hand in safeguarding our European objective which, of course, is to develop agriculture as a major and competitive player in world trade. Already our competitors have demonstrated their negotiating skills in this crucial area of international policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is absolutely true what Mr Souchet, as rapporteur, and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have had to say on the subject. They have my unequivocal support.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, there can be no doubt that the bottleneck in the budget and also the special WTO agreements represent a completely new challenge at the end of the day, particularly where export refunds are concerned. Who would have thought, even as little as a year ago, that we would be facing this conundrum, and having to weigh up the interests of agricultural product processors against those of the farmers who produce the products. If the Commission is now looking for a way to resolve this export bottleneck in products that are not covered by Annex I, then it is certainly responding to a need. Yet there is not the slightest suggestion in the Commission proposal that the problems facing the raw materials producers, i.e. the farmers, have been registered.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in complete agreement with Mr Souchet. Thank you very much for all the work you have put into the report. He rightly complains that the Commission is offering no alternative courses of action. One thing is for sure though, there must be no restriction in the availability of raw materials at competitive prices, and at the end of the day, agricultural policy cannot be devoted exclusively to the protection of the raw materials producers. But then nor should the burden fall on one side alone in agriculture, or have to be borne by individual products.</p>
<p class="contents">There are agricultural products that almost pay for the export refunds themselves, at the end of the day, owing to contributions from the producers, i.e. the farmers. Sugar is a case in point. The farmers’ contributions go into the general melting pot of the EU budget on the revenue side, and if export refunds are cut then these contributions will decline too. As I said, sugar is a particular case in point. I feel we must give special consideration to this issue, and give it priority where export refunds are concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am extremely pleased with it. It is also providing us with the opportunity to examine the situation we currently find ourselves in, as we are being forced to adapt regulations on two counts, which means that we sometimes need to adopt working methods which are not our own.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point is agreements reached at WTO level and the second one could be the budget. I would like briefly to explain both, starting with the WTO rules. It is becoming clear – poignantly so – given the price level in the EU but also outside, that we still need refunds, and there is also an indication that the difference in power between producers and farmers worldwide and those who sell their products is still far too pronounced. As long as this is the case, we cannot in fact do without refunds. This will also need to be spelled out clearly during the forthcoming WTO negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the budget. It does not seem right to me to use this in the argument regarding the refund regulation and processed agricultural products. Why? Because the European Union has, for a number of years, awarded refunds to Member States because it simply was unable spend it all itself. Surely, this cannot be the argument. Secondly, Parliament made it abundantly clear in its report on the 2001 budget, which was adopted in the Agricultural Committee, that there is extra scope within the framework of the financial agreements of Berlin.</p>
<p class="contents">In these agreements, a number of proposals have been made for a number of export certificates in order to solve this problem. For example, an extra five million has been proposed for cereals in the form of spirits, an extra ten million for cereals and rice, eleven million for sugar and isoglucose and eleven million for processed dairy produce. So the money is available and the solution should thus be in sight.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact remains that the agricultural policy is, in principle, there for the benefit of farmers. This is why it has been framed with the European rural areas in mind. The fact that this regulation is necessary also illustrates the close relationship between the processing industries in Europe and the farmers. In this sense, an interim regulation is essential. But I should add that, quite clearly, we should drive home the message to the processing industry that, first and foremost, we rely on products which are grown within the European Union. In addition, I should also call on the Commission to give due consideration to small- and medium-sized businesses. In many heavily agricultural regions, jobs are already thin on the ground, so it is precisely those companies that should be able to cope with this type of regulation and should, in that sense, be given more attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that your deliberations will lead to a consensus that opens the way for a rapid implementation early in the new budgetary year.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree on the need to promote the Union’s processed food industry competitive position. Export refunds are an important instrument in sustaining the industry’s competitiveness by compensating for high prices of basic agricultural products in the Union. However, both budget constraints and commitments under the WTO severely restrict available refunds that will no longer be sufficient to cover the industry’s export opportunities. It is for this reason that the Commission has proposed, within a balanced package of specific measures, an additional facility of inward processing relief – IPR – that will help compensate for the industry’s loss of international competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can agree with your proposed Amendments Nos 2, 6, 10, 13 and 15. The Commission can broadly agree with the purpose of Amendments Nos 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14 but does not consider them entirely appropriate for a number of reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">For WTO negotiations, a specific mandate from the Council is required therefore the present regulation does not seem to be the appropriate means of determining the Union’s position. This relates to the first of the amendments. Furthermore, some amendments could entail an administrative burden related to implementation and control that would appear disproportionate. This concerns Amendments Nos 3, 11 and 14.</p>
<p class="contents">The threshold for exempting small exporters from the export refund certificate system has already been increased to EUR 50 000, which concerns Amendments Nos 7 and 8. The remaining flexibility under the 2000 budget has already been used, which relates to Amendment No 9.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission is not ready to accept Amendments Nos 4, 5, 12, 16 and part of Amendment No 1. As a general rule, the Commission does not support discrimination among individual products concerning the possibility of access to inward processing relief. This relates to part of Amendments Nos 1, 4, 12 and 16. Moreover, the use of C-sugar in processed products for export is not possible under current market organisation: this concerns Amendment No 12. Operators importing products under the IPR do not receive any refund for the export of processed goods, so the assumption in Amendment No 5 is incorrect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the Commissioner said: in view of the “high prices of basic agricultural products in the Union”. Perhaps the Commission could get used to the following version: in view of the “low world market prices caused by dumping”, because otherwise we risk creating the impression that the agricultural pricing system within the EU is pitched too high. No, it is too low on the world market because farmers cannot produce at this price.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this is a report according to Article 37. We reserve the right – I will discuss this with the other groups – to refer this back to committee, because what you have said, your assumptions that is, will of course put paid to the efforts made by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. It is then highly likely that we will enter negotiations. I am just saying this now to give you food for thought. The honourable Members here will then be able to make their feelings known in the discussions. I just wanted to give you advance notice. Mr President, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
