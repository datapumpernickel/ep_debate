<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McNally (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Madam President, I am very pleased to present my recommendation for second reading on the Energy Star agreement. As you will know, in a rather complex procedure, Parliament has already been consulted on the agreement itself. This is now the codecision procedure on the regulation which implements that agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank the Commission, the Council and my colleagues, in particular the shadow rapporteurs, for their help in steering through this rather complex procedure. I would like to thank in particular the Swedish Presidency, which went out of its way to be helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council common position takes on board most of the points made by Parliament at first reading. We shall have an earlier review than was expected; we shall have an update on new technological advances in this area of energy efficiency; we shall have a report to Parliament. Furthermore, the United States' authorities are absolutely clear that Parliament is involved in discussions on the Energy Star programme from the Commission's point of view. This has been done through a side letter added to the agreement, at Parliament's request, which meets our wishes for them to know how we operate in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This clearly is not the only measure which is to be taken in the area of energy efficiency. I understand there is an update to the common position because of the new Eco-Label award scheme. I am prepared, as rapporteur, to accept that slight modification which has been made necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though I am pleased that it looks as though this agreement is coming into force, I do not want to exaggerate its importance. It is a useful tool, but it is a relatively modest proposal; it is a voluntary scheme based on a United States model. I know many colleagues agree with me that in future we should work as a European Union and have European Community schemes rather than attempting to latch on to schemes developed elsewhere, in the United States for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, although it is relatively modest, it is welcome. Computer equipment is sold worldwide and the educative, awareness-raising aspects of seeing the Energy Star logo on computers is worthwhile. We know that one of the tasks in increasing energy efficiency is to improve public awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a small part of what is needed. Everyone in this Chamber knows that energy efficiency is the most important component of energy policy. It is the fifth fuel – coal, gas, renewables, nuclear – the fifth fuel, with a 30% potential, is energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">If someone from another planet saw us acting as if we had known that, they would think we were stupid. We are not stupid, we are intelligent and that is why intelligent energy – a phrase with which I hope everyone is becoming familiar – and certainly Mr Wijkman, Mr Turmes, Mrs Van der Laan and I are doing our best to make it a very familiar phrase – and energy-intelligent Europe depends on energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">We look to the Commissioner to bring in a package of measures well beyond Energy Star. They are demand-side management and two important directives: one on household appliances and one on office equipment – not made in the USA. I hope that during this autumn, under the Belgian Presidency, we will see both of those draft directives adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been very cooperative on the Energy Star programme. There is only one amendment, which could be withdrawn. If the Commissioner is able to give us tonight an appropriate assurance and accept the spirit of that amendment, which asks her to take further action on the withdrawal of inefficient equipment, it is quite possible that we can approve the common position unamended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She was in a way having to negotiate a precedent and she showed great commitment and was very successful on Parliament’s behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the Vice-President of the Commission, who over all has worked very energetically for a European contribution to solving our energy problems. I think we are all agreed that the more efficient use of energy is a very important contribution to solving our energy problems. Modern technology offers us ways of saving energy and using it more efficiently. If we do that correctly, it is actually to everyone’s advantage. The costs of such technical innovations are small enough to be written off within months or a few years at the most, which means it is to the consumer’s overall advantage and it also gives industry an opportunity to bring its innovations on to the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we are looking at one way, namely the Label. It is an important step because it gives us influence over world standards since the Energy Star is used not only in the USA and in Europe, but in other countries besides. When I took on the task of being my group's shadow rapporteur, I asked firms in my constituency that are concerned with the subject, those that sell or make computers, for example, what they thought about it. They said the Label alone would probably not achieve much because, when consumers buy computers and similar goods, unfortunately they do not pay attention to energy consumption so much as to various other criteria. So we should perhaps talk about finding other ways of promoting energy-efficient equipment and gradually removing the big energy wasters from the market.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment in front of us says, after all, that one such way forward might be a voluntary agreement with industry. We should only think about legislation if that fails to work. I believe that to be very, very important because, as the rapporteur has said, we are debating here about an agreement with the USA and about a Label, but the solution to the problem does not lie in this Label alone. I am therefore asking the Commissioner to make very clear in her speech that the Commission is thinking of going further and also to say when we can expect other proposals. I don’t believe any of us would gain from having to engage in a lengthy conciliation procedure because of an amendment being tabled. If we achieve a good outcome this evening, we can avoid the conciliation procedure. Otherwise conciliation would be necessary and I am sure we all want to avoid that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Suddenly a regulation that has occupied us here in this House for quite some time has become a small pebble in the mosaic of this changed world. We know that 11% of electricity consumption – between 10 and 15% in other countries – in private households and public sectors – if we add those as well – contributes to power stations being operated completely unnecessarily because there would be other ways of doing it in standby mode. On a European scale that means between six and ten large power stations, and they could be nuclear power stations.</p>
<p class="contents">When at this very moment the first bombers could already be flying towards Afghanistan and people are wondering what form a possible counterattack might take, we can see that such a mundane thing as this regulation could bring us greater security here in Europe, greater security, too – if we think of the consequences of 11 September – in relation to the probable rise in the price of oil. From this point of view I therefore very much welcome the work that Eryl McNally has done.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect that should now again be given particular consideration is that we could provide a stimulus to the economy to which the Commission pays particular attention in the amendment to which the previous speaker has already referred – by finding a way not only to label good equipment but also to remove bad equipment from the market as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I welcome the approach adopted in this proposal for a voluntary code. That is a more pragmatic approach towards achieving improvements. Unlike Mrs McNally I see no harm in adopting measures that are in place in the United States. It is one of our aims in Europe to achieve common standards in the internal market. In that regard, why should we not seek to extend those common standards to our major trading partner across the Atlantic? Just because it was invented in the United States does not mean it is all bad. It is very important that we should assist people making choices about purchasing equipment in knowing what the energy efficiency is. In my own experience, labelling materially affects one's decision. It certainly affected my decision this summer when I was buying a fridge and a freezer for my home. The old ones were getting very noisy and very expensive. It may be that my motive was also concern to stop using so much electricity supplied by a company owned by a French utility, but that is another issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close by supporting the comments about the amendment, namely, that we all look to the Commission to give us an assurance on the issue of the further voluntary code. This is a healthy and sensible approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am aware that she has worked intensively with Parliament and the Council in order to reach the position we are in today. I also hope that we manage to reach an agreement on the text which is acceptable to all of us. I am sure that none of us want to go to conciliation if we can solve the problem in a more appropriate way, given that our positions are very similar.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is integrated into the Commission’s action plan to improve the energy efficiency of the European Union. Office communication equipment represents a high proportion of the electrical consumption of the tertiary sector and we all agree that the use of efficient and ecological office equipment can contribute to the sustainable development strategy decided at the European Council in Gothenburg.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed programme for coordination of labelling, the Energy Star programme, will lead to significant reductions in electricity consumption and CO2 emissions, and is therefore very viable. As Mrs McNally has very rightly said – and I would like to stress that I am in full agreement with her – energy efficiency is key. The key thing is to use energy well. That is where we have the greatest margins and we stated this in the Green Paper on the European Union’s energy supply.</p>
<p class="contents">After a long period of negotiation, in December 2000 the agreement was finally signed with the United States on coordination of programmes for energy efficiency labelling on office equipment. Now we need this Regulation so that we can appropriately implement what was signed with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme has already been a success in the United States and has led to considerable participation by manufacturers, the large majority of which have introduced energy-saving devices into their products. It has also increased consumer awareness of wastage resulting from office equipment in standby mode.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the positive experience on the other side of the Atlantic, the Commission is convinced that the Energy Star labelling programme will naturally lead to the gradual elimination of inefficient equipment on the Community market.</p>
<p class="contents">We perfectly understand the European Parliament’s concerns in relation to the effectiveness of the proposed Regulation on this specific point. These concerns are reflected in the amendment which Mrs McNally is still maintaining. There is no doubt that in other circumstances I would say that I agree with her. However, on this occasion I would ask Parliament to reject it or, even better, that Mrs McNally withdraw it. Because, although I agree with its content, I do not believe that this is the right instrument in which to include this type of measure. The Energy Star programme is not exactly the right place to include this incitement to renovation, modernisation and withdrawal of least efficient equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to tell the House that we are preparing a framework directive on minimum efficiency requirements in the office communication equipment sector, amongst others, a directive which I hope will be presented to this House and the Council during next year.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken this opportunity to explain the Commission’s position and I hope that Mrs McNally can withdraw her amendment and that we can therefore approve this report on the Energy Star programme today without having to go to the conciliation procedure<span class="italic">.</span> </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
