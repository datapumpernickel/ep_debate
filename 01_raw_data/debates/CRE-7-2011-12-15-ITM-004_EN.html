The promotion of energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources is of crucial importance to economic growth and job creation in Europe. The European Union has been developing strategies and ambitious legislation on this issue. However, all policies require instruments that are robust and that make the connection with the regional and local levels. This programme and the agency for implementing it have been contributing considerably to the implementation of legislation relating to renewable energy and energy efficiency, specifically by supporting innovative projects. In particular, activities like the Covenant of Mayors and the Pact of Islands should be continued and stepped up. It is particularly at times of crisis that programmes like this are crucial for competitiveness and economic recovery. In this context, I should like to ask the Commission the following:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, what does the Commission intend to do to guarantee the IEE programme a leading role in the upcoming Multiannual Financial Framework for 2014-2020?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, how does the Commission intend to improve the successor to this programme?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, what is the institutional framework for the successor to this IEE programme within the Horizon 2020 programme and what level of funding will be assigned to it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) programme and the European Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation are outstanding examples of this in the field of combating climate change, so the Commission will understand the concern of Members of this House when we learn of plans to discontinue a programme which encourages citizens to use energy more wisely and to help the Union to meet its Kyoto commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has talked about continuing work in this area, about mainstreaming it, about strengthening it in future funding programmes. Commissioner Oettinger was suggesting yesterday that Intelligent Energy Europe might go into the Horizon 2020, but we want to know whether there will be a dedicated programme still. We want to know whether this will have the visibility that the IEE programme has had. We want to know whether it will activate civil society and foster commitment in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">As Ms Carvalho said, the European Local Energy Assistance Facility has leveraged huge amounts of money from a very small investment to help businesses become energy efficient, to retrofit social housing, to improve public transport, to design smart energy buildings and to connect renewable energy production into electricity grids. If that programme were to disappear it would be a real loss to a huge variety of decentralised activities to promote renewable energy and energy saving.</p>
<p class="contents">I think at heart the question that Members are asking is this: has the Commission lost its way when it comes to renewable energy? Why is it planning to pump money into gas distribution networks for the benefit of companies that are already making billions in profits, rather than pumping money into the vision that it still professes of a renewable energy Europe, one where we can meet our commitment of cutting carbon by 80% by 2050? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not with you personally, but with the people in the Directorates-General for Research and Innovation and for Energy, who are in the process of doing away with one of the most sensible programmes we ever had within the European budget, namely the Intelligent Energy Europe Programme. Studies in relation to offshore wind energy in the North Sea, training workshops for government civil servants on the implementation of the EU’s Buildings Directive, training courses for architects and engineers on how to build near-zero energy buildings, networks between progressive mayors in Europe – the list goes on and on. Why is all this to be destroyed? Why?</p>
<p class="contents">If Ms Geoghegan-Quinn and Mr Oettinger fail to come up with a concrete project, then we, as parliamentarians, will be forced to resurrect the old Competition and Innovation Programme (CIP) and to restore the Horizon 2020 programme to what it should be: a separate research programme and a well-organised innovation programme. Those colleagues here present will be aware of the importance we attach to this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect a swift and specific response in writing both from Ms Geoghegan-Quinn and from Mr Oettinger. The abolition of the Intelligent Energy Europe Programme is poison in a time in which we must garner support for Europe among its citizens. We are turning our backs on those people in Europe who are in favour of European policy. This is unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, in order for the results of the research to be capable of contributing to our energy policy objectives regarding efficiency and renewable energy, they need to be accompanied by two types of measures that are also very important: first, measures supporting actions aimed at promoting market penetration of the resulting energy technologies and secondly, measures to eliminate non-technological barriers, which could be confused with market failures, by boosting capacitation, training and awareness-raising activities and mobilising both local investment and the parties involved, as in the case of the Pact of Islands.</p>
<p class="contents">To date, the ‘Intelligent Energy – Europe’ programme has met these objectives with remarkable success, as has been demonstrated by the various evaluations that have been carried out and the programme has, moreover, been distinguished by its support for small and medium-sized enterprises.

This is a huge step forward in terms of reducing the causes of climate change, limiting and minimising pollution and achieving more efficient and rational energy use. However, when talking about truly intelligent energy, we should today discuss other principles, such as non-fossil-fuel-based energy in Europe. The options might include wind, solar and hydro energy. The search for new forms of energy should be the goal at which all programmes consolidating intelligent energy in Europe should be directed.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States’ investment in new and leading-edge technologies in the field of energy efficiency and in renewable energy sources should be promoted and funded. New and bold steps should in principle be taken today in order to ensure intelligent energy use. Let us plan for a future of new forms of energy, such as hydrogen power and new generations of nuclear technology. We are the generation on whose action it depends whether we will safeguard the earth for future generations or will condemn it to a slow but inevitable death in 100 or 200 years’ time. Let us choose those actions and let us follow those principles which do not provide the slightest incentive to destroy what we did not create in the first place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Janusz Lewandowski, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">–</span> Madam President, all the questions asked and comments made expressed deep concern over the future of a programme which made a great contribution to energy efficiency and renewable energy across Europe. Therefore I can assure you that the commitment remains and should be reinforced – also in financial terms – in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As many arguments concerning the use and contribution and value added of the Intelligent Energy Europe II programme had already been presented, I do not need to repeat them. But what I have to say is that this not just a subjective feeling. It is also reinforced and fully confirmed by the external evaluation of the programme. I can state with satisfaction that this is both relevant and useful, as it replies to the evolving needs, problems and periods relating to sustainable energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme was, as you know, supporting more than 500 projects, 50% of which went to small and medium-size enterprises, and this was a clear preoccupation of Mr Paksas.</p>
<p class="contents">Two success stories should be in the textbooks highlighting the utility of that kind of common European programme: Solar Keymark and the ELENA facility. These are two clear success stories.</p>
<p class="contents">But the major questions were not about the past and present but about the future. My answer is that we have to handle several targets: energy efficiency and renewable energy sources is one of them – a very serious one. However, at the same time we have to respond to the question of energy security and solidarity. This is the question that was so tangible in 2009, when there were cuts in the gas supply via Ukraine – tangible in the kitchens of some Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">So we also have to respond to these concerns. This is why we have to share out money in order to reinforce energy efficiency: renewable, yes, but also transborder networks that are really contributing to energy security and solidarity on the continent, which is so dependent on deliveries from third countries which from time to time clearly display their monopoly power.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the future, as I was informed – you well know that this is not quite my dossier, but I was studying it before coming to the House – my preoccupation is to achieve better coherence between research, innovation and market update. This is why the Commission placed the programme-related activities as a dedicated energy component of a new framework programme. This is the philosophy of mainstreaming actions, and we have been asked by many sources to mainstream our actions in this respect. This is called Horizon 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree – and this is really what I have started as somebody responsible for the budget – that the clearly small amount of money (and I agree, this was a small amount of money: EUR 743 million) via leverage was giving a clear impact. Therefore, this is about clear impact with little money.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that energy efficiency and energy-renewable sources activities should be reinforced with more resources within the non-growing budget. Implementation and details are coming in 2012. I know, already in advance, that it should be reinforced, and this is one of the very few chapters or parts of the 2014-2020 budget proposal to grow. The others are either nominally frozen or generally defended as a real constant.</p>
<p class="contents">This was the real proposal for the future: to defend the budget as a real constant and really nominally frozen major spending blocks – cohesion and agricultural policy. This is the essence of a programme called Horizon 2020 adopted on 30 November with details to be known at a later stage. Perhaps we should go into a detailed discussion on the basis of these implementing details.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, of course, also the place for the Executive Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation. Here again, the external evaluation clearly indicates that this is a useful body. Therefore, the role of this agency in all these related activities should be reinforced. We have an external evaluation (so this is not just our feeling) of both the Intelligent Energy Europe II programme and the Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation, so both would be better placed, in financial terms, in the 2014-2020 programme. Here is my budgetary story. So I can say that this is not just a slogan but a clear indication that in real (also in financial) terms, we fully share the assessment of Parliament as to the value added of these programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The thing is that sometimes such explanations, which are really very sound, compete with reflections that are equally sound.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that what we do in Parliament at this point serves as a wake-up call to ensure that an instrument that has had a history of success does not disappear because of theoretical solutions which could in principle, theoretically, turn out to be more efficient but which would, in any event, put an end to the development of a tool that has made a very real contribution so that many programmes derive from it and have very important consequences for energy saving. I am not going to mention them all but there is no doubt that actions such as European Local ENergy Assistance (ELENA), Solar Keymark or GreenLight are success stories. All this has always been based upon a fundamental pillar, namely, innovation, even in these especially severe times of crisis in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is impossible for societies that do not make innovation the driving force of their development to survive in such a competitive, global society and here we have before us a tool that has proved useful precisely for the purpose of developing innovation in the energy sector. Therefore, Commissioner, our modest contribution is to insist that a tool such as this must not be wasted because it has been tried and tested and, accordingly, we have to give extremely careful consideration to the fact that this intelligent energy tool for Europe could disappear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are no objectives which are more important than those two.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commissioner keeps referring to ‘the low hanging fruit of energy efficiency’, because we need those budgets for that.

Today, the poet, who was also an effective ruler, would no doubt qualify these statements by calling for saving and efficiency. For, in a Europe poor in energy resources, it is essential that we can distinguish between necessary consumption that drives the economy and superfluous consumption. We need to control the latter and, to that end, it is imperative to encourage drastic change in the habits of many European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">When we analyse the economic crisis, we call for austerity and also for stimuli for growth. Well, fine, few better spheres in which to turn those beautiful words into reality than the energy sphere, where a combination of saving and the necessary investment for large projects is required, including construction of an integrated infrastructure network, the report on which I had the honour of presenting to this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must make more tangible efforts than those made to date because it would put a bit of backbone into Europe. Only a sound, well-thought out, efficient and economical European energy policy will enable Europe to walk upright and in the right direction. All clarifications from the Commission in this regard that I have indicated will be well-received. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European policy needs to represent an innovation direction that is capable of ensuring a long-term, sustainable energy supply for the European Union. The Russian gas crisis, the Fukushima nuclear catastrophe and the depletion of fossil fuels are forcing us to find an answer to the question of energy for the future as soon as possible. The ‘Intelligent Energy – Europe’ programme formulated by the Commission definitely represents such a direction. Its main objective is to ensure clean, secure and sustainable energy for future generations. It supports energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy sources and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not only able to help small and medium-sized enterprises with this programme, we can encourage innovative solutions, create jobs and support the issue of education and research as well. In spite of all this, unfortunately, the programme did not receive a specific position in the upcoming support system. This is why I would like to ask the Commission to do everything in its power to allow this programme to continue operating. I believe that even in spite of the concerns caused by Fukushima, we can still list atomic energy as a form of intelligent energy. It has been proved that atomic energy is capable of producing unlimited, clean and safe energy that does not involve the production of carbon dioxide. The fusion reactor built as a result of the ITER project can become just such an energy source in the future. Therefore, nuclear energy should be given a stable position in the ‘Intelligent Energy’ programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, I am in favour of continuing and improving the programme by providing it with a higher profile in the Horizon 2020 framework programme. However, one extremely important aspect which must be highlighted is the need to promote the Intelligent Energy Europe programme better in the new Member States too. Improving access to this programme must be balanced in Member States which are not involved in such projects at the moment, which ought to be actively promoted and encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, providing better information about existing projects and the ways to access the funds would create greater cohesion at European level, as well as avoid widening the current disparities in terms of sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So there can be no doubt about the fulfilment of the EU energy strategies, through which the competitiveness of the European Union will soar and soon put emerging countries behind it, and, perhaps later, the rest of the world as well. Naturally all this will be implemented in a completely sustainable way. The poor Chinese will be trembling at the knees when they look towards the unbelievable development in the European Union. Or wait a minute, if I take a better look, they are actually doubled over in laughter, and this is what makes their knees tremble. They do not understand how it is possible to bail water out of a sinking boat with a teaspoon, not even bothering to mend the hole first. Ladies and gentlemen, let us speak seriously for once.</p>
<p class="contents">As an initial step we need to mend the broken backbone of the energy industry immediately, as I have said in my earlier speeches on several occasions. Once our ailing energy industry, especially electricity production, has got back on its feet, we can talk about the details, such as the ‘Intelligent Energy – Europe’ programme. However, it is not worth spending a lot on this either. Unfortunately only 2% of citizens are able to buy so-called green energy at its real price, so perhaps we should think about the other 98% sometimes. Unfortunately, it seems I was talking about atomic power plant construction all in vain; China has already made plans for them 20 years in advance. In other words, if this is how we are going to continue, sooner or later Europe will become an open-air museum where we use candles for lighting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of the current economic crisis, this objective is extremely ambitious and difficult to achieve. Therefore we should appreciate that we have an effective tool which can help us in this regard, namely Intelligent Energy for Europe. During the decade it has been in operation, we have seen very clearly that the principles adopted within the framework of this programme, as well as its mechanisms of action, contribute to greater energy efficiency, promote renewable energy sources and, above all, enhance the exchange of experience between scientists and experts in the field. It is well worth our while to ensure that this experience is not wasted. It is important that the new version of the programme is open to new technological and fuel opportunities which have appeared recently and which make it possible for some Member States, in particular those where changes are urgently needed, to bring about a real reduction in CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions. An example of a new source of energy of this kind that will improve Europe’s energy independence and which is worthy of attention is the shale gas deposits recently discovered in Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of the current version of the programme lies in the fact that each project that is funded and implemented can be verified and evaluated in terms of its quantifiable results. Credit for this success goes to the experts and professional teams working in the affiliated implementing agency. It might be worthwhile considering whether this experience could be transferred to other instruments and mechanisms in order to increase the effectiveness of the measures taken by the Union and its Member States with a view to smart and sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would be confident that Commissioner Oettinger, whom I listened to yesterday at the meeting of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn, will be of one mind and will form a package whereby all this can happen so that we can reach our targets of 80% savings by 2050. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Your fellow Commissioner, Oettinger, said that yesterday, too. He said that the programme had definitely already been planned and that he would let us know during the week under which line.

Another example is the case of the island of Flores, 100% of whose electricity is already hydroelectric at certain times of year.

At present, the Union is to a large extent dependent on energy imports, predominantly from Africa and Asia. Europe’s oil and gas resources are not large enough that it can afford not to seek alternative energy solutions, and it was therefore natural to launch the Intelligent Energy programme, which aims to promote the use of renewable energy resources and state-of-the-art sustainable energy solutions. However, the Intelligent Energy programme is only scheduled to run until the end of 2013, and therefore we must ask ourselves right now how we will continue with initiatives in the field of innovative energy and solutions beyond 2013. I, like my colleagues, expect that the European Commission will respond shortly to this highly topical question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Intelligent Energy Europe programme encourages smart energy solutions to be adopted. The programme has available for the 2007-2013 period funding of EUR 730 million and provides 75% of the funding for the winning projects from among the annual project applications.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme has funded so far more than 500 European projects lasting 2-3 years, with 8-9 countries participating in each project. This means more than 3 000 beneficiaries from 31 countries. As regards increasing energy efficiency alone, more than 250 projects have been carried out in sectors such as transport, industry, energy services, energy efficiency in buildings and equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">I rate particularly positively the EU for Energy initiative funded by the Intelligent Energy Europe programme, whose aim is to increase Europe’s competitiveness. This year 476 projects have entered for the competition, submitted by 328 schools from every European Union Member State, as well as from Norway and Croatia.</p>

This usefulness and cost-effectiveness can be seen in a programme with a not-so-big budget of EUR 743 million that still has a huge leverage effect and impact on energy efficiency and renewable energy in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the involvement of small and medium-size companies, only part of the 3 000 partners – that is 1 500 partners – can be classified as small and medium-sized companies. The position of Parliament was not only visible as regards the awards; Parliament was able to increase the budget for this programme for 2011 by EUR 10 million and for 2012 by EUR 7.5 million. This is a commitment which is expressed in budgetary lines as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme will not disappear. The commitment cannot disappear because this is so conducive to the goals of the 2020 Strategy, and energy efficiency is among the seven priority areas of the Strategy for the Future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to respond to the need for mainstreaming programmes. Mainstreaming is clearly indicated in all the evaluations of various programmes of the European Union. Given the constraints of not being able to spend more money, we need in future to look at better spending. This is about the mainstreaming of programmes, not the disappearance of a programme that is performing so well.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the future of this programme? It will be placed under a consistent framework which links research development and market update within the growing envelope for Horizon 2020 – growing from EUR 50 billion to EUR 80 billion. The energy component is classified as secure, clean and efficient energy.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot give up on the issue of energy security on the continent, on which we will be so dependent in the coming years. Energy security is an important aspect of Horizon 2020. It is clearly the place for an energy component which is classified as clean and efficient energy; it is the place for intelligent energy and for a dedicated element of this energy component. So it is going to be a very visible commitment, in monetary terms as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course this is not the only place to find money for intelligent, renewable and efficient energy. As you probably know, this is high in the hierarchy of the goals of the structural funds, which attract a much larger amount of money in so-called interim regions, namely the regions with a per capita GDP of less than 90% of the European Union average. There is a very limited range of goals, and energy efficiency is the number one area of the structural funds to which funding is to be committed in this type of region of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are looking at the position of intelligent energy in the multiannual framework. This could be more than EUR 1 billion instead of EUR 700 million, for example; I cannot give exact figures today, but I know that this is a growing envelope. Therefore, visibility and financial commitment is to be guaranteed in the multiannual framework for 2014-2020. The role of the European Parliament is very clear in shaping the future by shaping the rules of the game in this component of the multiannual framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, the European authorities must take account of the differences between national economies and Europe’s regions because it is important that developing energy programmes (including diversification of supply sources) and boosting the production of energy from renewable sources also take into account the requirements of the local environment. Last but not least, the European authorities must bear in mind that, unlike other areas where the cost of investment or procurement which needs to be made is lower, the development of energy programmes requires considerable effort.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, it is of paramount importance to outline an institutional vision for cofinancing which will meet the interests of the Europe 2020 strategy, as well as build a European economy which is not only more efficient and competitive, but also more inclusive. It is just as important for the development of the European Union that the EU executive responds by its actions to the problem of funding the Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) programme. Similarly, the completion of the programme must provide an opportunity for making the most of the results achieved and creating a successor to it, capable of overcoming the problems that the IEE faced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I believe that it is crucial to simplify the rules for access to finance in order to allow greater participation by small and medium-sized enterprises and to open up research projects to young researchers. We must not forget our achievements thus far, but we must also face the new challenges created by a global market in which our closest competitors are China and the US. I especially hope that on the next Info Day on 24 January 2012 preference will be given to the participation of researchers in those parts of Europe that are at the bottom of the list when it comes to the awarding of grants, in order to promote the importance of equal opportunities for researchers and coordinators in the various regions of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the results of the Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) programme, which about more than just specific successful projects and sharing their results. It is about developing a broader awareness of the importance of the rational conduct of European civilisation. Through support for research and innovation with investments in projects for sustainable energy, despite some partial failures or problems, the actual question of sustainable energy has come onto the agenda. Without energy aware decision-making by public authorities, and without public pressure on such decision-making, it would be quite impossible to achieve the goals we are now discussing in relation to the energy efficiency directive. The Multiannual Financial Framework contains no mention of continuing the IEE programme. Horizon 2020, the framework programme for research and innovation as part of the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2014-2020, must therefore take on the role of the IEE, and above all secure sufficient funding for this programme. Without further support and facilitation of decision-making processes respecting energy efficiency, it will not be possible to ensure the internalisation of external costs in the area of transport, or to create a new impulse over intelligent networks. Without economical and innovative thinking, it will not be possible to begin implementing large-scale integrated projects in the field of energy, and without these the European energy sector will not become sustainable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
