<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karlsson, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Court of Auditors</span>. – Mr President, on behalf of the Members of the European Court of Auditors, I would like to thank you for inviting me to present the 24th Annual Report of the Court for the 2000 financial year. As in previous years, this presentation marks the start of the discharge procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The report follows the format used for the past three years, with chapters covering revenue and each of the expenditure areas under the headings of the financial perspectives. There is an additional chapter this year which marks the development of the Union, which deals with pre-accession aid for which a separate financial perspective heading exists from 2000 onwards. You will also – as usual – find a chapter dedicated to the Statement of Assurance and, attached to the report, you will find the Court’s observations on the implementation of the sixth, seventh and eight European Development Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The different chapters of the Annual Report address four main concerns. First, there is an analysis of the budgetary implementation and of the budgetary management practices for each specific financial perspective heading. Then, you will find the follow-up of observations of the Court in previous Annual and Special Reports. Thirdly, the specific appraisal in the context of the Statement of Assurance with information per financial perspective heading. Finally, a new element this year is that the principal findings and recommendations in the Special Reports adopted by the Court since the last discharge are summarised in the chapters according to the wishes of this Parliament. This means that the Annual Report this year contains all the principal findings and recommendations concerning the implementation of the general budget and the European Development Funds that the Court has published since the last discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">You will also find, for the first time – not in the copy of annual report that you have in your hands today, but in the Official Journal version that will come when the official version has been printed, something that Parliament has asked for many years – the text of the Court in one column and the answers of the Commission on the same page so as to make the report, at least in this respect, more user-friendly.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the budget management for 2000, one particular feature of budget implementation was the emergence of a very large surplus of revenue over expenditure, amounting to EUR 11.6 billion, equivalent to more than 14 % of final payment expenditure. The main factors which led to this situation were a higher revenue yield than budgeted and – perhaps even more important – lower payments on Structural Measures, in particular those for the 2000-2006 programming period.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court recommends that the Commission examine how it can better use the supplementary and amending budget procedure to avoid excessive budget surpluses, in order to avoid distorted revenue positions for the following year caused by the carrying over of surpluses.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court, responding to the wishes of the discharge authority, has continued to follow up the observations in previous Annual and Special Reports. The main purpose of this is to review what action has been taken, principally by the Commission, in response to the observations of the Court, the recommendations of the Council and the resolutions of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In all of the subjects examined, some action has been taken. The extent and effectiveness of this action, however, vary considerably. In general, the Commission, in particular where it agreed with the earlier observations and propositions, has adopted measures designed to respond to them and to improve the situation. In some cases corrective action has been slow, in others, staff and financial resources allocated have been insufficient to achieve the desired level of improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Effecting improvements in the management and control of complex programmes involving many organisations at different levels is difficult and takes time. Structural rigidities have often to be overcome, and in the areas of shared or decentralised management, which account for more than 80 % of the general budget, the Commission requires action from others, such as Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Notwithstanding that achieving change can be difficult, the Commission should ensure that it takes all the measures within its power to implement the recommendations of the Court and of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In early 2001, as part of its follow-up work, the Court reviewed progress in the replacement of the former anti-fraud unit (UCLAF) with the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF). The new arrangements for OLAF provide a more appropriate administrative framework, with greater independence for the Office than its predecessor.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court continues to work closely with OLAF. It has established formal procedures to ensure that the relations between the two organisations are efficient and effective. It has also established a constructive dialogue with the committee established to supervise the work of OLAF, under the chairmanship of Prof. Delmas-Marty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court has recently prepared an opinion, soon to be published, on a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council on the protection of the Community's financial interests. This directive is an important step forward in the fight against fraud. I would like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Court of Auditors for her impressive work and dedication over the years to make this important directive possible.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Statement of Assurance, the Court is of the opinion that the revised accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2000 reflect reliably the Community’s revenue and expenditure for the year and the financial situation at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the legality and regularity of underlying transactions are concerned, the audit of the principal management and control systems applicable to Agriculture and Structural Measures revealed weaknesses in the functioning of control procedures aiming to secure the legality and regularity of the transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">The audit of operational expenditure revealed an unacceptable incidence of error affecting the amount of the payments or the reality or the eligibility of the underlying transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the results of its audit work taken together, the Court is of the opinion that the transactions underlying the financial statements are, taken as a whole, legal and regular in respect of revenue, commitments and administrative expenditure but declines to provide this assurance in respect of payments in operational expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the last Annual Report the Court has adopted eighteen Special Reports to be taken into account in the discharge procedure, containing the results of audits which focus on a wide range of specific areas in which the Community’s financial management can be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the Court’s audits indicate significant positive findings. In the agricultural area the reformed clearance of accounts system and the Integrated Administrative and Control System have contributed to improved management of large amounts of European Union funds. The Commission’s strategy for dealing with BSE is basically sound.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Structural Measures, the URBAN Community Initiative has helped the implementation of many urban development projects and has enabled local authorities to access Union funds. In the external actions area, the work of the agency charged with the reconstruction of Kosovo, was found to be both efficient and economical. The TACIS cross-border co-operation programme is an instrument which has the potential to play a useful role in addressing issues relating to the new eastern border following the next accession.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it was also found that major objectives have either not been achieved, or only limited progress had been made. Further, it was frequently found that there was either insufficient or no evaluation by the Commission of the achievement of the objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s reform programme is increasing the focus on results and performance measurement, within a resource allocation framework reflecting predetermined priorities and defined objectives. The Court’s findings on recent programmes show that the Commission still faces major challenges in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important issues in the discussion that we had last year here in Parliament, when I presented the Annual Report for 1999, concerned the situation in the Member States. The results are striking. The Court has concentrated a large share of its resources on the audit of control systems in Member States as a follow up to this debate. Persistent weaknesses were found in Member States’ checking of community operations concerning programmes where management is shared between the Commission and the Member States. This was the case for the Integrated Administrative and Control System (IACS). It was also the case for export refunds, and concerning the control regulation for Structural Measures. Improving the control arrangements in the Member States is central to ensuring the correct use of Union funds. It is also important if the Court is to place some reliance for its own audit purposes on the checks carried out by the various audit and supervisory services in the Commission, and in the Member States. I will come back to this specific problem at the end of my speech.</p>
<p class="contents">The recast of the Financial Regulation, which is an important element of the Commission reform programme, maybe the first step that was taken, now seeks to clarify and strengthen the provisions relating to methods of implementation of the budget, advance payments, procurement, presentation of the accounts, and the offices. The introduction of new provisions intended to contribute to the establishment of a coherent legal framework in the field of budgetary execution, based on the primacy of the Financial Regulation, is another important improvement within the recast. However, as you will see from our Annual Report, some important matters of principle stated in the Court’s opinion on the proposed changes have not been followed, which may lead to serious complexity in financial management.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding enlargement, this year’s Annual Report has a new chapter dealing with pre-accession aid for which a separate financial perspective heading exists from 2000 onwards. In accordance with Parliament recommendations in its 1999 discharge resolution, the Court has been improving and intensifying the co-operation with the Supreme Audit Institutions of the candidate countries during the past few years.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in liaison with the Supreme Audit Institutions the Court has been intensifying the exchange of information at different levels of national administrations. The setting-up of national systems of internal control and the external audit of EU funds made available to the candidate countries require closer co-operation between the institutions even before accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement will bring about changes in the way the Council, the Commission and the Court of Justice will work. This is also true for the Court of Auditors and for Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, no one questions the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty to make the Court of Auditors one of the five independent institutions of the Union. The Nice Treaty will mean substantial organisational changes in the near future, also for the European Court of Auditors, where the Court will have the possibility of establishing an organisational structure in chambers with a more effective decision making, even if we will then consist of 25 Member States. The Court is actively preparing itself for this challenging reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court is developing its relations with the Commission’s new Internal Audit Service, with discussions covering a number of areas where we can work together. The Court is giving high priority to assessing how it will be able to use the work of the Internal Audit Service and the audit capabilities in the Directorates General. One very promising sign of progress in this field was the conference, under the challenging heading of "<span class="italic">Verstehen</span>" held at the initiative of the Internal Auditor, Mr Muis, on Thursday and Friday which Mrs Schreyer and Mrs Theato attended. I should like to say, as the President of the Court of Auditors, that this initiative might mean an extremely fruitful, concrete and promising step forward in the idea of a single audit system concerning European funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty states clearly that the European Court of Auditors assists the European Parliament and the Council in exercising their powers of control over the implementation of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and Gentleman, I am soon to retire as President and Member of the European Court of Auditors. During my seven years in the Court I have been privileged to contribute to the Court's growing importance, and to the continuous efforts it makes, in collaborating with Parliament and meeting its needs in optimising the assistance it provides.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court is addressing the need in its statement of assurance methodology for more information on the nature and causes of the problems affecting the management of Community funds by broadening the range of evidence in support of its conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent reforms in the area of financial management and internal audit will enable the Court to make greater use of the Commission’s work, not least for its work on the Statement of Assurance. The Court intends to continue to develop specific appraisals for each major area of Community activity as a complement to its Statement of Assurance. The specific appraisals are now envisaged in the Nice Treaty and are an important tool to help the discharge authority to make appropriate recommendations with a view to improving management.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the major tasks of the enlarged European Union will be the collaboration between European and National Supreme Audit Institutions. This has long been a key preoccupation of this Parliament. But, as we all know, this co-operation has advanced slowly and Parliament has repeatedly urged the Court to improve the situation. After having followed progress for a number of years I have arrived at the conclusion that a good result in this respect requires initiatives at a higher level than purely technical co-operation between the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Member States and the European Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to quote a Member of this Parliament, Mr Jacques Santer who pointed out, when he was President of the Commission, the importance of collaboration between the national parliaments and the European Parliament. It would also be a key factor in the field of Financial Control. The Supreme Audit Institutions act independently and have a strong collaboration with their respective national parliaments. So, collaboration between national parliaments and the European Parliament could have a major influence on national audit bodies and the European Court of Auditors, in particular in the matter of financial control.</p>
<p class="contents">The way of intergovernmental collaboration in this field is not the most practical route to take since the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Member States are, with the exception of my own country, independent of governments, as they are controlling them. But maybe the solution can be found in increased cooperation between this Parliament and the national parliaments of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finally add one little word. As parliamentarians in the European Parliament, as Commissioners in the European Commission, also as Auditors in the European Court of Auditors, we have a double role. We have to fulfil our tasks according to the Treaty; to fulfil them as Commissioners, as Parliamentarians and as Members of the Court of Auditors. But we also have another role in common. That is always to defend the idea of Europe.</p>

Let me thank the Court of Auditors, you, Mr Karlsson and the Court's members and staff for the 2000 Report and give especial additional thanks for the special reports, whose very practical recommendations make them very valuable to the Commission in its work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would most especially like to express my satisfaction with the Court's practical observations, and with the Court's support for two measures which are of particular concern to me. One, in the area of foreign policy, has to do with the reconstruction of Kosovo. The Court of Auditors has examined the accounting procedures and the profitability of the agency charged with the reconstruction of Kosovo and has come to a highly favourable conclusion, reporting that the agency has succeeded in achieving most of the high targets set for it, and that its administration and budget management were highly efficient economically.</p>
<p class="contents">I had strongly urged that the 2000 Budget should make available sufficient funds for the reconstruction of Kosovo. Parliament and, in particular, Mr Bourlanges, whom I would like to mention particularly in his capacity as principal rapporteur on the 2000 Budget, were also very much behind the idea that sufficient funds should be allocated for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">The good work that was done meant that funds for the agency charged with the reconstruction of Kosovo could even be increased in the course of the 2000 budget year. I am sure that Mr Bourlanges will feel, as I do, that it is quite simply very heartening when measures that one has been especially committed to get such a good report from the Court of Auditors. It goes without saying that this sends an important message to the taxpayers, that money is being invested well in Kosovo, and in an economically efficient way.</p>
<p class="contents">I emphasise this for the additional reason that there is a very intense debate going on in the media about the common foreign and security policy, with people asking: where is the European Union? where is the Commission? Here we have a quite tangible example of a common foreign policy measure and a tangible demonstration of what a good result can be achieved if we all pull together.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point about which I would like to speak personally, and on which I wish to express my thanks for the Court's support, is the Financial Regulation. The recast of the Financial Regulation is a highly comprehensive undertaking, on which the Court of Auditors gave its opinion in quick order and was of great help to the Commission, not only with the adoption of a formal position, but also with the many meetings on technical and administrative matters.</p>
<p class="contents">That may perhaps sound a bit arid, but the fact is that the Financial Regulation lays down Budget procedures in exact terms, stipulating who plays what role, who possesses which supervisory powers and whether, for example, there can be rapid redeployments in the Budget, and where they can be made, in order to take account of changes during the budget year.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to the Court of Auditors for making clear how important it is that all financial arrangements in specified sectors conform to Budget principles, or principles of sound budgeting. I am very grateful to you in this Parliament for the amendments you have proposed even before the summer recess. I can say quite unequivocally and definitely that the recast proposal gained a great deal in terms of quality as a result. For its part, the Commission has now done its homework; so too, on this point, has the Court of Auditors; and so too, to a quite broad extent in this area, has Parliament; I therefore believe it is actually high time for Parliament to formally take up its position, so that then the Council, too, can get its homework over and done with in a similarly short time.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I also want to consider some areas in which the Court made some highly critical comments. One case in point is the way in which the Monitoring Regulation for the Structural Funds has been implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the Member States who have primary responsibility for monitoring the legality of the use to which Structural Fund resources are put. It is, however, equally true that the Commission bears overall responsibility for the implementation of the Budget and thus for checking that monitoring regulations are clearly framed and enforceable and that the state of affairs does not come to pass in which more or less any Member State can come up with its own interpretation of the monitoring regulations and act accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The complaint most frequently levelled at the Structural Funds by the Member States is that the monitoring procedures are so complicated. This sometimes reaches the point where the conclusion is to say: ‘In future, we will have the Structural Funds only as a sort of lump sum transfer.’ The Commission, though, does not, of course, support this as the way forward, and I assume that Parliament does not support it either. For when funds go out of the European Budget, they do so in order to achieve definite objectives and not as a general settlement. It is, of course, true that, if we want things to be that way in future, we will have to work at simplifying the regulation in question. I join with the Court of Auditors in calling for a simpler scheme which, being more easily monitored, would lessen the likelihood of error.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Complicated procedure’ was also the criticism the Court of Auditors laid at the door of the Sapard programme of agricultural aid for the acceding countries. This afternoon the Commission will be debating the progress reports on the enlargement process as a whole, of which financial control is a very important part, as is the assessment of what progress has been made in the acceding states and of what problems remain to be overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Sapard, though, presents us with the problem of the over EUR 1 billion allocated for 2000 and 2001, of which in fact only EUR 16 million have so far been paid out. I must accept the Court of Auditors' criticism of what is, of course, a very poor result. This will also have to be discussed in the Commission, for the complicated procedure must not result in the funds ceasing to be used at all. When dealing with precise controls in the acceding states, we must, then, find a balance, but not to the detriment of implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the massive EUR 11.6 billion surplus in the 2000 Budget, the Court of Auditors has explained that a surplus should not be entered in the accounts for the following year, but should, if at all possible in the current budget year, allow the Member States to make reduced payments, which means that the Budget would then be adjusted downwards in the course of the year. I work on the assumption that the Council and the Finance Ministers would surely give this a favourable reception, but that there has to be more careful consideration of what is the right way forward here.</p>
<p class="contents">Of last year's Budget surplus, over EUR 3 billion was the result of increased income, which itself was a consequence of last year's growth figures in fact turning out better than had at first been assumed. It was, though, only in November that the official figures became available. Of the surplus, several hundred million euro represent real savings in agriculture as a result of favourable market developments. I see it as a very positive thing if we do not have to spend money, but whether that is actually the case will not be definitely known until the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who legislated for the Structural Funds had indeed already foreseen the possible difficulties in implementing the programme in its first year, and it is for that reason that the Interinstitutional Agreement provides for the option of transferring funds to subsequent years.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me again make it clear that I do not see it in a negative light if, at the end of the year, or, as the Court has proposed, possibly during the current year, funds can be returned to the Member States due to the money not being required. I am probably agreeing with certain comments made in this Parliament when I say that the distinction has to be drawn between the money not being needed in order to achieve a given objective, and the money not having been able to be used because of faulty budget management or shortcomings in administration.</p>
<p class="contents">That can be properly assessed only when we are no longer talking in the Budget procedure about how much money is being invested, but rather about what objectives we want to achieve. In this context, I take on board the Court of Auditors' remarks on evaluation and on how important it is in a good Budget procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors has confirmed the regularity of the accounts, in other words, that the books are in good order, and also of the revenue side of the Budget. It has also certified the reliability of the commitments and of the administrative outgoings. It has, however, criticised the excessive incidence of errors in cash movements.</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission, then, made too few changes in 2000 in order to improve financial management? Let me, on this point, refer to the Court of Auditors' statement that, in 2000, many steps towards reform had only just started to be taken, and that they will only gradually meet with success.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot, at this juncture, list all the steps we have taken since then, but I will all the same highlight a few of them. One example is in the personnel field. Additions have been made to the total personnel complement for financial management, among other things by redeployment within the Commission to reinforce the financial units in the various Directorates-General, and Parliament has made additional posts available for 2001. The selection procedure for these is at present in progress, and it will result in 250 candidates being put on a list to strengthen the financial and personnel management sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, in addition, to mention the steps we are taking in training and development. The Commission's reforms as a whole have meant that there is definitely a greater need for training. A total of 2 800 officials have already been trained in financial management by the Budget Directorate-General and another 1 700 will take part in courses of this sort in the next few months.</p>
<p class="contents">The technical assistance offices have also come in for a lot of criticism from us in the past. There are 126 of them, and 93 will have had their contracts with us cancelled by the end of 2001. I see this as an important point; it is something that has been achieved through pressure exerted by Parliament, and we will, for example, be continuing with decentralisation in the field of foreign affairs, in order to make greater use of local knowledge in implementing budget decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">This afternoon the Commission will be taking decisions about further new management systems and about the networking of national agencies. A few weeks ago, we adopted a comprehensive package to improve personnel policy. In the summer, I presented the report on the steps the Commission had either taken, or proposed to the legislature, to combat fraud, ranging from regulations on money laundering via customs measures through to the proposal for a European public prosecutor for financial offences.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much to do, but much has already been achieved. The Commission is not only active in well over 100 States. It also gives aid following natural catastrophes and gives humanitarian aid in crisis areas and war zones. It is active in many traditional fields, for example in aspects of agriculture, but it also makes funds available for many innovative projects suggested by Parliament. This may sometimes involve large amounts totalling millions, but sometimes, too, relatively small sums of money. We link up researchers and the results of their investigations, share in the financing of high-speed railway lines and of student exchange schemes. This represents a truly broad spectrum of areas of expenditure, and there is nothing rigid about it. The programmes change, the tasks change and the world changes, so we are all constantly being faced with new challenges, and all the European Union's institutions have to be open to them.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to create good European policies, which means learning from mistakes in order to make good measures even better. The reports of the Court of Auditors are a fundamental support to us in doing this. So I thank the Court, those of its members who are leaving, those who are continuing to be members of it, and most especially its President. Mr Karlsson, your presidency has seen the further development of the method for the statement of assurance, and the compilation of a very large number of special reports containing very definite and valuable recommendations. The understanding of financial management has improved under your presidency and so, I believe, has the institutions' understanding of each other. For that you have my most especial thanks.</p>

This is the last time you will present the report, as you are leaving office, as are a number of other Members of the Court. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and the retiring Members of the Court both personally and on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control for the years of excellent and effective cooperation and mutual trust under your presidency, and also under the previous presidency of Professor Friedmann, who is also retiring. There have occasionally been differences of opinion, but I believe that we have always managed to cooperate well, and we have, above all, performed a control function that has ultimately benefited the taxpayer. So once again, many thanks. The Annual Report of the Court before us today also demonstrates that we have made some further progress. I only want to highlight a couple of points.</p>
<p class="contents">The most striking point is the large surplus of own resources: EUR 11.6 million or over 14% of the budget has not been spent. The finance ministers are, of course, delighted, as this means that they will have to pay less to the EU next year, but we in the Committee on Budgetary Control are concerned to know which of the objectives that we have set ourselves have not been achieved. I believe that the Commission would be well advised – and I understand from the press that there will be surpluses again this year – to get to work on supplementary and rectifying budgets so that the money available is really spent on achieving objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The complex and cumbersome nature of the legal framework and the extent of the controls therefore involved are also a matter of concern both for the Parliament and for the Court of Auditors, and, as Commissioner Schreyer has just said, for the Commission too. We need to work to simplify things as a matter of urgency, so that the public can also obtain funding, rather than say, ‘It is so complicated. I do not want any money from the European Union’. Controls need to be proportionate but also to be effective, to lead to positive outcomes and to have a preventive effect.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is the positive statement of assurance, the SOA. Anyone looking for concrete figures or percentages in relation to payments will be disappointed. Once again, the Court has not mentioned any concrete figures. This House had actually pressed for that. The Court now wants to bring forward a refined method of producing this positive statement of assurance. We are more than happy to cooperate on this, but we also have to look and analyse where errors are due to the Member States and where they are the Commission's responsibility. The Commission is ultimately responsible, and it must accept this responsibility. I would like to thank you once again, Mr Karlsson, for your excellent cooperation, and I would like to wish all the retiring Members and you personally all the best for the future.</p>

I hope he will pass on our thanks to his other colleagues who are also leaving.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember that this report is the first report which assesses the first full year of the Prodi Commission – a Commission which, let us remind ourselves, was appointed with the specific remit of radical overhaul and reform of the European Union. The question we will be asking in our discharge procedure this year is: "Is the Commission delivering on that promise?". Let us be clear. If it is not, then the credibility of both the Prodi Commission and of this Parliament is on the line.</p>
<p class="contents">It is much too early to assess the success or failure of the Prodi Commission and of Commission reform. The only question we can ask at this point is whether we are headed in the right direction. Mr Karlsson, I noted your words last night. There are a number of hopeful signs in this report. So, where the Commission has specific responsibility, we do seem to be seeing some positive developments. As you say, the strategy on BSE is basically sound. The work of the Agency charged with the reconstruction of Kosovo was efficient and economical. The reform programme is heading in the right direction. You have approved the recasting of the financial regulation and the Commission's proposals on financial incentives for top grade officials, although I note that you have some concerns about the Commission's accounting mechanisms. Perhaps Mrs Schreyer could comment on that.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not going to let the Commission off the hook. There is a large area where the Commission has joint responsibility with the Member States, particularly in the agricultural sector and the structural funds. The primary responsibility must lie with the Member States. They are responsible for 85% of the budget. Here we see some serious structural weaknesses. In the structural funds, we see problems in the application of regulations at every level. The CAP accounts for over 40% of the budget and where Member States are responsible there is no improvement. Heads of stock continue be overstated.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands have not signed the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests. We are disappointed, Mr Karlsson, that you did not mention them by name in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Again the Court has failed to give a statement of assurance to the Commission. As I said last night, this is a complicated and ever-changing procedure and I do not believe the Commission will ever get a statement of assurance.</p>
<p class="contents">So the main message, as far as I can see, is that the Commission should keep going. It is on the right track. Member States must stop hiding behind the Commission and assume their proper responsibility of protecting EU taxpayers' money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is noticeable again that this year, as the Court of Auditors has already expressed in rather vague terms, there is no Statement of Assurance. The question arises as to how long this situation can continue like this. 2001 is the first year for which the current Commission shoulders all responsibility. In my opinion, there should come a day when a positive Statement of Assurance <span class="italic">can</span> be made. I should like to suggest that the Commission sets the year 2000 as a target date. For each year, an action plan should be drafted in which the Commission outlines its objectives. We must ensure that the necessary arrangements are then in place for certain Directorates-General, with a margin of error of, say, less than 1%.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Member States are concerned, we all know that that is where the money is spent. In my view, the system we are currently using for the agricultural funds is workable: if a Member State spends certain amounts inappropriately, the Commission will need to introduce capping. I should like to see the Commission make proposals for extending this system to include other sectors of the budget, notably the Structural Funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have started to wade through this tome. I have to admit that this 24th Annual Report seems superior and that more names are included than before. In other words, this Annual Report is simply a better read, it has to be said. It also becomes clear that you are sending out a message, namely an urgent request for simplifying legislation. Indeed, if legislation were simplified, fewer mistakes would be made, fewer irregularities would occur and this would probably result in less fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">When I read what was happening with the own resources and when I saw the results of the database, which gives an overview of all cases of fraud and irregularities established since 1996, amounting to EUR 1.5 billion, I appreciated the significance of what we are doing. On the basis of the Court of Auditors report, the OLAF reports, the work carried out by the rapporteurs and also our own studies, we will need to explain to the European taxpayers how their money is being spent.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted with the fact that the Annual Report devotes much attention to the role of the Member States. Indeed, they do not sufficiently inspect the Community programmes which they manage in conjunction with the Commission. Neither do they fight fraud satisfactorily when they collect their revenue. The VAT carrousels are a prime example of this. Finally, as Mrs Morgan has already stated, the Member States fail to implement legislation adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I should once again like to haul my own country over the coals. In the Blak report, Belgium was attacked for not yet having ratified the 1995 agreement. I have exchanged correspondence in this respect with the President of the Belgian Parliament, and four months ago, I was promised that this agreement would be ratified during the Belgian Presidency. That has not been done to date. That is an outright scandal, and I am grateful to the Court of Auditors for once again giving us the necessary ammunition today to ensure that the Belgian government and the Belgian Parliament carry out their tasks at long last. It is a disgrace which we must continue to denounce in public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those were the words of a former President of the Court of Auditors, Bernhard Friedmann, and if we take those words as a yardstick for this year's report, then we really have to ask just how successful the Union's policies are in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before us summarises what we already know from many other reports: there is still a need for reform in financial management and the way funds are implemented. There are dramatic shortcomings in many areas, which suggests that financial errors are endemic. The Commission's tendency to blame irregularities and deficits the Court discovers chiefly on the Member States is unacceptable. Of course the Member States cannot shake off their own responsibilities, if there are irregularities or fraud in the Member States, the Commission must act accordingly. The recovery rate, that is the reimbursement of funds that have been lost, is not satisfactory. It is not acceptable if Member States underperform in the fight against fraud because of lax controls and are then slow to get funds reimbursed as well. Politically speaking, the Commission has final responsibility for the EU budget and it is accordingly also responsible for efficient implementation of funds and checks.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the things mentioned in the Commission's responses on last year's report is that new systems are being introduced which primarily aim to make it easier to check the efficiency of VAT collection in the individual Member States. Given that significant shortcomings have also been identified in this area, we also have to ask how effective these control mechanisms are. I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for its successful investigative work and I call on the Commission to take further structural reform actions so that mismanagement and financial errors become a thing of the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Well, first of all and very simply, I shall say goodbye and thank you to President Karlsson.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall say goodbye, now that you are leaving us, after giving many years of loyal service, and thank you for the excellent cooperation that you developed with this House and for the quality of this report, which now seems like an impressive aircraft carrier, surrounded by a squadron of special reports.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall make three brief comments, as I have very little time. First of all, I believe that you are right to emphasise that the major problem with the 2000 budget is the massive under-implementation of a number of funds. Admittedly, Mrs Schreyer is right to say that there are sometimes good reasons for this under-implementation, but generally the budgetary authority feels a sense of frustration and is aware that there are problems related to this under-implementation. I shall give four examples. The first is the overly complex regulations, the difficulties in managing the project cycle, the poor interaction in execution and control between the Commission and the Member States, and, lastly, the often pernickety control which has the effect of taking away responsibility. These are the areas we will be focusing on in the discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one comment to make on the DAS. I am pleased to see that the Court of Auditors is keeping a good distance and we must do the same thing with the error rate. The overall error rate is merely the scientifically dubious aggregation of spot checks, which, whilst interesting, are random. I do not want everything to hinge on the error rate, which will determine everything. The Court of Auditors is reassessing this issue. Parliament must monitor and support this.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final comment relates to the management of surpluses. In my view, it is a shame that surpluses are systematically reimbursed to Member States. In fact, economically speaking, this management strategy has a pro-cyclical effect, which is absurd.

This is yet another important contribution to our understanding of the vital need to promote a thorough reform of the CAP in areas such as the funding of exports of agricultural products.</p>
<p class="contents">Until today, I had never read, in one publication, such a devastating set of facts on the misuse of public funds by the European institutions, some of which are worth highlighting. EUR 80 million from the Community budget were used to fund supplies to Iraq, in breach of the embargo imposed by the United Nations. Little or none of this money has to date been recovered. According to statements made by the Russian customs authorities themselves in August 2000, almost 80% of Community subsidies for exports to that country, currently being examined by OLAF, have proved to be fraudulent. It should be remembered that Russia is the main destination for subsidised European exports. The Community has set up free import agreements with candidate countries, but is still subsidising the export of dairy products to these countries. As a result, we have the classic roundabout scenario already seen in Estonia, in which the Community subsidised butter exports, which were then imported free from customs duties. The number of supposedly pure-bred cattle whose export the Community has already funded would be enough to give some importer countries, with Mediterranean or desert climates, huge reserves of pure-bred European cattle.</p>
<p class="contents">The system of control and monitoring bodies, designed to ensure the veracity of export statements has proved to be a complete fiasco. The Commission assured us, even in the context of the last budgetary discharge and on the Fléchard procedure, that exports to Russia in particular, were now being properly monitored. This report by the Court of Auditors categorically disproves the Commission’s words. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Can we draw clear conclusions from it? No, not really. That is why my group hopes that the discharge procedure will eventually give us the answer to the following questions: which countries cause most problems, which areas of policy are most problematic and what can be done about this, where does the Commission carry out its tasks and where does it fail to do so, but also where have improvements been made and where has that not been the case? We can already detect some improvement. That is partly thanks to the commitment by this European Parliament, but also the Court of Auditors, for which we are very grateful. However, this is still not enough. Moreover, it is still not possible to issue a general Statement of Assurance, and the budget surplus is currently at an all-time high. Progress has thus been made in small ways, but that is not enough to really gain the confidence of the people in Europe. In the final analysis, that is what we all need to work towards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are an incredible number of problems which crop up again and again, year after year. Lamentable control systems in the Member States, lost income from VAT, bureaucratic and complicated export refund arrangements, farmers who overstate how much land they have, misappropriation of structural funds, fraud involving research funds in the form of over-payment, and long-winded and bureaucratic procedures concerning the EU’s external aid. It is the same old story every single year. However, it is now the Member States that are the biggest culprits. It cannot be said often enough. The agricultural and structural funds are what cause us problems. There is a very tough approach this year to the management of the structural funds. I proposed last year in my discharge report that the Commission should impose fines upon those Member States which offend again and again, and I am extremely pleased that Mrs Schreyer and the Commission have promised to look constructively at this possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Denmark is also mentioned a couple of times in the annual report, and that is a couple of times too many. There are problems with farmers’ overstating how much land they have, and pathetic control systems at quite a few custom houses. The Danish practice of collecting users’ fees for the issue of export refunds has also been found to be illegal. It is thanks to the Court of Auditors that the Commission has finally realised what is unlawful about this practice. I am also pleased that we are working on the problems caused through the pile of work involving guarantee payments in Denmark, which are a disaster. In this area, too, the Commission has been a good and effective partner.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also say to Mr Karlsson that I should never in my life have believed that a Dane would end up missing a Swede. That is, however, the case and, since I, myself, am also leaving Parliament after this parliamentary term, we must set up a club for former Scandinavian MEPs in which we can rhapsodise about the old days. I think that the children’s book, ‘Karlsson-on-the-Roof’ was written with you in mind. Thank you for your fruitful cooperation over seven years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, we need to recognise that, once again, the Court of Auditors has been unable to give a positive statement of assurance in respect of Commission expenditure. I want to resist our gradually starting to regard the abnormal as being the norm. We can perhaps do that in this case, but certainly not outside this area. If this statement of assurance is procedurally weak, then I expect the Court of Auditors to make a statement to that effect. Otherwise we must note that there is a weakness in Commission expenditure that needs to be criticised politically speaking.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that I am very grateful to you, Commissioner, for having highlighted the link between today's debate on progress reports in connection with enlargement and the report of the Court of Auditors. The Court of Auditors has told us that in respect of the new pre-accession instruments there was actually a zero expenditure policy in 2000. That means that in practice – and the Commission is talking about the first candidate countries acceding in 2004 – we have already wasted 20% of the time available in the financial area. And that means of course that we will have to work even harder in the coming years in order to implement the pre-accession instruments properly.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is a comment about OLAF. I was surprised, Mr Karlsson, that your report more or less suggested that by adding a reserve for setting up OLAF, Parliament had affected the independence of that body. We felt obliged to do this when the Commission – as you know – simply transferred all UCLAF's staff to OLAF, and apparently thought the job was done. And all the more so when we discovered from the OLAF Monitoring Committee for which you have such high regard that OLAF's independence genuinely was at risk. Now that we have been able to deal with the Commission, and I would specifically like to thank Mrs Schreyer for that, we have a new problem. This is an area where I believe the Commission should step in, Mrs Schreyer.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Berlusconi government is now blocking one of the central posts in the new OLAF. I would be grateful if we could all pull together on this one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now that we have been working off the inherited liabilities for several years, something that has consistently attracted media attention, it now seems to me that we are tackling more systemic problems where it is not so much spectacular individual cases that are at stake, but rather whether systems are flawed in some way. I would like to address once again three points that arose most often in the debate. The first one is the high level of unimplemented appropriations. In the course of the discharge procedure, we will have to ask ourselves whether this is attributable to the caution officials exercise before they will sign something off and spend money, or whether it is to do with overcomplicated rules.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, given the many complaints I hear from my constituents and others about all the red tape you have to cope with in dealing with Brussels if you want to get support for something, I fear that I know the answer already. Although I am willing to accept it if this is clearly refuted, this is still an issue we need to sort out.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the statement of assurance, which has just been mentioned, and Mr Bösch has pointed out the dilemma we face. We need to ask ourselves if there are more reliable instruments or if we are treating this statement of assurance in the same way that the Council does year after year, that is as a kind of weather report that is not binding in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is this: we need to establish whether the Member States' handling of EU money has got worse or whether it is just being scrutinised more carefully now. If the latter is the case, that would represent some progress and the Commission could be given some credit for that. But it is the Commission's job to step up pressure on the Member States, and we will be glad to help out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish I could resign every time we met in order to listen to this lovely music. So thank you very much for all the nice words. Not least, when I go home to Sweden I shall tell them of these kind words from Denmark. Thank you, Mr. Blak.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise there is a heavy agenda, but I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall start with what Mr Kuhne has just said. It seems that a number of issues have been put behind us and there is a feeling – which I also had yesterday in a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control – that we are now able to address some major issues for the future. The first is one which underlies the budget surplus problem. It is not so much the revenue I am thinking of, as the under-utilisation and the under-implementation of funds, which, in turn, has a lot to do with our problems in achieving good management and fighting fraud – namely the over-complexity of Union funds and administration and regulations. I have had a long discussion on that with the discharge rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, and I feel confident that this problem will be addressed now.</p>
<p class="contents">My personal advice to Parliament is to do everything in its power, together with other institutions, to simplify things. On all the major issues, such as the pre-accession funds, structural funds and export refunds and on the market regulations in agriculture, we have built a mountain of complexity which, if I may for once step into the realm of political judgment, raises the major question of the European citizens' confidence in this Union. I would say that if I had to choose one of the tasks that Mr Kuhne mentioned as being the most important, it would be: simplify, for heaven's sake!</p>
<p class="contents">I wish you every success in that. I think that this Parliament, together with the Court of Auditors and the other institutions, will in the future manage to increase confidence among European citizens in our great project, which, of course, is the primary goal for all of our institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">With that, I thank you once again, on behalf of myself and my colleagues, for your kind words and for this most stimulating and interesting exchange of views. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
