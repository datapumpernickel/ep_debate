<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hans Winkler, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although a great deal has already been said under item 4 on the order of business about the elections in Palestine, the consequences resulting from them, and the way forward in their aftermath, I would like to raise a number of points that were the theme of the Council meeting on Monday.</p>
<p class="contents">The first thing to be said – and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs De Keyser and all the Members who have participated in observing this election – is that the elections went according to plan. Everyone is agreed on that, and I believe that they were an unambiguous and democratic expression of the popular will. That is beyond question.</p>
<p class="contents">The response from the Presidency and practically all the foreign Ministers of the European Union Member States was immediate, and they acted independently of each other, in a manner indicating that they were, in essence, guided by the same principles. I would refer the House also to the statements made by the Middle Eastern Quartet between 26 and 30 January, which make it clear that the international community continues to regard a lasting and peaceful solution of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians as conditional upon non-violence, the acknowledgement of Israel’s right to exist, and compliance with all current bilateral obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">It was and is particularly important that the statements by the Council and the Member States of the European Union were almost indistinguishable from those made by our partners in the Quartet. What both the Quartet and the European Union expect of any future Palestinian government is an unambiguous commitment to the principles I have enumerated, and they stress that international support for the new Palestinian Autonomous Authority will very definitely be conditional upon adherence to these principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel and the Palestinian Autonomous Authority have again been reminded of the obligations imposed on them by the Roadmap, and, in taking this line, the Quartet has received substantial backing from the Council, which also expects of the newly-elected Palestinian Legislative Council that it will endorse a government committed to the principles of a peaceful and negotiated solution to the conflict with Israel founded upon agreements already reached and on the Roadmap, to the rule of law, to reforms and to proper management of its finances. If all these things are in place, the European Union will be prepared to continue to support the Palestinians in their economic development and in their building of a democratic state.</p>
<p class="contents">To come to decisions at the present time would be premature, and, as we cannot do that, we must instead spell it out loud and clear that the European Union, like the other partners that are making their own contributions, is prepared to continue giving its support subject to certain conditions being met.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate was, of course, originally prompted by the subject of East Jerusalem, and I would now like to say a few things with specific reference to that. What emerged from the previous debate was the very clear expectation that the European Union should take an even-handed approach, with a coherent policy in the Middle East that is guided not merely by the interests of either Israel or the Palestinians, but for which balance is an absolute requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is, moreover, concerned about Israel’s activities in and around East Jerusalem, including the continuing settlement and extension of the dividing wall, as well as the destruction of Palestinians’ homes. These activities are contrary to international law, make a final settlement of the Jerusalem issue less likely and threaten to make impossible a solution founded upon the coexistence of two viable states.</p>
<p class="contents">These considerations have prompted the Council to ask the relevant Council offices to produce for the EU a detailed analysis of the East Jerusalem situation, drawing on data supplied by the EU’s missions in Jerusalem and Ramallah.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Council decided on 12 December, in view of the change in the situation, notably the prospect of elections to the Knesset in Israel, not to publish this study, but instead to inform high-ranking representatives of the Israeli Government of the European Union’s concerns in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, there have been two <span class="italic">démarches</span> – one by the EU troika to the Israeli foreign ministry on 19 December and another by the presidency to the principal Israeli political parties on the 23rd of that month.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has noted with approval the decision by Israel to allow some voting to take place in East Jerusalem, which will contribute to the successful conduct of the elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On Monday, the EU Foreign Ministers and the Quartet met to discuss our reaction to the entry of Hamas into the Palestinian national political arena, and the implications for our assistance to the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me bear three elements in mind. The first are our principles, which should be absolutely clear. We supported these elections by providing financial support of 18.5 million EUR. In addition, we have heard about 240 election observers under Mrs De Keyser’s great leadership. We also demonstrated our commitment to building democratic institutions. I think this is clearly a principled position. Should we now abandon this position today because we do not like the result of the elections? I think that would also clearly be a mistake. On the contrary, we should call for all to respect the outcome of a democratic election. When I visited Gaza, I clearly said that we were ready to work with a government that seeks peace by peaceful means. As the Quartet reiterated, that means cooperation, a clear commitment to non-violence, a recognition of Israel and the acceptance of previous commitments including the roadmap and the Oslo agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the responsibilities: the ball is now in the camp of the Palestinian leaders. It is their responsibility to behave like partners and to meet the criteria set by the international community. It is not yet clear how Hamas, under its change and reform platform, will exercise the responsibilities that a new Palestinian government will need to assume. This will take time to become apparent. In both these discussions, I have advocated a clear message from the international community as to what we expect. I have also said that the European Commission stands ready to work with any government that is really seeking peace by peaceful means.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are mindful of the economic and humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people, which are indeed considerable. We are also mindful of the legitimate Palestinian aspirations for statehood. We must bear in mind that donor funding is crucial in alleviating the plight of ordinary Palestinians and in preventing the vicious cycle of poverty and extremism. But we are also mindful of our own commitment to a two-state solution and to Israel’s security needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, first and foremost, we expect future members of a Palestinian government to commit to these three principles. This applies to the EU-Palestinian Interim Association Agreement. This clearly states that freedom of democracy, the rule of law and human rights have to be respected. In addition, the Neighbourhood Action Plan also clearly provides that the roadmap has to be the path to peace.</p>
<p class="contents">While the conduct of Hamas, as an organisation, will continue to be the subject of close scrutiny, the new Palestinian government must in the first instance be judged on its actions, including the provision of security and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">The stabilisation of public finances is a major and immediate challenge. I am ready to be constructive in reacting to the fiscal problems of the Palestinian Authority – especially now for the interim government and for the caretaker government – by easing their liquidity problems. But others, too, must play their role. This includes Israel, which has been called upon to continue to transfer customs revenues to the Palestinian Authority. I, as well as other Quartet members, will also personally speak to the Israelis about this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the Palestinians themselves, will also be crucial. The World Bank is sending a mission to see what it can do and how the Palestinian Authority could meet the benchmarks, maybe retrenching the budget. They have to find a possibility of lifting the suspension on World Bank Trust Fund payments. USD 35 million are still lying there. They have not been disbursed because they could not be disbursed. I hope I can count on the support of Parliament to find a short-term solution. However, it will also be important for the new government to get essential reforms back on track. This should be done in the same spirit as when we worked with the Palestinian Authority in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the Commission intends to continue those aid programmes which provide for the basic needs of the Palestinians, including the infrastructure facility, food aid and humanitarian and refugee assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing let me say that the peace process is – as we all know – at a very critical juncture. The year 2005 was dominated by unilateral Israeli actions and Palestinian institutional paralysis. The international community must now provide a tangible perspective of progress, using our efforts on both sides, with the Israelis and with the Palestinian Authority. In this context, I agree, we have to strengthen Mahmoud Abbas and his authority in order to provide stability and demonstrate that the negotiations will bring positive results. It is for this reason that I would like to underline the importance of avoiding all unilateral actions which threaten to prejudice final status negotiations, including terrorist attacks, settlement expansions and the routing of the separation barrier.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, therefore, we have to work together very closely: the days and months ahead will be absolutely crucial in determining stability in the Middle East, as well as our own stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the outset I would like to thank the other 26 Members of the European Parliament on the delegation for their work, particularly my deputy chairman, Mrs Napoletano, and, of course Mrs de Keyser, in her capacity as chief observer of the European Union’s team. I would also like to thank the staff of the European Parliament who came with us and who did an outstanding job in very difficult circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week on the streets of Palestine we heard the clamour for choice and change. We heard the noise of democracy. We found out, as one of my colleagues put it, that the process was perfect. Voters went freely to the polls, men, women, young and old. The polling stations, usually in schools and administered by teachers, were efficient and well organised. By and large the Israeli forces kept out of the way. The process was perfect and there is no doubt that the result reflected the wish of the people, but the product more reflects their despair of Fatah than their love of Hamas. Indeed, the Hamas people we met were not very loveable.</p>
<p class="contents">Not just in Palestine, but elsewhere in the Arab world – including in Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood did so well in November and December; in the Moroccan parliamentary elections to come – we are about to see the emergence of fundamentalist Islamist politics across the Arab world, an Arab world of 250 million people. That is the challenge to all our institutions. We must work together, because in my view, although we imparted the process of democracy, we did not impart the values of democracy that we are so used to in the European Union. Democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for the protection of minorities: these are the values we need to impart. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Véronique De Keyser, </span></span>  <span class="italic">chairman of the EU Observation Mission in the Palestinian Territories</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, my first thoughts go to the members of the mission who are still on the ground. I have received many words of thanks that I should like to share with them: they did an extraordinary job. I also received a great deal of help from the Council, from Mr Marc Otte, who was there in Palestine, and from Jeanette. However, I should like to thank you, in particular, Commissioner. You had to guide me through some difficult decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I will mention two of them. Firstly, the deployment of our mission to Gaza amid hazardous security conditions. From the beginning, we were the only observation mission deployed in Gaza. Next, the delicate decision, Commissioner, to meet the candidates of ‘Change and Reform’, Hamas’ list of candidates. Obviously, we chose the candidates that we were going to meet; they were moderate candidates. I should also like to say, however, that we were the only mission to meet candidates from the ‘Change and Reform’ party and that history proves us right to have done so, since 44% of the Palestinian population voted in favour of them.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to point out that we are faced with three challenges. The first challenge – which I too find difficult – is to respect the Palestinian people’s choice, which was, as Mr McMillan-Scott said, one in favour of change and not necessarily of radical Islamism. It is not a case of all Palestinians, or indeed of half of the population, having become radical Islamists. They want change both inside and outside Palestine, together with the peace that is a long time coming.</p>
<p class="contents">The second challenge, Commissioner, is not to give in to the temptation of unilateralism in the quest for peace. Not since the time of Yitzhak Rabin have we seen any hint of bilateralism in the decisions and negotiations between Israel and Palestine. The withdrawal from Gaza was a unilateral decision. The presence of Hamas in the Palestinian Government today would strengthen that unilateralism and would not lead to peace. I hope that the European Union will work along those lines.</p>
<p class="contents">The third challenge consists of making a distinction, irrespective of the circumstances, between the Palestinian Government, which will have to face up to its responsibilities, and the Palestinian people, which cannot be taken hostage on account of the choice it has made. Admittedly, the people made this choice, but it has basic needs that we will have to ensure are met whatever the future holds; otherwise we will be heading for a catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, let me tell you what a Palestinian woman said to me just after the elections. In response to my question: ‘are you not afraid of being governed by Sharia law?’ she said: ‘No, we were not afraid of saying no to the Israelis, who are stronger than us. We were not afraid of saying no to Fatah because it let us down. We will be able to say no to Hamas if it subsequently lets us down’. There you have the entire lesson in parliamentary democracy that the Palestinians have completely understood.</p>

In fact, they are like an x-ray of a society at a precise moment in time. These elections are a call for realism for all of us and a call for an end to hypocrisy in the international community. Millions of Palestinians are desperate. They have nothing to lose and they vote for those who promise any change, any reform, and an end to corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">We speak too much about the Middle East and too little about the real situation of men, women, children and elderly people who, along with their families, are desperate. We must respect this will. We must deliver a message of respect to this new majority. It must, however, be combined with a message pointing out that our support is conditional upon the end of violence, violent resistance and terrorism. But we must respect the will of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not pretend we will keep showing the same movie and keep the same script, but simply change one of the characters. That would be a recipe for failure. We are faced with a new scenario that requires new proposals, a new commitment and new pressures on both sides. The current situation has arisen precisely because we have not done this.

Now would be the worst possible time to abandon the region and the Palestinian people, and at the same time we should learn the appropriate lessons. What have we learnt from our involvement in the region and our aid to the Palestinian people? What have we learnt from saying for years that the solution was elections and democracy, that they were a step forwards and a condition for peace, when we are now seeing that those elections have become a problem rather than a solution?</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard no self-criticism from the Council or the Commission with regard to what we have done wrong, after investing billions of euros.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this Hamas victory reflects a situation in which Israeli policy has managed to realise a self-fulfilling prophecy. For years they have said: there is no Palestinian partner for peace. Well, in the end that is precisely what they have achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must now make it abundantly clear that, if Hamas wants to continue, it must accept the rules of the game and the agreements already reached by the Palestinian Government, it must recognise Israel and it must disband its militias. And at the same time we must work very hard to open up a prospect for peace.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the fundamental reasons for Hamas’s victory is that there is no hope, there is no hope of a definitive agreement in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Palestinians’ quality of life has continued to deteriorate year after year. The Quartet’s commitments on the ground to improve the well-being of the Palestinians have progressed at a snail's pace, very slowly, and the complicated procedures and obstacles have not been convincingly overcome.</p>

<p class="contents">The election count confirmed Hammas as the first political power and this result must be respected. At the same time, the result should not come as a surprise. It is the consequence of numerous factors both local and international.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinians, despite the pronouncements of the West, have unfortunately not yet seen the objective of creating their own independent state being promoted. However, they have seen the racist policy of the wall and settlement being legalised. The result constitutes a message both to the Palestinians themselves and to the international community, especially us, about our inadequate policy, which failed to exert pressure on Israel to apply the road map and the UN resolutions in order to promote a political process and was content merely to support the Palestinians financially.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I am not sure if we were able to receive these messages, given that today a resolution which is one-sided and unilateral is being promoted in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Our reaction to the new government cannot be to stop efforts to restart the peace process, as announced by the United States. At the same time, Hammas needs to denounce violence, recognise the right of the state of Israel to exist and cooperate with President Abbas in continuing the peace process. At the same time, reconfirmation is needed, both by the European Union and by the other members of the Quartet, of the undertaking to create an independent Palestinian state next to the state of Israel with East Jerusalem as its capital. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What I do believe we can say without any mistake is that the presence of the European Union’s electoral observation mission has been a notable success for the European Commission and that — as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has said — it increases the Union’s visibility and contributes to the consolidation of democracy throughout the world. We must therefore congratulate the Commission and also our fellow Members Mr McMillan-Scott and Mrs De Keyser, as well as the other Members of this Parliament who accompanied them.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I believe that it would be premature to draw the conclusion that the spluttering peace process in the Middle East will be buried as a result of these elections or that these elections herald the death of the Oslo agreements. I believe that we must allow a little time to pass and see what moves are made. In particular, despite the mistakes made, we must treat the President of the Palestinian National Authority as a legitimate interlocutor, wait until the new government is formed, remembering — as Mrs De Keyser said — that 75% of the citizens who have voted for this political formation do not want the destruction of Israel and, finally, Madam President, assess what impact this electoral process will have on the Israeli elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Sooner or later, Commissioner, however, regardless of the urgent short-term issues, the European Union will have to give its opinion on something that is fundamental: whether the immense needs — as you have said — of the Palestinian people are compatible with the existence of Hamas, whose founding convention calls for the liquidation and destruction of the State of Israel, and the fact that it appears on the European Union's list of terrorist organisations.</p>

Over and above that, these are historic elections: this is the first democratic change in the Arab world.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinian people did not vote in favour of Hamas, it voted against Fatah. Hamas won on the basis of a programme centred on the fight against corruption and on the reform of the PLO, the only organisation authorised to negotiate. Above all, it won on the basis of a social programme to be implemented specifically within Palestine. Those were my specific impressions when, away from our mission, I met the Palestinian mayors and their association, which is dominated by Hamas. As for aid, we must continue helping the Palestinian people, make sure that officials are paid and, above all, prevent the State from collapsing, otherwise the Palestinian Authority will fall into the hands of another country.</p>

<p class="contents">There are six references, seven recitals and twelve articles in this text on the Palestinian election result, and not once do they manage to mention – even mention – Hamas and the Charter of hate underpinning its ideology and its action. Mr Schapira just said how despicable – I think that that was the term used - the Charter is, and Mr Cohn-Bendit spoke of a repugnant charter. Clearly, I share these opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say that we deserve a Nobel ‘Cliché’ Prize at a time when, despite the Charter, we have actually heard the Middle East Quartet, Europe’s ministers, the media and Mr Solana, only a few moments ago, asking themselves the crucial question: how can we cooperate with Hamas and continue providing our vital assistance to the Palestinians if Hamas does not renounce terror and does not recognise Israel? Mahmoud Abbas, for his part, does not pull any punches when it comes to setting out his demands faced with the Islamists.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, the ballot was democratic – at least in terms of the way in which it was carried out. Yes, Hamas won. Yes, we want to continue helping the Palestinian Authority. Yes, in the end it is up to Hamas today to take the crucial decisions and to change. This is what needed to be said no less clearly and directly to the pragmatists on both sides: a democratic ballot has just brought to power an undemocratic ideology. That is the persistently difficult equation that we need to resolve today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to congratulate the Palestinians and say a big thank you to my colleagues. There are still problems in Israel and Palestine, however. Palestine is occupied. The fact is highlighted in a list of UN resolutions, which criticise Israel’s ongoing breaches of international law, as well as the settlements, the dreadful Wall and the attempt to annex East Jerusalem – just to mention the worst problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficult situation in Palestine is mentioned in the common motion for a resolution, which contains a number of constructive points. The proposal sets out the relevant conditions for Hamas. We must keep a careful watch to ensure that Hamas does not again have recourse to terrorism, it now having kept the peace for more than a year. Certainly, we must not take away the right they have under the Geneva Convention to armed resistance to the occupation, but we must make determined and carefully considered efforts to ensure that the situation does not get out of control. All non-governmental groups should be disarmed both in Palestine and among the Israeli settlers. We must discourage any form of radicalisation in both Palestine and Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution that is before us might well be read as a unilateral recognition and, if we are to help bring about peace, that would of course be dangerous. I would therefore call on Members to vote in favour of the amendments by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, especially the amendment to paragraph 10, which contains a very clear formulation of the Council’s decision not to publish the report on East Jerusalem, prepared by the Heads of Delegation in Palestine. Once this report’s criticism of the situation in East Jerusalem, together with the attendant recommendations, have been clearly withdrawn, the motion for a resolution will be a tool well suited to making further progress towards a just peace between Israel and Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">I would call on us to be consistent now. We do not have sufficient credibility among the Palestinians, and it is time we did so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe, however, that the failure to publish the report on East Jerusalem – which in actual fact is the focus of the debate – and the failure to adopt appropriate measures effectively gave Hamas a helping hand, because there is no doubt that certain truths should not be left unspoken.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it was on the cards that Hamas would win. Much of the responsibility for that lies with the international community, which, after the Oslo agreements were signed, was incapable of ensuring that international law would prevail and be respected. Thus it neither implemented the ‘two peoples, two states’ principle, nor guaranteed Mahmoud Abbas sufficient support, since funding alone is not enough – what the Palestinians want is political support. Nor did it, at the same time, exert the necessary pressure on Israel to prevent the growth of the settlements and the annexation of land.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, although the international community had the strength needed to exert pressure, I feel that it did not succeed in ensuring that negotiations would effectively be resumed. Nonetheless, the Palestinians managed to respond with a democratic electoral process in which the people did take part, expressing their need for life, justice and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">For me as a woman, the Hamas victory is a terrible outcome; I see it almost certainly, however, as a protest vote against al-Fatah, which held sway over Palestinian society for many years but was unable to keep its promises, and also against corruption, although that is a somewhat demagogical issue. In my view, it really is the European Commission’s and the international community’s task to rekindle the dialogue and to keep it alive, thus ensuring that both Hamas and Israel can put a stop to violence and acknowledge the ‘two peoples, two states’ principle in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that it now has attracted a democratic mandate does not alter or dilute its terrorist persona. Coming from Northern Ireland, I can speak from an experience of a like terrorist organisation – the IRA – also securing an electoral base. There, fundamental mistakes were made in the hope of encouraging them away from the paths of terror. The values of democracy were distorted, unwarranted concession after concession was made, but as each was pocketed, new demands appeared. That is how terrorist organisations think and work, as they fight their long, multi-faceted war.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge that a firm and resolute stand be taken, with no fudging and no budging from the principle that no aid can flow from the EU to an authority run by the terrorists of Hamas.

That goal is to guarantee both the existence and security of Israel and the creation of a Palestinian state. Significant steps have recently been made in that direction, thanks to the work of Ariel Sharon and Abu Mazen.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the electoral success of Hamas likely to be a setback for us? Is it likely to turn Palestine into a new theocratic, fundamentalist regime? The words of Mahmoud Zahar, the Hamas spokesman, who promised a new Palestinian Government without secular members because ‘they bring in AIDS and homosexuality’, certainly do not bode well, and nor do other statements about Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has a duty to make its voice heard, through strong political initiatives to force Hamas to keep to the path that has already been embarked upon. Europe will have to make the new government realise that if it were to think of threatening Israel’s existence it would lose the funds intended for Palestine. If Hamas chooses the path of intolerance, it will cause its people great harm and have a negative effect on the outcome of the Israeli elections. Let us therefore support Abu Mazen and welcome the idea of his visiting the European Parliament. Let us also stand up for the rights of Christian Palestinians: they are a minority threatened with extinction in the Middle East, but are an important factor for peace and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us work confidently so that the ideas of Anwar Zaboun, who said that negotiations with Israel are <span class="italic">haram</span>, or forbidden by religion, do not prevail.

<p class="contents">It therefore appears perverse that the threat should today be made to turn off the flow of European funding to the Palestinian Authority. If that were to happen, there would be a risk of aggressive states and groupings taking the EU’s place and of unemployed Palestinian soldiers and police officers being recruited by Al-Qaeda.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remind ourselves of the fact that, on 13 June 1980, at the Venice Summit, the EC recognised the PLO. It went on, through dialogue, to guide what had once been a terrorist organisation along the path that led to it recognising Israel’s right to exist and participation in the peace process. Hamas’ election victory now presents us with a similar challenge. It is worthy of note that the USA, before the elections, made it known that there had to be talks with Hamas, despite its being on the list of terrorist organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must now make its own constructive contribution and, as soon as possible, invite a delegation from the newly-elected Palestinian Assembly to Brussels, for it is now that confidence-building measures – rather than threatening gestures – are urgently called for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We doubt the new Palestinian Authority’s wish to build bridges of confidence and cooperation, yet we overlook Israel’s continued construction of the separation barrier. We rightly fund democratic institutions in Palestine, yet we impede the right to self determination of the people annexed in East Jerusalem.

There are conclusions that we have to draw from this. We have to work even more to make EU aid visible, for by so doing we will get the message across to the public that peace and democracy are worth supporting. I believe it is not just governments that need to hear that.</p>
<p class="contents">This election result is a disaster for the region. One can certainly talk in terms of a five-year rhythm here: it was about ten years ago that Rabin died, and terrorist acts meant that Peres was not elected; five years later saw the start of the Intifada, and now here we are again. Things keep starting over and over again from square one.</p>
<p class="contents">Even so, I do not believe that we should abandon hope of Hamas playing its part in development, but we do have to spell out the conditions under which that is possible. If, on the basis of the seats won in the parliament, Hamas takes over the Palestinian Authority, it must agree to renounce violence, to acknowledge Israel’s right to exist and accept the agreements already reached, or else everything will have to start again from the ground up.</p>
<p class="contents">My hope is that this will happen before the Israeli elections, so that we can avoid the sort of adverse occurrences that would make it harder for us to get back together.

<p class="contents">Hamas remains a terrorist organisation with links to the Muslim Brotherhood and Hezbollah. It is committed to the extermination of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state with Jerusalem as its capital.

Clearly, if it held these views anywhere in an EU Member State, it would have been banned as a political party.</p>

Nevertheless, it is clear that an organisation banned as a terrorist organisation, such as Hamas, cannot be a legitimate interlocutor for the EU, nor receive a penny of our taxpayers’ money until it forswears violence and recognises the state of Israel. I have always supported the security fence on the basis that it has saved human lives from the evil of suicide bombers. It has, regrettably, truncated communities, but it does not constitute the final border of a future Palestinian state.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, a Hamas victory will make a land-for-peace deal much more difficult to realise. Also, the final settlement of the East Jerusalem question, as well as the right of return questions, will be almost impossible with Hamas in government for the Palestinian Authority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is therefore one thing we must be pleased about: Hamas is now in the political game, and that is progress. And in order to draw it further into the political game, we must be able also to incorporate it fully into the relations between the Palestinian National Authority and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that the first time that a Hamas representative elected at these elections meets with the European Union may well be within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly which will take place on 26 and 27 March. And then the new Israeli Members of Parliament following the elections in that country will come there. Let us all therefore contribute in that shared forum to dialogue and a democratic modernisation of Hamas which will benefit everybody. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The conclusions we come to must not be premature and the strategy for the next stage must be properly thought through.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the debate, it was said – and rightly – that we do still, of course have a partner in the person of President Abbas, who is someone with whom we can still talk and with whom we must continue to negotiate. We can continue counting on him as a partner, for the new government neither will nor can alter the constitution that is coming into force. We must not abandon hope; on the contrary, we must look to the future.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is clear, though – the Council spelled it out on Monday, and so did the Quartet – and that is that there are principles from which we must not deviate, and let there be no doubt that among them are non-violence, recognition of Israel’s right to exist and the continuation of the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been said, time and time again, that European policy must be even-handed, and with that I can only agree; indeed, it is a self-evident truth. I also made clear in my introductory statement what the position of the Council is as regards our relationship with Israel and our criticisms of it.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters is that Europe should speak with one voice. If we want to have any influence, we also need to speak in the same language as our partners in the Quartet, and that is important too. I am particularly grateful to the Commission for having developed, with careful consideration and without undue haste, a strategy for helping the Palestinian people. As was said by several participants in the debate, the Palestinian people have suffered a great deal and continue to do so, and we cannot let them down. I know, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, that the Commission’s policy with regard to them is a very good and very coherent one, and one in which we should give them our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all let me thank you all for the kind words on the elections and the observations. All credit goes to Mrs De Keyser and her team as well as to Mr McMillan-Scott and his team. Credit also goes to the Palestinian people, who have shown that they can elect in a free and fair way, even if we are not always satisfied with the result.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have to agree to respect the will of the Palestinian people. As we said in the Quartet statement, the Palestinians have now voted for change. We know why. At the same time, they desire peace. Polls show that there is a slight majority in favour of peace with Israel. This has to be the way forward. We are ready to continue to support the Palestinian people. We wish to do so, just as we have done until now. There is no other organisation other than the European Union, and particularly the European Commission, that has done so much for the Palestinian people for years.</p>
<p class="contents">However, being elected and taking office is also a matter of political responsibility. That is why we ask – and even expect – that a new Palestinian government confirm its commitment to peace through peaceful means, in particular though the three conditions that were mentioned in the Quartet statement: non-violence, the recognition of Israel and the respect of previous obligations, namely the Oslo agreement and the roadmap. These clearly show a commitment to peace, to a two-state solution, but also to an ambitious reform agenda for the Palestinian Authority. I very much wanted to mention this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that the policy of the Quartet – and here we are really working together – is a very balanced one. I heard a few Members say that we were one-sided: those who have not yet seen the latest Quartet statement should please look at it. I would like to refer to the last paragraph where we say: ‘the Quartet reiterates its commitment to the principles outlined in the roadmap and the previous statement, and reaffirms its commitment to a just, comprehensive and lasting settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict based upon UN Security Council resolutions Nos 242 and 338’. I think this, per se, reflects our support for mutual obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me reiterate that our first objective must now be to ensure that Israel transfers Palestinian tax revenues to the Authority. More precisely, this is Palestinian money. We do not think it would be constructive for Israel to withhold it at such a crucial time. I will also speak to the Israeli Authorities about this and I know other colleagues in the Quartet will also do so. I very much hope that funds will be transferred soon, because they would cover a good proportion of the salaries of the Palestinian Authority employees and would also provide much-needed income for the families. That would be a humanitarian gesture that Israel could make at a crucial time.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also reassured by the President of the World Bank, who is of the same opinion. I met Mr Wolfowitz yesterday in London. Today he has been quoted as saying that ‘it will help the whole process if the life of the average Palestinian improves; we ought to be the last people to disengage’. I very much welcome this statement and hope it will help. However, this is also why the members of the Arab League should honour their pledges of support as soon as possible. Yesterday, at the London Conference for Afghanistan, Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik and I both took every opportunity to talk to the different Arab representatives, in order to make that possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have to be very vigilant in this period. It is a crucial period because we also have elections in Israel. We want the peace process to be able to continue in the future. I therefore invite Members to remain engaged with us. Despite its difficulties, we would like to make the path to peace less bumpy in the future.</p>

Only by showing complete trust and continuing to cooperate can we demand the necessary commitment from the new government to carry out the roadmap. We must, of course, be more watchful, precisely because of the serious tensions that have arisen in recent years between the party now in power and so-called Western society, but I am sure that clenching our fists is not the way to eliminate that kind of friction. On the contrary, Hamas needs to be given a chance to show that it can respect the commitment made more than once by President Abbas himself to stick to the schedule, to respect existing agreements and obligations and to pursue a negotiated settlement of the conflict with Israel. Cutting off funding to the Palestinian Authority is therefore not the solution. What is needed – and we must not be moved on this – is for the monitoring system to be enhanced, including through greater international cooperation, so as to ensure that the resources are used exclusively for the economic, political and social development of Palestinian society, and not for the destruction of our own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
