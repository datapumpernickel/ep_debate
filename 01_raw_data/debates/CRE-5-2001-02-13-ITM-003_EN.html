<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rocard (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioners, this is an oral question addressed to the Commission. Several months ago, the President, Mrs Fontaine, addressed the Lisbon European Council with concerns, to quote her, “the devastating effect [of unregulated mergers] on the Union’s social cohesion”. She urged the Heads of State and Government, and I shall quote her words once again, to “ensure that, before such mergers can take place, a serious assessment of their social impact is carried out so that the necessary accompanying social measures can be taken”. In so doing, Mrs Fontaine was highlighting the major problem of how to reconcile the necessary flexibility in businesses with the necessary safety of workers?</p>
<p class="contents">Since Lisbon, Mr President, restructuring has intensified further. We now hear that there are more than three hundred mergers every year. Every new day brings further sources of anxiety for employees whether in the sectors of what is curiously termed the ‘old’ economy, which is the bulk of the economy, or in the new information technology sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the Nice Summit sent out some very positive signals. Overcoming the thirty-year deadlock on the European Company Statute, including the section on employee participation, and the adoption of the social agenda, illustrated the importance that the European Council attaches to improving the situation of the European Union’s workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The request we would make of the Commission through this unanimous oral agreement – and let me stress that there was unanimity within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – is that they use this new political will as a firm basis to truly guide their proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our honour, therefore, to ask the Commission to make some specific commitments. First of all we want better provision to be made for the social effects of restructuring. How, for example, do you plan to use the new European Industrial Relations Observatory, to be operated by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in Dublin, which this great House, the European Parliament, was so dedicated to creating? We would like you to undertake a reassessment of the existing directives on social matters with regard both to their record of implementation and to the new challenges presented by their restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">We urge you to propose the necessary revisions wherever they are needed, particularly in order to have stricter scrutiny of workers’ rights to information and consultation and as far as possible to bring forward the provision of information to the social partners in the restructuring process.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, we would appreciate the Commission’s immediately proposing, now, not in 2002, as announced, revision of the current directive on the European works council, a directive which itself stipulated it would be revised after a few years. The time for that has now come. We also urge you to revisit the directive on collective redundancies in order to incorporate the procedures needed to prevent the requirement to inform workers being contravened.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally we would like to see the internal procedures for competition policy within the Commission being amended in order to take greater account of social factors. We know that Mrs Diamantopoulou is not completely averse to this idea. Well, “not completely averse” is a polite way of saying it, as I am in fact fairly sure that she is in favour of the idea. Would it not be only natural, when a firm asks Brussels for permission to go through with a merger, for the Commission to ensure that the minimum requirements for the information and consultation of employees as laid down in Community legislation have indeed been respected.</p>
<p class="contents">These, Commissioners, are our demands, which have a symbolic value as far as public opinion is concerned, a justified value as far as the employees are concerned, and, if I may say so, are useful as far as the economy is concerned, for how is it possible to manage a knowledge-based economy without the employees being involved?</p>
<p class="contents">Within my committee, we were unanimous in our discussion of this oral question and also on a motion for a resolution that is now before us. I must point out that a further motion was tabled by the Liberal Group. As we are of one mind with our liberal friends, who voted in favour of the first resolution and, above all, in favour of the committee’s question, we think there has been some technical hitch and that our liberal friends did not receive proper information. Do not, at any rate, see this as discord. It is a matter we are going to sort out. Until now we have worked in perfect agreement, and that includes with our liberal friends.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioners, we impatiently await your responses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, honourable Members, Europe must face industrial restructuring and its social consequences by combining innovation with social cohesion and improving its capacity to manage change. Our positive and pro-active answer to change covers three main fields: improving our capacity, anticipating and managing change i.e. in the Dublin Observatory; creating or developing the legal mechanisms which can ensure adequate protection of workers in situations of industrial restructuring and promoting in general their own capacity to anticipate change; and developing corporate social responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The establishment of an observatory on industrial change is one of the actions proposed in the social policy agenda adopted by the Nice Summit as a means to develop a pro-active approach to anticipating and managing change. I personally attach much importance to this matter in view of the current situation regarding mergers and acquisitions. The Dublin Foundation has included this initiative in its four-year rolling programme. In the framework of its current limited resources, the Dublin Foundation has planned in its 2001 work programme to set up the observatory's steering committee. This work will provide a basis for further development of the observatory from 2002 onwards, if additional resources become available.</p>
<p class="contents">The directives on collective redundancies and transfers of undertakings, dating back from the seventies, were conceived and adopted in a context of full employment and slow change. Since then the situation in the economic world has radically changed. It is true that their provisions are no longer adapted to the needs of companies and workers. Today they focus on promoting anticipation, prevention of crisis, employability and adaptability. Our answer to the weaknesses of the existing rules, and the only efficient way to modernise national systems of worker involvement, consists in refocusing the information and consultation procedures on economic and strategic issues and putting the long-term evolution of employment within each company at the centre of them. That is the aim of the Commission's proposal on information and consultation. Once this general framework is adopted and widely applied, the specific rules on collective redundancies and transfers of undertakings will make sense; first of all, because crises in the employment relationship like these would in many cases have been prevented.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, even when they cannot be avoided, the normal losers would have been alerted well before and would be in a position to adapt better to inevitable changes in their employment situation. I know that you are very supportive of this approach and that you share the Commission's satisfaction with the irreversible progress recently achieved on this sensitive dossier. With your cooperation and a strong political will from the Council, we may finalise it before the end of this year and that will be a decisive step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I also share your point of view according to which the European Works Council Directive will also have, sooner or later, to be updated. Nevertheless, we will have much to gain from pursuing the evaluation of the rich experience of practical application of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, before doing so, we would conclude some unfinished tasks which are also at the centre of your concerns. First of all the information and consultation dossier must be finalised. Then at the end of last year we had another major and long-awaited achievement: the European company statute. It is worth mentioning in the context of this debate because this new form of incorporation will certainly be widely used by companies in Europe operating on a trans-national basis, above all, when they restructure themselves and adapt to new economic and market conditions. One of the outstanding positive elements of the statute is that it contains well developed provisions on worker involvement, which reflect the modern approach also translated in the national information and consultation proposal. This will surely contribute to a better treatment of the social dimension of corporate restructuring in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Then the five other legislative proposals are on the line, following the unlocking of the European company texts: the three twin statutes for cooperatives, mutual societies and associations and the draft directives on trans-national mergers and transfers of the registered offices of companies from one Member State to another. All of these instruments will require the same kind of provisions as the ones found in European companies. This is another reason for waiting a short while before launching the revision of the European Works Council Directive, which, incidentally, will have much to gain from the debates held on these other dossiers. They will inevitably inspire and facilitate the acceptance of the solutions which will be on the table for discussion when we turn to the task.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I know that there is concern in this House about information and consultation of employees in the context of mergers and acquisitions control. As you know, from previous speeches, we are holding a debate within the Commission on how better to address this concern. Under the merger regulation, workers and representatives are already entitled in some cases to be auditioned by the Commission's services, which conduct an inquiry on the conformity of a merger with the Treaty. Our idea consists in making these auditions more systematic. On the other hand, we could usefully remind merging companies of their responsibilities and obligations with regard to worker information and consultation on these operations which very frequently affect them.</p>
<p class="contents">As social cohesion is now top priority for Europe, public authorities can no longer be expected to be solely and wholly responsible for it. Like every other part of society, businesses are expected to undertake their share. Promoting corporate social responsibility is now an essential part of the European strategy for social cohesion. The guiding principle of corporate social responsibility for companies is to be competitive and profitable by living up to their social responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the Lisbon Council's appeal to companies' corporate sense of social responsibility the Commission has included this theme in its own social policy agenda published in June 2000 by stressing its importance in addressing the employment and social consequences of economic and market integration and adapting worker conditions in the new economy. It has announced a communication to support initiatives related to corporate social responsibility and management of change. The Commission will issue a Green Paper this year to facilitate further development towards a framework for corporate social responsibility practice at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, it is the combination of the different lines of action which I mentioned to you, as well as adequate action from public authorities, private organisations, companies, workers and the social partners at all levels, that will allow us to deal properly with the social implications of industrial change and corporate restructuring. All of them are important, all of them require an innovative and open attitude on the part of policy makers. I know that is your stance on this and I thank you for your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am delighted with the Commissioner’s response. I think we will find that it contains all kinds of points worth acting on – particularly if we give it another good read through – in order to reach the goals we are seeking to achieve through these questions, and find the necessary solutions. Whenever restructuring takes place there is a debate as to whether our institutions are sufficiently well-designed to cope with such eventualities. That is quite logical. Indeed the Treaty on the European Union, specifically Article 136, bestows this task on the European Union. Needless to say, we must tread a fine line, i.e. the companies concerned must be given as much leeway as possible to make their own policy decisions, and so promote commercial growth of their operations, which will help to combat long-term and structural unemployment in Europe. On the other hand, we have a moral duty to engage in consultation. Volkswagen in Germany is a good case in point. If these consultation obligations are properly observed, then it is far easier to resolve a particular structural problem than were this not to be the case. If you compare the restructuring of Volkswagen with restructuring operations now taking place in other European countries, which do not have such a good record when it comes to observing consultation obligations, then the differences are plain for all to see. That is why it is so very important for these consultation obligations to be included in the agenda as soon as possible, and for the matter to be resolved, preferably within the term of the Swedish Presidency. That is what we aim to achieve with these questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rocard was right in saying that the resolution was submitted on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. Having said that, we still need a number of amendments, precisely in order to underline the point that companies must be given as much leeway as possible to make their own policy decisions. Of course, that is what the resolution implies, but the point is not made quite as clearly as we would wish. So we will go along with the resolution, but only if it includes the amendments we have yet to put forward. Obviously we still have up to Thursday to discuss this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We want a pro-active approach to industrial restructuring and change. We want to see a corporate code of social responsibility but we can see that this will be achieved only when we have an updated and completed legal framework in this area. We want to see true partnership at work and the real benefits that this can bring to the European Union. But the latest spate of restructuring in the United Kingdom and throughout the European Union shows that we are far from achieving those things. To the Corus workers in the north-east of England or Wales, to the Vauxhall workers in Luton – or, for that matter, the Danone workers in France and Holland – the idea of a corporate code of responsibility – as I said in an earlier debate – is a sick joke, quite frankly. The promise of a Green Paper in the middle of this year is not an adequate response to the anguish that those workers, their families and entire communities have felt.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to see a review of the law on collective redundancies, a review on transfers, a review of the European Works Council Directive, to make sure it is a directive that is observed rather than being systematically avoided by business. We also want to see the general framework on information and consultation adopted as a matter of urgency. This is absolutely essential if we are going to introduce an ongoing day-by-day flow of consultation and information and, in that way, build a true partnership at work: a partnership that can deliver improved innovation, competitiveness and productivity. We want to see that true partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">We are tired of the linkage of various directives in this package, with the excuse that we cannot look for a review of the European Works Council Directive until it has been further bedded-in and the European company statute is in place. Yes, we need to establish linkage, but in taking this package now and taking a holistic approach to the need to improve information and consultation for workers.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that if this framework of legislation can be updated in this way, coupled with the new observatory on industrial change, it can give us the tools for a more pro-active approach to industrial change within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make an appeal to the Liberal Group. We were given a mandate by this House in January to look at this issue of restructuring in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. We have done that. We have come up with an oral question and a resolution in a spirit of cooperation. I would ask the Liberals, in the spirit of cooperation, to withdraw their highly destructive resolution. It would be helpful.</p>

We had the self-same debate exactly a year ago, on 17 February. I would not find this disconcerting, were it not for the fact that we also discussed this topic back on 27 October 1999, and I could mention a few other occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, what is it that Europe needs? It was agreed last year in Lisbon that we want to become the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, and Parliament has thrown its weight behind this objective, in a spirit of generosity and with a large majority. That is why, on Thursday next, we will hold a debate on a European research area, and the need to invest in research, technological development, innovation and education.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is more important than ever for businesses to exploit their competitive potential to the full, because an uncompetitive business costs jobs. Seen from this perspective, it is sometimes unavoidable that businesses have to undergo reorganisation and occasionally take painful measures such as transferring or replacing workers, or making them redundant if the worst comes to the worst. Needless to say, the rights of workers as laid down in the various European directives must be upheld in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">You will understand that the Liberal Group cannot endorse the question raised by Mr Rocard or the resolution tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs as it stands, for it provides renewed evidence of the fact that Parliament has a very selective memory. After all, only the Nice social agenda is discussed in the joint resolution, whilst Lisbon is forgotten for the sake of convenience. We will therefore table a number of amendments in the spirit of the Lisbon objectives. Mr Rocard thinks that not responding immediately to an e-mail signifies automatic acceptance; he is wrong on that score. But we will withdraw our resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has been mentioned earlier, the Anglo-Dutch company Corus – the steel company – is a classic example of a company making decisions based on profit with no regard to the disastrous social costs of its actions. Corus has just announced total job losses of 6 000 in the UK – nearly 3 000 in my own constituency in Wales. Despite months of speculation over possible plant closures the company was unwilling to reveal its future plans to the government, let alone to its own workforce, until the formal announcement was made on 1 February. There was no prior consultation with the workforce, although since announcing the decision the company has been holding what it calls "consultation".</p>
<p class="contents">There is speculation that Danone, a profitable company, is to shed 3 000 jobs in Europe. Again there has been no consultation with the workers and no discussion about alternative ways forward. That is why it is so important to adopt the directive on the information and consultation of workers without delay, together with a review of the European Works Council Directive and the Collective Redundancies Directive, which incidentally proved to offer so little protection to the Corus workers in my constituency.</p>
<p class="contents">Companies cannot be free to wreak such havoc on people's lives and communities. There is a positive framework of controls and sanctions which we can use. We must make sure they are effective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is high time that we provided means to intervene on behalf of employees. There is an intolerable contradiction between the Council and the Commission’s declared priority of promoting employment and the massive redundancies that big businesses are making, and who are, at the same time, making fantastic profits.</p>
<p class="contents">Michelin, Moulinex, Danone and Alstom are not businesses experiencing difficulties. They are perfectly competitive, and have a record of making more than adequate profits, but they are laying off thousands of people nonetheless. The case of Danone is very instructive, making 3 000 people redundant in Europe and 1 700 in France. In the year 2000, this firm’s European installations made a net profit of EUR 795 million, or 17% more than in 1999. It is not possible to sit back and simply watch the unfolding spectacle of mergers that make men and women redundant, plunging entire families into chaos.</p>
<p class="contents">The European citizenship we so often refer to in this society will continue to be nothing more than just so much hot air as long as employees are not properly informed and consulted on choices which determine their own future and that of their region and their country. How, furthermore, can we find it acceptable for groups to benefit from grants of public financial aid to promote employment without being obliged to comply with the commitments they have made? In such instances, the aid funds should be paid back to the community which will have to bear the social costs resulting from the choice of financial profitability over employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that the problem boils down to employability or adaptability or to simply dealing with the social fallout, as the Commissioner suggested. I therefore endorsed the proposals made in the resolution as well as the amendments that clarify and strengthen certain aspects. We shall have to go much further to respond to the democratic demands of the working citizens of Europe. I therefore feel that rights should be developed to the point where it is possible to halt scheduled redundancies and ongoing mergers. Any merger contract must include social clauses. Penalties must also be introduced for failure to comply with the directives on worker consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">At this time when there is a great deal of debate on the subject of European identity and the direction that European integration should be taking, I feel that a text specifying certain employee rights in the face of financial objectives would be the least that could be done so as to give the European Union a degree of credibility. I shall therefore vote in favour of the resolution which I hope will be enhanced by a number of amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
