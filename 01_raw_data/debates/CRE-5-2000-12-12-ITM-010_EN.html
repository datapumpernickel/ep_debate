Croatia has made considerable progress in the economic, the political and the social sector and the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is the next logical step. Allow me briefly to summarise these three main sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the economic sector. Obviously, huge efforts are still needed before the Croatian market functions in line with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. However, efforts are clearly being made and the results of structural and economic reform can already be seen, especially in the transparent procedures being used for privatisation and the protection being offered to foreign investment. The Stability, or rather Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which provides for financial aid and general financial assistance through the relevant Community programmes, will strengthen this progress in the economic sector and speed up preparations for Croatia's accession to the European Union at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">The progress made by Croatia is evident not only in the economic sector but also in the political sector. The new coalition voted in during recent elections in Croatia has decided to put its money on democracy and the rule of law. This embracing of democracy and the rule of law go beyond mere words to daily actions: institutions are being created and legislation – such as the legislation on protection for refugees, the right to asylum and immigration – is being reformed. Also worth mentioning here are the attempt by certain representatives of the Croat community in Bosnia to destabilise the government in order to recreate the wartime statelet of Herzeg-Bosna and the government's compliance with the terms of the Dayton agreement and collaboration with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress has clearly also been made in the social sector and at this point, I need do no more than read you an extract from the conclusions of the Council of Europe:</p>
<p class="contents">"Croatia has made significant progress in fulfilling its commitments as a member of the international community, in particular with its ratification of the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, the European Charter of Local Self-Government and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages."</p>
<p class="contents">With the changes and democratic developments in Yugoslavia, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the European Union and the present motion for a resolution on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia, there are good prospects for democratisation and stabilisation in the Western Balkans and Croatia can play a specific and decisive role here.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia has come along at just the right time. Parliament also has cause to congratulate itself on rushing approval through before the end of the year. Just how right it was is confirmed by the summit in Nice which ended just yesterday morning. The following is an extract from the chapter describing the Western Balkans: </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its membership of the NATO Partnership for Peace and of the World Trade Organisation, its bilateral agreements with the EFTA states, its free-trade agreements with the CEFTA member states and the negotiations that began recently, on 8 November, on a wide-ranging Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union are all evidence that Croatia has embarked on a clear change of course since the elections of 3 January 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union emphasised this again by the summit held in Zagreb on 24 November. However, it also became clear at this summit that the situation inside Yugoslavia remains as brittle and strife-ridden as ever. If this pattern of behaviour continues, where in case of doubt each party fights the other, it could break up the Stability Pact for South-East Europe, which is based on regional cooperation. For even now states like Croatia are asking whether the obligation to cooperate on a regional basis might not end up delaying their own accession to Europe. Croatia, like a more democratic Serbia, where I hope that democracy will be consolidated on 23 December, could become major factors of stability in these regions destroyed by wars and ethnic conflicts. It is important for the European Union, as also the European Parliament, to do their utmost to provide economic protection and support for the democratic process in these countries. Even if they still have a long way to go before they can join the European Union, economic and political help quite simply offer the principle of hope, and Mr Baltas' report takes that principle into account.</p>
<p class="contents">But we should also apply the principle of differentiation in this region. Croatia has made significant progress, especially by ratifying the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture, the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The European Parliament's report rightly notes that. Another point in Croatia's favour is the changed attitude of the newly elected Croatian authorities to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia has always felt part of western Europe, western culture. It needs all our support and encouragement along its chosen road to economic and political reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also had very good talks with members of the former government. Some were very useful, but the whole thing always had to be seen in the context of extreme nationalism, of very sluggish cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal and a very hesitant approach to Bosnia and Herzegovina. That has changed. The new Croatian government has not only recognised but actually supports Europe's Balkan policy. And that is why it was right to react quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">I can see no contradiction between the one-to-one relations between the European Union and Croatia and the various Balkan countries, and regional cooperation. We need regional cooperation. We need it, for example, with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and it is most welcome that the government has said it will support the idea of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a single state, which has not always brought it friends among the Croatians in Herzegovina. But that is a bold, clear and definite step and it must be followed up.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end we also need cooperation with Yugoslavia, meaning cooperation on both sides. On the one hand we must continue to insist that the ethnic Serbian refugees who have fled Croatia can return there, that this is not just the will of the government but can also be achieved against quite considerable local resistance in individual regions, villages and areas. But of course we also need cooperation with Yugoslavia not just for this process but also in order to stabilise the region. Even if we are being a little cautious and reticent at this point we and Mrs Pack is here too have told Mr Kostunica quite plainly that we must also require the new Yugoslavia, which we hope will emerge stronger from the elections on 23 December, to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal, to cooperate on a regional basis, to be prepared to resolve the conflicts peacefully.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final comment is this. The Zagreb summit sent out a clear message. We in this Parliament have already incorporated the further developments clause in the agreement with Macedonia. Now, however, we must also prepare the way carefully. That makes the decision, or non-decision, of Nice rather disappointing: the complexity of the majority-voting system makes things difficult enough for the current round of enlargement, but they will become much more difficult when it comes to enlargement towards south-eastern Europe. Here the Union still has much work to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Croatia is increasingly becoming a factor of stability in the region. It is making positive progress towards democracy. However, let me emphasise that even though we welcome this progress, this does not mean we think Croatia has reached its goal. It must now take the next steps towards legislative reform, especially in relation to minority rights, freedom of the press and an independent judiciary. It is up to the Commission to take a very critical look at precisely these aspects now in preparation for the Stability and Association Agreement. Let me also stress that Croatia is endeavouring to put its relations with neighbouring states in good order. That means it really has made quite positive progress here.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly important to show Croatia that we regard it as quite crucial what role it takes on with regard to stabilisation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Federation there. Indeed, that is the precisely the yardstick by which we must measure Croatia's progress towards stabilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it would be a disaster for the EU to tie economic support to an agreement on the return of the refugees in the Association and Stabilisation Agreement. That issue must be based on other conditions, namely whether access to asylum in Croatia is compatible with international standards and whether it is a humane access to asylum. I believe this question has to be treated separately and must not be part of the agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also think that the Commission has acted at the appropriate time to launch this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that the work has been done in record time, and we congratulate Mr Baltas on his efficient work in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that it is timely because, although at the time, we, as the European left, criticised some countries of Western Europe for their role in the break up of the former Yugoslavia, through encouraging, facilitating or instigating hatred and aggression, both ethnic and of other kinds, which resulted in the emergence of Croatia, at this time, when its recent past has also changed, I think it is a very good sign that the European Union is taking a step forward to help recover the mood of tolerance, democracy, respect for human rights and living in harmony with other republics and areas in the region, because it is of vital importance for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget the suffering of the almost three hundred thousand people, of Serbian origin, who were violently expelled in a week, by terrorist methods, from Krajina, and had to flee to Serbia. I think it is important to recognise that it was wrong and that those people be helped to return, if they wish, to their homes. That would prove that tolerance, living together in harmony and respect for different opinions are possible in the Balkan region and it would improve the prospects for our future in the area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unlike its neighbour Slovenia, immediately after independence in 1991 Croatia was not able to develop in a way as to allow it to become a candidate for accession at this point. For at the time, in 1991, one third of the country was occupied. At the time the Croats were driven out. In 1991/92 more than 250 000 Croats were expelled from Kraijina, from western and eastern Slavonia. They were not able to return to their homes until the, to my mind, justified­ recapture of these areas. There they found their property and possessions in ruins. Unfortunately, during this recapture Serbs who had the right to live there were expelled in return, not just by the Croats but sadly also by their Serb ringleaders, who, of course, did the same in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Sarajevo.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we also saw serious attacks carried out during this recapture. But we should not confuse cause and effect. We then punished Croatia for this recapture by denying it our friendship. We refused to grant it any aid. And because we refused to help, many things then started to go wrong in Croatia, with wrongful privatisation, corruption and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The new government has now taken a European line in many policy areas. It is seeking to cooperate with The Hague. It has stopped supporting separatist movements in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is currently adopting difficult austerity measures in order to meet the preconditions. So I believe Croatia has deserved this support. It can become a factor of stability throughout the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the 20th Century, Croatia has gone through the same stages that many of us that are now part of the European Union had to go through. In the last 60 years, Croatia experienced a particularly awful form of fascism. A fascism like that in Germany, Austria, Italy and Spain: a characteristically European path, therefore.</p>
<p class="contents">Then the Croats, through a particularly militant anti-fascist resistance, freed themselves from Nazism. This journey of resistance is part of the best of European heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">After a new and long period of authoritarianism came the outbreak of independence, led by nationalist forces and others based more on purely democratic aspirations. In the struggle between them the Croatians had to go through a new chapter of ultra-nationalist authoritarianism, supported paradoxically by their Serbian counterparts, through the occupation of part of their territory and through the war.</p>
<p class="contents">With peace and the consolidation of democracy, the Croatian people have chosen the path of moderation and tolerance, freedom and respect. And they have clearly identified that choice with their full participation in the project for European construction.</p>
<p class="contents">The entry of Croatia into the Council of Europe made a decisive contribution to the positive developments that have been taking place in the country, and was a step further along the road to the stabilisation and association agreement with the European Union, which we are debating today and which we want to become a reality as soon as possible. This agreement is nothing if not a step further towards Croatia’s accession as a full member of the European Union, and there is no place on that path for any conditions other than those that the other applicant countries have to comply with.</p>
<p class="contents">The Croatians have a right to that accession, but, moreover, I think it is obvious that the European project would be incomplete as long as Croatia was missing from the mosaic, along with its other neighbours from the former Yugoslavia. We will therefore vote in favour of the proposals put forward by our friend Mr Baltas and we commit ourselves to continuing to support Croatia in its efforts to become one more member of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I am delighted to be able to comment on the excellent report by the honourable gentleman, Mr Baltas – produced, as several honourable gentlemen have said, with considerable expedition – on the Commission's feasibility study for a stabilisation and association agreement with Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents">This has of course been a historic year for south-east Europe. It was Croatia – we should not forget – that got things moving with its elections under a year ago. So I am delighted that we celebrate the end of the year by launching negotiations with Croatia for a stabilisation and association agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We initiated those negotiations appropriately enough at the Zagreb Summit a fortnight ago and the first full negotiating session takes place on Monday in Brussels. We hope to make swift progress in these negotiations and to be able to conclude them rapidly. How rapidly depends to some extent not just on us but on the Croatian negotiating team who are extremely well prepared. I have to say that, on the basis of Croatia's performance this year, I have every confidence that we will be able to set a brisk pace. Certainly that is what Croatia has done during the course of the last months: setting an example to its neighbours, demonstrating how rapidly it is possible to turn a country's political fortunes around, given sufficient vision and political courage.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to pay a warm tribute to Croatia's leaders and to her people for what they have achieved. Croatia has, for example, bravely transformed its relations with The Hague, based on the wise assertion of her President that it is only by establishing individual guilt that a country can truly be absolved of collective guilt. Wise advice, applicable not just in Croatia but wherever war crimes are alleged.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Stenzel pointed out, Croatia has joined the PFP and WTO, and it has taken on a host of other international obligations. The new government has made radical changes to Croatia's relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina, clearly distancing itself from extremists in Herzegovina and instituting a more open financial relationship with the Croat components of the federation army. It has pioneered free trade agreements with FYROM and Slovenia and now with Bosnia and Herzegovina. It played an extremely helpful role in supporting the democratically elected government of Montenegro in withstanding pressure from the Milosevic regime.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the government has started to make real reforms at home – politically and economically – that have led us to conclude that Croatia would be able to uphold the substantial obligations which a stabilisation and association agreement entails. Last month, as the House knows, Croatia hosted, with extremely impressive efficiency and diplomatic finesse, the historic Zagreb Summit. I do not think that is a bad record for a year. So I am pleased, if not surprised, that Parliament backs our judgement that it was right to proceed quickly to begin these negotiations with Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents">I share many of the observations in the report. I strongly agree, for example, that we need substantially to increase our financial support for Croatia under the CARDS regulation. We have a team of officials in Croatia this week to look at programming for next year. I strongly endorse Parliament's view. I know that it is the strong view of the Croatian Government that countries participating in the stabilisation and association process must be judged on an individual basis on their own merits.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreements must be tailored to their particular circumstances and adjusted to the rate of progress that they have made. That is certainly our approach, and the speed with which we have adjusted our policy towards Croatia in recent months testifies to that. We also naturally want to see countries participating in the stabilisation and association process taking the lead not just in establishing closer relations with the European Union but with each other too.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not – and I want to emphasise this point – a sort of back-door attempt to try and recreate Yugoslavia. It is an underlining in our relations with these countries of what has been our own experience. We coped with appalling political division. We coped with turmoil by coming together, by trying to work together economically and politically. It should not come as a surprise to countries which want a better relationship with us, which want a closer relationship with us, which want to join us in the European family, when we insist on exactly the same for them.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last year Croatia has embarked boldly and decisively on the road to Europe, but there remains, despite recent progress, some way to go. We will need to see a strong continuing commitment on the part of Croatia and on the part of other governments in the region to refugee return – a point which a couple of honourable Members referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all we will need to see continuing economic and institutional reform, the establishment of a genuinely free economy, reform of property law, the strengthening of the independence of the judiciary and the protection of the rights of minorities. There will also need to be serious reform of the media, with a real effort to create a genuinely open and pluralistic media environment, living up to the highest professional standards of impartiality and independence, especially in television.</p>
<p class="contents">So we will continue to need the support of this Parliament as we urge our Croatian friends to press on with these reforms, many of which will bring pain before the gains are evident. We welcome Parliament's support so far, not least on the important question of the legal base for the stabilisation and association agreements. This is an important point for us and we will, I hope, be able to count on Parliament's support when we come back to consult you formally once we have negotiated the agreement. The conclusion of the stabilisation and association agreement will, of course, be subject to the assent of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">With the start of these negotiations, Croatia has embarked on a new era in its relations with the European Union. Croatia has won many friends in Europe for the role it has played in the last year and for the progress it has achieved. Of course, in many respects the hard part is only just beginning, but I have every confidence that the people of Croatia are equal to the challenge, equal to the difficult path of reform, the path to Europe that now lies ahead. We in the European Commission look forward to helping Croatia to meet that challenge and to helping Croatia along that road.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said at the outset, this year began with the people of Croatia and their new democratic government lighting a candle. I think it was remarkably important for the whole region. We owe it to Croatia to give the government and people of Croatia every help in the years ahead and we are extremely grateful to the honourable Member for his wise advice in ensuring that we pursue this route.</p>
