<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Valverde López </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Madam President, I must first congratulate the European Commission on its proposal for revision of the regulation governing the environmental audit, first approved in 1993. This reflects satisfactory progress in terms of the Commission"s work.</p>
<p class="contents">This new proposal has been made after five years of working with these arrangements and assessing their effectiveness in the various Member States. In my role as rapporteur, I support the broad principles of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity of conveying to Mrs Graenitz, rapporteur for the Socialist Group, how much I appreciated her determination to work together and reach a joint position on many amendments. She has also tabled interesting amendments that I have been very pleased to support.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment relate mainly to deepening and broadening the scope for implementation. This is certainly necessary and it was provided for in the previous regulation. Pilot projects undertaken in various Member States in non‐industrial fields have proved very successful. Here, I could mention, for example, the pilot project carried out in the field of tourism in Spain, or to those carried out by certain public administrations in the field of transport, the universities and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Some amendments are aimed at making the reports on environmental audits more attractive to organisations, while others are intended to avoid overlap with ISO standards. Our regulation must be more advanced and far‐reaching than international standards, despite being based along largely the same principles.</p>
<p class="contents">An attempt has also been made to provide greater facilities for small organisations, along the lines of the European Commission"s proposals. In addition, we propose greater decentralisation of the system at regional level and even at local level.</p>
<p class="contents">In another context, we stress the need to standardise the public assessment report that organisations have to produce, and to ensure that its content and transparency are improved. This is something we already referred to in the 1993 report. We would also like to see the auditor"s role strengthened. In this connection, we have come up against a problem. It involves an issue of interpretation which has surprised us.</p>
<p class="contents">We felt that according to the spirit and the letter of the regulation, environmental auditors had to be natural persons. This involves certain requirements as far as training and experience are concerned, and calls of course for professional people with the relevant qualifications who are accustomed to discharging the responsibilities associated with the liberal professions in relation to penal, civil, administrative and professional matters. To our great surprise, however, it appears that some Member States have a different interpretation of the concept of an auditor, applying it to legal entities. I believe that this would be to misinterpret the report. I further urge you to investigate the application of this report by the various Member States and ascertain if any departure from the spirit of the report has taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also be sending out two political messages, Madam President.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission"s assessment report, certain countries have not yet managed to get their verification structure up and running. The countries in question may as well be named: they are Greece and Portugal. I feel that a direct approach to the authorities in these countries is called for, offering them support if necessary. The aim must be to ensure that the regulation concerning assessment of the environmental impact of organisations is applied in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In other countries, very few organisations have become involved. The most notable examples are Belgium, France and Italy. It is surprising that so few organisations have taken advantage of this regulation. In my view, actions aimed at promotion, cooperation, and encouragement are called for, and more information should perhaps be made available to organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure you will agree with me, Commissioner, as to the nature of the second political message which needs to be sent out at the moment. In the course of the enlargement negotiations with the countries of Eastern Europe, we must bear in mind the transitional aid to be provided to those countries to enable them to take advantage of this opportunity and to carry out self assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your patience, Madam President.</p>

It was very pleasant working with him, and I hope that we can be very pleased with the result. I also hope, Commissioner, that you will be able to accept a number of amendments agreed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and that Parliament will also vote for these amendments tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam requires that environmental policy should be incorporated into all areas and that sustainable development should genuinely be achieved in the European Union, and I believe that we need a lot of instruments to be able to implement this. The improved version of EMAS is one of those instruments which puts companies in particular in a ‘win situation", allowing them to protect the environment and reduce costs. In my view we must publicise this opportunity much more. My small country has the highest percentage of EMAS‐certified organisations. I have inspected some of these and was really able to see the enthusiasm with which the staff, the managers and the owners or shareholders support EMAS, as it is not only the environment that it benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">The changes mentioned by Mr Valverde López will certainly make the programme more attractive. Member States will have to recognise the input already made by the companies which led the way in environmental legislation, and opportunities may have to be created in awarding public contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there was one point on which I did not agree with the rapporteur, but which my group considers to be very important along with worker participation, and that is the point about best available technology. This Parliament has defined best available technology very precisely for industry and has also – rightly, in my opinion – excluded SMEs from this. But if we want EMAS to become widespread and other sectors to become EMAS‐certified as industrial companies or very large institutions, we must apply best available technology differently. Why do we always think only of industry? A hotel business has best available technology for sewage. A transport company has best available technology for its logistics. In order to achieve the goals of sustainable development and the Kyoto objectives, I think we need to make further progress in this area. I very much hope that this amendment by my group – requesting that we include best available technology in this EMAS law – will be adopted.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schnellhardt </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I felt rather helpless as I had dropped my glasses. The aim of European environmental policy to guarantee sustainable development with a high level of environmental protection should be achieved not only with the conventional instruments of regulatory law. The statement in the fifth environmental action programme that industry is not just part of the environmental problem but must also be part of the solution to the problem, continues to be relevant today, and an alternative to environmental regulatory law is the environmental audit scheme that we are now discussing. The voluntary implementation – I emphasise this particularly – of eco‐management and audit schemes allows companies to meet the requirements of environmental protection in a flexible way.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have already heard several times today, the current regulation has proved itself, in particular in industrial firms, and we have also established – here I must contradict you slightly – that 75 % of companies participating in the environmental audit are from Germany. I too have visited the firms – a Commission list – and I can tell you that I too have seen the efforts that the people there have made, but under the simple conditions presently contained in the environmental audit scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">If we now include services I find this very positive. But I think we must also recognise another problem, which is that we have to motivate small and medium‐sized enterprises to agree to implement these requirements. In doing so we must ensure that the demands we make are not beyond the capabilities of small and medium‐sized enterprises, otherwise there is the danger that – as SMEs have always told me – they will then not participate in the environmental audit programme, they will implement only ISO 14001, and they will not have an environmental audit. So once again we would have adopted an excellent decision here in Parliament but it would not actually be put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the debate in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection showed this too. I have seen how our desire to involve interested parties is put into practice, in a company that produces environmental technology. When we say that the available technology should apply, in my view this is a concept which has no place whatsoever in legislation, Mrs Graenitz, as it changes every week and would have to be constantly redefined. It cannot be defined once and for all. There is no end to technology. It continues to develop and it is not necessary the best thing.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to you once again: let us try to change these proposals a little more, as we need widespread participation. We will not achieve this with the current version, I warn you!</p>

I think it is important, as Mr Schnellhardt also emphasised, for us to ensure that EMAS is a useful tool for our businesses here in Europe. We should make sure that good environmental intentions do not make EMAS indigestible for small and medium‐sized businesses. It must be understood that participation in the EMAS scheme is voluntary. It should not be misused in an attempt to impose tougher environmental legislation on businesses. It is important that this scheme is as flexible and unbureaucratic as possible. Otherwise we will not be able to persuade small and medium‐sized businesses to participate in it under any circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, if I may, I would like to comment on some amendments. To begin with, there are Amendments Nos 24, 28 and 29. I hope very much that my colleagues – and the Commission too – will welcome them. I would also like to draw attention to Amendment No 23. We in the Liberal Group are opposed to this proposal, because it would allow the use of the EMAS logo on products and packaging. I think that this would undermine the work we have done in the past and are in the process of doing in the area of labelling, and would be of no benefit to consumers or business. I heard my Austrian colleague talk about best available technology, or BAT. We in the Liberal Group have asked for split votes on the amendments dealing with this concept, because we cannot support the inclusion of BAT in EMAS. If BAT is included in this legislation, it will only make the scheme even more unacceptable for businesses. At the moment, the Commission is only preparing BAT advice for those businesses and sectors which will have statutory IPPC approval, and even this advice will not be ready before 2004, so we are opposed to this.</p>

Unfortunately, the scheme is not yet sufficiently widespread. We also support his proposal to broaden the objectives as regards using cleaner technology, avoiding environmental pollution by organisations, preventing environmental accidents and replacing substances, products or means of transport which cause pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the process of drawing up an environmental declaration like this, we feel that information should be made available to everyone, and that worker participation should be facilitated. In our view, the proposal concerning the future participation of consumers and clients in the work of companies who adopt these measures is of fundamental importance. So, too, is the need to make the results of the assessments widely available together with information on the organisations participating in these projects.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur suggests, it would also be helpful to introduce tax concessions for these organisations, particularly for small and medium‐sized enterprises for whom the use of the best technologies can be a problem. In addition, these small and medium‐sized enterprises should have preferential access to finance. After all, according to Eurostat, most of the jobs in Europe – more than 85 % – are generated by small and medium‐sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel very strongly that if we encourage small and medium‐sized enterprises to participate in the scheme, we shall also be encouraging job creation.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schleicher </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the present amendment aims to make the eco‐audit, which is voluntary and will also remain voluntary in future, more attractive to businesses. I believe we all agree with this objective. After initially grave reservations, the eco‐audit has now become a real hit with industry in those areas where it is used, and I can say on behalf of Germany that the figures speak for themselves: in absolute terms, Germany has the highest number of participating companies, even if it is only 1 % of all companies. Austria is in first place per capita of population, but then Austria is smaller, which is perhaps what has caused the misunderstanding referred to earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Denmark and Sweden are next, with considerably lower figures. However, there are a number of Member States in which the eco‐audit is almost non‐existent, as the rapporteur pointed out. It is therefore very important to provide incentives to encourage an increasing number of companies, particularly the many small and medium‐sized firms, to introduce the eco‐audit; I think we all agree on this. This is particularly important because, as Mr Schnellhardt already said, the international ISO standard 14001 means a certain level of competition which could be undermined as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of our amendments, also tabled by our group, were accepted by a majority in committee. I must say, however, that a number of amendments were also accepted in committee which in our view run counter to the objectives and are indeed at odds with the whole purpose of the exercise. If we now suddenly lay down standards it is no longer a voluntary system but one in which the companies are to be given incentives to achieve more in the relevant areas than the legislation requires. That is the incentive. But if I now lay down fixed standards, then it is no longer a voluntary eco‐audit but one that is difficult for some companies to achieve. I must say quite honestly, on behalf of a number of colleagues and myself, that if the amendments that run counter to the objectives are adopted, we cannot vote for the report. We want the audit to remain voluntary and incentives to be increased; we also want the administration to be reduced, in other words no further conditions to be imposed but instead to improve management. I come from Bavaria and I can say that German companies have carried out most eco‐audits because the incentives have really worked here. I wish this were also the case in other Member States too.</p>

This second version is very much better, particularly Annex VII which is new and which concerns the initial assessment. In the light of my considerable experience in this sector, I feel that the initial assessment is the key to setting up a management system successfully. I would say it stands for 80 %, yet it in the past it did not exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, I think you have failed to take into account how industry actually operates. Hundreds of organisations have adopted ISO standard 14001, along with others the world over, and they have been registered. A few – a very few – are registered with the EMAS scheme. But why so few? Even the 2 000 registered in Germany represent only a tiny percentage of the large organisations. This is because the system is terribly complex. In my opinion, Commissioner, the entire verification procedure should be simplified. Why are there many verifiers in Germany? The reason is that they are natural persons. As Mr Valverde has said, what happens in a great many other countries is that the accrediting bodies will only accredit insurance companies or standardisation companies and that makes the complex procedure even more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust the new version will help to improve this situation. Nevertheless, I suspect that most organisations will continue to be certificated under ISO 14001, and environmental audits under ISO 14010 and 14011, because it is so much more practical and useful to do so. In fact, it comes to the same, because ISO 14001 constitutes 80 % of the EMAS scheme. The remainder is made up by the verification the Commissioner is called upon to simplify.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bjerregaard, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DA)</span> Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Committee on the Environment and especially its rapporteur, Mr Valverde López, for the effort which has been made to ensure the rapid progress of this proposal revising the existing EMAS scheme. We are talking – as has been emphasised – about a voluntary market instrument aimed at improving the contribution which businesses make to the environment. But I shall not repeat the proposal. There have been many excellent speeches about it, so instead I will concentrate on the 65 amendments which have been tabled. The Commission finds 20 of these amendments acceptable in full or in part. We are able to accept Amendment No 1, the first part of No 4 and the second part of No 26, because we believe they help make the Commission's proposal more attractive to business. Then there is the second part of Amendments No 18 and Amendment No 51, which also strengthen the credibility of EMAS and can therefore be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">The comparability and conformity of the scheme between Member States is also of great importance, and for that reason Amendments Nos 34 and 43, which demonstrate Parliament's support, can be accepted. Other key principles in the proposal are intelligibility, clarity, transparency and subsidiarity. The rapporteur, Mr Valverde López, touched on the problem of making the scheme sufficiently well known, and intelligibility, clarity, transparency and subsidiarity are all important in this respect. The Commission can therefore support Amendments Nos 5, 8, 11, 20, 21, 24, 27, 42, 45, 48 and 61 in principle, because in the main we think that they reinforce these aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">We are unable to accept the other amendments. As far as the most important of these are concerned, I shall now discuss some of the reasons why the Commission cannot accept them. Because EMAS is a voluntary instrument, it is important for it to have a logical structure and to be intelligible. For this reason, we cannot accept Amendments Nos 7, 12, 13, 14, 36, 41, 44, 53, 54, 59, 64 and 65 because they repeat elements which are already covered by the text, especially in Annex I A. Support and incentives for organisations taking part in EMAS are included in the proposal and improved by the amendments we are accepting, as I have just mentioned. Amendments which lower the requirements for SMEs are not acceptable. The proposal has been framed in such a way that it can be applied by businesses of any size. The attitude of SMEs themselves is that they do not want a lower level scheme because they fear it would be of less value in the market‐place. For this reason, we do not support Amendments Nos 2, 52 and 56.</p>
<p class="contents">The added value for the environment of the EMAS scheme compared with ISO 14001 is an important aspect of the proposal, as has also been mentioned in the debate. The Commission therefore does not support Amendments Nos 16, 17, 52 and 63, because they weaken the transparency and control of information concerning environmental outcomes by reducing the validation frequency. An important element of the proposal is that it extends the scope of the EMAS scheme to cover all business sectors. The Commission is therefore unable to accept amendments relating only to a single sector, such as Amendments Nos 7, 12 and 25, which require organisations to apply best available technology, and I can understand why opinions have been divided on this in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As the directives on public tendering now stand, the first part of Amendment No 26 and Amendment No 30 are not acceptable. However, I personally have some sympathy for the thinking behind these amendments, and future developments in this area could lead us to take the matter up again.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is convinced that in its improved version, with the addition of those amendments from Parliament which have been accepted today, this document provides an effective and balanced instrument for improving the environmental impact of economic activities throughout the Union, and with those comments, Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Valverde López, and the Committee on the Environment for their work.</p>
