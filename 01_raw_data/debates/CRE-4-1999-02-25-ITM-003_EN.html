We do not think it right to adopt a certain stance concerning the Öcalan case and, at the same time, to establish a cooperative relationship with Turkey. This is not because our group disagrees on the principle of the matter – on the contrary, we entirely agree that Turkey should be included in the Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes – but because we do not consider the timing to be appropriate. By voting in favour, we would be endorsing the political legitimacy of the Republic of Turkey and its government at the very time when the Öcalan affair is on everyone's lips.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I believe that it is essential to pause for thought.</p>

My group believes that if there is one line of communication which must remain open between the European Union and Turkey, it is that of access for young Turkish people to the European Union. We saw just last week in Turkey that on precisely this issue, there is very great concern amongst the most progressive and open‐minded groups in Turkey that it should not be used as an arena in which to fight a war with Turkey which we have not been brave enough to wage by political means in the EU. Parliament would be sending out the wrong signal if we did that.</p>

According to the representatives of human rights organisations, the situation of the Kurds has deteriorated considerably since the capture of Abdullah Öcalan.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, individual Member States, other democratic countries and the international organisations have all allowed Turkey to participate in various forms of cooperation, often with the aim of promoting human rights and democracy. Some of the cooperation links have been accompanied by more or less forthright demands that Turkey should respect human rights, a requirement which, sadly, it has not fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital to maintain and continue the dialogue with Turkey. To sever all links with undemocratic countries is not generally regarded as a constructive solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The youth exchange programme gives young people a chance to study the workings of democracy, thereby instilling in them a desire for change. However, it is vitally important that the selection criteria should make it possible for all young people, regardless of ethnic origin, for example, to participate in the programme. Another criterion should be that the young people who take part do not find themselves subjected to repressive measures on their return home.</p>
<p class="contents">As things stand at present, we think it would be inappropriate for the European Parliament to approve the proposed cooperation project. Parliament should withhold its approval until there is clear evidence that human rights are being respected.</p>

Even though the European Union has quite rightly set out clear and precise conditions for the accession of the CEECs, this House believes that there is nothing unusual in involving Turkey, a country that can hardly be said to fulfil these criteria, in such Community programmes. Given the current state of affairs, guaranteeing financing for such programmes is already a rather delicate task.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community currently suspects Turkey of having prepared a political trial for Mr Abdullah Öcalan where the sentence has already been determined. The European Council has been forced to specify that it hopes that he will receive ‘fair and correct treatment and an open trial according to the rule of law before an independent court with access to legal counsel of his (Mr Öcalan"s) choice" with the condition that, if this is the case, it ‘cannot but affect EU‐Turkey relations positively". In this way, the Council has displayed its concern as to whether or not these conditions will be met.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, on this subject as on many others, the European Parliament is wearing rose‐coloured spectacles, wishing to see its counterparts not as they are but as it wishes them to be. We cannot have double standards when differences between fact and fiction reach such a high level. It is perfectly acceptable for the CEECs to participate in these programmes as soon as they meet the appropriate criteria and if they are preparing to eventually become part of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Turkey has a great deal of ground to cover even to meet these criteria, if indeed it hopes to go further and become part of the Union. In effect, Turkey, which only has a tiny section of its territory on the European continent is not a European nation, neither through its history nor its civilisation. It would be more constructive and more logical to make this clear once and for all and to develop partnership agreements and close relations with this large country that are founded on something other than promises of possible membership that are always being postponed. That is why we voted against this report.</p>

What is at stake here is whether to allow Turkey to become involved in Community programmes on education and youth. These programmes, the Socrates and Youth for Europe III programmes, do of course expire at the end of 1999, so it is therefore not at all certain that young Turks would in fact participate. However, voting in favour of this step does at least mean acting on principle and improving relations in sectors that are essential for Turkey"s future, that is, education and youth. What is more, this House already stated that it was in favour of this in a resolution in September 1998, while the Luxembourg European Council of December 1997 confirmed that Turkey was eligible to become a member of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Voting in favour of this step also means helping young Turks to open their minds through contact with their European counterparts. It means encouraging them to become more tolerant and, as a result, we can hope that the Turkish population in general will become aware of the fact that democratisation is vital and necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Voting in favour of this step is a challenge for the future and a challenge for the respect for human rights. For these challenges to be met, there is a need for education and specific training that can be obtained by participating in these programmes and in exchanges.</p>

Dialogue with its people, in particular the young, offers a valuable opportunity for discussing the important social issues implied in democratic development. However, this is not the right time to be considering extending the Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes to include Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The manner in which the PKK leader, Abdullah Öcalan, was detained, and the legally dubious conduct of his trial should be met with resistance and denunciation. Turkey refuses to guarantee Abdullah Öcalan a fair trial with legal representation throughout, under the supervision of international observers. Turkey also refuses to discuss the issue of the recognition of Kurdish identity, language and culture, as well as the question of granting regional autonomy to the area inhabited by the Kurds within Turkey's borders. Nor does Turkey recognise democratic rights such as freedom of expression and the right of the Kurds to form democratic parties in the same way as the Turks. HADEP, the predominantly Kurdish party which intends to take part in the Turkish elections on 18 April, is currently awaiting a decision from the Constitutional Court on whether it is to be banned from doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should send a delegation to Turkey to monitor developments in the trial of Abdullah Öcalan; an international conference should also be organised to initiate a dialogue for peace in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">It would create the wrong impression if Turkey were to be given EU funding and allowed to participate in various EU programmes before there is any clear indication of how it intends to tackle the Kurdish question. As a condition of participation in the Customs Union with the EU, Turkey promised, amongst other things, to comply with the requirements relating to democracy and human rights, and to stop the use of torture.</p>

Many stolen vehicles end up being taken out of the EU, where they are repainted, re‐registered and sold on. In order to combat car theft it is necessary to be able to check registration certificates, but differences in the Member States" rules on certificates make verification difficult. The proposed directive is therefore a valuable and necessary initiative on the part of the Commission, providing for a uniform set of minimum indications and information codes on vehicle registration certificates in the EU. Fortunately, Parliament's amendments to the Commission text from first reading have to a large extent been taken up by the Council. Hence there is a good chance that the directive will be adopted and implemented soon, so that it may become possible to put a stop to phenomena such as organised car theft in the EU.</p>

The last compromise voted through in 1998 left us feeling rather disappointed by the European Commission"s overcautiousness. Today, however, I see that our efforts have been rewarded as the overall budget for 2000‐2006 has increased. As a result, I approve the Pack report.</p>
<p class="contents">The 119 million students and 4 million teachers in the European Union hope to see this programme continue, a programme that has allowed half a million students to study in another country. It has given 60 000 teachers the chance to teach abroad and has allowed 110 000 young people to take part in educational exchanges.</p>
<p class="contents">Such cooperation must be encouraged and this increased mobility and the general European dimension must be developed at all stages of education. In fact, 87 % of participants believe that their involvement in Socrates was positive, particularly as regards European integration and in terms of increasing awareness of our immediate neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">The new philosophy behind Socrates II concentrates more on the needs that have not been met over the past five years, such as enlarging the programme to include young adults with no qualifications and to include the applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this, it would be impossible to maintain this programme with an ever‐decreasing level of resources, something that has afflicted the Socrates programme from the outset. Today"s increase in the budget is therefore extremely significant and logical.</p>

The Commission supported us by adopting, in full or in part, 34 of the 54 amendments tabled at first reading. At the last meeting of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, our rapporteur was able to reach a compromise with our colleague Mr Elchlepp, and we now have a very good report in our hands.</p>
<p class="contents">We should like the idea of student mobility to be strengthened, particularly in the case of those who are already undergoing training. What is more, we maintain that students" socio‐economic situation should be properly analysed and taken into consideration when awarding grants. In addition, we would urge the Member States to provide the extra funding needed for such mobility. To put it clearly, we would ask them not to stop helping a young person financially just because he is participating in a Socrates programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, all that remains is to confirm our budgetary proposals through our vote today: EUR 2 500 million over a period of seven years, instead of EUR 1 550 million for the same period, as the Council of Ministers wishes.

In our view, the European rules have certain advantages: that patents are only granted for inventions which are new in relation to what was known before the application was filed.

Clearly, it is a basic principle of any patent law that patents must not be granted on inventions which are already publicly known. But the grace period, which is a feature of American and Japanese patent law for example, gives an advantage to these countries in relation to the EU in an area which has great importance for the development of firms and the creation of new jobs. It is therefore absolutely essential for this imbalance to be removed by the introduction of a limited grace period in the EU as well, during which patents can be granted on inventions which are publicly known.</p>

<p class="contents">In effect, there is a need to promote all sectors that support waste management for packaging materials and do not restrict such waste management to reuse or recycling alone. Heat recycling is a possibility and this should not be forgotten. Packaging such as cardboard or wood is useful in the incineration process for household waste.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the conformity assessment procedure for packaging, packaging manufacturers must accept responsibility, not those who recycle it. This can be achieved by applying the ‘polluter pays" principle and by simplifying the administrative procedure on the number of operators.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to clarify our group"s position on eco‐taxes on packaging. In some Member States, heavy and restrictive eco‐tax systems have been implemented and are restricting access to their market for products from other Member States. In this respect, it is essential that the Commission adopts a clear position, based on eco‐tax systems applied in both Germany and France. In effect, these systems are based on a common marking system that is valid for the whole of the ‘waste recovery" sector. They are based on a simple and fair administrative system, both for internal operators in the Member State and for operators from other Member States. They are also based on a system that allows the integrated management of packaging and waste packaging to be applied in the best possible way.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that the tax system must also be fair in relation to the material or materials used in producing the packaging. In France, for example, some public services wish to introduce a reduced VAT system promoting the ‘multi‐material" approach in order to promote the <span class="italic">Eco‐emballages</span> company, and yet this is to the detriment of other eco‐tax collecting companies. If such a fiscal change is introduced, recycling sectors such as the glass recycling sector would be penalised and other more polluting materials would benefit.</p>

<p class="contents">The vote in this House displays two major flaws. One relates to what we call ‘premixes", in other words, alcoholic drinks containing carbonated water, sugar, and flavourings and that are aimed at young people. After the vote in this House, these drinks would have a much more beneficial labelling procedure than wines or spirits. Wine is a cultural product aimed at an older population and is mainly consumed during meals. The effects of the alcohol in wine and in such premixes are therefore totally different as these premixes are consumed on empty stomachs during evenings out.</p>
<p class="contents">The second flaw concerns the list of products included in the annex. In effect, Amendment No 14 from Mr Hallam included beer, cider and perry in this directive. However, such drinks are not agricultural products, that is, they do not come under the common organisation of the specific markets, as governed by agricultural regulations under Article 43. Brewers" and cider producers" attempts to amalgamate these products could harm the whole of the wine‐producing sector.</p>

But in my country, the government is, at the same time, in favour of producing cigarettes, and for every packet sold pockets 75 % tax. We are right to ask whether the concern shown for public health is not merely a screen to hide the true tax objective of maintaining significant budgetary revenue. In France, and undoubtedly in other countries of the Union, smokers are being milked in the same way as motorists are.</p>

We must encourage the production of quality tobacco with lower tar levels. This is why, on the whole, we support reform of the COM in tobacco, and supporting it just this once will not do any harm.

I am therefore pleased that the rapporteur addresses this matter in his report. It is interesting that because of single market dogma, the Commission could not care less about the people who will lose their jobs through the abolition of duty‐free, and yet it has been similarly indifferent to the jobs in the tobacco industry which are threatened by the differences within the single market which allow smuggling. My own preference would be for my national government to reduce tax on handrolling tobacco in the UK. Given that this is unlikely, the alternative is for taxes on handrolling tobacco to be increased on this side of the English Channel.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1998 alone Customs and Excise in the UK estimated a loss of revenue of £1000 million as a result of cross‐channel smuggling. This did not take account of revenue lost through smuggling in large freight consignments or by air. There is clearly a major problem which is affecting jobs in the UK.

<p class="contents">Protection for the port and sherry denominations of origin was hard won from the European Union and, from the year 2000, from the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore cannot allow this guarantee to be abandoned, particularly when no assurance is given in the draft agreement concluded by Commissioner Deus Pinheiro that South Africa will stop using the port and sherry denominations after the lengthy transition periods have expired, during which South Africa would be able to export, for example, to important markets like the USA.</p>

<p class="contents">The talks with South Africa have been going on for over three years now and I would call to mind the commitment we have entered into to conclude the EU/South Africa agreement by March at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">The final package negotiated by Commissioner Pinheiro and endorsed by the full Commission is the basis of a solid partnership for trade, development and technical cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context I would urge the governments of France, Italy, Spain and Portugal to consider carefully the implications of delaying an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that this agreement is not merely about trade and commerce. It bears a highly political significance. South Africa is a country struggling to build a new democratic identity and reconcile itself with its past. It is a country where there are both political and social problems. This agreement is vital to encourage the processes that have got under way. To hold it up now would be a serious blow to our South African partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to the governments concerned to reassess their position and to remove any obstacles to agreement which reflect a short‐term view of the situation. I call on them to take the long‐term view – to accede to the Commission's proposals which also reflect the wishes of this house and indeed of the Vienna European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Every effort must be made to put in place the Compromise reached at Davos which will allow for a copper‐fastening of EU‐South African relations. This is as I have said a vital agreement for the new South African democracy, but it is also the basis of a partnership of equals, one which will enhance both sides economically as well as strategically.</p>

However, this agreement only makes sense if it is in the interests of all parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet some interests of the parties have not been protected. This is particularly the case with port wine, where it must be made absolutely clear that South Africa may not produce or market any wine with this name after the end of the transition period. This is an issue which must be enshrined in the text of the agreement or in an annexed declaration. The aid of EUR 15 million granted by the European Union only makes sense if it is devoted to converting these wines into table wines or to abandoning this activity, otherwise there is no point in granting a tariff concession for a quota of 32 million litres of table wine.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, we believe that the Council has acted wisely in postponing a decision until all the issues have been clarified. We therefore also voted against the resolution which the House has approved today.</p>

We also cannot ignore the importance and necessity of helping to consolidate a regime which has allowed South Africa to regain its national dignity and which is trying to eradicate racism. Some of those who are now claiming to defend democracy in South Africa, and who previously ignored the persecution and crimes of the apartheid regime and regarded President Mandela as a terrorist, do not have the moral and political authority to invoke democracy with regard to this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this and despite the fact that the Vienna Council stated that a decision on a draft agreement should be taken by March of this year, it should be stressed that the further postponement of this decision is not particularly worrying. In fact, the specific commitments made by Commissioner Deus Pinheiro on behalf of the Commission are not totally acceptable as they are opposed by at least four Member States (Portugal, France, Spain and Italy). They must therefore be revised so that an agreement which claims to be balanced does not prejudice important Community sectors. With regard to my own country, these commitments must not undermine the port wine industry, which is so important to the national economy. Reasonable deadlines should therefore be set in order to finally end the production and marketing of a product which is made only in the Douro valley in Portugal and whose denomination of origin cannot be used elsewhere, whatever the pretext.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore consider it prudent not to offer concessions but rather to wait a little longer in order to ensure the effective protection of this and other issues. In this way, an agreement can be rapidly reached which fully satisfies all the parties involved. We therefore do not support the proposal approved today, which ignores important aspects of the future agreement between the European Union and South Africa. If these elements are omitted, they could compromise the full political and economic effectiveness of this agreement.</p>

<p class="contents">I share the rapporteur"s approach in linking working time to safety. But I would also like to add here the quality of life of employees. However, I note that the text, as a matter of principle, states that a reduction in working time cannot be accompanied by a drop in basic wages. This was a necessary step.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, it may be dangerous to link a reduction in working time to the concept of flexibility, as we are aware that, as a general rule, employees in the transport sector already have to be extremely flexible. Such flexibility brings with it a strong possibility of a direct or indirect lack of safety when one looks at the extent of current working hours.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I should also like to congratulate the Commission, and Mr Neil Kinnock in particular, who became aware of these risks very early on. He was also aware of the impact on society of social dumping by certain companies and its repercussions in terms of intra‐Community competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, when faced with the growing internationalisation of transport, it is increasingly necessary to defend our legislation in international bodies and to obtain basic rules, particularly for sea and air transport.</p>
<p class="contents">I now hope that this important step towards harmonising social legislation for the transport sector will serve as a lesson for other sectors to follow.</p>

Yet the Commission and the Member States alike are persisting in this logic and promoting new measures aimed at the railways and at passenger road transport. They insist on adhering to the timetable for the complete liberalisation of maritime cabotage.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, the provision of high‐level social protection for people working in this sector is especially important, to the extent that this improves existing working conditions, complies strictly with protective regulations, supports collective labour agreements and reduces working hours without reducing incomes. The Commission could use the opportunity of the debate on extending the working time directive in the transport sector to revise the working week downwards. We are opposed to any attempt to further extend flexibility and to allow the jettisoning of rules on the working week by extending the transition period for mobile workers which is provided for in the proposed scheme. Moreover, there must be clear consolidation of the concept of working time, since this is an especially sensitive concept in the transport sector. It must include not only driving hours and the time taken to load and unload, but the whole time workers are at the service of their employer.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, we deplore the lack of measures on the part of the Commission to address the issue of the undermining of working conditions and wage agreements through national legislation to enable companies to increase their profits in the light of increased competition. The issue of second merchant shipping registers, for example, must be addressed immediately. Instead of taking measures to improve legislation in the Member States, the Commission, through its proposal to amend the regulation on cabotage, is taking away from the recipient state the power to determine its own staffing arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that international competition and, more generally, market forces must under no circumstances be used as an alibi in order to reduce protection. On the contrary, they require the most concerted efforts to institute high‐level social laws which would strengthen the level of protection in countries with less social protection, protect working people, and ensure their safety and that of users. This can only be achieved by respecting the principle of public service and by curbing the progress of misguided liberalisation, which thus far has led only to negative developments.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection of people working in the transport industry is especially urgent today, since the intensive liberalisation of the sector has given rise to the most serious problems and to the dramatic weakening of safety and working conditions of working people. On this basis, we wish to highlight the positive nature of many of the rapporteur"s proposals and to ask that they be adopted and implemented.</p>

Firstly there is the maintenance of the principle of relative stability. There are also, in particular, elements which were included in the report as a result of our amendments and which confirm the House"s desire not only to keep access to the 12‐mile reserved zone within the exclusive national sovereignty of the coastal countries but also to extend this zone to 24 miles.</p>
<p class="contents">These elements are important and decisive for the implementation of a regionalisation policy which, as we understand it, means applying the principle of subsidiarity to the common fisheries policy. This can be achieved by increasing decentralisation, which will allow the Member States to adapt general guidelines on stock preservation and monitoring of the common fisheries policy and to determine, together with the sector and the European Community, which specific measures at regional and/or national level are suitable for converting into more general objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this is not how the report sees regionalisation. In the report, regionalisation seems to be a very vague and inadequately defined concept which consists more of dividing seas and parts of oceans into regions and sub‐regions. These would then be subject to devolved management assumed by various groups of countries in accordance with the geographic location of these divisions. Under this management, guidelines would be regarded as definitive and not subject to joint discussion, and they would cover nearly all the aspects currently falling under the common fisheries policy. The imbalances and discrimination which could result from this are clear.</p>

I cannot conceive that innovative businesses will settle in regions that often have few transport services and that, in fact, find it difficult to break this vicious circle.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must not conceal another constraint linked to the Member States. We must remember that European regional planning is still heavily dependent on national planning policies where control has been devolved to the various governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, there is a need to develop our degree of synergy. Such synergy between local authorities, the Member States and the European Union is, of course, complex but it is also vital. And we must also promote the development of cross‐border systems of decision‐making.</p>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur is quite rightly disappointed by the small share of the Structural Funds given over to research: 5.37 % for Objective 1 and 2.06 % for Objective 5b. The European Union could obtain added value by encouraging high‐quality scientific projects and by linking economic and social partners to these projects, such as SMEs, consular bodies and universities.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the report emphasises the role SMEs can play in technological development. On many occasions, we have had the opportunity to stress the importance of SMEs in terms of job creation and also in terms of the vitality of the rural world. SMEs must be able to reap the benefits of research that has been carried out. Therefore, it is vital that we make adapted and efficient financial instruments available to them.</p>
<p class="contents">In promoting the competitiveness of SMEs, our policy on research and technological development will encourage social cohesion and the vitality of the least‐favoured regions. Mr de Lassus himself mentions the case of ultra‐peripheral and island regions. We believe it is essential that we also highlight the case of rural areas and areas dependent on fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, new information technologies offer us the opportunity to set up or to relocate research and development teams in these rural areas. Such teams will allow businesses established in outlying regions to have access to the new technologies they need to remain competitive and innovative. Whilst we must be wary of being too optimistic, we must realistically make use of the new opportunities that are available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">We are naturally disappointed that Mr de Lassus is making use of this occasion to call for a European regional planning policy. However, the quality of his work and the relevance of his proposals encouraged the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations to support his report.</p>

<p class="contents">On the whole, I share the rapporteur"s concerns regarding the transport, banking and nuclear fields. In this respect, I support the idea put forward in the text to help Russia to get over this hurdle. The dangers may become real, even without giving way to gloom‐mongering. Therefore, it is our duty to prevent such risks in this field and also in other sectors of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do wonder about the responsibilities of the main actors in the information technology industry in the face of this deadline, a deadline we have been aware of for many years. I am astonished, to say the least, that they feel that once a product has been put on the market, they can wash their hands of it.</p>
<p class="contents">This is how they behave over problems linked to changing over to the year 2000, but it is also a valid observation for other products that need regular updating to correct some hidden defects, and for which the luckless buyer must foot the bill.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I will vote for the resolution by Mr McCartin so that the Commission can negotiate with this industry to allow individuals and small businesses to rectify this ‘error". It is to be hoped that they will do so without, yet again, having to pay for a problem that has been evident for a long time yet for which they are not responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I believe that now is the time for us to extend the debate so that we can take steps that will allow us to protect the consumer"s basic rights as regards businesses that supply hardware and software.</p>

Many of these vital services could be affected by the ‘year 2000' problem. The responsibility for solving the year 2000 problem rests of course in the first instance with the suppliers and users of the computer programmes, but because the problem is so extensive, the public authorities must also provide support. I therefore endorse the Commission's many initiatives in the year 2000 area, including the launching of cooperation across national borders and discussions of the problem in the Council and with all the relevant contacts in industry and the Member States. The Commission's reports on what progress has been made in solving the problem will be of great importance in coordinating efforts. It is of course absolutely essential that particular attention should be paid to especially sensitive sectors, including for example the cross‐frontier problems which may arise at the Eastern European nuclear power stations, and for the necessary measures to be taken.</p>

Although it may at first appear to be a minor technical matter, the millennium bug has in fact the potential to bring the everyday life of millions of people to a grinding halt – if not worse. It is easy to forget how much nowadays we rely on microchips to run everything from dishwashers to dialysis machines. Vital services could be interrupted, transport could come to a stop and businesses could be forced to close. Yet with proper preparation, we can ensure that our hangovers on 1 January 2000 will just be from bubbly and not from bugs.</p>
<p class="contents">Britain under the Labour Government is leading the battle to beat the millennium bug in Europe with its ground‐breaking Action 2000 campaign. Under its auspices, British utility companies (including water, gas, electricity and telephone companies) have already reported that they expect to offer ‘business as usual' over the millennium. Other vital public services, such as the NHS, emergency services, DSS, Post Office and railways, are not far behind.</p>
<p class="contents">Britain cannot afford to rely solely on its own efforts, however. In an increasingly globalised world, the preparedness of other countries (or lack of it) will affect Britain too. I wish to ensure that my constituents are free to enjoy the millennium without fearing the morning after. I therefore support EU efforts to ensure that Europe – and the world as a whole – are ready to swat the millennium bug.</p>
