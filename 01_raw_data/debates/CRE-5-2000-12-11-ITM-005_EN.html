<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liese (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, medical research which is essential for patients must be approved quickly and with minimum bureaucracy, but at the same time ethical boundaries must be strictly respected and the subjects must be given maximum protection from abuse. This was the European Parliament's objective in the legislative procedure on clinical trials, and I believe that today we can say that this objective has been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">In an informal trilogue last week, the Council told us that it could accept most of the amendments tabled by the lead committee and that there were a number of places where it wanted further drafting changes, which we can make through compromise amendments tabled by four groups tomorrow. For a long time, it seemed as though an agreement was going to be impossible. Positions here in Parliament were very far apart, but they were equally divergent between the Member States and the different institutions. We have now reached an agreement and I should like to thank all those involved for their part in achieving this: colleagues, the Commission, also the Council, and, in particular, the French Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromises which we have agreed greatly improve the common position from the European Parliament's point of view. There is clarification that, as a general rule, consent in a clinical trial has to be given in writing. There is clarification that interventions in the human germ line cannot be accepted. There is recognition that non-commercial clinical trials, which industry either cannot or will not support, are nevertheless important and that rules need to be drawn up for them. I am particularly pleased that we have struck a very good compromise on clinical tests on people who are unable to give legal consent themselves. This issue of research involving those who are incapable of giving informed consent has caused heated controversy in the Member States, as well as here in Strasbourg in the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Positions also differed amongst those involved in this legislative procedure. Originally, the Council did not want to include any provision in the directive at all and wanted to leave it up to the Member States. The European Parliament decided at first reading that clinical trials of this kind should only be permitted if it could be shown that each individual clinical trial was of direct benefit to each individual patient. Now we have found a compromise, and I do not think that it is a compromise formula or a formulaic compromise; it is a proposal supported by the facts which provides a good solution to the problem, at least in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the direct benefit is concerned, investigators running clinical trials have to identify those cases where it is necessary to administer medical products and carry out the accompanying examinations in order to draw conclusions for future patients. This is an important condition which we make here in our report. Then a distinction has to be drawn between children and adults who are incapable of giving informed consent. Children's metabolisms have particular characteristics, which is why medicines which are administered to children also need to be tested on children in clinical trials. This is not the case in many areas at present. Children are given medicines which have only been tested on adults, which means that children are badly treated. The report aims to ensure that children in Europe receive better treatment in the future, that they suffer fewer side effects and are given the right doses.</p>
<p class="contents">We have drawn up very, very strict rules for this. The rules, which were drawn up in committee, which the Council will accept and which Parliament will hopefully adopt tomorrow, are stricter than those laid down by the Council of Europe in its so-called Bioethics Convention, but the rules explicitly permit research, and we think that this research – when it is conducted in accordance with the rules – is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect I am therefore happy with the compromise which has been reached. I am unhappy with two aspects. Originally at the first reading we had demanded a shorter deadline for authorising clinical trials, and I had hoped that the deadline of 60 days, which is provided for in the common position, would be reduced somewhat, at least for the national authorities. You see, I believe that it is perfectly acceptable to grant a rather longer deadline to an Ethics Committee, whose work is not the main job of the people who work there, but surely the authorities should be put under some pressure to start the work quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it was unlikely that a compromise would be reached on this basis in the Council, and I would therefore prefer to put the compromise struck with the Council to the vote rather than having a long conciliation procedure, with perhaps no agreement at the end. The situation is the same for the issue of whether the principal investigator should be a doctor or whether other professions should also be authorised. Parliament continues to want doctors to be the only ones to carry out clinical trials in all of the Member States because we believe that nurses and midwives should not be active in this sensitive area even if they have additional training, and neither should biologists or pharmaceutical chemists, who may only have worked in the laboratory and not have sufficient experience with patients. I must concede, however, that the Council was not prepared to compromise further here either. That is why we must, with a heavy heart, agree to this compromise. If we accept it we will still have a directive which guarantees therapeutic progress and which does not just leave the protection of patients in Europe as it is but improves it, and that is why I would plead in favour of this compromise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patrie (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this directive, before us today for the second time, falls within the delicate context of international competition in pharmaceutical research and major health challenges, particularly in paediatric medicine. It allows us to resolve the problem of clinical trials being held simultaneously in several Member States and at several locations.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position forwarded to us by the Council is some improvement on the Commission’s proposal and especially on Parliament’s first reading. There are several points we can agree with. Thus, the principle selected for starting a clinical trial is tacit authorisation from both the Ethics Committee and the competent authorities in the Member States. The opinion of the Ethics Committee is determinant as it comes first and the absence of a negative opinion in fact means the trial can begin immediately without loss of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we agree with the Council’s proposals on labelling medicines used in such trials.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, some other points could be improved and I am glad the Council is prepared, as I understand it, to make a number of compromises.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think there can be any question of compromise on the first point, which I consider essential. The consent of persons taking part in a clinical trial must necessarily be given in writing and if that is not possible, for example in case of temporary inability to write, a witness must be present when consent is received.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, consent must be informed, which means, in particular, that the person taking part must have been informed of the conditions under which the trial is to be conducted, the potential risks that he runs and his unrestricted right to withdraw from the trial at any time.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally – and I think this point is fundamental – we must ensure that the greatest possible protection is guaranteed to those who are not in a position to give their consent: the weakest, children and legally incapacitated adults. They must be able to expect direct benefit from the clinical trial. In particular, the opinion of minors must at least be listened to because account must be taken of their clinical and psychological characteristics.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me right not to include adults incapable of giving consent in clinical trials that could be carried out on adults who are capable. Finally, adults incapable of giving consent should only participate in trials that relate to the condition affecting them and causing their incapacity.</p>
<p class="contents">So, although there are still some points of disagreement with the Council, I would like to remind you that the result we are seeking to obtain through the adoption of this directive is the outcome of lengthy and fruitful compromise negotiations between Mr Liese, our rapporteur, whom I thank and congratulate on his inclusive and constructive approach, and the Council, which has proved cooperative and open to the amendments adopted at second reading in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. So after what Mr Liese has just told us, I am very hopeful that we will rapidly reach an agreement allowing us to avoid a long conciliation that would be not very productive in the end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are dealing with a particularly important directive here. It may contribute to improving clinical research in Europe and hence the welfare of millions of sick people. The sector is sensitive. It is a matter of scientific progress, but also ethics and morals: in short, value judgments.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the first reading, Parliament has concentrated on the protection of people incapable of giving informed consent to these clinical trials: children and adults with a mental handicap. These groups must remain within the scope of the directive. Excluding them would mean obstructing research into conditions specifically affecting them. In some cases scientific and experimental research is their only hope.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, we know that empirically dividing the adult dose to treat children has already led to tragedy in the past. Then there is the opposite extreme, children not treated because, although the specific medicine to cure them exists, it has not been tested for them.</p>
<p class="contents">So we want these groups to benefit from advances in research, while laying down conditions for these trials which are as severe and strict as possible. That is the aim of Amendments Nos 36 and 37 in particular: full and objective information, adapted to children – a point I consider very important; informed written consent from parents or legal representatives; exclusion of any financial advantage; control of protocol by ethics committees. In these amendments we also refer, not once but twice, to the fact that the interests of the patient are always more important than those of science and society. Children and disabled people are fragile people who need maximum protection. But there must be no ban: these patients must not be shut out beyond the gates of hope research represents for them, sometimes the last thread still linking them to life.</p>
<p class="contents">One more word, on another point I consider highly important, I mean Amendment No 30 which concerns non-commercial clinical trials. It is crucial that the directive take account of this academic research. Nor must it be penalised. It is especially beneficial to the patients concerned. I am particularly thinking of cancer research, but there are many others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should, however, also like to remind you that it was the Green Group which made this proposal at the first reading, in the face of much resistance – including, I am afraid, from the current rapporteur. We did so in an amendment tabled at the time which many colleagues here supported and which provided that no research should be carried out on those unable to give written consent unless it was of direct benefit to them. It was only, in my view, this amendment, tabled by us, that made this important debate possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress this once more: I am glad that the rapporteur has given ground on this point because it has allowed us to reach what I believe is a very good compromise. This compromise, which of course can be further improved upon by each Member State, constitutes a minimum standard, to ensure that we do not have a kind of ethical dumping in the European Union and to avoid a situation where it is possible to carry out research on those unable to give informed consent in one Member State and not in others.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to stress once more that this compromise goes beyond the proposals in the Council of Europe's Bioethics Convention, because we have much greater protection for patients, with a much stronger link to their own interests, for example, consent given by a representative can be revoked at any time.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased, however, that we have succeeded in clamping down on germ-line gene therapy. It must be quite clear that clinical research which seeks to introduce germ-line manipulation by the back door must not be possible, because this would be a violation of human dignity. That is why I believe that this compromise is very good, particularly when you consider that the Member States are able to introduce even stricter rules. Through this compromise we are making it clear that there must be no ethical dumping at European level and that there must be no research which is of benefit to outsiders on those unable to give informed consent.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to cordially request that the Council re-examine our amendment on placebos. Here, as you know, we have proposed that research involving placebos should only take place if it can be proved that there is no other way of monitoring effectiveness, because we wish to avoid research taking place if there is no direct benefit, but at the same time we wish to enable research to happen. That is why we made this proposal, and I should like to ask the French Presidency to kindly make a note to answer this question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why medical science should be given every possible means of properly protecting individual and public health. Unfortunately, although the right measures are taken, they are unable to prevent new risks and diseases from emerging which the drugs available are unable to treat, and the medical community is obliged to find modern, more effective ways of meeting these challenges. Clinical trials are a necessary step in this direction, provided that they are conducted in a way which safeguards the dignity and the mental and physical welfare of the subjects. Current differences between the laws, regulations and administrative provisions in the Member States are creating obstacles to and competition between pharmaceutical companies in their bid to make new drugs quickly available to patients. Hence the need for harmonisation at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Because it recognises the importance of this directive, the European Parliament has endeavoured to overcome its differences rather than hold up the legislative process, focusing on the following safety conditions for clinical trials: the written consent of the subjects to the clinical trial, the consent of the guardian or an authority provided for by law and of the treating doctor to the participation of persons with impaired understanding or a mental disorder which prevents them from giving their consent, the criterion being that the expected benefits of the drug being tested must outweigh any side effects. The participation of children in clinical trials must be regulated properly because it is a particularly sensitive issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and here I am dissatisfied with the Council's compromise proposals, I think that the main investigator during clinical trails should be a doctor, because only a doctor has the knowledge and experience needed in order to evaluate the benefits and deal with any side effects or risks which arise during the clinical trial. Of course, the team conducting the clinical trial may include other specialists with the relevant qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Liese, on his report and thank him for his efforts to reach a compromise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission would be happy if, after so much effort on the part of those concerned, we could achieve harmonisation, at Community level, of the requirements for conducting clinical trials. Indeed, this is particularly important for the protection of public health.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, since 1965 Community legislation on pharmaceuticals has required medicines to obtain marketing authorisation before being put on sale. Authorisation is only granted if three fundamental criteria are met: quality, safety and effectiveness. This requirement responds to two essential objectives: the protection of public health and freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">Conducting clinical trials, in accordance with the principles of good clinical practice, makes it possible to test the effectiveness and safety of medicines. Good clinical practice has been the subject of international harmonisation, in the form of guidelines adopted by the International Harmonisation Conference involving representatives of the European Union, the United States and Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as these guidelines are not legally binding, they are applied very differently in the various Member States. This involves difficulties both for participants in clinical trials and industrialists who want to conduct such trials in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what led the Commission to propose, in September 1997, a legislative framework, based on Article 95 of the Treaty, with the aim of harmonising the procedures applying to clinical trials in the European Union. The Commission modified its proposal in April 1999 to take account of the opinion of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position of the Council, adopted in July 2000, is essentially based on the Commission’s amended proposal and incorporates most of the amendments suggested by the European Parliament and accepted by the Commission, which entirely appreciates the European Parliament’s concern in tabling amendments largely aimed at finalising the protection of the individuals taking part in clinical trials, especially children and adults incapable of giving consent.</p>
<p class="contents">Where it is essential for these groups to have medicines specially adapted to them, the challenge is to be able to carry out trials whilst ensuring their protection. In-depth work, carried out in full cooperation between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, has made it possible to draft a compromise which takes account of all the points raised and indicates where positions occasionally diverge.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept all the compromise amendments. In fact, they meet the Commission’s objectives, that is, the protection of public health in the eyes of those taking part in clinical trials, the need to facilitate the establishment of clinical trials within the European Union, and the need for the pharmaceutical industry to be competitive internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission can accept compromise Amendments Nos 28 to 43. It can also accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 21, 23 and 24. The Commission can also accept Amendments Nos 5, 11, 15, 17, 25, 26 and 27, in principle, but on the other hand, it cannot accept Amendments Nos 4, 18, 20 and 22. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
