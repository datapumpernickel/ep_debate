<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ullmann </span> <span class="bold">(V), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the use of electronics in public and private communication is so far advanced today that the mechanisms used for such communication can even speak and read digitised language. Not only are they capable of doing these things; they actually do them in the market for goods and services and in the area of official and private communications. What are the legal consequences of this, and which legal questions need to be answered? Our task is to translate the present legal standards in these fields to take account of the new communication dimensions without restricting them.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft directive before us does this in a restricted but fundamental area, namely that of signatures and authentications of every type, albeit – and this must always be emphasised – only in open systems. Only three things have to be regulated in this context: the conditions for guaranteeing the reliable identification of the person communicating by means of an electronic medium, whether digital or binary, the integrity of the transmitted information and the legal status of electronic or digital signatures. So it is not a matter of the relationship between the power of the state and that of the market in the realm of public and private security, as is sometimes claimed. It is actually about the relationship between public information and privacy in the digitisation of certificates and their legal validity.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive takes a convincing approach to solving this problem by laying down provisions on the equivalence of electronic and written signatures on the one hand and by restricting the conditions of certification to the minimum standards which are indispensable for European harmonisation, as the two annexes to the directive put it.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions in the Council at the present time evidently centre on the desire, founded on the current legal position in the Member States, to have a higher standard of public security. The German Government has told me that there could be a compromise solution to this issue, involving the addition of an Annex III, dealing with the technical specifications for certification equipment. I am interested to hear, Commissioner Bangemann, what the Commission thinks of this proposal, which has no doubt come to your attention too. I believe Parliament could live with it. In my view there is a small problem, but otherwise this Annex III does not affect the basic rationale of the directive: completely free market access for all providers of certification services and guaranteed protection of consumers' privacy within reasonable levels of data protection, including scope for the use of pseudonyms and incorporation of the principal rules governing liability.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the amendments tabled are concerned, I recommend their adoption, with the exception of Amendments Nos 2, 4, 8, 9, 21, 22 and 26, which either create inconsistencies within the directive, duplicate other clauses or effectively water down the provisions of the directive. I therefore ask the House to approve the report, but I cannot do so without thanking Directorates‐General XIII and XV of the Commission for their extremely willing and active cooperation, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and the draftsman of its opinion, Mr Tappin, as well as all the other honourable Members whose amendments have helped to improve the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me make a prophecy to all those who have stayed away from this interesting midnight debate: you will be amazed at the impact this directive will have. In the Federal Republic of Germany, no fewer than 3 800 laws are affected by it. This should keep us in suspense.</p>

It is estimated that commerce on the Internet will double by July.</p>
<p class="contents">In all Member States there are moves towards introducing technology into so many aspects of daily life – for example, electronic voting, electronic social security systems and electronic banking transactions. If we are to move into an electronic age we must have safe and controllable procedures in place to ensure that citizens and organisations can carry out transactions swiftly and securely. We need a clear common framework for electronic signatures to boost confidence in the new technologies. We need to make sure that we do not sacrifice peace of mind for convenience. An electronic signature needs to have parity under the law with a manuscript signature. There should be no distinction, no disadvantage and no privilege.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason we have focused on the need for those who issue certificates to respect the information carried electronically and the fundamental rights of a signatory to privacy. A signatory must be able to determine the extent to which their personal data are published in directories. Pseudonyms must be available for legitimate use but not be allowed to cover illicit transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ensure that the move to electronic trading is not accompanied by a growth in fraud. Also, recognising the range of existing proposals and initiatives currently operating within the different Member States, the need to protect the principles of the internal market are paramount. We have an obligation to ensure that the shift to the use of electronic signatures does not create technological barriers and there is, not just within the European Union, the need to promote the principle of interoperability on a worldwide basis. For this reason it is vital that the Commission involves experts in the formation and review of policy.</p>

<p class="contents">As already expressed by Parliament in its resolution of 17 July 1998, it is important to set up a regulatory framework to ensure that electronic signatures and manuscript signatures have the same status in law, so that a document bearing an electronic signature may be used as evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal is at stake here, and according to Internet forecasts electronic commerce should reach 220 billion dollars this year, or by next year at the latest, of which Europe will account for 26 billion. The know‐how of traders, bankers and computer scientists in converting a network that is ill‐adapted to economic needs – we must remember that it was the two principles of freedom and lack of cost that governed the network in the beginning – into an area for commercial transactions must not blind us to the fact that the protection of personal data and compilation of customised listings are often a neglected aspect of the legal problems posed by the development of electronic commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, this proposal for a directive carries on this unfortunate custom. However, I congratulate Mr Ullmann on having included the proposals put forward in my opinion on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs. They aim to clarify the status of certification service providers in order to prevent the divergent measures that have already been seen in a number of our Member States. Take the case of France, where two decree‐laws have created intermediaries, known as ‘trusted third parties", which carry out their work under the supervision of an administrative super‐service, the French central service for security of information systems.</p>
<p class="contents">This super‐service actually seems to be more keen to ensure that the information systems do not have any security which they cannot penetrate rather than checking that they are secure. Another example is the case of Spain, where the 1998 finance law this time authorises the Minister for Home Affairs to act as a certification service provider. It is doubtful whether such a measure guarantees the confidence of the signatories. I say this simply to remind you that cyber consumers also have rights and that the pretence of secrecy, anonymity and confidentiality must become a reality once again.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Berger </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of my group, may I convey our sincere congratulations to the rapporteur for his report. In particular, I wish to thank him for guiding this report through the committee stage and now through the plenary stage within a fairly short time of our receiving the draft from the Commission. I believe we all agree that the entry into force of this directive is a matter of extreme urgency, since it will put an end to the tangled mass of disparate legal provisions that are hampering the single market in the domain of electronic signatures, a crucial aspect of cross‐border electronic transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two major concerns of the Commission and the rapporteur that deserve particular support. The first is their desire to strike a balance between the need to ensure that the new areas of business activity opened up by the electronic signature are not shackled and virtually nipped in the bud by excessively detailed and restrictive rules – for which we have had no shortage of proposals in Parliament – and the need to increase demand for these services and promote acceptance of electronic signatures by means of confidence‐building measures. I think we have jointly succeeded in establishing an even better balance than the one created in the Commission proposal, in particular by stipulating that providers of certification services should be independent and that accreditation systems should be voluntary, and by providing for the additional option of these accreditation systems being operated by non‐governmental organisations too. These provisions and the liability legislation, which we have done nothing to alter, may also be regarded as start‐up aid for future providers of certification services or as a sign of trust in their ability to deliver. At the same time, we expect them to make good use of these benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second concern relates to the principle that whatever is legal offline must be legal online, and whatever is illegal offline must be illegal online. We must help to establish this principle in all its implications. This applies especially to the right of consumers to use a pseudonym for online transactions in order to preserve the anonymity that is customary when small everyday purchases are made in shops. The consumer's right to conduct small electronic transactions under a pseudonym can also serve to prevent the creation of excessively detailed customer profiles.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to appeal to the Commission to accept the amendments adopted by Parliament, to the rapporteur to reconsider his position with regard to Amendment No 26, and above all to the Council to come up quickly with a common position.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Mosiek‐Urbahn </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I also wish to begin by sincerely thanking the rapporteur for his swift and very cooperative work. In the field of electronic commerce, consumers and businesses in Europe must be able to rely on every message being attributable to its actual sender, with no possibility of legal doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">So as not to obstruct the development of our economy, we must therefore give the people of Europe the opportunity to supplement the traditional written signature by electronic means. In my own country of Germany, a law was passed a year ago which provides for the use of digital signatures at quite a high level of security. The first electronic identity cards, in other words smart cards with which electronic signatures can be produced, have been on the market since last week.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore high time that this material was incorporated into a uniform European framework, otherwise there is a danger that we shall eventually have 15 different laws on digital signatures with a variety of different standards. This would ultimately result in serious impairment of the free movement of goods and services in our internal market. That is why the draft directive that the Commission presented to Parliament last year was such a welcome development.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive guarantees providers of certification services free access to the market; provided that electronic signatures fulfil certain conditions, it puts them on a par with conventional signatures and recognises their validity in cross‐border transactions and as evidence in court proceedings. Provisions governing the liability of certification service providers are designed to ensure consumer and business confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">So although I believe that some of the amendments adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights do represent useful improvements, the Commission proposal itself was a very progressive and balanced one. For example, Article 8(3) of the proposal provides for digital signature certificates to be issued under a pseudonym at the signatory's request. Not only do we have no reservations about this provision, we expressly welcome it.</p>
<p class="contents">In its efforts to ensure the protection of personal data, however, the Commission goes rather too far. In its proposal, it seeks to ensure that the identity of any person using a pseudonym cannot be revealed without that person's consent, unless such information is required for the investigation of criminal offences. It is therefore gratifying to note that an amendment – the rapporteur's Amendment No 27, which was adopted by a clear majority in committee – also permits the transfer of such data if it is necessary for legal claims relating to transactions in which a pseudonym was used. I do not think this amendment diminishes the protection afforded to personal data, particularly since any such transfer is explicitly required to comply with the provisions of data protection legislation. On the contrary, this amendment strikes a balance between the rights of the pseudonym user and the interests of the other party to the transaction.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, a number of other amendments succeed in formulating provisions more precisely and eliminating contradictions. One example is the term ‘digital signature', which standard usage limits to a particular and currently prevalent form of electronic signature. This term has been replaced in the amendments by ‘electronic signature'. In this way, the directive is given broader scope to cover future technological developments.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, there are also some rather inappropriately worded amendments, such as nos 8, 15 and 23, which my group feels have overshot their target, namely to formulate the text more precisely. Instead of the intended clarification, they have the opposite effect and should therefore be rejected. The same applies to the amendment on the electronic submission of petitions, which, in the view of my group, has little to do with digital signatures and is consequently out of place here.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments, namely Nos 6 and 7, seek to have data protection clauses inserted in all multilateral conventions to which the Union is a party. They insist that other parties to such agreements should respect the right of not only the EU but also its Member States to maintain existing rules on data protection. They are thereby placing unnecessary restrictions on the flexibility of the Union at the bargaining table. We therefore cannot support such amendments to the recitals either.</p>
<p class="contents">I assume that, when the votes are taken, the House will bear these considerations in mind and will adopt a balanced version of the directive.</p>

We are therefore pleased that the rapporteur has carried out his work so quickly. However, I still believe that a decision on this proposal should be postponed until the Finnish Presidency. So I look forward to that.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we have made some worthwhile revisions which complement the preliminary work carried out by the Commission. In principle, Certification Service Providers would not have to be accredited, but we have nevertheless highlighted the private organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposed strict responsibility – in Finnish ‘<span class="italic">ankara vastuu</span> '. Now it appears that the Council intends to change this. I should like to ask the Commissioner to clarify the position as regards responsibility in the future. In my view, the Commission's proposal represents a reasonable point of departure.</p>
<p class="contents">A central issue in the directive is legal effect. Is there to be a special technique for this or not? I think that here too the decision we have made, with the Commission, is a good starting‐point. In principle, we should give the same legal effect as we do to manuscript signatures. One might say jokingly that if national legislation does not allow marriage by correspondence, then marriage by electronic means is also inadmissible. That is perfectly reasonable.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do not share the rapporteur's view that we should be prepared to approve the so‐called Annex III put forward by the Council. I do not regard it as being technologically neutral in the way that most of the committee would have wished it to be. I also asked the Commissioner what position he would adopt in future discussions with the Council, since in my view this will be a key factor in future negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to ask the language services whether they do not think that in Swedish the term should be ‘<span class="italic">elektroniska underskrifter</span> ' rather than ‘<span class="italic">elektroniska signaturer</span> '.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oddy </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Ullmann for his – as ever – conscientious work and extremely good report. This is an important subject, as all the other speakers have highlighted. More and more commercial transactions are being conducted by electronic commerce and the Internet particularly facilitates cross‐border transactions. Having a consistent, pragmatic, secure system of recognition of signatures on electronic commerce is important.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal recognises the need to ensure legal recognition of electronic signatures which have the same validity as handwritten signatures. The clarification is necessary for the certification services. Two particular concerns can be highlighted: first, the requirement for privacy; secondly, the requirement for security. The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights recommends that the use of pseudonyms should be investigated and monitored. I recommend this report and the draft directive to the House as an important plank in opening up the single market to electronic commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">As an aside, it is curious that it is mainly women who have stayed for this debate. In some ways we could compare Mr Bangemann to a thorn amongst roses, although I am quite sure he will take the subject very seriously. I am particularly intrigued by the thought of getting married on the Internet. As someone who is not married, perhaps it is something I can look forward to in the next ten years.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bangemann, </span> <span class="italic"> Member of the Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, at the end of her speech, Mrs Oddy just addressed a problem which really can arise in this area, where the issue is to what extent electronic signals can satisfy formal requirements laid down by law in the Member States. It reminds me of my law studies, where one professor used to ask this memorable question: ‘If the legally prescribed answer to the question, ‘Do you take this woman here present for your lawful wedded wife?’ – and this is the very problem which you raised, Mrs Oddy – is ‘I do’, is it sufficient for the gentleman to say ‘But of course’?' That is roughly how a number of the Member States see the problem of electronic signatures too.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur. The report has been of great assistance to us. We have also been able to accept a good number of amendments. Of the 35 amendments, we can accept 17 in their entirety and eight in part. We could not endorse the other amendments, because they either do not actually improve the original wording or touch on problems that lie outside the scope of this directive. That, I have to say, is an old parliamentary failing, which I have often mentioned before. You have this constant urge to use any given piece of legislation to put the whole world to rights. That does nothing to further the cause of clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">It was rightly mentioned that Member States as well as international organisations have been working very assiduously in this area, which means that, if we wish to play our part by obtaining a common set of uniform rules, which are naturally needed for the single market, we shall have to make haste. So far, Parliament has been maintaining a brisk pace. At the last discussion in the Council, which was not conclusive, as you know, because the opinion of Parliament was not yet on the table, we ultimately came to grief on the question of whether we could issue operating licences to certification services without becoming involved in technical details which would more or less dictate a particular technological solution. The Commission and Parliament, of course, are against intervention on the technological side. That is why we have tried to present a proposal which, though naturally not permitting indiscriminate certification, also deliberately avoids laying down any technological conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, we did not make any progress at that Council meeting. The new proposal, which develops our ideas somewhat further, Mr Ullmann, still needs to be examined very closely by us, because in its present form, although it may not prescribe any technical solutions, it does seem to imply a kind of type approval. This needs some thought before we can say whether it is really the ideal answer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is more or less divided into two camps. One camp comprises the smaller countries, which take a far bolder approach to this issue, while the other comprises the larger countries, which insist very strictly on such formal requirements and therefore take a less liberal view of this matter. At any rate, we shall see how far we can progress at the next meeting of the Telecommunications Council. There should not be too much rigidity either. It is worth remembering that a handwritten signature can be forged too. We should not start subjecting electronic signatures to more stringent requirements than are normally applied to handwritten signatures.</p>
<p class="contents">We do have liability rules for providers of certification services. I am not entirely sure what you meant here, because these liability rules are set out in Article 6. On the technology question I have already said what I think. I have told you which amendments we can and cannot accept. I do not intend to list these in detail at the moment; we can do that at the second reading. As I said, the report is very constructive on this point too. We are largely in agreement, and I hope that at the next meeting of the Council we can arrive at a common position, which we can then re‐examine in detail.</p>
