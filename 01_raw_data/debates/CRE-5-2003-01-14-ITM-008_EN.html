<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mantovani (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span><span class="bold"> –</span> <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this evening we are addressing a subject of considerable importance for all European citizens. We are discussing health and the elderly, and I would say that the health systems of all the European Union Member States are experiencing, albeit to varying degrees, similar situations. In fact, they are already, at this juncture, faced with the fundamental challenge of how, in particular, to control and cover the costs of health care.</p>
<p class="contents">The ageing of the population, developments in medical technology and rising demand for health care services have led to a significant increase in the costs of health care across the board, which, at times, cannot be sustained by current economies, and in the costs of care for the elderly throughout Europe. Here are some examples: in the European Union, the proportion of the population over the age of 65 will rise from 16.1% in 2000 to 22% in 2025 and 27% in 2050, that is a third of the population. At the same time people over the age of 80, who made up 3.6% of the population in 2000 are likely to make up 6% in 2025 and 10% in 2050. Although the provision of health care and care for the elderly remains essentially the responsibility of the Member States, we realise that this trend, owing to the significant and complex implications, cannot find an effective response at exclusively national level. These problems must be included in the context of broader European cooperation so that we can achieve successful results, as set out by the principles and goals of the Community action programme in the field of public health and the specific objectives established by the United Nations Plan of Action.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to meet these objectives, the cooperation of all health care professionals is required. There needs to be greater cooperation in the exchange of information and best practice, research, the establishment of a data bank covering the social and health care sector containing statistical analyses and projections, and the definition of common qualitative and quantitative standards, which will establish health indicators and formulate common standards to monitor the health services. In March 2002, the Barcelona European Council also stressed the need to launch and develop cooperation between Member States in this sector, through exchanges of best practice and information and discussion of the common challenges facing them at European level. The European Union has already affirmed on various occasions the need to draw up a global strategy covering the economic, employment and social implications of an ageing population, by harnessing the full potential of people of all ages and strengthening solidarity between generations. The safeguarding and further improvement of high quality social protection and health care provision in the Member States, based on the principle of solidarity and accessibility to healthcare for all concerned, will be necessary in order to fully attain the goals of financial viability, accessibility and quality.</p>
<p class="contents">All this should, in the future, also lead to the creation of an internal market in health services and products: an internal market not treated in the same way as a commercial product and subject to its rules, but a product subject to the rules on quality and accessibility for all, and I am saying this in particular for Mrs Jöns, who has contributed a great deal and whom I would like to thank for her work on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Another key aspect to take into account is the risk of overemphasising the importance of the goal of financial viability at the expense of accessibility and quality. Solutions should be defined at the earliest opportunity: there need to be awareness-raising and information campaigns, specific analyses and research, programmes to fund training projects and refresher courses for medical, nursing and care staff, as Mr Mussa also suggested. Lastly, more attention needs to be paid to certain aspects of developing health care and social services for the elderly, especially for those who are not self-sufficient, who constitute the main, most important problem, such as the treatment of mental illnesses affecting the elderly, preserving peoples’ autonomy, integration, access to rehabilitation and readjustment services, prevention, assistance and support for families caring for elderly people and combating maltreatment and neglect.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, the Commission sounded the umpteenth alarm, seeking to make us the most competitive economy in the world by 2010: precisely what was determined in Lisbon three years ago, owing to slow growth. Well, the thorny question of ageing of the population is important in this context. Therefore, in the hope that we shall soon see the European Parliament participating more actively in drawing up the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and health policy guidelines, I would call on the Commission and the Council to take into consideration the decisions contained in this report when preparing the joint synthesis report for the Spring 2003 European Council, and also the European Convention, which should include a high level of health protection as a general goal. I believe that having a ‘Social Europe’ is the only way that we will move from being a Europe of banks and money to a Europe of people and peoples.</p>

The Commission will be taking account of the proposals and recommendations made in it.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the report is in favour of Community cooperation to improve health care in the European Union is very important. The information provided by Mr Mantovani, which illustrates that the viability of social systems, especially care services for the elderly, has deteriorated dramatically and that we really do need cooperation at Community level, is equally important. The ageing population, the increasingly technological nature of services for the elderly, the special programme needed and the increase in the prosperity index are creating huge problems which need to be addressed. As you know, the Barcelona European Council called on the Commission and the Member States to work together in this sector. The Commission presented its first communication in December 2001 and this parliamentary report is in response to it. A series of questionnaires was sent to the Member States in the autumn. They have now been returned and the Commission is working on a new report which will be presented to the Employment Council and then to the European Council in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that this whole procedure centres around social protection rather than care issues. Our aim is to make sure that citizens, especially elderly citizens, have access to a high standard of affordable care and long-term care services, which is what the elderly generally require, and to address the question of cost, which often exceeds the financial resources of both the patients and their families. Another important objective is the economic viability of care services faced with an ageing population which, as I said earlier, is one of the main causes of the crises in a number of Member States and will be one of the main causes of future crises in others. This entire process forms part of a coordinated strategy to modernise social protection systems. The Commission proposed this strategy in 1999 as part of the social agenda under the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, this report will influence our work throughout 2003 and I think that both Parliament and the Commission will be formulating the same urgent request to the Member States to cooperate and teach each other so that three basic objectives can be achieved: access to these systems for the elderly, the provision of quality services and economic viability. We are working constantly on the comparability of the data and indices needed to facilitate cooperation between the Member States. The Commission will issue a new communication on measures which need to be taken during the current year on the basis of this experience and the work I referred to earlier. Obviously, the entire procedure comes under the Community strategy on public health and the Community action programme which has finally been approved and to which Mr Berend referred.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mantovani’s report also examines a whole series of other issues relating to public health and the free movement of people and services on the internal market. These are important issues which we shall continue to work on, using appropriate political tools and bearing in mind that they need to be complementary and cohesive.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish with the candidate countries. Last year, my services started a series of studies into the social protection systems in the 13 candidate countries and they are currently examining health care systems. The conclusions of these studies, which were discussed in Brussels on 5 and 6 December, will be available to you shortly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the elderly population increases, we need to work out ways of coping with it and to find a strategy across the European Union which really works. But this is ultimately the responsibility of Member States. Our challenge is to ensure that Member States carry on with their own provision, but with coordination and cooperation and the sharing of best practice throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also be aware that not all elderly people fall into the same category. Elderly people should be encouraged to remain active because otherwise, as previous speakers have said, this will ultimately cost more money than we are able to afford at the moment. So we need to find a sustainable way of keeping people active and healthy for as long as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Mr Mantovani's report and the Commission communication. We must ensure that, sooner rather than later, there is real dialogue between Member States and an exchange of best practice, so that we can put the strategies into effect and make this a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the provision of health care in general and care for the elderly in particular is essentially the responsibility of the Member States, it is right that we look to broader European cooperation in order to face these problems, given the extremely difficult situation which countries continue to experience.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the difficulties is the nursing shortage: in fact, an ever-increasing number of nurses will be needed. The increased life expectancy of the European population, with a growing adult proportion, will create the difficult question of the staff who must care for them, staff who must, moreover, be increasingly qualified owing to the specific nature of the diseases which affect the elderly. Employment of nursing staff has already increased by more than twice the average in the last five years: a level of employment which, however, is still not enough to meet the demand. Secondly, it is easy to foresee that this shortage will be felt particularly keenly when, thanks to enlargement, there will be increased mobility of patients from the CEEC, whose health systems provide less than those in the Community, because they will automatically turn to cross-border health services.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, an issue comes to the fore: ensuring a high level of human health protection, as set out in Article 152 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and as specified by the goals of the Community action programme in the field of public health, which, moreover, calls for universal and equal access to health services, the constant improvement of these services and promotion of the social inclusion of people with disabilities and people in the most vulnerable categories.</p>
<p class="contents">Qualitative principles in the field of health care can be put into effect through the creation of specialised higher training for nurses, financed by European training funds, which encourage people to obtain further professional qualifications in important areas such as oncology, transplants, heart surgery and all the age-related diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">With the launch of this higher training, we will ensure access to health services for European citizens, the provision of high-quality care and financially sustainable care systems, which is included in the three objectives proposed by the Barcelona European Council. In order to ensure care for all, however, the European Union Member States need to take steps to raise young people’s awareness of paramedical professions.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution to this problem must be implemented quickly since it concerns all the Member States. It is all well and good to raise awareness of the profession among young people of the Member States but, up to now, this has been on too small a scale, so much so that there are far fewer qualified nurses than the countries need. This opportunity should therefore also be extended to CEEC qualifications, in order to resolve a twofold problem quickly: to respond to the nursing crisis in the Member States and to respond to the situation of countless immigrants seeking work in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What I am about to say may sound like a provocation, but I cannot avoid talking to you about another serious problem which concerns citizens from every European country, that is the 500 000 job cuts in the engineering industry over the next four or five years, a figure I have been given by an international trade union source. This employment problem could be resolved in part though the transfer of qualified resources from one sector to another. The mobility and retraining of the unemployed engineering workers who hold an advanced secondary education qualification could be achieved by providing them with access to information on nursing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would close by calling on everyone to reflect on what has been said regarding the need to remedy as soon as possible the nursing shortage in the European Union, the need to meet the quality criteria for care specified in the Community action programme by providing higher training, and the need to respond to the specific employment needs of the citizens of the Member States with solutions such as mobility and retraining, looking, where these prove inadequate, to human resources from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have heard it said on occasions that we cannot give our opinion on numbers and therefore we are saying nothing new when we say that world demographic tendencies reveal a gradual ageing of the population. The rapporteur has already mentioned the percentage of the European population over the age of 65, 16 %, an estimated 22 % and 27.5 % for 2025 and 2050, and that the number of people over 80 is going to increase as well, from 3.6% in 2000 to 6% in 2025 and to 10% in 2050.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of these statistics it is no good to bury our heads in the sand like an ostrich and wait to see what happens and nor must we be alarmist. The demographic situation is obviously a success for society, which can be attributed to medical care and an improvement in living conditions in general. Elderly people do not make up an homogenous group and their needs therefore also vary. Policies relating to the elderly must focus on the double perspective of their needs and the care they require – and which they have a right to – in order to meet those needs, and of their potential and the services they lend to society. No society – including European society – can afford not to take advantage of the contributions elderly people can make in terms of their experience, training and knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as Article 152 of the Treaty, these policies comply with Article 21 of the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, by prohibiting all discrimination – in this case on grounds of age – and Article 25, stating that the Union recognises and respects the rights of the elderly to lead a life of dignity and independence and to participate in social and cultural life. These principles would be deprived of content if they were not accompanied by policies to turn them into realities. In this regard, the Barcelona Council of March 2002 pointed out the need to initiate and develop cooperation between the Member States on these issues during 2002 and 2003, the need for an exchange of good practices and information and the need to hold a debate on the common challenges at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Healthcare systems must face a triple challenge. Firstly, access to care for all, with the special characteristics of care for the elderly; secondly, a high degree of quality and, thirdly, the financial sustainability of the systems. I believe these are three necessary, minimal and laudable objectives, and I would like to draw attention to the close link between them. Whatever the system of funding, taxation or contributions, their achievement can and must be promoted also through the promotion of healthier lifestyles, prevention measures and increasing awareness on the part of service providers and users on the correct application of therapies and medications. This will allow a balance between the three objectives. The risk of prioritising the objective of financial sustainability could undermine those of quality and accessibility, but also, without sustainability, quality and accessibility would only be possible in the short term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jöns (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by extending my very warm thanks to Mr Mantovani for his excellent cooperation. I think we have succeeded in securing a broad majority in tomorrow's plenary for this most important report. It is also timely that we should at last achieve closer cooperation in health policy and, of course, also in care for the elderly, something to which the Gothenburg Summit, albeit very late in the day, pointed the way.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us just be honest. In matters of health policy, the EU is still catching up with reality. In many fields, after all, a European health policy already exists – the Euregios spring to mind. Even now, to take an example, patients in the German Rhineland have the right to use their German health insurance cards to obtain treatment in health centres in the Netherlands. Apart from that, Europe has hospitals generally recognised as specialising in specific diseases, and there are also European networks that draw up guidelines for the treatment of those diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">All the Member States are looking for strategies to guarantee that their health care systems will, in future, remain accessible to all and to secure their standards of quality and performance, as well as ensuring that it is possible to finance them. New mechanisms are constantly being tried out, but, as yet, nobody has made the great breakthrough. So, when governments realise the importance of organising an EU-wide exchange of experience on matters concerning health care and the care of the elderly, they are simply being logically consistent.</p>
<p class="contents">Just to take the wind out of the sceptics' sails, let me say that I am convinced that nobody in this House actively wants a single European system of health care. The Commission does not, and the Council very definitely does not. The organisation and funding of health care systems is a matter decided at the national level and should remain so in future. It is far more a case of how we are to retain, in the long term, our European model of a health care policy based on solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I am speaking quite deliberately in terms of a European model, as the following four principles underlie all health care systems. The first is that health is not, and must not be allowed to become, a purely economic commodity. The second is that equal access to health services is a fundamental right and must remain one. The third is that, as has already been said, all systems of health care are based upon the principle of solidarity. And the fourth is that the State has a crucial role to play in regulating, funding and providing services.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the Mantovani report makes quite practical proposals as to what enhanced European cooperation in health care policy might be like. These proposals have to do with methodology, objectives and specific content. As regards the working method, the report proposes that the open method of coordination should now be brought into play in this area as it has been elsewhere, which is consonant – I am very glad to say – with what the Greek Presidency has said. Now, though, we must not lose any more time, and it is for that reason that the report urges the forthcoming European spring summit to resolve upon a precise timetable for further action and to agree on common targets and indicators within one year.</p>
<p class="contents">If, though, we are to be able to carry out any kind of exchange of experience, we have to start by improving the national and European systems of health monitoring. Comparable data are absolutely indispensable here, but to date the EU has not even had a standard measurement of mortality rates. This is where we can even now make progress by using the new action programme on health care policy. The same is true of the establishment of common criteria for patients' rights, and, in view of eastward enlargement in particular, there is a need for a survey of patient mobility in the Euregios, for we know all too well that the shortfall in health care provision is especially pronounced in the regions bordering on the new Member States, and any European constitution must not only stipulate a high standard of health care as an objective, but also health policy's continuing status as a responsibility shared between the EU and the Member States. We do all, after all, want the EU to be able to keep on, in future, using legislation to supplement the Member States' policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say that, even though there are features of the report in its final form with which my group disagrees. I should like to thank the Commission for the survey it has given us of future care for the elderly, for I do believe that the Commission communication is genuinely constructive. It indicates a number of overriding goals in terms of access, quality and financial sustainability. It also points out that, even though we know that there will be many more elderly people in the future, it is quite uncertain what that will actually mean in the form of future financial burdens. Over and above this, it points out that, in many areas, the EU has opportunities to make joint contributions under the current rules. That is true in relation to public health policy, on the basis of Article 152 of the Treaty, to economic policy and to the development of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have a host of opportunities for cooperating under the existing rules. My group must therefore also reject Parliament’s present proposal, as put forward in the report, that we should introduce outright open coordination when it comes to health policy and policy in relation to the elderly. We have tabled a number of amendments, and if, as I really believe will be the case, it is not possible for these to be supported by Parliament, we shall find it difficult to support the report as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The open coordination method has, of course, become very popular in recent years and is used in a great many areas of economic policy, such as pensions, social exclusion within education and the convergence criteria in employment policy. It is a good form of cooperation in which a number of common objectives are set that can be achieved in different ways. I am a great believer in using open coordination because it is a way of achieving common objectives without needing to legislate in a lot of new areas, but I think it important that open coordination be binding.</p>
<p class="contents">In some areas, open coordination is directly authorised by the treaties. That applies in the case of economic policy and employment policy. In other areas, there is a less obvious basis in the treaties, or else there is really no basis. It might be said that the Member States have every possible freedom to decide to coordinate their efforts and develop good practice. That is something we have done within the framework of the OSCD for many years, but the difference between OSCD reports and the open coordination we undertake within the framework of the EU is – and, in my view, should be – that open coordination is more binding and that the countries in actual fact undertake to pursue the common objectives. In addition, the parties concerned are very actively involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it would be wrong of us to allow the use of open coordination to escalate to the point of its being used in every possible area. It is of course a basic principle of EU cooperation that we accept diversity and difference. It is an advantage that we have many different models so that we can learn from each other. We must not sneak harmonisation in through the back door in areas where national competence should clearly apply. That is not something for which we would be thanked.</p>
<p class="contents">In the health sphere, there are many areas in which cooperation and common rules are important and necessary, and there are therefore clear rules about this in the Treaty. Cooperation will develop via the internal market, as a result of that internal market and through other cooperation, such as cooperation on research. As for a common EU policy on residential homes, however, my response is no thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So it is important to give absolute priority to policies and measures based on an integrated approach which aim to promote health, ensure primary prevention, eliminate health risks, include a high level of health protection and which define and implement sectoral policies designed to eliminate health inequality.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth highlighting the close relationship between socio-economic measures and health, particularly in the fields of employment, housing, education, transport, income distribution and social welfare. The emphasis placed on monetary policies, on giving priority to nominal convergence and on maintaining the blinkered criteria of the Stability Pact is leading to restrictive social policies and being used to justify such policies, and it is having a negative impact on public health policies and on health care for the elderly, as has become clear in Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication on this subject, which the report welcomes despite some occasional criticisms, is indicative of the contradictions in social policies. Despite statements about defending the quality and accessibility of health care, too much weight is given to the objective of achieving financial viability with a view to establishing an internal market in health services and products. This could lead to the liberalisation and privatisation of an essential public service, which health certainly is, whilst ultimately jeopardising equality of access to high-quality health services. This is an untenable position and it is the main reason why we intend to reject the report before us if it is not revised on this key point, and if the amendments that we are tabling are not approved. These amendments advocate better quality health services, security and solidarity, and propose new means of financing statutory retirement schemes with a view in particular to extending social welfare contributions to all income, at a rate identical to that levied on wages and salaries.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge here therefore remains that of achieving some coherence amongst those who say that they are committed to defending health care and care for the elderly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am grateful to Mr Mantovani for his work.</p>
<p class="contents">Caring for the ageing population throughout Europe will be one of the biggest challenges facing the Member States in the future. Although, as has already been said, the organisation of health care is a matter reserved for Member States, they cannot do this in isolation. That is why my group welcomes the cooperation suggested by the Commission, in terms of exchanging information and best practice and developing common quality standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The current provision and funding systems for care of the elderly vary greatly throughout Europe, from comprehensive free care with financial risks spread throughout the population to state funding as a last resort safety net. Drawing comparisons and exploring the care systems within Member States could be a valuable way of highlighting successful solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the reference in Mr Mantovani's report to social care as well as health care, as the combination of both is an essential element in the welfare of older people. If those responsible for health and social policy took a real life-long approach to preventing disease and disability and viewed health promotion and prevention as the cornerstone of a 'foresighted policy', in the words of the report, this would not only improve health but would also cut costs. The reduction in costs would not be temporary or short term, but long term.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, we know that older women and people in rural areas experience greater levels of poverty. In my constituency in Wales, three out of five older people live in poverty. Most pensioners depend entirely on their state pension or other state benefits as their only income. More people have long-term illnesses in Wales than in England or Scotland. These facts are not unrelated.</p>
<p class="contents">Some methods of health prevention and early detection of illness are essential. Hand-in-hand with this is the importance of a multi-agency approach to coordinating care and a multi-sectoral approach to policy-making, to include social, employment, environmental and economic considerations as well as the need to involve users and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">The elderly play a very valuable role in our society. Life-long learning, communication between the generations, voluntary work and similar issues on which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has done a lot of work are intrinsically related to this discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Trying to establish a free market of care and treatment and harmonising health care systems has its dangers. Meeting the Stability Pact requirements, whilst providing the necessary funding for health, welfare and social services, is a major challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">Health care, as I said earlier, is the responsibility of the Member States. The references in this report to an internal market in health services and products reflects the move towards liberalisation. As has been seen time after time and as we see in the private finance initiative in health services in the UK, privatisation does not improve services or reduce costs, but leads to longer waiting lists, worse levels of care and staff shortages. My group believes that health care and the care of the elderly is too important to be put at risk by privatisation and the GATS Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The focus of this report and one of the main issues in this debate must be equality of access. This means access to care for everyone and securing a local supply of services. GATS threatens this. I would ask, therefore, for support of Amendment No 6, to call for exemption of health and care services from GATS, ensuring that the very good proposals made by Mr Mantovani – which I hope will be adopted by Parliament tomorrow – can be implemented and services to older people secured for the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Care for the frail and elderly is a challenge that faces us all and unfortunately it is one that we will probably all face ourselves at some stage in our lives. How we provide care and services for people is how we will be judged.</p>
<p class="contents">Health care and care of the elderly, whilst an important part of the overall health system, does not necessarily represent the overall health system. There is a tendency in the report to assume that issues concerning health care of the elderly apply to the health system as a whole. A detailed study on the financing of long-term care for older people is being carried out in my own country, Ireland. I look forward to examining the policy proposals which this will bring forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Particular attention has been paid in the report to meeting long-term care needs, reducing unnecessary recourse to institutional care and widening consumer choice. In Ireland we have a very active health policy to give old people a better way of life. The implications of Amendments Nos 1 to 6 run counter to this policy. I am able to support Amendments Nos 7 to 11 on replacing the 'open method of cooperation' with 'cooperation'.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, in the area of private financing for the health service, there must be a risk equalisation element whereby, if you bring in a private health insurer for the health care system, they must take the same risk as existing insurers or the state, which means covering everyone and all sections of society. We have been developing our own health strategy which includes payments and allowances for carers, including carers looking after two or more people.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect I want to highlight is the changing role of the family and community. We must ensure that support is put in place to allow people to remain in their families and their local communities as much as possible. In providing and caring for the elderly, that will mean utilising new technologies and new methods of ensuring that they have independent means of living and can fully participate in their own community.</p>
<p class="contents">All Member States have faced the same common issues: how to address the impact of demographic ageing or healthcare systems and expenditure, how to use the new technologies for the benefit of the elderly, how to ensure a better standard and quality of life for the elderly. Sharing information in these areas can only be beneficial.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Mussa, for his work on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in tackling issues which were not fully addressed in the Commission proposal, in particular training for health professionals, nurses and those involved in specific expert care for the elderly. These are now being included in the report by Mr Mantovani. That is a welcome move.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many organisations that want to work in assisting the elderly. This year – 2003 – is the year of the disabled. There are many elderly people who suffer from disabilities as well. We must ensure that we not only pay lip service to the disabled this year, but also give particular emphasis to those who cannot speak for themselves, and mostly that means the elderly disabled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a Dutch expression about the consequences of getting older. After all, age generally comes with ailments. Ailments which, with proper attention and care, a person can live with. This proper attention and care involves people. People who provide the necessary hands-on care. With the support of good policy and the commitment of politicians, this can be accommodated.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mantovani’s report aims to provide the space to do so from a European perspective. He puts forward a range of proposals based on a great concern about the demographic trend towards an ageing population and the consequences this will have for our health systems. In addition to expressing my appreciation for the report, I would like to indicate why, in my opinion, his proposals lose sight of the reality of care provision. The report is brimming over with the politics of good intentions. Good intentions alone will not, in my opinion, be the mainspring of political and policy-related activities. Certainly not if Europe would have to be given new powers on such a basis. Assigning powers to European institutions is a failure to appreciate the fact that care is provided between people at the micro level.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting good healthcare and exchanging good practices are points I endorse. Also of great importance is the fact that it is made clear that healthcare and care of the elderly must not only be approached from the point of view of what it costs. Elderly people and patients are more than just an item of expense to society.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of new policy-coordinating proposals and inventories will not, in my opinion, promote good care and assistance but will rather impede it. In my country there is a lot of discussion about healthcare at the moment. Dozens of rules, procedures and administrative obligations are impeding the work of nurses and carers. If one thing has become clear, it is that we need hands at the bedside and not at the computer. If we also have to comply with European wishes in respect of the provision of information, you will understand that there are few hands left over to actually provide the care.</p>
<p class="contents">Although many of Mr Mantovani’s ideas appeal to me, I cannot endorse his report. The report misunderstands the position of the concept of subsidiarity when it comes to the role of Europe and the role of the Member States in these areas of policy. The report furthermore disregards day-to-day practice. Practice is not waiting for new rules from Europe, it is waiting for people who want to do the work.</p>
<p class="contents">You will understand that I do not regard the European institutions and the Convention as being assigned a role in the policy areas of care for the elderly and healthcare. I therefore support Mrs Lynne’s amendments concerning scrapping paragraphs 18 and 20. This will ensure that responsibility for healthcare and care for the elderly remains with the national governments. It is there that the parameters are established and a substantive policy can be pursued that enables us to respond to the people’s demand for care. Finally, I would like to point out the importance of interrelationships between people in family, church or home circles. That is where the care is provided in practice, at the micro level. It is pointless worrying about care, you have to go out and do it! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like wholeheartedly to support the proposal from the European Commission, together with my colleague’s, Mr Mantovani’s, proposal. In Europe we all have the same problem. We all have healthcare that is expanding, certainly financially. Why? Because we are dealing with emancipated citizens, citizens who have a different lifestyle, citizens who want more and who want better quality. We also have facilities that are making healthcare more expensive. We all want to keep this system under control, but we would all also like to be able to respond to this justified demand on the part of our citizens. This means we will have to discuss a number of matters with each other, perhaps not with a view to doing everything in the same way but with a view to finding out how we can all learn from each other’s experience.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, I must now make a critical comment about the communication from the European Commission. In the Netherlands, healthcare is not financed via taxes but via premiums; the situation is therefore different from what it says in the communication. I also see that the communication – and this is why I am so much in favour of this open method of coordination – states that in those countries in which only a small proportion is financed via private insurance and the bulk via taxes, the best example in the table being Luxembourg, the per capita cost of healthcare is simply considerably lower.</p>
<p class="contents">That is therefore something that we can learn from one another. What we should also have learned from one another is that Europe actually plays a major role in the field of healthcare already, despite the fact that we have little to say formally. Firstly via the article in the Treaty in which achieving a high level of healthcare protection is stated as an objective. Incidentally, Hans, Dutch citizens benefit a lot from this. Secondly via the deepening of the internal market; we do in fact have a great deal to say about appliances and certainly also about medicines. So we should – and I would like to ask the Commissioner if she agrees – come up with solutions for the shortages and gaps in order to achieve proper financeability. In this case I am thinking about the whole range of medicines, for example. If we were to do something about generic medicines, we would be able to save EUR 500 million a year in our country alone. I therefore say to the Commissioner: do something about it, start taking targeted action on this point in consultation with your colleague Mr Byrne.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to go back briefly to that high level of protection. The Dutch citizen benefits from that too. Why? Because with that high level, we can at least arrange for people to have the opportunity to go abroad for healthcare if care in the Netherlands is inadequate because it is a demand-led system, the last communist system still in existence in Europe. Furthermore, we cannot declare a certain treatment to be experimental. No, that has all been tested by the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that Europe can do a lot, does do a lot and should actually do even more in the area of healthcare, even if it is initially via the open coordination method. In any event the first reports reveal that we can learn an awful lot from one another. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, holding this debate is consistent with all this House’s concerns about the needs of elderly people, and it is very helpful that Mr Mantovani’s report has achieved such a broad consensus on certain very important ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">I am one of those people who believe that the dignity of a society is basically measured by the dignity with which it treats its elderly people; I also believe that issues relating to health, rather than being commercial goods, are a matter of rights. Fortunately, Mr Mantovani’s report and the amendments which I hope we will approve tomorrow and others which we will reject – I hope – will highlight these elements, which are fundamental to the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that it moves in this direction, that it stresses the coordination elements which the Commissioner has mentioned, that it maintains the open coordination method, and I hope that this is the beginning of a broader consideration, so that it may also reach other elements of our society.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission has said in some of its documents, Europe – despite its great progress and despite having increased its standard of living and life expectancy over recent decades – still has problems such as the fact that one in every five citizens dies prematurely; the new risks; inequalities and differences on health issues, ...</p>
<p class="contents">These problems are not exclusive to elderly people, but they are problems and issues for all European citizens, who are appealing to us, to the politicians, to the European Convention, to finally treat Europe as an area in which there can be competition but also cooperation and solidarity. The European citizens are asking for it for essential elements of their lives such as health.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that this method of open coordination, this detailed and exhaustive approximation of health needs – but also social needs and the humanisation of the lives of the elderly – and of these problems, is extended in future communications. I hope that we will have new instruments so that Europe is not just a market, but also a collection of rights and a source of hope, which is what the public are asking us for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Are these generations an asset to modern society, yes or no? Do our societies have the means to provide them with a decent future, sufficient means for care, and therefore a high-level retirement worthy of our times, yes or no? My reply is yes, a resounding yes. In France today, 40% of people retiring receive less than EUR 1 000 per month. Statistics indicate that by 2005, 30% will be approaching the poverty line. So yes, of course, funding for social protection needs to be reviewed. The problem is deciding on the principles according to which this should take place.</p>
<p class="contents">Asking questions about the future of retirement and care therefore equates to making social choices. How can we address the causes of the debt, how can we increase the number of those participating in the national solidarity effort? By combating unemployment by means of employment policies or by making redundancies and closing businesses?</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to voice my opposition, as others have already done, to Article 10(c) of the report in particular, which advocates, and I quote, ‘the creation of an internal market in health services and products’. This would open the way for the attitude of pension funds which are more interested in gaining a market share than in worrying about any kind of health policy. I personally cannot envisage care being distributed according to budget. Is there not already a risk when, for example, in the United Kingdom, dialysis is no longer funded after the age of 75? On the other hand, I am sure that social benefits such as those under the French retirement system should be strengthened. In France, seven trade unions have been asking for this recently. Their joint platform demands a high-level retirement provision. They are also calling for demonstrations throughout the country on 1 February.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we have the resources to ensure a high-level retirement provision. As recommended by one of the amendments tabled by my group, we need to study new ways to fund legal retirement systems, in particular by extending social contributions to all financial income, applying the same rates as for salaries. Lastly, I would like to express my total opposition to increasing the duration of working life in France and in Europe, as recommended by the Barcelona European Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lambert (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, as a visibly greying member of the population I have a considerable interest in this debate, as do many others in this House. I have some concern about the climate of it. I would like to believe that it is genuinely about providing universal high-quality care in a variety of situations and circumstances, but that is certainly not the tone of the debate as it often comes across in a number of our Member States, where it seems to be all about how we can cut costs and find the money to make provisions. As others have said, that is not the only way in which we should be looking at this issue, if we should be looking at it that way at all.</p>
<p class="contents">One way of improving the situation is to pay reasonable wages to well-trained and qualified staff. I am aware that non-medical care is one of the fastest growing areas in terms of job creation. However, it is all too often very poorly paid, it is often done by women, by migrant women, and the staff are often recruited with difficulty. It is certainly a boom area for temporary work agencies in the UK. Yet those workers are then treated as if they are some sort of disposable commodity and as if the work is unskilled, whereas care work is immensely skilled and stressful.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to look at the implications of the current employment policy which not only encourages but actively pushes more people, especially women, into the workforce and away from the caring role they might have fulfilled or the voluntary work they might have done.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not saying that women should be forced to stay at home. I have never believed that. But it means that we must look carefully at the financial and social support for carers, which should reflect the much larger costs that society would otherwise bear.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to recognise that carers who are in work need leave provision, not just parents. We need to look at the employment needs of carers. I am pleased to say that the equal funding is being used for at least one such project involving the UK.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of my other concerns also focus on the issue of discrimination in the provision of health care for the elderly. This is observed in quite a number of Member States. It is a useful area for comparison between Member States and might at some point be part of another horizontal directive for Article 13.</p>
<p class="contents">We mentioned in the debate the issue of an adequate income for older people. I am very pleased that paragraph 7 of Mr Mantovani's report, quoting the World Health Organisation, talks about health being best served in a more socially cohesive, egalitarian society with a smaller burden of relative deprivation.</p>
<p class="contents">People have raised the question of the internal market in health care, not just in terms of cross-border treatment, although, judging by the post I receive, the ability to transfer disability allowances and carers' allowances across borders under Regulation 1408/71 would be welcomed. It is also an issue of cross-border service providers and increasing provision from third country providers.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Evans said, it is not yet clear what impact the future negotiation on GATS will have on service provision and which aspects of health care and other care for the elderly will be put into any EU offer for discussion under the World Trade Organisation's agreements. It is certainly the view of my group that such services should not be included.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear that at some point we will need a framework for the cross-border liability of service providers. I agree with Mr Crowley on the issue of risk equalisation in the private sector, to avoid cherry-picking of the purely profitable. We also need to consider, both inside and outside the Convention, to what extent health care and general care are services of general interest and whether universal and affordable access should be guaranteed in the Treaties of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to look further at what constitutes goods or services in health and other care. I am aware that Denmark has already introduced legislation on this. It would be another useful area for comparison in an open method of coordination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I found in the report the word ‘Überalterung’. I do not know what that is in Greek, English, or any other language, but in German it amounts to quite offensive discrimination against older – or as the word in question would have it, superannuated – people. When one is no longer as young and beautiful as you are, but, like me, is in one's seventieth year, that sort of thing causes an enormous amount of anguish. Let us at last stop using these stupid expressions about the superannuation or geriatrification of Europe. Even though you can read it all over the media, it is quite simply not true. Never have there been so many people alive in Europe as there are today and never before has there been such high life expectancy as there is now. As recently as 150 years ago, average life expectancy was around 40 years, and now it is 80. Any girl born today has the chance to live to a hundred. People today have the good fortune to be able, at long last, to live to an age that has in fact always been genetically possible. So let us stop talking about any geriatrification of Europe or about its superannuation. I assume that this has simply escaped your notice. Please stop talking about people being superannuated.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make another comment. In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I tabled a whole series of amendments, all of which were adopted. I am very pleased about that. There is one amendment of which I am particularly proud, Commissioner, and it is one that I should especially like to commend to you. It has to do with something that is a quite splendid addition to what has been achieved in terms of family and social policy – continued remuneration for one week in the year in the event of a person remaining at home to care for a close family member – perhaps a parent or grandparent – who has become ill. That is the law in Austria, so that any working person can stay at home for one week in the year to care for his or her elderly family members<span class="italic">.</span> I think it is a great thing that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has adopted this amendment. I hope that we will do the same when we vote tomorrow. Commissioner, I commend this matter to your care. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One very positive fact: the human lifespan is increasing constantly while external signs of ageing are decreasing significantly. Another fact, which is of serious concern to economists and in particular to anyone with budgetary responsibilities: this increased lifespan goes hand in hand with health and care needs, the costs of which are also increasing and will increase considerably over the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless we believe, therefore, that the single market and free competition will solve all the problems in this regard as well, we shall have to be prepared to make significant financial efforts in terms of contributions and taxes, which will of course have to be distributed fairly, in order to guarantee a high level of care for all. Some, quite wrongly, deny this. Others find it regrettable; I find it regrettable for them, because they will be old one day too. Lastly, others, myself included, think and say that we must grasp the nettle. It is the only way of preventing longer lives from being nothing more than delayed death and ensuring that this increase represents the continuation of a genuine life, not forgetting that experience is also a factor in progress. This requires quality care and services, adapted to every situation, which necessitates public research for new medicines and treatments, changes in mentality and different priorities for our society and, in particular, public budgets which meet our needs. Now, at the beginning of a new millennium, Mr President, we all know, and some, even some of us, regret, that we are far from having fulfilled all these conditions and criteria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That phenomenon is the result of low birth rates and increased life expectancy, especially amongst women. In less than one decade, between 1990 and 1999, the number of women over 65 has increased by nearly 3%. The effects of an ageing population are being felt at various levels. In Portugal, for example, if we consider the population of working age, greater longevity amongst women means that since 1995 the number of elderly women has been greater than that of young women. At the same time, the increase in the number of elderly persons is imposing a greater burden on health care and social services.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue we face is a simple and intuitive one. Society cannot be said to be progressing if greater life expectancy is not matched by improvements in quality of life. So the great challenge for us is to achieve a high level of satisfaction amongst the elderly with their quality of life, while keeping the costs that this involves in check. This will inevitably make demands on public finance, which plays a key part in expenditure on health in all the Member States. Even in Greece, the country where public finance makes the lowest contribution to health services, the figure is about 56%, rising to 84% in the United Kingdom. An ageing population will have a considerable impact on budgets, which will in turn increase public expenditure. Health care systems in the European Union should therefore be pursuing the objective of being simultaneously accessible, high in quality and financially viable. Each Member State is responsible for the organisation and financing of its own social protection system. Nevertheless, this responsibility is increasingly being exercised in an overall context that affects various Community policies.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, as has already been mentioned, the Barcelona European Council stressed the need to establish and develop closer cooperation between the Member States as regards social protection, exchanges of good practice and information, research, establishing common indicators and standards and the development of health and social services for the elderly.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I believe that the Greek Presidency should examine the European Community strategy and action programme in the field of public health, with a view to the next European Council in the spring adopting the use of the open method of coordination and a precise timetable for cooperation between the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Beyond that, however, how can we talk about the future of health and care for the elderly without raising the problem of pensions? On the pretext of modernisation, numerous governments within the Union are increasingly attacking pensions and current and future pensioners.</p>
<p class="contents">In France, just over the past fifteen years, following various reforms, the level of pensions has decreased by some 30%. How, therefore, could working-class pensioners, who, even as employees, received insufficient salaries, survive this permanent reduction in their purchasing power without it affecting their health and quality of care?</p>
<p class="contents">The report emphasises prevention. The first step in prevention, however, is guaranteeing acceptable living conditions for pensioners. We need not only to halt the reduction in the level of pensions, but we also need to ensure that, for all those who have worked their whole lives, retirement does not mean a reduction in their purchasing power. We must not accept being told that this is impossible and that the ratio of people of working age to those of non-working age does not allow it. The problem is not this ratio between people of working and non-working age, but the ratio between the considerable profits of large companies, the ever-increasing income of the wealthier classes, and the constantly decreasing income of employees, both when working and as pensioners. In order to guarantee dignity for pensioners, we must agree to dip into these profits or the income of the wealthy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karas (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Flemming's remarks oblige me to say that we should not view this report in isolation from other reports and initiatives, for example, the Lisbon strategy, which also aims towards social cohesion and sustainability, the Commission report on the evaluation of national strategies for adequate and sustainable pensions, or the Streamlining Report on the coordination of employment policy with economic policy. All these serve the purpose of ensuring that our social security system continues to be financially viable, because that is what is needed. Demographic changes are relevant to every area of policy and have effects on the social fabric and on the socio-political framework, and so I welcome this report and this debate as helping to increase our awareness of these things.</p>
<p class="contents">Action is needed, on the part of all of and us at every political level. A survey by Eurostat, a few days ago, showed that in 2002 there were fewer births, but more deaths, recorded in the EU. The number of live births in the EU reached 3.99 million in 2002, which is 0.3% fewer than in 2001. It is estimated that, in 2002, some 3.68 million people died in the EU, which amounts to some 60 000 more than in 2001. These figures alone show that our society faces a change which will affect policy on social security, employment, finance and the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is just one aspect that I would like to pick out – that of care. In my country – Austria – alone, 540 000 people are at present in need of help and care. This figure will increase to just over 800 000 by 2011. At the same time, 84% of all those in need of care – and this is the case in all countries – receive that care from members of their own family. Only 26% require or receive additional help or avail themselves of it. Demographic and economic changes mean, though, that the family members who provide care are becoming fewer in number.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of people employed in the care field has increased by 5.5%, so the health and welfare sector is creating jobs. Underdevelopment of many areas of the mobile care and support services means that far from all the sufficiently trained staff can be employed. I therefore demand certain things above all in this context. Among other things, we should be attaching greater importance to the mobile services and to the services needed to supplement them – hospices, family support, and day centres – and extending them. There is a need for a build-up of resources in personal environments and for more extensive support both for recipients of care and for their families. In my view, though, we also need uniform standards of training and professional development, as aid is often required across national boundaries. The caring professions need a campaign to enhance their image and we have to explore why they are so unstable and why staff remain in them for so short a time. Care is one of the greatest challenges of our time, and we need European standards for it.</p>
