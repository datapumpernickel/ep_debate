<p class="contents">The reason why the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats has addressed this question to the Commission is that we want, after the Villiers report, prior to the presentation of the third consultative document and before the Commission complete the draft Directive, to give a clear signal to the public and to the enterprises affected that we speak for the affected parties in the Directive's drafting process and that we want to be more involved in the discussion process, both as regards the monitoring of the Basle Committee and also the preparation of the Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic conception of Basle II, of closer alignment of the capital base of banks to the actual risks, is in our view something to be welcomed. What is of the essence, though, is what form it should take in practice, as it is only through a conversion appropriate to our economic structure that the financial sector including an essential pillar of the economy and its enterprises, above all the small and medium-sized ones, can actually be strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous proposals by the Basle Committee on banking supervision are, in our present view, still unsatisfactory, and we believe that they should, in many instances, undergo thorough revision.</p>
<p class="contents">Our question today is prompted by our economic structure. Eighteen million small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe create 75% of European jobs and pay 80% of the taxes. These enterprises' capital costs are therefore crucial to their competitiveness and to the maintenance of the small and medium-scale economic structure.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe, Commissioner, that the Commission – and I would also like to know what you intend doing about this – should be an intermediary between the six Member States of the European Union that are not members of the Basle Committee and the nine that are, and that we really must do everything we can to ensure that the Nine really do represent the Fifteen. It is only if this happens that I can regard it as at all feasible to incorporate the Basle result unchanged into the draft Directive, as Commissioner Bolkestein has said in his statement. If this does not happen, all the various opinions will find their way into discussion of the Directive, leaving Parliament, the Commission and the Council far less room to manoeuvre.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that we, that is Mr Radwan, Mrs Villiers and I, have put a number of questions to you, which we urgently want to have answered when the Directive is drafted. They relate to the consequential costs for small and medium-sized enterprises and to the issue of flexibility in the Directive's application to small and medium-sized enterprises and to banks; they also relate to the date on which the Directive will enter into force and to the Commission's role as co-ordinator between the nine represented on the Basle Committee and the six not represented on it. The question takes up the cause of the medium-scale economic structures in Europe and is intended to give voice to the questions that small and medium-sized banks and enterprises want to ask. We look forward to you giving definite answers to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<tr><td width="70" align="center" valign="top"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="photoframe_blue"><tr><td><img alt="MPphoto" src="/doceo/data/img/photo_generic.gif" align="right" width="50" height="63" /></td></tr></table> </td><td width="5"> </td><td align="left" valign="top">
<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, on behalf of my colleague I would like to start by saying that the review of capital adequacy is an extremely significant project forming part of the Commission's financial services action plan. The aim is, as mentioned, to modernise the existing capital requirements for banks and investment firms. This will lead to significant benefits within the European financial services markets in terms of increased efficiency and enhanced competition, while at the same time improving financial stability through prudential requirements that are both more comprehensive and more sensitive to the risks faced by these institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European review is taking place in parallel with the review by the Basle Committee on banking supervision of capital requirements for internationally active banks. Before going on to specific questions, let me mention that excellent progress has been made but the review is still ongoing. My response to your questions should therefore be read in that light.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the internal ratings-based approach and smaller banks, the framework likely to be proposed will be based on an evolutionary and flexible approach. Different approaches will be used by institutions depending upon the level of sophistication they wish to adopt – their risk management practices and so on. The significance of the IRB approach has already been identified in Parliament's resolution of 17 November 2000 on the evaluation of the own funds directive. The IRB approach should be designed prudently but in such a way as not to unduly exclude smaller and less complex institutions. The Commission has pursued the above from the beginning, both in preparing its proposal and in participating in the Basle process.</p>
<p class="contents">To accommodate the needs of smaller and less complex institutions, the second Commission consultative document of February 2001 diverged on specific issues from the Basle consultative document. Particular focus was put on the Basle minimum standards, which were modified to make them more appropriate to the European Union context. For example, the Commission's consultation paper proposed requiring institutions to apply the IRB approach to all material exposure classes. This will give institutions the possibility to exempt from the IRB approach portfolios that are immaterial. This means applying a partial use approach. The Commission believes that such flexibility strikes an appropriate balance in the European Union context.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect included in the Commission's second consultative document was the proposal to allow banks to use pooled data in estimating the probability of default of borrowers. This will allow smaller institutions to overcome the possibility that their individual amounts of data will be too small to be statistically meaningful and to rely, where appropriate, on an internal rating system developed by a banking association.</p>
<p class="contents">On the potential effect of the new regime on the cost of lending to SMEs, both the Commission and the Basle Committee have strongly emphasised the importance of ensuring that the capital adequacy regime leads to appropriate treatment of credit to SMEs. During 2001 significant progress was made on this aspect and the Commission is committed to a successful outcome in this significant issue.</p>
<p class="contents">A modified risk-weight curve for corporate exposures has been developed, which is likely to reduce the capital requirements for many SME borrowers relative to the proposals in the second consultative document. Recognition is likely to be given in the IRB approach to a wider range of collateral. I will say more about this in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Work has continued on the development of risk-weight proposals in respect of retail lending. In the IRB approaches these are lower than for lending to corporates. Retail lending is likely to be defined in such a way that small business loans that are treated as retail loans by a bank and that meet the other relevant criteria will fall within the retail risks weight. That will benefit the regulatory capital charges of relevant small-business loans, while maintaining appropriate levels of prudential soundness.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of recognition of a wider range of collateral in the IRB approach has received a good deal of attention during 2001. This is of particular importance in the context of lending to SMEs. The emerging thinking is to recognise a broader range of collateral than was previously proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">The likelihood is that the approach will be not to name specific types of physical collateral that will be acceptable, but to set eligibility criteria that seek to ensure a certain sustainable value of the collateral in the event of borrower default. It is envisaged that appropriate recognition will also be given in the IRB approach to situations where loans are secured against receivables and that the risk mitigation aspects of financial leases will be appropriately recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">Consideration is also being given to recognising the practice whereby life insurance policies are placed with the lending institution as security for a loan.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the fifth question on implementation of the new Basle Accord, concerning the question of uniformity and flexibility and the date of implementation. On the question of uniformity of application and flexibility, it is important to state once again that the new framework will be based on an evolutionary approach. It is designed to be used differently by institutions of different sizes and complexity.</p>
<p class="contents">A key focus of the Commission's efforts lies in ensuring that the specific features of the European Union context, including the wider range of institutions to which the regime will apply, are fully reflected in this new regime.</p>
<p class="contents">For reasons of competitive neutrality, the European Union legislative framework for banks and investment firms is based on the principle of equality of treatment between competing institutions, at least as regards certain business and market segments. For this reason, a capital adequacy regime that is profoundly innovative, should not be introduced for only one category of institution. For reasons of international competitive equity, it is very important that European Union institutions move to the new framework within the same timescale as institutions of other jurisdictions, including, for example, the United States. The target date for implementation is 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to adopt the proposal for a directive shortly after final agreement is reached in Basle. This, together with the full and thorough consultative process that is taking place in order to produce a very high-quality proposal, will enable the Commission to contribute to the fullest extent to a process which will allow legislation to be adopted in good time to achieve the accord implementation date.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of rapid implementation of the new framework was recognised in the resolution of this Parliament of November 2000 on the evaluation of the own funds Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">On the sixth question, I would say that the Commission is aware of the concerns of some commentators, including some Member States, that the treatment of the maturity dimension proposed in the second consultative document could create competitive disadvantages for banks which typically grant long-term loans. This matter is still being considered in Basle.</p>
<p class="contents">On the seventh question, regarding limit retail loans, the Commission believes that the borderline between corporate loans and retail loans should be such as to allow certain kinds of lending to SMEs to be treated as retail in nature. The question of where exactly the cut-off point between a retail loan and a non-retail loan should be, is subject to ongoing consideration. The definition currently proposed in the IRB framework includes a use test, whereby such a loan can be treated as retail in nature if is treated in the institution's risk-management systems and assessments in the same manner as other retail loans and meets the other relevant criteria, including those in relation to value. The Commission regards this approach as useful and effective.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recognises the special risk characteristics associated with home loans. It also recognises that European residential mortgage markets have different features from other mortgage markets in the world and that they are of particular importance to the European Union banking system. Work is continuing to develop an appropriate treatment for loans of this type.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the eighth question – regarding coordination between the nine EU Member States that are members of the Basle Committee and the other European Union Member States – the European Union perspective is indeed strongly represented in the Basle Committee. Spain joined the Basle Committee last year, which brings the total number of EU countries on the committee to 9 out of 13. The Commission sits as an observer on the committee, as does the European Central Bank. This has allowed the views of the European Union as a whole to be conveyed, as reflected in the recent development of the Basle proposals, in the review of the capital requirements applicable to lending to SMEs, and in the wider recognition of collateral.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of the Banking Advisory Committee is very important in this regard. The BAC is an advisory committee to the Commission, bringing together banking supervisors and regulators. The authorities responsible for the prudential supervision of investment firms have been invited to participate in discussions of the capital review.</p>
<p class="contents">A dedicated working structure has been established to assist in developing concrete proposals that should address EU concerns, in particular as regards the application of the capital framework to a wide range of institutions, including smaller banks and investment firms.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, let me say that the Commission considers that very good progress has been made. Of course further important work remains to be done before the third consultative document is published later in the year. The Commission looks forward to finalising this work and adopting a legislative proposal so that the new regime can be introduced in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission regards it as important to the process that Parliament be kept informed of the Commission's developing thinking in relation to the potential proposal for a new capital adequacy regime. Commissioner Bolkestein has just this week written to the chairman of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee to suggest that it might be useful to arrange a meeting where members of the committee could be apprised by Commission experts in greater detail as to the emerging thinking in relation to the capital adequacy review. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I very much welcome what you said about the flexibility and evolutionary approach with regard to the internal ratings-based approach. It is vital that this risk-sensitive framework should be potentially applicable to a wide range of credit institutions, both large and small.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome what you said about pooled data, which is essential to ensuring that smaller institutions can take advantage of a new risk-sensitive framework by pooling data with similar, smaller institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I further welcome what you said about the modified risk weight curve and retail lending and collateral. All these issues are going to be vitally important in ensuring that the new framework is adaptable to the diversity of large and small credit institutions and investment firms in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome a risk-sensitive framework. There is no need for a more sophisticated and risk-sensitive framework to be more bureaucratic and costly. At all costs we want to ensure a fair balance for SMEs. There is no need for a risk-sensitive framework to make SME borrowing more expensive. I am confident that if the Commission and Parliament do their work properly we can devise a solution and a new accord which are risk-sensitive, protect savers, encourage systemic stability and ensure that small businesses can continue to have access to loan finance. In many cases I hope that this may even bring down the cost of lending for small businesses. It is vital that we get this right. I look forward to the further exchange of views that has been proposed. There is a great deal more work to be done, but I am encouraged by what I have heard so far in response to the question tabled by myself, Mr Karas and Mr Radwan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I pay tribute to your valiant rendering, not only of the English language – in which you have no problem – but also of the specialised terminology of the financial markets, which probably caused you more throatache than the language itself.</p>
<p class="contents">You paid tribute to the modernising efforts of the financial services programme. Indeed it is a remarkable programme, which has to succeed if we are going to have a unified and integrated capital market in Europe – a great competitive advantage for an economy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the word "modernise" can be such a terrible weasel word at the same time. Many things can be cloaked in modernism. In this particular case there is an upside, insofar as the integration of capital markets is helped; at the same time, however, the increasing leverage of financial institutions, inter alia, has already given rise to various risks will do so in the future. There have to be ways of strengthening control of those risk-management models which banks will use in order to assume control. Such models are very costly and hard to control. When I say "control" I do not mean control in the old-fashioned bureaucratic sense. New methods have to be invented for checking on these models so that they perform in a way that helps the banks perhaps to leverage more while at the same time keeping them in check. If they are not kept in check the risks could be very substantially increased.</p>
<p class="contents">The other risk in this area is that we create a risk-management divide where big banks and big financial institutions will have all the means at their disposal to engage in modern risk management. Meanwhile, small banks will become more and more marginalised in this respect and be increasingly burdened with costs which the bigger institutions have managed to shrug off.</p>
<p class="contents">If indeed a way out is to be sought through partial application to small banks, this may exacerbate the lack of transparency in the whole area. The recent Enron debacle offers a sobering lesson in what a lack of transparency could provoke.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore our advice would be to temper a little the enthusiasm for surrendering control to the markets, while building up the official control side a bit more and applying it in a modern way using modern methods. Such methods might, in the short term, limit profitability, but if they are to spare us a couple of Enron-type disasters in the long run, they will more than compensate for any reduction in short term profit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share your view that substantial progress has been made in the Basle II discussion process so far. Mr Karas, and Mrs Villiers as well, have referred to a number of fundamental problems, especially with regard to the various financing structures in Europe, and we still have a whole range of problems to resolve. You were right to address the problem of internal and external ratings, where we have made progress, but, as you yourself have said, the crediting of securities and the time long-term credits take to be assessed as being of a significantly higher risk are all yet to be discussed in Basle.</p>
<p class="contents">What emerged from Mrs Villiers' and Mr Karas' question today was important for me to learn, and so I ask you to add to it. There are two points still outstanding. One of them is, as before, how the Commission exerts influence in Basle – if it sees these problems in the same way that we do; I got that from their answer. You have, admittedly, mentioned the Member States – including Spain, the new one – but, at the end of the day, it is we who are the legislators. What matters is that it be made clear there how we envisage transposition. I would like to have a more definite statement from you on that.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing that interests me is this. We all hope that, in Basle, all the problems that preoccupy us in the parliamentary process here will be solved. After all, we cannot all take part. What happens, though, if they are not solved? What view, then, for example, does the Commission take of something that has fundamental importance for Austria and Germany, namely, how we assess the value of long-term credits, if this problem is not resolved? That is the question that arises in my mind, and there is still the statement by your colleague Commissioner Bolkestein, who is present here, that a 1:1 transposition is imperative. A statement like that leaves us relatively little room for movement in Basle. What ideas are there circulating within the Commission about the introduction of a degree of flexibility here?</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I would like to add that I would be very interested to know how you envisage the process of transposition. When Basle II is adopted – and you have yourself said that you are aiming for 2005 – it should all happen very fast. What we have heard from the Commission to date is that there will be a framework directive and then appendices to – as it is so elegantly phrased – deal with the technical details, and which will sort out the questions of a system of supervision as well. It will be a very rapid process. I would greatly welcome it if this working party linking Parliament and the Commission could start very soon, in order to get those within Parliament who are interested – and we three from the group of the European People's Party/European Democrats are very much so – involved in the process in good time and thereby avoid various problems with timescales. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to underline that I spoke on behalf of Commissioner Bolkestein who is responsible for these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make three points. The first is the influence of the European Union in the Basle Committee. I mentioned the global framework. Nine out of 13 members of the Basle Committee are members of the European Union. The Commission and the European Central Bank are involved in its debates. We have the opportunity to convey the European Union's points of view in the debates and in the Basle Committee framework. Thanks to the coordination of our positions, we influenced the debates in the Basle Committee, in the areas of review of the capital requirements applicable to lending to SMEs and the wider issue of recognition of collateral. Those are two examples where our proposals did play a major role in the debates on the Basle Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, creating compatibility between flexibility and transparency is a key issue for the credibility of the overall system. It will be necessary to establish not only the relationship between the minimum capital requirements of the institution and the risks that such an institution takes on board, but also to guarantee that there will be transparency in the criteria that are used by the supervisory bodies of the Member States. That is why the financial services action plan is seeking a certain degree of convergence of the supervision in order to guarantee that flexibility in the application of the system will not detract from the necessary transparency and the outside control of the way each system acts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me ask you to save your more detailed and technical questions for my colleague, Mr Bolkestein. I am sure he will be willing to give you full and comprehensive answers. I do not dare to go any further than this because let me remind you that the last Renaissance man was Leibnitz and he died some years ago! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
