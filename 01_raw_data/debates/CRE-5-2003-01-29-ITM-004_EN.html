<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Yiannitsis,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have this opportunity to report to you on how the Community is preparing for the forthcoming meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the aims of the Greek Presidency is to step up the human rights dialogue between the European Parliament and the Council. The conclusions adopted by the Council on 10 December 2002 contain recommendations on closer cooperation between us, in a bid to bring about a more open and transparent European human rights policy, and I should like to outline the basic principles which underpin this policy and shape the Union’s overall approach to what we all agree is an extremely important and sensitive issue. On 25 June 2001, the Council reaffirmed its commitment to promoting the European human rights policy and the policy of democratisation in third countries and issued a series of basic principles designed to bring about a more creditable, coherent, consistent human rights and democratisation policy. We need consistency between Community action and the common foreign and security policy as well as development policy through close cooperation and coordination between the competent bodies of the European Union. We need to integrate and mainstream human rights and fundamental freedoms into all EU policies and actions. We need openness of our human rights and democratisation policy through a strengthened dialogue with the European Parliament and the civil society and we need regular identification and review of priority actions in the implementation of this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has a long history and has managed to create an area of legal security and inviolable freedoms of which we are rightly proud. Our aim at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference is to incorporate the codified <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>on human rights and fundamental freedoms, as contained in the European Charter, into the Treaties. We hope that this will respond to our citizens’ expectations and increase their level of protection. The clearer and more unequivocal our absolute respect for human rights inside the Union, the more creditable and persuasive our foreign policy on these issues will be, and we shall be able to demand more effectively that all members of the international community abide, if not by all, then at least by the basic principles and values which give man and society their dignity. As you know, abolishing the death penalty and torture, combating discrimination against women and protecting children from exploitation are our main lines of approach. Respect for these principles must inform all aspects of the Union’s foreign policy, even if there is an economic or political price to pay. This approach will guarantee our credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, before detailing the preparations we are making for the meeting in Geneva, I should like briefly to recount the results of last year’s meeting, to give you an idea of the challenges facing us in March and April. As you know, last year was a trying time, due in part to the composition of the Commission, some of the members of which have a poor track record in human rights. It was also the first time the United States was absent from the Commission and the Middle East dominated the discussions and overshadowed every other initiative. European motions on Iran, Chechnya and Zimbabwe were thrown out for the first time in the Commission’s history. I should point out that, apart from the return of the United States, the composition of the Commission is more or less the same as last year. I should also like to point out that the way in which the Human Rights Commission functions reflects the complicated and difficult power struggles with which we have to work. This became clear during last year’s elections in the Commission, when the calming and stabilising role of the European Union demonstrated the value of a sober but pragmatic European approach, defusing the tension and circumventing a painful and dangerous impasse. Nor must we forget that this situation may be complicated in the immediate future by the prospect of unilateral intervention in Iraq, the worsening situation in the Middle East and the possible rekindling of terrorism, fed by conflicting arguments from all the forces involved as they try to pass the buck from one side to the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, with this general context in mind, I should like to say a few words about how the Council is currently preparing for this meeting. The COHOM working group organised its first two-day meeting on preparations for the work of the Commission two weeks ago. Delegates from the various geographic working groups were invited to this meeting for a presentation of this year’s priorities. With the help of senior officials, COHOM has already managed to identify which countries are willing to agree on an action package. It has also identified which countries need further discussion, rapprochement and information and has called for reports from the heads of the Community representations in these countries. I must stress that no final decisions – and hence no initiatives – have been taken. The COHOM working group will decide on as many issues as possible at its meeting on 5 February and any particularly thorny issues outstanding will be discussed in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and, where necessary, referred to the Council. This debate has come along at exactly the right time, because the COHOM meeting on 5 February will be able to consider your ideas and comments.</p>
<p class="contents">I can, however, report that the working group has already provisionally agreed that the Union will vote in favour of item 9 on the agenda on the five countries of Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Myanmar and the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. At the same time, the European Union is moving for parts of south-eastern Europe to be transferred from item 9 to item 19 on the agenda, so that they can be provided with consultancy services and technical know-how in the human rights sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I have deliberately not gone into all the European Union’s actions in this area for the current period. The Union’s traditional report on the human rights situation in various parts of the world will cover the countries which give cause for concern. A draft is already under way and we are endeavouring to give this report weight by covering about twenty or thirty countries. Here too, the views of the European Parliament on the countries which we need to support will be vital. As far as thematic decisions are concerned, the final decisions will again be taken in February. What I can tell you is that motions are already being prepared on the death penalty and children’s rights. Finally, supporting declarations are also being prepared on issues which are major priorities in the European Union, such as racism, sexual discrimination and xenophobia, women’s rights, modern forms of slavery and supporting and encouraging all types of personal and collective initiatives to protect human rights. These are just a few examples but I think I have given you an idea of the European Union’s commitments and expectations for the forthcoming meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I finish, I should like to comment on one particular issue which is a priority for the Greek Presidency and that is the importance of taking an organised approach to the waves of illegal immigrants flooding into Europe. We believe that this will also help combat serious forms of crime and human rights abuses, such as slavery, prostitution and what is often total disregard for human life. In order to protect the human rights of immigrants and refugees, the presidency considers that, apart from third pillar issues which have to do with this question, we need to do something about the social rights of these people inside the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must point out, especially as things stand today, that the Union needs to strike the right balance between security and the unobstructed exercise of people’s rights, between cooperation and pressure, between control and protection, between the demands of others and what applies to our members. It is a difficult path to tread, but it is the only path. Having said which, the Council welcomes the entry into force of the Statute for the International Criminal Court which, we believe, will do a great deal to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Eleanor Roosevelt was unanimously selected as the first chairman of the UN Commission on Human Rights in 1946, which was charged with the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. She might well have turned in her grave at the recent events in Geneva. The election of a Libyan chair to the primary UN body dealing with human rights has rightly prompted wonderment at how this can be. It may simply be because the election of individuals to the Commission on Human Rights bureau is based on nomination by regional groups: it was the Africans' turn to nominate, and they chose an individual from Libya. The secret vote called at the behest of the United States led to a common abstention by seven EU Member States in the Commission on Human Rights. The strong concern of many in the international community, including the EU, has rightly been registered at what is a significant blow to the credibility of the Commission on Human Rights. The performance of the new chair will undoubtedly be closely scrutinised. It is now time for the EU to focus on the initiatives it will take in the 59th session. The challenges facing the EU constitute a decidedly uphill task.</p>
<p class="contents">At the 58th session last year we saw the Commission of Human Rights vote down EU initiatives on Zimbabwe, Chechnya and Iran. Those results prompted a bout of soul-searching as to how the EU could improve the prospects for its country and thematic resolutions. At the UN General Assembly – a third committee in New York – several innovations were put in place by the Presidency: earlier preparation of drafts, more concise resolutions and improved burden-sharing amongst EU partners. These are important measures because they free up time for lobbying – diplomatic groundwork can, of course, make all the difference between failure and success.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the EU will need all the diplomatic finesse it can muster in Geneva when faced with an array of CHR members with poor human rights records, many disputing the legitimacy of tabling country resolutions. The EU has rightly defended the need for country resolutions alongside thematic resolutions. In many instances, those resolutions form the basis for the mandates of the special representatives and rapporteur who, when permitted by the country in question, seek to illuminate the human rights difficulties requiring attention. This constructive system is not embraced by the vast majority of the international community, with over 150 states declining to issue a standing invitation to the UN special mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that, in view of this, it is interesting to note that the African nations have agreed to have the African Union organise a peer review process which, whilst weaker and different from this, nevertheless represents a step towards arriving at a situation in which some collective measurement of performance in these areas is actually taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">It is undoubtedly a difficult process to determine which countries should be subject to EU action in the Commission on Human Rights. The EU has sought to develop its approach this year, with the Council Working Group on Human Rights taking soundings from all relevant geographic working groups in the Council as to which countries most warrant attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions are set to continue at the COHOM meeting on 5 February 2003. It should be stressed that no final decisions have been taken by the EU, but initiatives on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Israeli settlements, Burma/Myanmar and Iraq have been provisionally agreed upon and other countries remain under consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament's resolution on priorities for the Commission on Human Rights will constitute an important contribution to that debate, as will the presentation of priorities by NGOs at the forthcoming session of the Human Rights Contact Group.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the EU's approach to Iran and China at the Commission on Human Rights will attract a great deal of interest. The EU is engaged in human rights dialogues with both countries, with the primary aim of achieving concrete progress on the ground. That is why we have designed a set of clear benchmarks to measure results. As the EU guidelines on human rights dialogues make clear, and as we have made fully apparent to the Iranian government, such dialogues do not in any way preclude the tabling of resolutions in international human rights fora. That decision must be made on the basis of our assessment of the human rights situation on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, the EU's decision on a resolution cannot be divorced from an assessment of the prospects for progress within the framework of the dialogue. For the first round of dialogue with Iran, the initial assessment is cautiously positive. Whilst the mandate of the special representative to Iran, Mr Maurice Copithorne, disappears with the defeat of the EU's resolution at the 58th Commission on Human Rights, last year Iran issued a standing invitation to the UN special rapporteurs, and it has announced that it will accept visits by four UN thematic rapporteurs during the course of this year. It is worth noting that Mr Copithorne was not allowed to set foot in the country to implement his mandate, illustrating that, in the face of intransigence on the part of a third country, resolutions do not always secure the progress sought.</p>
<p class="contents">After a year's absence, the United States returns as a member of the Commission on Human Rights. It is important for the EU and the United States to pursue their common interests in advancing human rights in the often hostile climate at the Commission on Human Rights. It is true that there are several issues on which the United States and the EU do not see eye to eye, including such fundamental advances as the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture and the International Criminal Court. Those differences should neither be artificially papered over nor allowed to block meaningful cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the EU and the United States have launched regular informal consultations on human rights which complement the existing human rights troika and include scrutiny of the language used in our respective resolutions and the thinking behind our approaches. The next round of consultations is scheduled for 6 February 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I welcome the European Parliament's intention to send a delegation to the 59th Commission on Human Rights following last year's successful visit, which provided the opportunity for productive exchanges between the EU Heads of Mission and the Commission's delegation in Geneva. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In preparing for this 59th meeting, we are, of course, aware of how difficult it is to achieve substantial results within the UN framework, something that the Council and the Commission have already illustrated to some extent.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not, though, be creating difficulties about the UNHCR's standing in view of this year's chairmanship having been entrusted to Libya, of all countries. I find it a particular cause of embarrassment that this was made possible by the European Union abstaining when it came to the vote. I know that this was a deal done with the African states, but if a nomination of this sort is to be avoided, we should perhaps be doing more in-depth work with this continent in the area of human rights, rather than only when it comes to haggling for jobs and positions in the corridors of the UN. I have heard what the representative of the Council has said. He quoted the fine declarations that were made in June 2001. At the General Affairs Council this week, we learned how the absence of any agreement has meant that the opposite has been the result, in Zimbabwe for example. Obviously, considerations of human rights were seen as less important than issues of economics.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, it strikes me as important that the meeting should be followed – and promptly – by the public debriefing from the Council and the Commission here in Parliament. A review of the last meeting is of little use to me right now; I would have been very keen to hear it once the meeting was over. Parliament and the public have a right to know what the Council and the Commission did at the UNHCR meeting, and why they did it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad, though, when a dialogue on human rights is got underway with a country, and the Commissioner mentioned Iran as being one of them. As the rapporteur for Iran, that is something that I welcome. Iran should, though, demonstrate the seriousness with which it takes such a dialogue by cooperating with the United Nations. I found a number of positive things in what the Commissioner said, and I hope that we can make them a reality. We have tabled an amendment expressing our wish that a successor for Mr Copithorne should be formally nominated, and I hope that Iran will also be prepared to work together with him.</p>
<p class="contents">In this resolution, we have listed a number of countries as illustrations of the indisputable deficits in the area of human rights. We in the PPE-DE Group do take the view, though, that this resolution is not suited to illustrating the dimension of present-day human rights violations in their entirety, by, for example, incorporating a plethora of individual cases under specific headings. We will therefore be rejecting the relevant amendments – not because of their content, but for procedural reasons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that would be extremely welcome and I say that as a delegate who has attended the three previous sessions.</p>
<p class="contents">We recognise the importance of the UN Commission as a forum to effect real change, but we feel that the Council, Parliament and the Commission must act together if we are to achieve our real aims. Of course, there were regrets about the lack of cohesion last year between the EU Member States and the so-called Western Group and we have better hopes for this year.</p>
<p class="contents">We must recognise the fundamental importance of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and we call on the EU Presidency to address this important issue. It should also tackle the important issue of the abolition of the death penalty, and again, we call on the EU to sponsor a resolution inviting all states to introduce a moratorium on executions with a view to the total abolition of the death penalty, and we reiterate our request to the US, China, Saudi Arabia, Congo, Iran and other states to immediately end all executions.</p>
<p class="contents">But let me turn to the rights of those sometimes forgotten, namely women, children, minorities, lesbian, gay and trans-gendered people who suffer inhumane and degrading treatment merely because of who they are. The case of the Cairo 52 in Egypt is still unresolved after more than 18 months, and again more people have been arrested for alleged homosexuality. The complaints of the three British men, Nesbitt, Nawaz and Pankhurst, who have made serious allegations of abuse, have yet to be investigated.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the Council that we must be consistent in our applications and our approach, and must be determined to end human rights abuses wherever they occur. Where we have association agreements and human rights clauses, we should not hesitate in criticising those countries which fail to uphold human rights and, where necessary, suspend such agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not think so. The most important forum in the world is once again missing the mark by a mile: it is not the severity of the violations that is the deciding factor but the ability to mobilise political support. Some countries also manage to repeatedly avoid censure; this produces a distorted picture of the human rights situation in the world and tarnishes the legitimacy of the Commission. Regrettably, having a notorious violator of human rights such as Libya as the chairman of the Commission is an example of this. It is high time for reform that will prevent these kinds of undesirable developments.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union can play a greater role in the UN Commission if it is properly prepared, prepared in time, speaks with one voice and is persistent and courageous – in short, if it operates differently from the way it operated last year. Europe’s abstention in respect of Libya’s chairmanship, however diplomatically tactical that was meant to be, is an admission of weakness and creates a lack of clarity with regard to Europe’s position. In order to exert maximum influence, coordination must take place with the United States on as many aspects as possible. I understand that that does in fact happen. It is very important to my group that the European Union makes efforts particularly in respect of resolutions on slavery, immunity from punishment, torture, brutal interpretations of Sharia, discrimination against women, freedom of religion, the situation of indigenous peoples and certainly the protection of human rights activists as well. We place great importance on the resolutions on the 17 countries in which Iraq, Iran, Burma, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, China, Russia and Colombia are in particular named. Selection is inevitable, but that certainly does not mean that all countries that have not been named will get off scot-free. I would also like to draw particular attention to the renewal of the mandate of the special rapporteur for Iran, the strengthening of the position of the High Commissioner in Colombia and the approval of special rapporteurs in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must integrate the outcomes of Geneva into its policy and resume the political dialogue with the countries concerned. As the human rights rapporteur for this Parliament for this year I say: let the European Union do everything it can to restore the authority of this UN Human Rights Commission. We cannot do without it, there is no alternative. A meeting is only successful, however, if it is feared by the violators and applauded by the victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over and above our high-sounding declarations of principle, human rights are being violated in far too many countries: Chechnya, China, the African countries at war, Israel, the USA with the death penalty and so on and so forth. The blame lies not just with those violating these rights but also with those who see what is happening but do not intervene and genuinely enforce international law. In this sense, governments are often indifferent towards the work of UNHCR and their recommendations go unheeded. Like many of you, I feel indignation when fundamental human rights – the right to life, freedom of thought and movement – are ridden roughshod over in countries professing to be democracies too, and, today, illiberal, death-dealing acts are being carried out in the name of the war against terrorism, although that is not to say that terrorism must not be combated, as in the case of the massacre in Mazar-I-Sharif.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like a measure to be taken in March which would make Israel, for example, which is a signatory State, respect, if not the UN resolutions requiring an end to military occupation, at least the Geneva Convention. Collective punishments, the demolition of houses, schools, hospitals, factories and shops, the uprooting of trees, arbitrary arrests, torture, extrajudicial assassinations, vandalism and theft perpetrated by Israeli soldiers, which I personally witnessed in Ramallah, are tragic, daily occurrences in Palestine, like the attacks against civilians in Israel. Three hundred and fifty Palestinian children and 80 Israeli children have been killed in the last two years, innocent victims of our failure to act. We have the means to do so but we often use two different sets of checks and balances: it is our alliances, not our values, which carry most weight. Europe is founded on the principles of democracy and the rule of law. If we are not consistent, first and foremost in the context of European Union affairs, employing all the means available to us, including the suspension of the association agreements with countries which have blatantly violated human rights, how can we be credible as promoters of these rights within the United Nations? We need the provision of enough UNHCR financial and human resources to be able to act more effectively. At the March conference, we must take tangible decisions such as sending a peace-keeping force to protect the civilian population in the occupied territories and refusing to allow Israel to obstruct or even fire on humanitarian missions.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution on which we are going to vote outlines effective, valuable priorities and commitments – such as the operation of the International Criminal Court, human rights monitoring in Iran and the cooperation of the institutions with associations and NGOs from civil society – which will further education and respect in the field of human rights and democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nor did our debate in this House, and the resolution we adopted unanimously on 19 December 2002, have any effect. On 26 January 2003, the People's Court in Chengdu confirmed the death sentences that had been passed on Lobsang Dhondup and on the Buddhist lama Tenzin Delek. They were accused of involvement in an attack using explosives and of sabotaging national unity.</p>
<p class="contents">Lengthy solitary confinement without contact with family or legal representatives is a manifest breach of the UN's minimum standards for the treatment of prisoners. Their trial was neither fair nor in accordance with the rule of law. A public hearing in open court – demanded by this Parliament among others – was refused on the flimsy grounds that state secrets were involved. There was no free choice of legal representation, and public defence counsel were appointed by the court.</p>
<p class="contents">Lobsang Dhondup's execution resulted in immediate protests by the EU Member States. It will also be on the agenda of the human rights conversations between Germany and China. Great Britain has reiterated the demand for the death penalty in China to be at last abolished, and the human rights dialogue between the EU and China must now at last concern itself with this serious case. It is a disaster; while China is trying to cut a credible figure on the world stage, the most basic conditions of the defence of human rights are being disregarded. On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and as President of this Parliament's Intergroup on Tibet, I call upon the Council, the Commission and the Member States to intervene without delay and prevent the death sentence with which Tenzin Delek has been threatened from being carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">For decades, this lama has worked in the religious, cultural and social fields – with such manifest success that all hardliners see him as a threat. This appalling event can leave us in no doubt that China's violations of fundamental rights should be on the agenda of the Human Rights Convention in Geneva, and the European Union must take the lead in this.</p>

I would like to mention two, in particular, which are considered to be of particularly minor importance: the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">I then feel that we should continue to call strongly for a moratorium on the death penalty, not least in that it has become clear that, resisting any fatalistic tendencies or ideas of inevitable destiny, it is actually possible to persuade some US governors of the worthlessness of this barbaric practice: the fact that the governor of Illinois commuted 167 sentences shows that this is a battle that it is actually possible to win.</p>
<p class="contents">We call upon the European Union, first and foremost, to fight to ensure that there are no off-limits zones in the protection of human rights. One such off-limits zone could be the fight against terrorism, which should be based firmly on respect for international humanitarian law. Another free zone could be the fact that the Rome Treaty establishing the International Criminal Court continues to be treated by some countries, particularly the United States, as extremely insignificant. The authority and effectiveness of this Treaty are in danger of being increasingly diminished by the attitude of the United States and its decision to adopt bilateral agreements with some countries.</p>

<p class="contents">First, we should not be mild-mannered psychotherapists in one country and unrelenting public prosecutors in another. The criteria applied to Turkey should also apply to Iran and the criteria applied to Iran should also apply to Turkey. And while we are on the subject of Turkey, it is about time that Leyla Zana, the woman awarded the Sakharov prize, saw the light of day. And it would be an important achievement if that were to happen under the Greek Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the United States. In addition to what the Commissioner said, there is the question of the death penalty in the United States and we need to address this issue in the same way as we have addressed it in other countries. And while we are on the subject of crossed swords between the European Union and the United States, I think it is perhaps about time we awarded a Sakharov prize to an American in 2003, the outgoing governor of Illinois, who has pardoned 150 people on death row.</p>

Who other than the Commission on the rights of men, women, children, minorities, etc. could demand reports on countries that imprison people for crimes that they have not committed? I am thinking for example of Mr Bandajevski, whose health is deteriorating in prison in Belarus; I am thinking of Lemine Ould Cheikh Melaïnine who is wasting away in a Mauritanian jail. We must give all of our support to the proper functioning of this Commission so that it can fully play its role. For this we need to ensure that an appropriate amount of speaking time is granted to the Commission rapporteurs and humanitarian NGOs who, on the ground, are often the real witnesses and representatives of those without a voice.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate is also the opportunity to highlight the rights of indigenous peoples as, when too many States are violently breaching fundamental rights, what can be said about the rights of indigenous peoples in the absence of practically any information about their definition or their legal guarantees? We must strongly support the UN’s initiative to have a permanent forum on these issues in order to raise awareness and promote the cause of indigenous peoples. We must also do everything we can to ensure the maintenance of the working group, which is the only one of its kind dealing with indigenous peoples' issues. Also, ladies and gentlemen, it would be to the European Parliament’s credit if it, for its part, were to set up the European Parliament indigenous peoples' delegation that was decided upon when a resolution was adopted in 1992. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our inconsistency is a form of political prostitution and undermines our moral authority in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this joint resolution and, as mentioned in paragraph 16, the EU Presidency should support further resolutions on a number of countries. I would like to refer to three in particular. With regard to China, the strike hard campaign continues to be extremely worrying, having dramatically increased the number of executions in China, often carried out in reliance on insufficient evidence in summary trials. Severe restrictions on freedom of expression and freedom of information persist. Pro-democracy campaigners and political activists are often detained without charge and, in some cases, charged with inciting subversion. It is essential that the Presidency make human rights a core part of all dialogue with China.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Middle East, I condemn the way in which human rights are abused because of the use of terrorism, especially suicide bombings carried out by Palestinian extremists. But I also condemn the state terrorism inflicted on the ordinary people of Palestine by Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Iran, EU leaders had expressed the hope that engaging Iran in political dialogue would strengthen reformist elements and improve human rights. Sadly, stoning seems to have been only stopped temporarily, for reasons of image. Numerous newspapers are being closed down daily and unfortunately the number of executions has increased significantly.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection and promotion of human rights is one of the fundamental principles of the EU. It is imperative for the EU to show consistency in its stance on human rights on the global stage and particular at Geneva; otherwise, no one will take us seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think they will be most useful to the Council, as will the references made to a number of countries and regions such as China, the Middle East and Zimbabwe, which not only reflect the Council’s position, they also reflect the action being taken by the Council and the Commission on a whole series of issues. We are not sparing any effort to persuade everyone we can of the need to implement human rights. Of course, what is important in the final analysis is for the pressure we exert to bring about results and not just remain political pressure. Of course, I also agree with many of the other comments made but there is too little time to go into them, such as turning our attention to the problems in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Before discussing our position in various international fora, I should like to take this opportunity to comment on Mr van den Bos’s reference to the European Union’s abstention from last year’s vote. I personally believe that the decision to abstain was not an expression of indifference. That would not be in the nature of the European Union. It was a considered decision which, it was hoped, would help the Commission on Human Rights operate smoothly under the political circumstances which arose last year.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that of course we are interested in abolishing the death penalty, it is one of Europe’s crowning achievements. This is clear from numerous discussions under way, including with the United States, where a number of agreements, especially as part of the fight against terrorism, cannot proceed unless there is a guarantee that the death penalty will not be applied to people extradited to the United States. We take a keen interest in the question of the death penalty everywhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree that this needs to be pushed and is an issue which is, in fact, the same in every system, in every country. As such, this issue deserves strong attention and more activity.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Fava's remark – that by defending human rights we can avoid or prevent terrorism – I would also say that I only wish that were true. It would be extremely good if this really were the case. The world is more evil than that. There is extremism and it is not possible to avoid the problem totally by having our own record straight or even having global decency really move forward. This involves a number of fundamental problems, but having said this, I agree with the approach expressed in this formulation. Certainly, we have to be extremely careful not to damage these ideals by fighting terrorism. It is extremely important to maintain that balance.</p>
<p class="contents">On the vote in the Commission on Human Rights, and as a reaction to Mr Gahler's remarks, it is not correct to state that the seven EU members of the Commission on Human Rights contributed to the election of the Libyan chair.
