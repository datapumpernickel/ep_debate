<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lehne (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this legislative project at second reading is a really complex project, which does not make it easy to explain the context we are dealing with here. I will try to do so nevertheless.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the common position before us, which we have to decide on today, has a number of crucial weaknesses, which for the rest nobody has disputed so far during the debate in terms of principle. The first crucial weakness is the lack of harmonisation. This common position, which after all concerns the takeover of companies, seeks to protect the shareholders. I regard that as an aim most definitely worth trying to achieve. But in fact it also requires certain framework conditions. After all this is supposed to be a framework directive. In regard to a number of issues in connection with hostile takeovers, with takeovers in general, which simply have to be regulated, this common position does not really regulate anything.</p>
<p class="contents">Take for example the issue of what is called the takeover threshold, as from which a compulsory offer can be made, the issue of what is called the equitable price to be offered to the shareholders, or even the issue of the circumstances under which cash payments are made obligatory. We have merging stock markets in Europe. I believe that against this background it is urgently necessary not just to leave these questions open but to settle them. For that simple reason the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market I am presenting today includes a whole raft of amendments containing concrete proposals on how these issues could be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">I also consider it right to make these proposals, for if we do not settle these matters we must at least ask ourselves seriously, in face of the problems involved, whether there is any point at all in this directive. To inscribe in a directive that shareholders must be paid an equitable price is about as useful as saying that an apple will fall from the tree when it is ripe. Then you should also say in it what that equitable price actually is and what this whole business is really about.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major problem in this directive is Article 9. The purpose of the directive is supposed to be to create a level playing field in Europe. But unless the directive is amended, the end result of this common position would be that not only do we not have a level playing field with North America, we do not even have one within Europe. The Americans have what they call the 'Business Judgment Rule', i.e. the possibility of mounting a defence against takeovers. The common position provides on principle for a strict obligation of neutrality in Europe. That means that in future it will be easy for American companies to take over European ones.</p>
<p class="contents">The other problem is that there is no level playing field in Europe either. In a number of countries, the United Kingdom being the classical example with its London Stock Exchange, which has been much described, company law provides for the possibility of in effect excluding takeovers by restrictions to the right to vote in the company statute. So the end result of Article 9 as it now stands would be that some companies in some countries in Europe could be taken over much more easily, while other companies in other countries in Europe could virtually never be taken over if they have provisions of that kind in their statute. That is why Article 9 also needs to be amended.</p>
<p class="contents">The next problem is the issue of the competent supervisory authority. The common position devotes three pages to regulating this issue. If it takes three pages to do so, then clearly there will be enough points of reference and opportunities for dispute and we will create no legal certainty. That is why I believe we must also improve Article 4.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to make one more observation. In the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market we managed to find compromise amendments over and above the groups. These compromise amendments do not please everyone in this House. That is in the nature of compromise amendments. But what is crucial is that we realise that this directive has serious weaknesses and that is beyond dispute. The only way to remedy these weaknesses is by deciding to opt for conciliation here by a majority of 314 votes. It is quite clear that the result of the conciliation will not in the end be the same as what the Council decided or what Parliament decides tomorrow. The result will be another compromise. If we do not adopt these amendments before us tomorrow, we will not achieve that further compromise and the directive will remain as bad as it is now.</p>
<p class="contents">So I can only ask this House to endorse the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market's compromise amendments. If certain circles in the Commission or elsewhere fear the directive could come to nothing, then I must honestly say I do not think so. Since the conciliation procedure was first introduced between Parliament and the Council, which is now more than six years, only a single directive, the one on the bio-patent, came to nothing in the conciliation procedure. A short while later it was, nonetheless, adopted both by the Council and by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I really do not know why we should not eventually succeed in reaching a compromise in this case, as with all other directives. So I certainly do not share the concern voiced here. We are pursuing a perfectly normal procedure. We should complete the second reading successfully and then seek a good compromise in the conciliation procedure.</p>

In view of the fact that Mr Lehne proposes to strengthen the role of company directors, it is quite obvious that Members may want to declare that before speaking.

My friend Mr Lehne has given the position of the EPP Group. I am going to give the position of the British Conservative delegation and a number of other Members. However, it is not necessarily a full and accurate description of the EPP Group's position, which he has given.</p>
<p class="contents">When a public company is listed, the management and owners are telling the world that investors are free to buy and sell stock in it without the shadow of management or the state rigging the market against them. The European single market is a pan-European market place but within which the market in shares must be treated like other markets so that national boundaries, even if they delineate different jurisdictions, do not interfere with the essential equivalence of the rules across the market place.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the single market investors, be they private, corporate or pension funds, should be able to exercise the rights of ownership to the benefit of the companies in which they invest and for those investors in them.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country, we have real reservations about the common position, but in the spirit of good will have been prepared to accept it. Unfortunately, we believe that some of the proposed amendments do not improve it. On the contrary, some will fatally damage the project of a single pan-European take-over regime. To be effective, useful and in the public interest, such a directive must: first, avoid direct involvement of the courts, but rather have a regulator with wide powers of discretion under the rule of law; secondly, clarify and have workable rules on jurisdiction; thirdly, clarify definitions of equitable price and set proper thresholds; fourthly, ensure management cannot improperly frustrate shareholders taking their legitimate decisions about the future of the company in which they own a stake.</p>
<p class="contents">If we fail to get this directive right, it will tell the world that Europe will not face the realities of the global market. That will not mean that it will not have to do so in due course; rather it will merely mean that adjustment will be more prolonged and painful and the victims will be European jobs and European prosperity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a proposal that has gone down a long and, I fear, stormy road in order to overcome some of the existing problems.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that there have been many problems. It is also true that the political agreement obtained in the Council last year enabled some of them to be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore offer a few thoughts on the function of Parliament: in a codecision procedure, in which a political agreement has been reached on a complex matter, what should be the role of the European Parliament? Should our role be limited to saying “Amen” to the Council’s proposals? I do not think this should be the case, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p class="contents">By this I do not mean that, once that agreement has been obtained in the Council, Parliament should decide to blow it out of the water. Ladies and gentlemen, we are politicians and therefore, we are always in favour of reaching political agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">These thoughts are fully applicable to this report. The Council has reached an agreement that should be respected on its main points, as the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, has done in his magnificent report, on which I sincerely congratulate him. And I congratulate him not only on respecting the main points of that agreement, but also on seeking formulae which – and I stress, while respecting the main points – try to improve the legislative proposal. This is, in my understanding, the role of a colegislative institution such as Parliament in the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments that our Committee is tabling can be grouped into three blocks. In the first block are a series of technical amendments that aim to either clarify concepts or fill gaps. I am not going to dwell on them.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second block are a series of amendments that aim to improve the participation of workers when there is a takeover bid. We cannot close our eyes to reality: when there is a takeover there is staff restructuring, redundancies and so on, in short, measures which affect jobs. It is therefore important that workers and their representatives should be informed, from the start, of what is being planned and that they can make their voice heard in the actual takeover procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The third block contains those amendments that have been most controversial during the procedure. And I would like to have the power of conviction to prevent you from having any fears about the consequences that could be deduced from the approval of those amendments. It is true that the European Parliament Rules of Procedure do not make this easy, making these debates into a pure and simple dialogue between the deaf. What can we do?</p>
<p class="contents">The first amendment refers to Article 4, which establishes what will be the competent authority for supervising the bid. In paragraph 1 it is established that it will be that of the Member State in which the company concerned has its headquarters, if – logically – its securities are admitted to trading in that Member State. What happens if they are not admitted to trading in that Member State? An answer is proposed that does not appear to be compatible with another amendment tabled by other Members, undoubtedly in good faith, requiring the criterion of headquarters. Because if the securities are not traded there, why should they be supervised by that authority?</p>
<p class="contents">The second controversial amendment refers to the duty of neutrality. Here we met with very conflicting and even opposed positions, and a formula has been reached that permits some exceptional hypotheses in order to carry out some defensive manoeuvres when it is not possible to call a general meeting.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallis (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, I fear that we are in danger of losing the plot or losing sight of what this directive is about. It is part of the financial services action plan; in our Commissioner's own words, "a key element in the creation of a fully integrated market in financial services, giving investors and consumers more choice". The proposals introduce three key elements at a time when there is a change in control of a company: protection of minority shareholders, transparency in relation to bid information and regulatory supervision of the process. But what are we in danger of doing as a Parliament, by virtue of the amendments tabled?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we are being far from transparent. Some of the amendments seem to be a covert attempt to introduce some elements of a company statute through the back door. Secondly, we are adopting rigid structures and procedures when the recommendation of the Commission was actually light-touch, allowing Member States leeway to reflect national practice in corporate culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the issue of clarity: the lack of this is especially evident in the debate about jurisdiction, an issue of which I have a little experience. The common position suggested some form of split arrangement. Now we have a proposition that would lead to muddle, forum shopping, potential litigation at a delicate moment in a corporate deal. This is not helpful. Jurisdiction should be solely in the hands of the Member State where the target company is registered. This is fair for minority shareholders, transparent and, above all, clear. Indeed I would ask the Commissioner to consider whether he can accept my amendment on this crucial point.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> editorial today talked about bid politics: that it has taken no less than 10 years to get this draft and that we, Parliament, could destroy that in 10 minutes tomorrow by voting through misguided amendments. I hope that will not be the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a matter on which clarity is of the utmost importance. Similarly we will reject the critical part of Amendment No 17, which would exclude shareholders from deciding on the merits of a bid for a company that they own. The ground for this is that it is not for governments, supervisory authorities or incumbent management to accept or frustrate a bid. It rests with the company's owners – the shareholders themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the principle on which perhaps we will divide tomorrow: what should be the over-riding concern of a law regulating takeovers. If you think that the correct thing is fairness and transparency towards all shareholders – majority and minority alike – then that determines your vote on a number of the issues here.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some points where I would be happy to go along with the compromise amendments, particularly those affecting the position of employees. I understand Mr Lehne's desire to get the thing taken into conciliation and further clarified. I have some sympathy with his point.

In the legal wrangling between the Council and Parliament, there was not even any mention of the workers, technicians and employees who actually turn the wheels of these companies which the large financial groups are fighting over. The European institutions care little about the job losses and closures caused by almost every company takeover or merger.</p>

In the UK the regulation of takeovers through the voluntary code of practice administered by the takeover panel has been highly successful: a good example here of a pragmatic approach to a highly complex issue where legislation will be less appropriate. It should not escape our attention that the takeover market is primarily British. Activity in London exceeds the whole of the combined volume in the rest of Europe, therefore this measure will damage the United Kingdom. Many believe that the imposition of a legal code is simply a protectionist device to enable less efficient European companies to protect themselves from takeovers by resorting to complex legal actions.</p>

It must also be possible to restructure companies between one EU country and another.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive will probably not create the clear regulations which are now needed on the international stock market, but the battle is not yet lost. The problem is that stock exchange law is closely associated with company law and that it is difficult to harmonise the one area if the other is not harmonised. However the regulations are drawn up, someone will suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">In a small market like Sweden’s, with relatively concentrated ownership, harmonising the level at which offers must be made at 30 per cent will create problems, and we are demanding greater flexibility. Greater flexibility is also required when it comes to the complete duty of neutrality recommended by the Council. German companies will have problems because Germany’s company law prohibits vote diversification. Greater understanding must be shown for national characteristics. Otherwise, there may be devastating consequences for an individual Member State’s company structure.</p>
<p class="contents">It would, however, be easier to solve the problem of which supervisory authority is to have jurisdiction. The most flexible solution would be to choose the supervisory authority in that country in which the target company has its head office. Companies may be quoted on different markets, and companies with head offices in Sweden are not always quoted in Sweden. It would be strange to say the least if, for example, American authorities were to be responsible for a takeover involving two European companies. Anyone who wants to avoid such consequences has the opportunity to vote in favour of Amendment No 19, which makes it clear that it is the target company’s head office which counts.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not defend the duty of neutrality, there will be no point to the directive. If, moreover, we open the door to defensive measures, we shall perhaps make it more difficult to restructure European markets and, especially, to protect small shareholders.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to emphasise that the Conciliation Committee has a <span class="italic">very</span> big responsibility and that success requires everyone to pull together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is at the heart of the EU financial services action plan. But, more than that, the bigger prize is that we are able to take forward the Lisbon agenda of creating a competitive, dynamic European economy. For that we need an efficient market in goods, services and capital.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bolkestein, I share your concerns: we cannot afford to risk losing this directive, because the EU economy would pay the opportunity cost for years of not being able to restructure European companies. Yet the amendments tabled by our rapporteur will take us in that direction. I fear it will undermine the effect of corporate restructuring necessary to build that EU competitiveness in global markets. If we are to achieve global excellence in, for example, the telecoms sector, we must ensure that recent take-overs such as Vodafone, Mannesmann, France Telecom, Orange, will show that European models work, cannot be blocked by hostile action or poison pills. That would be turning our back on the opportunity to achieve the competitiveness that we desire.</p>
<p class="contents">My delegation of Labour MEPs cannot accept, therefore, the changes in Article 9 to allow company boards the right to defensive measures to frustrate takeovers without getting shareholder approval. Mr Bolkestein himself has said that it is crucial that the management of target companies consult shareholders in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">Our primary objective must be to protect our investors, to ensure a fair and equal bidding process. It must be to ensure efficient flow in capital markets; and we must not end up by producing legislation which protects potentially inefficient managers and props up failing companies. That is in nobody's interest. It will result in investors not seeing the EU as an integrated capital market; it will undermine investor confidence and it will result in capital flow out of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur's amendments create confusion in the area of litigation and it would be wrong of us to vote for confusion in potential litigation cases.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that I cannot understand Mr Lehne's approach in the British <span class="italic">Economist</span>, where he has himself agreed that his compromise is unworkable, but that he put it in to keep the socialists happy and he is prepared to take it out in conciliation.

But it should be pointed out that the situation has definitely changed since the first reading. Foreign investment within the EU doubled between 1997 and 1998 and cross-border mergers and take-overs have reached record levels. Hitherto we have not had binding rules on take-overs either in Community law or in the legislation of a good number of Member States. The directive on take-over bids therefore seems necessary to ensure fair competition and for reasons of legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in the fortunate position of being able to say that since 1 January 1999 Austria has had its own take-over legislation. Austrian take-over legislation, and in particular its implementation by the take-over commission, has more or less proved its worth since it entered into force. Here in the European Parliament we are chiefly concerned with finding minimum European rules to regulate the major fields of tension in take-over law, for instance the boards against the shareholders, large shareholders against small ones, companies against the stock market.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is essential for the Member States to have the possibility, in accordance with the overall objectives and in the framework of the directive, to adopt useful, further-reaching rules, such as for example the provision on the promotion of equal treatment of all shareholders that we have in our current Austrian take-over law, by ...</p>

It is a pity the report took so long. Once again, time is running away with us in politics. It is economics that sets the pace. The reason this feels like a rather eerie debate has less to do with the time of night and even less with the sparsity of Members now present, but more with what is in fact going on. We are talking about a Europe that is supposed to unite, and what do we hear? British lobbyists against this Europe, against any hint of the social model that keeps being paraded in the electoral campaigns. It would be really nice if British Labour obviously we cannot expect anything like that from the Conservatives any more would for once move outside the borders of the City of London. Once upon a time it was said that 'Britain rules the waves', now we hear that 'Britain is drifting away'. Why are we always taken hostage for this little City of London? Why are we not honest enough to say that take-overs will become a major social problem if we do not cushion them? Why do we not dare to stand by what we keep announcing in our campaign speeches? In concrete terms we know that 70% of mergers go wrong. BMW/Rover was a disaster. Daimler/Chrysler is visibly becoming a crime, when we look at what is going on there.</p>
<p class="contents">Does Mr Lehne's report go far enough? No, but I do believe it is a first step in a certain direction. I personally and I wish that for once the same would apply to British Labour too will support the amendments that lead to more regulation. We do not want to see American conditions here at home. We do not need them. The European economy is doing very well. In the United Kingdom the social differences are widening ever further. We need this for insider deals, for cartel law. Does might come before right? That is the question. But the answer is that the Lehne report is at least a small step towards empowering the people of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A point I want to make with regard to this takeover directive is to bring the argument very firmly back to millions of electors in my country and millions of people who have pension plans and savings that are based upon investments in the stock market. Mrs McCarthy quite rightly reminded us to declare an interest. So let me declare an interest. I have a pension fund from my previous employer. A lot of its value is based on investments in the British stock market and I rely on investment managers to keep my investment safe and to develop it for my future retirement. That, of course, is a major strength, Mr Martin, for the British economy because we have those funds there at a time when our society is growing older and we need to provide those pensions. We do not have an overhang of publicly funded pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">That is something that everyone in the European Union is going to have to tackle and this takeover directive, in the final form that comes through has to address that issue. The problem with the amendments that we have before us is that, if this goes through, the people who are managing my pension fund will not be able to maximise that value for me. That applies to millions of ordinary individuals working in companies up and down the United Kingdom. It is their future that we are talking about. This is not some abstract concept. It goes to the heart of the British economy and it is something that increasingly will be critical for the future of the European economy as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This attention is certainly justified, in view of the importance of the text, which the Heads of State and Government made a priority during the European Council of Lisbon in March 2000. After all, were it to be approved, it would bring about a considerable improvement in the operation and stability of the European financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly delighted that I can at last discuss this common position, which we had a long wait for, but which was finally adopted by the Member States last June by unanimous vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the amendments proposed by Parliament further improve the text of the Council’s common position because they highlight points that could lead to interpretation difficulties and push for speedier transposition of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the Commission approves Amendments Nos 7, 14 and 18. It prizes Amendment No 18 particularly highly, the aim of which is to reduce the deadline for transposition, in accordance with a wish already expressed by the Commission on numerous occasions. Indeed, it has constantly highlighted the need to waste no time in implementing this directive, which is something all interested parties have looked forward to so much.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also taken note of the statements brought to the fore by Amendments Nos 5 and 13. Whilst the Commission has no objection to these suggestions, it would point out that they do not belong in this directive. The current text guarantees employees appropriate information on the conditions and repercussions of the bid. Stipulations that go further in this area are not in keeping with the objectives of the directive, which relates to the protection of the share holders. The labour conditions and employee rights in the event that enterprises are restructured are provided for in other Community directives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would also like to demonstrate its interest in Amendment No 12. This amendment seeks to introduce an instrument enabling a majority shareholder to take over the remaining securities. However, this procedure, which already exists in certain Member States, does not just affect the field of public takeover bids but extends much further and could, if necessary, be studied more closely as part of the general review of company law undertaken by the Commission. So I would suggest adding this topic to the list of subjects that could be submitted to a committee of experts.</p>
<p class="contents">Much to its regret, the Commission is unable to approve the other amendments, and this is for a variety of reasons. Amendments Nos 2 and 10 are unacceptable because they alter the scope of application of the directive. The directive relates to all public and exclusively public offers to purchase or exchange, be they voluntary or mandatory.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 4 and 15 are unacceptable because they do not belong in the intended stipulations. These only concern holders of securities in the first case and the supervisory authority in the second.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 8 and 9 are without foundation. After all, it is by no means certain that the proposed definition of equitable price is better than any other, because the various definitions that are currently in use in the Member States are all perfectly satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission studied the content of the amendments in depth but it cannot accept a single one of them. For example, Amendments Nos 6, 11 and 16 appear to pass over the existing national provisions that the text of the common position is in fact trying to bring closer together. Amendment No 6 in particular, contains an amalgam of ideas that were all addressed to a lesser or greater extent during the discussions on the directive, and were rejected because they did not seem to be suitable. Particularly the appointment of the competent authority, whilst the text of the common position came about after consultation with the supervisory authorities themselves. Then there is the definition of the percentage that confers control over the company, which ties in with other provisions in the field of company law, which differ considerably from Member State to Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 17, in its turn, should it be approved, could make it impossible for there to be any kind of hostile takeover bid. The Commission has no objection to extending the neutrality obligation to after the official deadline of the bid, as proposed in the first paragraph. However, the Commission cannot go along with Parliament’s proposal to allow the board of a particular company to determine the future of the company without taking account of the shareholders’ position, by simply submitting its decisions to the judgement of the competent authorities or the judge. A solution of this kind threatens on the one hand to lead to confusion over the role of the supervisory authorities, which must remain independent and impartial, and on the other hand to the systematic institution of legal proceedings that can be time-consuming and expensive and which benefit neither the companies concerned, the members of their Boards, nor the other interested parties, and particularly the employees. The situation in the United States can teach us a thing or two on that score, and should be a warning to us to proceed more cautiously.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, may I remind you that this is a framework directive, as requested by Parliament at an earlier stage. Nevertheless, the directive stipulates firstly, that a committee of experts from the Member States and from the Commission are to supervise the implementation and application of the text, and secondly, it includes a review clause for making any changes which may prove necessary in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Commission would point out that should this House approve the proposed amendments, it could prove very difficult for an agreement to be reached between the Council and Parliament. That said, the Commission is convinced, and it is supported in this by the economic operators involved, that the text, which is the product of over ten years of negotiations – which is longer than is needed to take account of all interests – is a good starting point, and it is high time we took action.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a further two new amendments have been tabled about which I have the following comments to make. Amendment No 19 is unacceptable, for the same reason that Amendment No 6 is unacceptable. As for Amendment No 20, which is similar to Amendment No 17, the same applies to both, albeit for slightly different reasons. The first part is acceptable, just as it is in Amendment No 17. The second part is not because the term ‘<span class="italic">Aufsichtsrat’ – </span>to use the German expression – is encompassed by the Dutch term ‘<span class="italic">bestuur’ </span>(board) and is subject to the same obligations as all managers of a company. The third part of it is unacceptable for the same reason that no so-called ‘social amendments’ are acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what I wanted to say on the issues raised by Parliament and needless to say the Commission is looking forward with enormous interest to the vote on this subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
