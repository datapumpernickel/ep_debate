<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Rothley </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, researchers, scientists and inventors in the European Union are faced with a problem. Either they publish the results of their research, their scientific findings, thereby waiving the right to subsequent protection by patent, or they steer clear of the academic discussion process in the expectation of a future patent. That is the dilemma facing researchers, scientists and inventors in the European Union. They are forced to choose between contributing to scientific knowledge and obtaining a patent. The problem has been solved in the United States; it has been solved in Japan; it has been solved in many other countries of the world, but not in the European Union. This has fatal consequences. European researchers, scientists and inventors can naturally apply in the United States for patents on what they have developed, on the scientific ideas they have publicised. Of course they can do that, with the result that they will naturally make further investments in the country in which they hold the patents.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the lack of a grace period means that our rules in the European Union both impede innovation and discourage research. What does the grace period mean? It means that a publication by the inventor himself or herself will not prejudice the granting of a patent to the same person. I hasten to add that this does not in any way alter the ‘first to file" principle. Now there are some clever people in the European Union, for example in the Association of the Chemical Industry, who tell us that this is all a matter of legal uncertainty. The Americans, the Japanese, the Canadians and many other peoples in this world would rub their eyes in disbelief to see the German Association of the Chemical Industry citing legal uncertainty. They will scarcely share that sentiment.</p>
<p class="contents">Another astonishing thing is that, when Europe negotiated with America in the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) framework on the basis that they were introducing the ‘first to file" principle, so we would introduce the grace period in Europe, the whole of European industry actually agreed with the introduction of the grace period. I know that the Commission, which incidentally held a hearing in October and, to the astonishment of the European public, communicated its conclusions the very next day, has said that it can only look at this in conjunction with the ‘first to file" principle and with the issue of the ‘first to invent" principle, which, as you may know, plays a major role in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is sure: the Americans will never deviate from the ‘first to invent" principle. This being the case, we Europeans are effectively left with the sole option of doing the sensible thing, of acting in our own best interests at long last by introducing the grace period. Now it is not my job to make recommendations to the other political parties. I shall not make any recommendations to the PPE or the Liberals; they may possibly reject all of this. That may well be. I merely wish to point out one thing: the position that the PPE seems to have adopted and the position that the Liberals seem to have adopted will both have to be abandoned. They will not be able to assert their positions. They will lose this argument.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, of course, not entirely unaccustomed to having to wait until the second round before winning the day, but however Parliament may decide on this initiative, I know that we – my group – will succeed with it in the end; that is quite certain. We shall organise an international congress on this topic with the best people, and then we shall probably be able to tell the Commission how the world sees this question instead of merely presenting the narrow viewpoint of the Association of the Chemical Industry in Germany. My recommendation would be this: if I were the PPE or the Liberal Group, I should be somewhat more cautious. It is always difficult to have to give up a position that has become unsustainable because it is hostile to research, because it impedes innovation and because it has nothing to do with the international harmonisation of patent law. This position is untenable. You will have to give up this position, and so will the Commission. You will abandon it!</p>
<p class="contents">It would perhaps be wiser to line up on the side of common sense from the outset. So whatever the result tomorrow, whether we secure 314 votes or not, it will be of no consequence at all. If my group had not taken this initiative, the whole issue would not have arisen. The Commission, of course, would have preferred to keep the lid on this issue and not to have it discussed in connection with the Community patent. That is what the Commission would have liked best. The only problem is that we have now put it on the agenda. We shall talk about it, and whatever the outcome of tomorrow's vote, the prospect of failing to secure the necessary majority does not perturb me. We shall conduct the real discussion in connection with the Community patent, and we shall ultimately win this debate and thereby strengthen the European Union as a location for research and industry. It continually puzzles me, when Europe's standing as a business location is being ruined by such anti‐investment and anti‐research instruments, how anyone can still wonder why the jobs are all being created elsewhere. That is why I am convinced that common sense will prevail in the end.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oddy </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur who is one of the most imaginative Members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights. He was the first person to pilot an own‐initiative report through Parliament on motor insurance which led to the Commission producing legislation. Yet again Mr Rothley has been imaginative on the subject of inventions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the European Union does not suffer competitive disadvantage, vis‐à‐vis other parts of the world, as far as our engineering skills are concerned. Patents are an important plank of legal rights to encourage inventions. Creativity is the engine of productivity in the European Union. Engineering is important in my constituency so I particularly appreciate the importance of patents and inventions. To cite just two examples: in my constituency Frank Whittle invented the jet engine and James Brindley invented the safety gears on bicycles.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is important as a proposal because it would allow researchers a year to publish before the need to file for a patent. This would help researchers to publicise their work and would follow the example of the United States and Japan. We need to make the European Union as competitive as possible. We need to have a strong manufacturing base and patents are an important part of developing the industrial output of the European Union.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Añoveros Trias de Bes </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, the legislative initiative before us today is based on the second paragraph of Article 138b of the EC Treaty and on Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure. As the rapporteur has explained, its purpose is to introduce a one‐year grace period into legislation on patents. During this period the inventor may file for a patent without suffering adversely from prior publication of the invention. This therefore amounts to setting up a system similar to that which already exists in the United States and in Japan, where the grace period is six months.</p>
<p class="contents">The attempts by the WIPO to introduce such a grace period have so far proved unsuccessful. The main reason for this has been the failure to resolve the issue of who has the right to the patent. In the United States it is the inventor, but in Europe it is whoever files for it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have a great regard for my colleague Mr Rothley, as he knows. I truly believe that he is a great parliamentarian and a fine lawyer. Nevertheless, I do have to say that, in this case, I am completely opposed to what his report proposes. He has referred to the need for prudence. I am not sure whether it is more or less prudent to request a grace period than not to do so. My speech could in a sense be redundant, as Mr Rothley has already referred to the arguments I intend to adduce. He has anticipated what I have to say by presenting the arguments against such a request, and I can but wonder why. As we see it – Mr Rothley said so and I shall therefore repeat the point – the grace period results in a high degree of legal uncertainty and also in financial uncertainty for those responsible for the invention to which the patent relates. This is undeniable and, as Mr Rothley also pointed out, industry would clearly not be able to bear the costs of the uncertainty resulting from such a grace period.</p>
<p class="contents">What is called for is a detailed study to establish the actual effect of the existing discrepancies between European and United States legislation, yet no such study has been undertaken. We must remember that the grace period currently provided for in the United States is the consequence of a risk capital system that differs greatly from that which exists within the European Union. It would therefore be inappropriate to provide for such a period within the Union, as it would not take account of the specific nature of our current financial system.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be borne in mind that in October 1988, the Commission organised a public hearing attended by representatives of the sectors concerned. The conclusion of this hearing was that for any initiative linked to the introduction of a grace period to be successful, it would have to take account of globalisation. Consequently, it would have to operate within the framework of a regulatory authority.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not therefore agree that Article 138b of the Treaty can serve as the legal basis for this proposal. We believe that it is expecting too much of the Commission to ask it to take a legislative initiative of this magnitude. We do not consider that it would be prudent to do so, and Mr Rothley himself referred to the need for prudence. My colleague stated that the real debate will take place in the context of the patent and he is quite right. If that debate takes place, then a grace period is not required and could in fact prove counter‐productive.</p>

As the rapporteur has pointed out, it would be advantageous in some cases, for instance scientific research and small businesses which are unfamiliar with the procedures. However, when we talk about the EU lagging behind in the number of inventions per head, this only applies at EU level. In my view, we should also be investigating the differences that exist between the Member States, since here the picture is not nearly as clear as the rapporteur is saying.</p>
<p class="contents">The disadvantages that have been mentioned include uncertainty about the law and legal procedures, and the possibility that European businesses may end up in a worse situation than their American counterparts.</p>
<p class="contents">We Liberals believe that the matter should be looked at in conjunction with some of the trade wars that are currently taking place between Europe and the USA. Clearly, what is at issue is intangible property; I have in mind the UMTS dispute in this respect. We were evidently very close to a settlement some years ago, when it would have been better to have had ‘first to file" rather than ‘first to invent" as a general, worldwide principle. We should also have made provision for a grace period.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not now give up the chance of bringing these two principles together through the unilateral introduction of a grace period. It is plain that the rapporteur, with this initiative, has goaded the Commission into action. I think we can see this in the Commission's last communication on Community patents, in which it specifically points to the need for some kind of interim arrangement for an enquiry to take place, whereby it is registered that something has been invented. Such a clear boundary is considerably better. Consequently, the Liberals are opposed to a formal initiative. Nevertheless, we are in favour of further investigations and of the EU holding to this course in the forthcoming trade policy negotiations. We have reached this decision bearing in mind the current state of relations between the trading blocs.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ullmann </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, there may be different views, or even very different views, about whether it was wise to abandon the European tradition of patent law in favour of adaptation to the US system. But what quite certainly cannot be done, and I believe the rapporteur is absolutely right here, is to refuse to accept the consequences of the decision after it has been taken. Adopting the US patentability criteria without taking the logical next step of introducing the grace period, which has long been in force in the United States, would mean placing European research at a blatantly unfair disadvantage. It would rob European researchers of the advantages that adaptation was supposed to bring, and would only result in their being compelled to publicise their work and apply for their patents in the United States. Going it alone at a national level is clearly not an option in this case, and it is equally clear that we need to adapt our rules to those laid down in the Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose behind the objections to the grace period that have recently been raised by the chemical industry is to ensure that scientists safeguard the industry's interests by keeping their discoveries secret. I believe it is the duty of this House to defend scientific freedom and the right of scientists to control their own intellectual property, which is why I ask the House to support the rapporteur's initiative as emphatically as it can. I should also like to convey my special thanks to the rapporteur for having taken this initiative.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gebhardt </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is indeed an astonishing fact that our global players sometimes perform like teams in the lower reaches of the Third Division! Here we have international groups and their industrial lobby actually trying to dissuade us from including a grace period in the patent laws. And the groups of companies that are trying to dissuade us from affording protection to inventors are the very ones that are coping very comfortably with such provisions in other parts of the world, such as the United States or Japan. Unlike the lobby, which condemns the grace period as hostile to research and a barrier to investment, I share the view of the rapporteur that European patent law cannot go on operating without the speedy introduction of a grace period. It nurtures research and protects small and medium‐sized businesses, to which the European Parliament is very committed, and with good reason, since these businesses create jobs that are urgently needed and are the channels through which the technologies of the future are introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">The ideas of young researchers at universities and research institutes provide the vital spark. They must be able to discuss and publicise their innovations without jeopardising their right to apply for a potentially profitable patent. Large companies can afford to conduct research behind closed doors and to keep new developments under wraps until the time is right to profit from them in the market‐place. Researchers at universities, on the other hand, must be able to publish their findings in order to establish and confirm their academic credentials. The usefulness of the grace period can be seen in the United States. That is where the most frequently cited researchers live, in a country with an enviable wealth of innovative small businesses. If we want to compete with them, Europe will have to wake up – not gradually but as quickly as possible – whether or not it suits the large industrial groups.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bonino, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the question of introducing a grace period for innovations in national patent laws is a delicate and, in several respects, important aspect of the current debate on the reform of the patent system in Europe, as implied by the rapporteur himself. For this reason, the Commission is grateful to the House, and in particular the rapporteur, for having taken this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Having heard a number of speakers refer to the US and Japanese systems, I feel I must point out that, although US legislation does indeed establish the principle of a grace period, this must be understood in the light of one specific feature of the American law, namely that it operates according to the ‘first to invent' principle, whereas the European legislation operates on a different basis: the ‘first to file'. Whether we like it or not, any comparison with other systems must in my opinion acknowledge the different starting‐points and rules on implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as has already been said, the Commission held an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> hearing of interested parties on 5 October 1998. The Commission does not take decisions single‐handedly: the hearing was attended by 150 people representing all the relevant circles, and perhaps I should list them for your information. They included large, small and medium‐sized enterprises, associations of inventors and researchers, national, European and international representative bodies, patent consultants, national and European patent offices, international institutions, Member States and international experts.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps all these persons were mistaken; the fact remains that one initial, important conclusion can be drawn following this hearing: a legislative initiative concerning the grace period can be envisaged only at international level, through the World Intellectual Property Organisation. It emerged plainly that a unilateral European measure would not produce the desired result.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, according to the overwhelming majority of those attending the hearing, a grace period increases legal uncertainty by abandoning the principle of absolute novelty in favour of relative novelty. The grace period seems in fact to be regarded as an inadequate response to genuine problems, such as the complexity of the procedure for filing applications, the lack of relevant information and the need to disclose one's inventions before filing for a patent.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the hearing on 5 October brought to light certain solutions which the Commission has undertaken to explore; moreover, it made such an undertaking in the communication on the future of patents in Europe, which was adopted in February.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, as regards the complexity of the procedure for filing patent applications, the Commission has undertaken to investigate the idea of filing an application provisionally, on the basis of simplified formalities and without payment of a fee. Our consideration of such matters will be completed by the end of 1999. Further, to meet the specific needs of inventors and SMEs, who need to disclose their inventions before filing for a patent, the Commission has undertaken to re‐examine two exceptions to the principle of absolute novelty, which currently applies under European law: manifestly unlawful use to the disadvantage of the applicant, and presentation of the invention at international exhibitions.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has to say concerning the motion for a resolution that it cannot accede to the request to propose a Parliament and Council directive based on Article 100a of the Treaty. The Commission can, however, accept the amendment put forward by Mrs Palacio, calling on it to continue its deliberations, taking into account the conclusions of the hearing to which I have just referred.</p>
