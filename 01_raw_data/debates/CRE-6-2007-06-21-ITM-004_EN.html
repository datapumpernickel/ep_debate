<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Meglena Kuneva, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, on behalf of Commissioner McCreevy, I would like to thank warmly the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Fruteau, for his excellent work in preparing the report on the review of the remedies directive in the area of public procurement. Before listening to Members’ remarks, I should like to congratulate Mr Fruteau on his election to the French Parliament. I wish him all the best in this new challenge, and I am sure he will continue to fight for European values from a different perspective. I also want to pay tribute to the committee chairman, the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for the way in which they conducted the negotiations between our three institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Public procurement is a cornerstone of the internal market and accounts for about 16% of EU GDP. It is therefore crucial that public procurement markets be open and transparent, guaranteeing fair competition between bidders from different Member States. Only this will lead to the best value for money for public authorities in terms of procurement. Let me underline that the ultimate beneficiaries of this are the European citizens and taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">European public procurement rules contribute to more open, transparent and competitive procurement markets. With the rules in place, we now need to make sure that they are respected. The Commission has identified situations where rejected bidders in a public procurement procedure encounter difficulties in seeking legal redress. This is especially the case when the public contract has already been concluded. In such situations a rejected bidder very often cannot reverse the decision, even if he is in the right.</p>
<p class="contents">The new directive aims to remedy this in two ways. First, by imposing a mandatory 10-day standstill period between the communication of the award decision and the conclusion of the public contract. Second, by introducing a new mechanism which enables a national court to declare public contracts ‘ineffective’. Ineffectiveness implies that the contract is null and void. Ineffectiveness is the proposed sanction for contracts which have been illegally awarded to a single supplier without prior transparency and competitive tendering. Ineffectiveness is also the proposed sanction where the 10-day standstill period has not been respected and the tenderer’s chances of obtaining the contract have been adversely affected.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that by strengthening national review procedures in this manner, business will have stronger incentives to bid for contracts anywhere in the EU. Adoption of the proposed directive should, therefore, have a major impact, stimulating a further opening-up of the public procurement markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I draw your attention to the fact that the compromise contains an obligation that Member States report to the Commission on the specific decisions of national review bodies which are based on the directive. This obligation has been included in the text at the request of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. The Commission wishes to underline the principle of loyal cooperation which Member States have to observe in fulfilling this obligation. A statement along these lines will be added to the minutes of the Council meeting at which the proposed directive is adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The report adopted last May by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, under the leadership of Mr Fruteau, has played a very important role in the negotiations. The compromise that is now on the table as Amendment 86 seeks to meet the objectives of the committee and, in particular, its call for a strengthening of national review procedures in the area of public procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude that European companies today need open public procurement markets. Effective procedures for seeking redress are essential to make sure that public contracts ultimately go to the company that has made the best offer. This will help to build confidence among businesses and citizens that public procurement procedures are fair and correctly implemented. This new directive constitutes another major step towards more competition in our European single market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jean-Claude Fruteau (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the completion and proper operation of our internal market now require that we give economic operators the capacity to conduct their business across the Union. With this in mind, European companies need to be sure that if problems arise, they will have a legislative framework that will enable them to protect their interests.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of public contracts, they must have a guarantee that they will have effective recourse if they consider that their rights have been violated in the process of awarding these contracts. There are already a series of provisions in the national legal systems along these lines. However, the absence of coordinated rules relating to the deadlines for pre-contractual reviews has contributed to allowing a race to sign contracts to unfold, which prevents any objection from being raised against the procedures used once the contract has been signed.</p>
<p class="contents">The desire to resolve this problem is the main objective of the text on which the European Parliament is now being asked to reach a decision in plenary, which is the result of a compromise reached with the European Commission and the Council. In this respect I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and the various political groups for their excellent cooperation, in a spirit of openness and dialogue. I would also, of course, like to thank the representatives of the Commission and of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council for their availability, expertise and desire to succeed, which made it possible to reach an agreement at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">The final text confirms the general focus of the reform around two main aims: firstly, to preserve the opportunity for candidates to seek a review by providing for the timely postponement of the contract; secondly, to establish a set of adequate penalties, which are essential for preventing violations.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve the first objective, Parliament, the Commission and the Council propose to establish a minimum standstill period of ten days, fifteen days in some cases, between the decision to award the contract and the signature of the contract, to allow candidates that consider their interests to have been damaged time to seek a review. In order to take into account the realities on the ground, this minimum period shall not apply to a series of situations, particularly in very urgent cases. The specific situations associated with framework agreements will also be exempted from this standstill period, subject to particularly exemplary penalties if irregularities are discovered.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major focus of the draft reform concerns the penalties for violation of the rules. On this issue, the compromise reached with the Council and the Commission fully takes up the desire expressed by Parliament to have a set of penalties that are both severe and also adapted to the realities faced by local authorities. Therefore serious violations of the rules will result in the contract being considered ineffective, creating a deterrent for the awarding authorities. These cases include illegal direct awarding of contracts, which the Court of Justice has deemed to be the most serious violation of the rules applying to public contracts. Also affected are violations of the rules regarding framework agreements, and violations that damage tenderers’ chances of winning the contract.</p>
<p class="contents">It will not, however, be compulsory for contracts to be considered ineffective in cases of minor breaches, for which the draft reform allows the possibility of applying other, less drastic penalties. It shall also be possible to be exempted from the rule of ineffectiveness of contracts if imperative public-interest reasons require that the contracts remain effective, subject, of course, to safeguards that Parliament wanted and secured.</p>
<p class="contents">Based around these two objectives, the draft reform submitted to you for the vote is a balanced text that gained the support of representatives of Parliament and of the Commission and the Council. It was finalised under a tight schedule, and offers a series of guarantees that are necessary for economic operators that are candidates for public contracts, without placing excessive constraints on the awarding bodies. If it is adopted today it will enable Europe to take a new step along the path towards harmonising the rules governing its internal market. It will also help to give the Union effective tools to make the practices involved in awarding public contracts more ethical, by reducing the risks of fraud and corruption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs, I have examined the subject in great detail, and held a hearing in my constituency. As a result, in my report I called for a standard period of 14 calendar days from the announcement. I believe that a simple and standard deadline is imperative for the sake of small and medium-sized companies. The opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has confirmed this view. The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted my proposal unanimously. Unfortunately, despite the enhanced cooperation, the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs has been ignored. So let me stress once again that this type of increased cooperation is not serving the intended purpose. We would be well advised to create clearer relationships in the current discussions on reform and enhancing cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally feel that the compromise on deadlines is still too complicated for SMEs. The distinction made between postal and electronic notification is unnecessary in my opinion. What is positive is that Mr Fruteau and the shadow rapporteur have agreed to a standard deadline and have removed the references to calendar days and working days, thereby eliminating the confusion generated by the periods given in the original Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">On balance, I will be voting in favour of the compromise, which is the result of much discussion and a massive effort on the part of all rapporteurs, the Commission and the Council Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can assure you that when we voted in the trilogue, we did try to take the interests of the various committees into account. There were, however, clear positions in the Council that unfortunately we were unable to reconcile with all of Parliament's views.</p>
<p class="contents">We have reached an agreement in the first reading. This is always portrayed as being constitutionally tricky, but I do not think that this compromise is an over-hasty or inappropriate solution. I therefore hope that you will be able to vote in favour of this compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">We have moved one step closer to legislation based on transposing Court of Justice case law from the rulings on Alcatel and Halle city, and also on the Commission's statement that illegal direct contracts constitute a major problem in the internal market. We in the European Parliament have endorsed this reasoning, but have also made it clear – among other things last Tuesday in the debate on Arlene McCarthy's report – that Parliament feels that cases can no longer be considered in terms of economic factors alone. Instead, we want to see clearer, more reliable data backing up claims in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the main advantages of this new, revised directive are the fact that the public procurement process will now be more transparent for bidders, who will also have better opportunities for legal redress if they are not happy with an award decision. Given that 16% of total internal market GDP falls under public procurement legislation, it will represent a great step forward if the authorities awarding the contracts really comply with the letter and spirit of the contract.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time as making it clear that illegally awarded contracts are invalid, we also stressed that nepotism has no place in the European Union and that anyone who fails to follow the rules cannot expect their contracts to be upheld. I believe that this marks another major step towards creating a genuine single market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly I am very pleased that Mr Fruteau's excellent work has borne fruit. We should be very grateful that we have him.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to express my sadness that Mr Fruteau's election to the French Parliament means that we will be losing a valuable fellow Member. Mr Fruteau, I am sorry that you will soon be leaving our ranks. It is always sad when we lose talented MEPs.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I should begin by responding to Mr Mayer's comments on the hotly-debated standstill period. The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and Mr Fruteau have both sought to establish simple rules. There was just one small difference: you wanted 14 days, and Mr Fruteau favoured 12. But those two days were not the real problem. The problem was that the Council really did not want a simple solution, so we were banging our heads against a brick wall. We in the Committee on Internal Market would also have liked a simpler solution than that which is being put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">When the directive is transposed, I do not want to hear ministers from any Member State saying that it is too bureaucratic and blaming Brussels. It is the ministers themselves who are responsible: Brussels and Strasbourg wanted something very different. The ministers should take responsibility for their decision.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to the very heated discussion between Parliament and the Council of Ministers on the scope of exemptions, and how far we could extend the potential for exemptions in the name of public interest. We in Parliament have a more rigorous view on this than the Council, because this directive is clearly intended to improve the effectiveness of the public procurement review procedure, notably in those cases which already run counter to existing laws. So it is not a case of changing the Member States' directives on public procurement, but rather a question of deciding what sanctions could be applied in this area. We should not confuse the two. Today's plenary discussion has not made that mistake, but it does occasionally creep into the public debate. We should re-emphasise the fact that we are trying to define sanctions for when contracts are awarded illegally. Reality justifies this strict approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish him all the very best in his future work in the French <span class="italic">Assemblée Nationale</span>. I know you had to produce this report in the midst of the electoral campaign, which was no mean feat. So thank you very much.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased that Parliament and the Council were able to agree on the key elements during the trilogue. It is important that we establish the same binding conditions in all Member States of the European Union. I would like to pick up on a few points that I consider particularly important.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point has already been addressed: the length of the standstill period before contracts are concluded. I am glad to hear that there is agreement, but I do think that the ten-day period with an additional five days for postage is pretty short. I would also have liked companies to have been given more time to review the award decision. Companies that do not have a legal department – which are mostly small and medium-sized companies – always find it very difficult and time-consuming to examine a decision to award a contract. I fully agree with Mrs Gebhardt: this is the Council's doing, not Parliament's.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I am very pleased that we have agreed to introduce a declaration of ineffectiveness to penalise illegal direct contracts. What is particularly important here is that exemptions on the grounds of public interest should only be authorised for very specific reasons. For example, exemptions justified by public interest are usually only valid if the reasons go beyond purely economic interests. If a Member State chooses to cite economic grounds, the Commission has to be notified. Some Member States are concerned that this will lay the foundations for future infringement proceedings, but it will have quite the opposite effect. As the Council has always emphasised, exemptions are only granted in exceptional circumstances, in which the economic considerations for both contracting parties are so great that it is reasonable to waive the ineffectiveness penalty. Notification is only required in these rare cases. The Member States should be expected to comply with these rules so that the Commission can ensure a uniform application of the directive's provisions throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Better legislation also entails uniform implementation, and ensuring that the Commission has a clear view of whether this is really happening. This is one of the principles of fairness and is essential for improving the functioning of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I finish, I would like to thank Mr Fruteau, Mrs Rühle, Mr Schwab and Mr Zillmann again. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the group's assistants and the MEPs who have worked so hard to produce a solid text. I would however be grateful if, in future, this kind of debate could be held in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, he is responsible for our being able to approve a directive on first reading, a directive that seeks to improve legal certainty in the area of public procurement. This will benefit local authorities and private contractors alike. We hope that it will benefit small companies in particular, as they cannot afford big legal departments.</p>
<p class="contents">We particularly welcome the fact that the rapporteur insisted from the outset that the directive should be strictly limited to EU directives, with no extended scope. In order to allow all bidders to examine the contract award, a standstill period of at least 10 days has been included. I should say that I too would have preferred a longer period, but my priority was reaching a compromise in the first reading so as to increase legal certainty. Member States do have the option, however, to extend the period if they so wish.</p>
<p class="contents">Contracts that are concluded illegally during the standstill period shall be declared ineffective unless there are overriding reasons relating to a non-economic public interest. Ineffectiveness will be determined by an independent court. This was another of our priorities, and we fully supported the rapporteur on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">The public contracting body's duty of information has been clearly defined in order to increase transparency in public procurement and to reduce the risk of illegal practices and corruption. On balance, we have found a good and viable compromise that will improve legislation in Europe. Our group will therefore be supporting the report in its entirety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to state that our group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left will vote in favour of the report as a whole. I also wish, of course, to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur for the fact that we have now obtained a better report.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a very great deal of respect for the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur, who have elucidated all the legal concepts that people are required to understand if they are to familiarise themselves with these regulations. As an elected representative, I must in any case acknowledge for my own part that it is sometimes hard, if not impossible, to find one’s way through the legal text. Our political decisions in this House need to be crystal-clear and comprehensible in every respect to those who have to assume political responsibility for the decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I also find it difficult to understand why political decisions actually have to be taken on this issue. Matters should operate in such a way that we elected parliamentary representatives decide what it is we want to achieve through our political decisions. It is then the task of the legal experts to assume responsibility for designing the legal rules and to do so in accordance with what was specified in the political decision and with what we are aiming to achieve through our decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are no doubt all agreed that procurement rules should be fair and should guarantee equal treatment. In the proposal for a directive, the justification talks, for example, about its being particularly important for small economies and small companies that there be an efficient, competitive and properly functioning public procurement market. That is certainly true, but I wonder how many small companies really have the ability to assimilate all the legal wording. They need, of course, to be quite certain that they understand the regulations fully so as not subsequently to be exposed to accusations and to be held responsible for incorrect procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that, in the future, we need to reflect more on the fact that procurement is not only about finance. Rather, we must have a form of procurement that can also take account of the fact that we are reducing the amount of transportation and the harmful effects on the climate that we do in fact have when we have public procurement involving 27 Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">În acest context general, iniţiativele care au ca obiectiv îmbunătăţirea modului de derulare a uneia dintre activităţile economice importante, cea a achiziţiilor publice, nu poate fi decât una salutară. De aceea, demersul Parlamentului şi al Consiliului de a propune adoptarea acestei directive este pe deplin justificat, deoarece a rezultat dintr-o necesitate reală: aceea că actualele norme nu creează cadrul legal suficient care să permită promovarea în condiţii de eficienţă a recursului în cazurile de nerespectare a prevederilor comunitare în materie de achiziţii publice. La această concluzie s-a ajuns şi în urma consultării unor operatori economici din mai multe state membre, care, cu această ocazie, au confirmat faptul că actualele proceduri naţionale de recurs nu permit întotdeauna o corecţie suficientă a cazurilor de nerespectare a prevederilor comunitare în materie.</p>
<p class="contents">Prin textul final al directivei, majoritatea acestor lacune sunt corectate, iar aplicarea acesteia va avea efecte benefice în toate situaţiile, dar mai ales în cazurile de atribuire, prin înţelegerea părţilor, a contractelor de achiziţii, practică ilegală, care se înregistrează în mai toate statele Uniunii, dar pentru a cărei stopare, până în prezent, nu au fost adoptate soluţii eficiente. Efecte benefice se vor înregistra şi în ţările nou-aderate precum România, unde prevederile legale în materie sunt încă destul de permisive, situaţie care poate facilita atribuirea oneroasă a contractelor de achiziţii publice.</p>

When we started this, we did not expect that so much detailed work would be needed in the Council, and he has led that process very effectively, which I am sure will stand him in good stead when he goes to the French Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just a few observations about the importance of this directive, building on what a number of colleagues, including my fellow coordinator, Mrs Gebhardt, have said about the importance of the Commission carefully monitoring the transposition and implementation of this directive. It is, I think, unnecessarily complex, but that is what the Member States wanted.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we have to ensure that companies are able to exercise their rights under the directive in a simple way, and those who consider that practices have been wrong are able to avail themselves of the declaration of ineffectiveness of the contract. As the directive points out, this is by far the most effective remedy, and that is what will sustain competition in public procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">As they do characteristically, the Member States have also carved out for themselves the possibility, under certainly carefully defined circumstances, not to apply the suspension procedures. However, it is extremely important that the Member States use this right very sparingly and, therefore, I ask the Commission to ensure that it is properly monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point on which I particularly want to thank Mr Fruteau for his cooperation concerns framework contracts, which constitute a new element brought in by the reform of the directives undertaken by this committee in 2003. These framework contracts do not need the full weight of some of these suspensive procedures in the award of contracts, as a result of a framework, to smaller businesses which are effectively pre-approved to be able to benefit from these contracts. We have reached the right balance here and I thank the rapporteur very much for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, this is a worthwhile reform, but it will need continual vigilance by the Commission, with support from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, to ensure that it is really effective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This proposal also establishes effective measures for combating the illegal direct awarding of contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion with the Council was based on the excellent report by Mr Fruteau, mainly on the issue of penalties to void contracts that have been awarded in violation of the standstill period, which we achieved at the end of the trilogue. The Member States therefore have the opportunity to establish substitution penalties for violations of the standstill period, and this proposal has our support. It is a good compromise. The ineffectiveness penalty for violations and the possibility of applying other penalties, and therefore of leaving some room to manoeuvre for the national courts in the event of violation of the standstill period, is a good formula, and we approve it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In closing, let me stress a few key points. First, we cannot establish a truly open and competitive market for public procurement without effective remedies for businesses seeking redress. Second, this is crucial to making sure that public contracts ultimately go to the company which has made the best offer. Third, we really need to further reassure businesses, public administration and citizens that public procurement procedures are fair.</p>
<p class="contents">Later today, Parliament has the opportunity to endorse a proposal which reflects the views it has already expressed in the report by its lead committee. On behalf of Commissioner McCreevy, I would again like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Fruteau, and Parliament for the importance they have attached to the subject and to stress that Parliament’s vote is a historic occasion to contribute to fair and more competitive public procurement in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
