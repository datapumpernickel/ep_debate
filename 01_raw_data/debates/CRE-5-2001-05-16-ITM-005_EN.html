The visit to Ankara from 30 April to 1 May by members of the EU-Turkey<span class="bold"> </span>Joint Parliamentary Committee showed that the European Parliament has an important role to play. The Council, the Commission and Parliament should continue their joint efforts to stimulate the Turkish government into continued political reform in order to meet the Copenhagen Criteria and take measures to bring the hunger strikes to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council deeply regrets the fact that these hunger strikes in various prisons across Turkey continue to lead to the loss of human life. This is a major human tragedy. Therefore, the Council has pressed the Turkish authorities to take suitable steps to avoid further deaths. We have also encouraged Turkey to make changes to the law and take concrete action to follow the recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture. Discussions with the Turkish government are ongoing, particularly within the framework of our deeper political dialogue. Meetings took place in Stockholm on 14 March and in Brussels on 26 April. The coming Association Council with Turkey on 26 June will also cover human rights issues. In addition to these contacts, a dialogue is underway with the Turkish government through the local representatives of the Presidency and Member State representations in Ankara.</p>
<p class="contents">Meetings have been held with the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Justice, with the prison situation high on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council notes with satisfaction that the Turkish government decided at an early stage to co-operate with the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, which has visited Turkey three times so far due to the current situation and the hunger strikes. Changes to legislation have entered into force, or will do so shortly, aimed at reducing the isolation of prisoners. It is necessary for these reforms to be generously and correctly applied in practice, in accordance with the recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council strongly hopes that these measures now being carried out by the Turkish government will bring the hunger strikes to an end. In this confusing situation, it also feels necessary to appeal to the hunger strikers and their families to react so that no human life is lost. The Council will continue to monitor the development carefully in dialogue with the Turkish government and voluntary organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Council would point out that the Accession Partnership for Turkey, which was adopted by the Council in March, contains prison reforms as a priority area which Turkey needs to address to meet the political Copenhagen Criteria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliamentary representatives, the presidency and the Commission have all endeavoured over recent weeks to resolve this serious humanitarian problem. The forthcoming visit of the prisons by a delegation from the European Parliament will give new impetus to the reform of the criminal justice system in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission deeply regrets that 22 people have already died during the hunger strike in Turkey, while many others are suffering terribly. Their condition is worsening day by day. Many will be staring death in the face if no way is found of ending this hunger strike.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from where the organisers stand politically, the Commission feels that the current situation gives serious cause for concern on humanitarian grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Turkish prisons was one of the main topics of conversation between me and the Turkish foreign minister in Brussels yesterday morning. It was clear from what was said that the Turkish government feels that action is needed in order to avoid more deaths. In this respect, the Commission welcomes the fact that the Turkish parliament has already passed an amendment to Article 16 of the Turkish anti-terrorist law. The main point of this new regulation is that it allows prisoners to take part in social activities while serving their sentence. We must call on Turkey today to ensure that the new regulation is implemented as quickly as possible, so that the conditions of detention in the prisons actually improve.</p>
<p class="contents">The Turkish foreign minister also informed me that two other bills are being drafted which will guarantee that sentences are properly executed. One of these two laws makes provision for a new penal monitoring committee made up of representatives from Turkish NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">The second law requires that a judge oversee the execution of sentences. Both laws have already been adopted by the committee on legal affairs of the Turkish parliament and are due to be debated in the Turkish national assembly very soon. I should like to stress that the Commission attaches great importance to further judicial and penal reform. The Commission supports the recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, as we set out quite clearly in the accession partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Turkish prisons was a cause of concern to the Commission even before the unrest broke out and the hunger strike began. The Commission repeats the call it made to the Turkish government on 21 March 2001, i.e. that it take all appropriate measures to prevent further deaths. Suitable medical care must also be provided. The Turkish government and Parliament should continue to work together to speed up the reform of the criminal justice system in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect human rights to be respected everywhere in any country wanting to become a member of the European Union, including in its prisons.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also urges the organisers of the hunger strike to distance themselves immediately from any action or demands which might lead to further loss of life. Those who have taken it upon themselves to represent the interests of detainees should prove first and foremost that they no longer intend to risk the lives or welfare of the detainees.</p>
<p class="contents">In every situation, care must be taken to avoid endangering human life or health for reasons of political expediency. The Commission is certain that further loss of life can be prevented and that the conditions of detention in Turkish prisons can be improved if everyone involved, including the organisers of the hunger strike, acts with restraint and a sense of responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation is highly critical and, as the President of the Council pointed out, it has already cost 22 lives and may cost many more. At the same time our Parliament does not want to intervene too hastily. Several initiatives, from different sides, have been taken with a view to resolving the situation: by the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Presidency of the Council and the European Commission, as Mr Verheugen pointed out, and, on a personal basis, by the chairman of our parliamentary delegation that visited Ankara and met all the actors involved in this singular conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective is to support these initiatives; we do not want to interfere to no purpose but to demonstrate the European Parliament's enduring interest and vigilance in relation to human rights and everything that concerns our Turkish partner. Turkey has been going through difficult times since the beginning of this year. The very serious financial crisis put paid to some extent to the economic recovery plan that was already under way. The European Union is supporting and underpinning the IMF action to promote the implementation of the vigorous measures that Minister Kemal Dervi� resolutely adopted. At the end of the summer we will have an opportunity to look at the results of this policy and to evaluate the national programme to adapt the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>, which the Ankara government recently adopted. Over the same period of time, however, the Turkish prisons have been the scene of riots that were suppressed by particularly bloody means, followed by hunger strikes that turned into death fasts.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that this creates an extremely difficult situation for the Turkish authorities. The leaders of the movement belong to fanatical extremist organisations that do not hesitate to play with the lives of their militants, or even their families, for political propaganda purposes. Oddly enough, this movement sprang up when the prisoners concerned were about to be moved from the overcrowded prisons into which they were crammed under shameful conditions into modern prisons that complied with the Council of Europe's recommendations. During the 1970s and 1980s, similar events occurred in our own democracies, although on a lesser scale. While we do not underestimate the difficulties we do, therefore, emphasise the importance of rapidly finding a solution to the humanitarian aspect of the crisis, to bring an end to the daily deaths, without giving in to what is plainly an unacceptable form of political blackmail.</p>
<p class="contents">A delegation from our Parliament will be visiting the Turkish prisons in early June to try to evaluate the situation on the ground objectively and make recommendations on a longer-term prison policy. It is very much to be hoped that this humanitarian problem can be settled in the meantime. As Mr Verheugen said, this could be helped by speeding up the modernisation of the Turkish penal code and penitentiary code as also by adopting measures to calm down the situation in the new prisons. At the same time, I am convinced that these would be regarded as a significant expression of Turkey’s resolve to move closer to the European model. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has economic problems which people are trying to resolve – and good luck to them – and we in the European Union shall support the reforms. To all intents and purposes, Turkey is still both unwilling and unable to reform the political system – as the president of the republic and the military have both pointed out. Hardly any progress whatsoever has been made on the so-called Kurdish question, i.e. the question of minorities, and the situation in the prisons is horrendous. You would think that a government with so many problems would at least try to resolve the most pressing and urgent problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I recently made a short visit to Turkey with Mr Cohn-Bendit. I personally was only there very briefly, but it was time enough to see that this is a dialogue between two people who are either hard of hearing or stone deaf; I refer to the organisers of the hunger strike on the one hand, who should end or at least suspend the hunger strike, and the Turkish government on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Parliament delegation just announced is to make any sense or have any chance of success, then both sides need to be willing to find a compromise or, at the very least, to stop what they are doing. We all know that reform is needed in the Turkish prisons. But the various proposals made – and this is a mild criticism of the work of the Council of Europe and its anti-torture committee – must not lose sight of the underlying problem. Turkey is a country which, because of its laws, still generates a lot of political prisoners; that is the problem. There are not so many political prisoners because there are so many assassination attempts, there are so many political prisoners because the laws in Turkey make political prisoners out of so many people – and that should be the starting point.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, even where people become prisoners or political prisoners as the result of terrorist activities – which I do not condone but which I cannot deny – solitary confinement must be abolished or at least reduced to what is humanly bearable. The Commissioner announced a series of measures which Turkey intends to implement. I spoke with the Turkish justice minister in January and these issues were already being discussed. But the point with the monitoring system, with Article 16 and with the system of a judge to oversee how sentences are executed in Turkey is, how is all this going to be implemented? The same law can be applied in a humane manner, with due respect for human rights, or it can be applied in a way which tends towards isolation and solitary confinement. I call on Turkey to give us, the European Parliament, and Europe a chance to help it overcome this problem, but Turkey must also show willing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Turkish judicial and penal system is in transition from a regime of retribution and oppression to a more western approach, where prisoners are penalised but not persecuted. The European Union should assist this reform process by supporting financially and also technically certainly carefully selected confidence-building measures, without which the fasting will not cease. These measures include training of judicial officials, prison officers and <span class="italic">gendarmes</span>, ensuring first-class medical services, improving conditions for prison visits and installing the independent scrutiny of the prison system and protecting lawyers.

Prison reforms are the hardest reforms of all to implement, not just in countries like Turkey, but in our own countries as well. We all know that. Prisons are always the Achilles heel, the weak point of a democracy. Even in the highly developed democracies of the European Union, the situation in the prisons is far from rosy, let alone democratic. Applied to Turkey, this means that the situation in the prisons in a country which, culturally speaking, still has to find its democratic feet, is a mirror image of this contradiction in terms. That is why I think it is very important to establish one thing: I do not know if it was the Council or the Commission which said that it called on Turkey to be generous in its application of the law. I think that, legally, this is the wrong approach. The law is one thing and generosity is another. To my mind, what is contradictory about reform in Turkey is that, basically, it leaves reform up to the prison administration, which then has the opportunity to apply it as it sees fit.</p>
<p class="contents">With the situation as it is, this does nothing to inspire confidence in prisoners with painful experiences of the prison administration and the prison guards. That is the problem. How to create trust? Which his why I think – and we established this on our trip – that we need to find a solution quickly because the prisoners have changed their standpoint. They are not making so many incredibly complicated demands. Isolation cells to be opened at once, new arrangements to be made for visits by relatives and lawyers at once, medical attention from doctors of their choice, these are more or less their immediate demands in order to call off the hunger strike.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we call on Turkey, first, to be generous in implementing what is yet to come and to start by opening cells and doors so that the hunger strike can end. Secondly, to instigate a dialogue with the prisoners so as to clarify exactly what they want. It is important to recognise that. Thirdly – and essentially in my view – Turkey must make it clear that it is ready in the dialogue to acknowledge these people as people.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we say to the organisations organising this strike that the decision to end the strike must be taken by the prisoners, not by some party leader or other. That is our demand because it is these people who are risking their lives, not the leaders in Brussels, who still have plenty to eat and drink. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union must stop standing by in silence as more and more people die. The European Parliament must take a decisive stand if it is to be taken seriously as a negotiating partner.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not be indifferent to the massive violations of human rights in Turkish prisons. We must not forget human values. The European Union must insist that human rights are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The Turkish parliament recently passed a law relaxing conditions of solitary confinement. Now prisoners sentenced under the anti-terrorist law are to be allowed to take part in cultural and sporting activities. My criticism of this law is that it does not allow all prisoners to take part in group activities. All prisoners must be treated equally.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot stand by while prisoners are tortured and maltreated in solitary confinement and exposed to the arbitrary treatment of the guards without witnesses. People in solitary confinement are totally cut off from the outside world. And yet everyone needs human contact and interaction. We urgently need to find a way of preventing further deaths. On behalf of the GUE/NGL group, I therefore call on the Turkish government and the prisoners' organisations to reach an agreement through political dialogue. Dialogue will allow a social consensus to be reached, while force will only be answered with force.</p>
<p class="contents">My group cannot regulate Turkey's internal affairs. But we would all like to help put an end to this situation. If Turkey wants to be accepted in the European Union, it must stand up for democratic, humane values in the penal system. Human rights must apply to everyone, including prisoners. My wish is for agreement, for internal peace and for an end to hatred which opens up deep wounds. That is why we must speak out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, that does not apply to the item on the agenda on the situation of Turkish prisoners. Quite rightly the Council, the Commission and Parliament are jointly examining the issue, since the Republic of Turkey after all enjoys the status of a candidate country. In order to actually join, such a candidate must meet the Copenhagen criteria. An important European demand in this connection is that there should be a constitutional state. In view of the continuing serious accusations about the Turkish prison system, this thorny national problem therefore demands European attention. The recent introduction of the new F type prison in Turkey forms an extra complication. It led to a veritable deluge of complaints and even mass hunger strikes. On the basis of my Christian belief I certainly reject the final political weapon of voluntary death by starvation. This view of life, however, also requires a humane treatment of prisoners within a constitutional framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The above considerations lead me to agree wholeheartedly with the institution of an ad hoc delegation of Parliament on the Turkish prison system. As a member of this delegation, I trust we shall receive the full cooperation of the Turkish authorities on our visit at the beginning of June, in the hope that the European Parliament by applying the principle of hearing both sides of the argument can contribute to ending the tragedy of the hunger strikers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There they experience many difficulties. They are badly treated, not only by the management of the prisons, but also by their fellow-prisoners and are scarcely given any protection. Turkey has some 62 million inhabitants, 99% of whom are Muslims and less than half a per cent Christian. The largest group of Christians are citizens belonging to the Armenian Orthodox Church, the Syrian Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church. Then in Western Turkey there are the Greek Orthodox Christians. And although the Turkish constitution respects freedom of religion, courses run by the Armenian and Greek Orthodox churches have been closed on a massive scale, as have the courses of the Syrian Orthodox Church. The Armenian Christian community particularly is constantly subject to new attacks. Not so long ago, a Christian bookshop in Eastern Turkey was besieged by armed soldiers, as a result of which one person was killed and 26 wounded. The only crime was the selling of Bibles. According to the spokesman of the Armenian patriarch in the last few years 40 plots of land belonging to the Christian Armenian church have been confiscated by the Turkish state. Anyone protesting is imprisoned and as a non-Muslim treated badly in the prisons. The Syrian Orthodox Church is treated even more harshly and as a result of the intimidation more than 100 000 Syrian Orthodox citizens have left Southern Turkey, some of them to Western Europe. In the province for which I am politically responsible, there are 9 000 Syrian Orthodox Christians and they have lost over 800 villages in Southern Turkey. Those people who have stayed are intimidated, imprisoned and badly treated.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not an opponent of Turkey’s accession into the European Union, but I must say that if this mistreatment of Christians in Turkey continues, I may yet come out against Turkey’s membership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of the Council, I would like to thank you for this work.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with what Mr Swoboda said about the importance of looking at the political system which produces a prison system of the kind found in Turkey. Of course we have to tackle the practical issues and examine the harsh prison conditions, but we also have to look at the bigger picture: the political system and the economic situation. This is why I, as President-in-Office of the Council, have become involved in supporting the IMF and World Bank’s work to help the Turkish government achieve economic recovery, as we believe that this could also create the basis for advances such as better conditions in Turkish prisons. I therefore look forward to continued close dialogue with Parliament. The Council will continue to present itself very clearly to the Turkish government. The Swedish Presidency, and no doubt the next countries to hold the presidency, will be very clear in their dealings locally with the Turkish government. Hopefully, we will soon achieve concrete results in what is an important issue for us, namely the unacceptable situation in Turkish prisons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
