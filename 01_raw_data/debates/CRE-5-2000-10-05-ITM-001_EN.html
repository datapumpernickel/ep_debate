I first addressed the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities on 11 July and, on 5 September, I made a statement about the monitoring centre for industrial change.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I am here to talk about balanced participation by men and women in all areas of society. The motion for a resolution on the Commission’s reports that you will be voting on later goes into great detail on the subject. I would like to comment on three points highlighted by Mrs Dybkjær, and I commend the quality of her work as rapporteur to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">First, as regards the need for regular assessment and monitoring of equality at every level regarding work, employment, education, training, family life, health, and the dignity of women, we will only be able to make significant progress if we have the most accurate intelligence on every aspect underlying discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point relates to the new information and communication technologies. This emerging sector is opening up greater access to the world of work for women. We must make sure the gaps in this area are reduced. We must make sure women benefit from the new jobs generated, while avoiding reproducing the inequalities that exist in more traditional sectors: less skilled jobs, part-time work (sometimes not by choice), insecure contracts and difficulties put in the way of access to decision-making posts.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, I think the proposal to make implementation of the principle of equal treatment a selection criterion for any Community aid or funding is essential to promoting equality.</p>
<p class="contents">Because equality is a major political issue we are going to use a number of events to give it prominence during the French Presidency. I am primarily here today, of course, to discuss those events.</p>
<p class="contents">We have organised a Ministerial Conference in Paris. It will be held on 27 October. I have naturally invited Mr Rocard, my eminent fellow countryman, the Chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and Mrs Theorin, Chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. We will also be organising a Conference on Professional Equality on 24 November, bringing together experts, social partners and company managers, to look at the obstacles in the career paths of women. I shall not, however, be talking about the Conference on Professional Equality so much as the issues I have put on the agenda for the Ministerial Conference on 27 October.</p>
<p class="contents">Three issues will be tackled, and they are issues also dealt with in the Presidency’s major documents, either in the Fifth Action Programme or the Social Agenda. The three subjects on the agenda for the Ministerial Conference are balanced participation by women and men in decision-making, combining work and family life, and including equality in several structures of the European Union Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">The first issue, women’s participation in decision-making in all areas, shows the serious deficit women still suffer from today in comparison with men. That is a democratic deficit which is less and less tolerated nowadays. Perhaps some of you remember the Paris Conference of April 1999, when we reached agreement on a statement, but, with fifteen Ministers, had great difficulty deciding on a plan of action with quantified targets.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I decided to seize the opportunity afforded by the Presidency’s major documents, this time, to move that action plan forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell you that my country has now marked a crucial milestone as regards women’s participation in decision-making. Very briefly, a reform of the constitution was adopted on 28 June 1999 in France, with the support of the Prime Minister and the President of the Republic, and immediately afterwards we began debating a bill on parity, which was adopted on 3 May 2000. This law will be applied to all elections, including local elections from 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">So, at the risk of seeing their electoral lists invalidated or not having their campaign costs refunded, the political parties must present lists with equal numbers of men and women placed alternately to prevent women being relegated to positions where they have little chance of getting elected.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel sure that balanced participation of women in political decision-making would produce a genuine renewal of our whole political life. Such power sharing will bring with it other profound changes in economic, social and cultural life.</p>
<p class="contents">The Beijing Platform for Action and the final outcome document of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Beijing + 5, last June, are along the same lines. The Finnish Presidency’s report on women and decision-making sets out clear indicators for evaluating the progress made.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to salute the Commission’s initiative – I think my information is correct, Mrs Diamantopoulou – in taking a decision to have parity between men and women within its committees and groups of experts. We must all commit ourselves to following and developing this encouraging initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">The French Presidency would like to make progress in this matter and hopes to approach its partners with proposals for quantified targets for giving women access to decision-making in all areas, the political arena, which I have already mentioned, but also economic and social sectors. Initial consultations undertaken by the French Presidency confirm that this is a central concern in all Member States. I do not mean to imply that we have already reached agreement on the quantified targets, but I can assure you I am putting a good deal of effort into getting that agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue for this Ministerial Conference will cover combining work and family life. Following the example of Finland, a questionnaire has been sent to all the Member States and this will be followed very shortly by a report. A proposal on indicators to measure progress will be put before the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I was hoping to make this issue an important one in the Presidency’s programme so as to ensure continuity of the work done under the Portuguese Presidency. I am thinking of the Evora seminar on maternity and paternity and the resolution on balanced participation by men and women in family life and at work. Because we know that as long as women have to carry the burden of a double working day alone they will continue to face a dilemma between their private and family lives and between their working lives and their lives as citizens. Indeed, as I always say in France, ladies and gentlemen, while a law to impose parity in politics is now within the bounds of possibility, it is more difficult to impose parity in daily life, domestic parity, by law.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as the public arena should not be a male monopoly, the private sphere should no longer be the exclusive domain of women. That is why new methods of organising time must be considered, so that all those involved – parents, children, citizens, elected representatives, businesses – have their proper place. This will be one of the strong points of the Ministerial Conference. Let me add that I have also put this item on the agenda of the Conference on Professional Equality of 24 November.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue for the Ministerial Conference will cover the incorporation of gender equality into the work of the various European Union Councils of Ministers. I hope to initiate a process I have used as a working method in France, a method that works well. For the first time, several Councils of Ministers will be dealing with gender equality by linking it with one of the items on their agenda. To give you a couple of examples: at the Education Council there is the issue of mobility of men and women students and teachers, because we have recognised that there is major inequality in mobility; and at the Internal Market, Consumption and Tourism Council there is an item on the development of electronic commerce so as to make it accessible to all, both men and women, because we know there is gender inequality in electronic commerce too.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the Ministerial Conference and the Conference on Professional Equality, I should also mention two very important documents specifically devoted to equality, but within the area of competence of the Employment and Social Affairs Council. I am thinking of the Fifth Action Programme and the amendment of the 1976 Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Fifth Action Programme, I would first like to wholeheartedly thank Mrs Theorin and the rapporteur, Mrs Eriksson, for their work which will, I hope, make it possible to adopt the programme before the end of the year. I know Parliament will be particularly concerned about mainstreaming and the implementation of strategic objectives relating to equality in economic and social life, and – to return to this point once again – balanced participation in decision-making. For my part, I undertake to ensure that the programme’s funding matches up to our ambitions.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, it falls to us to review the 1976 Directive, 25 years after its adoption. This review will not only bring the law into line with the many rulings from the Court of Justice, but will also incorporate other very important points into Community legislation. I am thinking, for example, of sexual harassment as gender-based discrimination. The notion of indirect discrimination will be more precisely defined and the derogations from equal treatment supported better. This is a particularly important advance for women, as Mrs Hautala is sure to emphasise when she presents her report to Parliament on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Going beyond the specific issues falling within the scope of my ministry, I want to mention three initiatives, very briefly. First of all, the guidelines for employment, this time fleshed out with quantified targets, which propose to increase the employment rate for women to 60% by 2010. The role of the social partners is also strengthened, and I am very pleased about that. Finally, in a word, the fourth pillar devoted to equal opportunities reinforces the integrated approach to equality through gender mainstreaming and through specific guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The second initiative I want to mention relates to the social agenda to be submitted to the Nice Summit, next December. This is one of the Presidency’s great priorities and, as you know, it opens up a broad field of action in employment, and clearly makes the point that combining work and family life makes a contribution to this. Personally, I would like to see this issue taken into account even more specifically in the social agenda. I think we can all congratulate ourselves on the fact that the agenda contains a chapter devoted to the promotion of gender equality and, in that area too, I hope we will progress towards quantified targets.</p>
<p class="contents">The last initiative I want to stress concerns the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. As you know, the draft is the outcome of complex negotiations which were completed on 26 September. The document will be submitted to the Biarritz European Council in a few days’ time. I shall stress our commitment to having the articles relating to gender equality clearly set out in the Charter. I am frequently asked about this. I know I have already used up my speaking time so I shall be very brief, but there are a few things I need to make clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Three articles in the Charter are devoted to gender equality. The first is devoted to the general principle of the equality of all persons under the law. The second relates to the principle of non-discrimination, including that based on gender. The third affirms the principle of equal pay and equal treatment, together with the possibility of undertaking positive action in favour of the under-represented sex.</p>
<p class="contents">Combining work and family life, entitlement to paid maternity leave, rights of a more general scope, such as the right to dignity and the right to respect for their physical and mental integrity, also appear in the Charter. So all these provisions make this document an additional instrument underpinning equality. Civil society’s expectations are high, and this has not escaped the members of the Convention, who are anxious to have a gender-correct Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I repeat that the Community level is the right one for making progress together in all the areas I have mentioned, but it is also the right level for making progress on many other issues of concern to women. I am thinking in particular of the violence they suffer, one of my priorities for government action, and I know that is a specific issue that impels you to action too.</p>
<p class="contents">Any progress we make in one Member State is progress for the other Member States. If national policies are enriched by Community policies, then Community policies must also be inspired by national experiences. I am convinced that together – Parliament, Council and Commission, but also Member States, social partners and non-governmental organisations – we will make progress and I know – we know – that equality between women and men is on the move.</p>

Those of us who have previously heard her in Parliament know that, with her as President-in-Office of the Council, we have a very committed spokesperson for women’s issues, and that is something we need if our plans are to succeed at all. In the committee, we combined three reports from the Commission and dealt with them together. On behalf of the committee, I can promise that, in future, we shall attend to the reports in time so that the Commission does not feel it is engaged on a major task, but that we in the committee are ignoring the fact and not getting our reports ready in time. We have promised ourselves that this will not happen in future.</p>
<p class="contents">All three reports – I shall return to the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council in a moment – call attention to the articles of the Treaty of Amsterdam and say that, in these, we have obtained a new and sound basis for working on the issue of equality in the Commission and that we have also obtained a number of tools for implementing equality in the different Member States in a way we were unable to do before. This is something which, as women, we should be pleased about. We can say that almost all women have worked hard to achieve a better Treaty where equality is concerned, and I therefore think that we can be quietly pleased with the fifteen men who sat and adopted the Treaty of Amsterdam and were therefore also involved in implementing the principles of equality, even though it cannot, of course, be said that there is much in the way of obvious equality in their own Assembly. There is really a paradox in the fact that we in the EU have, on the one hand, an outstanding basis for equality – especially now with the Treaty of Amsterdam – but that, on the other hand, there are fifteen men in the European Council who make all the decisions, something I shall refrain from commenting further upon. It therefore becomes obvious in one way or another that there is a difference between principles and concrete implementation. I am also saying this because I think it is incredibly important that the EU should be given a stronger women’s perspective, and I say this for two reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we have had a referendum in Denmark which clearly showed that women, more than men, are opposed to this project, and not merely the project involving the euro but the EU project as a whole. In Denmark, we have equality in a great many areas, so women ought not to feel threatened by the project. We see, however, that, on many points, women are opposed to the project to a much greater degree than men. We therefore have some problem or other, and I will venture to say that it is not because we have declined to say that the EU is OK. Instead, it has to do with this overridingly male-dominated agenda, which women have emotional reasons for voting against.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are now facing enlargement, and we know that the progressive changeover from state-run to private enterprises affects women more than men. Because a great many of the countries have said that they want to hold referenda, we have the major task of conveying to women in the candidate countries that the EU is good for them. For, if we do not make a special effort in this area, I am completely convinced that there will again be a range of emotional reactions which will not necessarily have to do with the EU clauses but with the fact that the EU is, all in all, a very male-dominated enterprise. In that way, there is a risk of our seeing ‘no’ votes in referenda in the candidate countries, too, and of enlargement failing to go ahead. I would therefore prevail upon the President-in-Office of the Council, both the current and the forthcoming ones, as well as upon the Commissioner, to be alert to this aspect, for I believe that it is absolutely fundamental to our work that we make a very big effort in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the reports, I would also say – and the President-in-Office of the Council touched upon this, too – that one of the major problems in the EU is of course the big cultural differences. It is therefore no wonder that the President-in-Office of the Council is having difficulty getting her action plan through. This clearly shows that the countries have very different interests, but one of the things we have to work on is trying to find out where, in particular, we can make a contribution in the individual countries. I have a dream of our being able to obtain proper statistics for the different areas so that we can obtain indicators for the labour market, education and many other matters in relation to equality. In that way, we shall be able to work on things in very much more concrete terms. I would very much recommend that this be done for the candidate countries too, for it proves to be incredibly difficult to obtain figures from the candidate countries about how responsibilities are divided between men and women in the different areas. I believe that, if we are to be able to deal with enlargement properly, we must also have those figures.</p>
<p class="contents">There were thousands of other things I could have done with saying. I can see, however, that my allocated speaking time has run out, so I shall stop at this point. I would, however, put a strong case to the Presidency and the Commissioner for our continuing to follow the guidelines which we have indicated in the report and to which I have referred in my speech.</p>

Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, covering equal opportunities for men and women and Article 141 covering positive measures for employment are a guarantee for women that should take effect in all the policies of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that women do not participate sufficiently in the decision-making process in politics, business or unions. They have a much smaller share in the labour market than men, a difference that is particularly accentuated in some countries, especially in southern Europe. They do not receive the same pay for equal work, with the difference reaching almost 30 % in the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that measures for combining family and working life particularly favour women, although research is still needed into the current situation of the family and the role that women play in it, which is no longer the traditional role, because society has changed a great deal, and at the same time, so has family structure.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that research should be carried out on the real situation of women in the various Member States in order to guide the policies that need to be made if we are to achieve greater equality between men and women. In order to integrate gender policies into all programmes, we must be aware of the situation from which we are starting and the objectives that we wish to achieve with particular policies. Because what really count are the achievements and the advances in the situation of women.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that the majority of unemployment in the European Union is among women. In order to achieve full employment, therefore, we need to have positive policies directed at women, which will consist both of creating jobs and of preparing women for the new jobs – information society, new technologies – in which they can play an entirely equal role to men. The percentage of women in work in the European Union is much lower than that in the United States and Japan, a level that only some northern European countries come close to. If we take into account the candidate countries, the problem becomes more serious as the levels of women workers in those countries are even lower. Therefore, the objective of equality between men and women should be included in all programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Women have decided that they wish to work, that they wish to make their work compatible with their family life. Women wish to take part in decision-making processes, in politics, unions, and business, and we know that the contribution of women is positive for everyone and for the progress of society as a whole. European Union policies should help them to take part in order to achieve greater equality between men and women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its launch was accompanied by a great deal of legal creativity, audacity and lashings of political power of persuasion. If one examines women’s equality policy now, it seems to me, as we are all gathered here – and, of course, most of the people attending and taking part in the discussion are women – that while we are all naturally trying our utmost, we are also aware that European women’s equality policy is threatening to lose its momentum. It has become an issue for which you have strong feelings neither for nor against. To put it mildly, it is in a conceptual and political vacuum.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports we are dealing with here seem to reflect this mood. There is a great deal of activity, reasonable sums are being spent, fantastic conferences are being held, everyone does all kinds of wonderful things, but we do not know where it is all leading. Is this policy a success? Is it useful to draw the goals nearer? We cannot verify this, for – and the rapporteur also mentioned this in her report – the goals of the policy are not clearly defined and cannot be measured. What we need to do, therefore, is to formulate our goal more clearly, so that we know whether we are successful or whether the instruments we deploy are successful. We also need to define the problem more clearly and identify the problem which the policy is trying to solve. Twenty-five years ago, we were able to talk about social discrimination of women as a group and about unequal treatment. Does this definition of the goal or problem still apply? Is it still appropriate? What are the groups in society for which this definition is still appropriate? Is it not the case that the gap caused by this social discrimination has been partly bridged for certain groups and that others groups are doing very well indeed, in other words, that a kind of sham women’s equality has been created? In short, I would very much like us to address the question as to what the problem facing women consists of. What is the problem which the policy is trying to solve? Can we reframe this using a more modern approach and can we apply a theory and set of policy instruments which will breathe new life into the policy, so that we do not continue on the same path?</p>
<p class="contents">I may be critical, but it might be useful to shake up the house of cards, which women’s equality policy in Europe does appear to be, where we are all frightfully nice to each other and say everything is so wonderful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that Lone Dybkjær did what she could.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a man in an EU within which men and women do not have equal opportunities. It is worth repeating that. Sometimes, some people – even colleagues in this Assembly – seem to believe that they do have equal opportunities, but they do <span class="italic">not</span>. Just as some people have said, it is enough to look at this Assembly: the majority are men, the majority of those making decisions are men, and when the European Council meets it consists solely of men. There is <span class="italic">one</span> female Head of State in Europe. It is therefore gratifying that the European Parliament is represented by a woman in these contexts.</p>
<p class="contents">More women are needed in decision-making positions, because it is quite simply unacceptable that so much human ability is being lost. Women do have the ability – and without imposing quotas. This week we have taken a great step closer to a reunited Europe. Emphasising how matters stand regarding equality in the candidate countries is a particularly important task in the membership negotiations that are currently in progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Some problem areas: women often have two jobs, unemployment is higher among women, childcare has deteriorated, there are too few women in decision-making positions, violence against women is on the increase in many candidate countries and several candidate countries are at the centre of the increasing trade in women.</p>
<p class="contents">What can be done? Rapid membership of the EU will provide economic strength, better conditions for women and greater freedom of choice. The chapter on equality must be accorded equal importance in the membership negotiations. There must be no transitional periods. We must monitor whether the directive on equality is really being incorporated into legislation. Mainstreaming is very important in the internal policies of the candidate countries, too. An ombudsman for equality issues should be introduced, and in the candidate countries too. The EU should pursue a campaign to combat violence against women throughout Eastern and Central Europe. The EU should also take the initiative and organise a UN convention against the trade in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">I started by talking about my male status. Perhaps this issue of gender needs to be pointed out in this Assembly. On the basis of my own experience, if I may speak personally, I am convinced that Paragraph 15 of the resolution – stating the importance of men’s involvement in, and access to, good childcare – is the most important paragraph by far if equality and equal conditions are to be achieved for men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by saying that equality begins in the home. If we cannot share tasks and responsibility in the small world of the home, there will never be real equality in the big world outside, either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is, of course, no surprise, as we know that Secretary of State Péry is also extremely active in these matters in France. She is quite right when she says that steps taken forward nationally can inspire us at EU level and, on the other hand, steps taken forward at EU level can give hints to the Member States regarding the direction they should go in.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be said that France’s constitutional amendment to establish a policy of equal decision-making would perhaps be ideal as a source of inspiration not just in the Member States, but perhaps also at European Union level. I know that in this we are getting into a very sensitive area as we are stepping into what is almost like the Member States’ areas of competence.</p>
<p class="contents">We could perhaps say that as the Commission has begun to ensure there is equal representation of men and women in its own committees and expert groups it will perhaps not be such a very big step from there to what Mrs Dybkjær said, dare we say it, that we should work on the assumption that both women and men should represent the European Union at a higher level too, such as at summit conferences.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the biggest disappointment in this area with regard to the Charter on Fundamental Rights, as far as I am concerned, is that the Charter does not say that we should carry through the idea of equal representation of women and men in decision-making. However, this should have been incorporated in the Charter quite naturally – in a modern society such as ours – but this work will certainly have to be continued and gone into in greater detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Péry spoke of the importance of reconciling work with family life. I am glad that she also mentioned that the method chosen by Finland was being used in France, in which quite clear indicators are identified to gauge the situation. This will also perhaps serve as an answer for Mrs Swiebel, who was demanding that we must be able to define clear targets and that results must be able to be measured. I believe that this method, which Finland has introduced for the first time, works well in many areas and while it is part of the Commission’s strategy on equality there is good reason to expect much from it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention one problem in the area of work and family life. It would appear that it is getting harder for young families to take advantage of the rights that have been guaranteed them by law, as competition in the job market has become so fierce. We must be very careful that young mothers and fathers do not freely surrender their rights because they are afraid of the problems they might encounter in working life.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference was also made here several times to mainstreaming, and I can only agree with what has been said here that, for example, in the area of economic policy it is of absolutely major importance to start considering the gender perspective. The fact is, in Denmark, women suspect that the whole European integration project threatens the rights and levels of welfare women have achieved there. This, I think, presents quite a challenge for both the Commission and the Council.</p>

I found them both enormously interesting. Today, I simply want to talk specifically about what these reports contain – our current objective as Europeans in terms of equal opportunities. What emerges from these reports is that it is difficult to move from theory to practice. Plenty of theory, plenty of fine words. No one is quicker than us to say these things or to come out with fine words, but practical results are a long time coming.</p>
<p class="contents">Why does this worry me? Because I think there is currently great ambiguity and awkwardness about equal opportunities in Europe. We want specific actions and we want mainstreaming. The two things are not easily reconciled and we could lose out on both counts. For example, at noon we will be voting on two reports on discrimination and equal access to employment which both exclude gender on the grounds that gender is covered by policies other than discrimination policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I find that position awkward and ambiguous, and I think that means more thought is required on the drafts you are presenting to us, because there is no certainty that all this will produce practical results. To take a very simple example, which we were just discussing three days ago in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, are we talking about defending flexibility or about fighting poverty? Both are possible, but they are also contradictory, because we know very well that flexibility creates more poverty, and next week’s World March of Women will make that point.</p>
<p class="contents">So there are contradictions in our equal opportunities policy and I think we must be aware of that so that we can organise the future of our project better, or so it seems to me. Another example, also full of contradiction, is part-time work. It appears in today’s reports amongst the social rights. Is access to part-time work a social right? I have no idea, but I doubt it. On the other hand, there is also something in the reports which seems to me very important and which Mrs Dybkjær has placed well to the fore, as has Mrs Eriksson: the fact that in future we need to be concerned about so-called ‘derived rights’, that is, women’s social rights to autonomy.</p>
<p class="contents">What happens to a woman who has spent twenty years with a husband who then leaves her? What sort of pension will she get? Good question! What is her tax position? There is no equal opportunity, there is no real equality for women without autonomy and freedom as social rights, so that they can have control of their lives throughout their lives. I would like this subject, so strongly emphasised in our reports, to be one of our priorities from now on.</p>
<p class="contents">I now want to talk about enlargement, which is still, perhaps, one of my concerns. We are delighted that the Finnish Presidency has introduced indicators and I know the French Presidency wants to consolidate this indicator policy into an important institution. I am very pleased about that, I am delighted. But looking at the problem of enlargement, and here I will conclude, because the issue of enlargement worries me a great deal, yesterday we naturally voted in favour of the report on enlargement to a whole series of countries. But where, pray, are the conditions for women’s rights and equal opportunities in that enlargement? I am concerned about that and I urge the French Presidency to be concerned about it.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Montfort (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all of us here agree that equal opportunities for men and women must be pursued in all our policies. But beyond that, the method has to be defined. We need to be sure that what is decided in Strasbourg is real progress. In the name of equal opportunities, and thanks to Europe, French women have won the right to work at night. I am not sure they should thank Europe for that.</p>
<p class="contents">The European method, imposing uniformity, is wrong. First, because while women, like citizens in general, have the same ideas of what is fair and what is unjust, they do not have the same ideas about their role in the various cultures of the European Union. Nature has determined that woman should carry the future of humanity in her womb. Now, the primary duty of any society is to promote life and hence do everything possible to enable women to reconcile their legitimate right to personal and professional development with potential motherhood.</p>
<p class="contents">In that area, there is no equality. Only women can have children. So fairness does not come into the equation when the roles of women and men are as different as that.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than making abortion easier, the French government should be developing a policy aimed at eliminating every material and social reason which might drive a woman to such a negation of life. Every abortion is a condemnation of our society, but never a condemnation of an individual woman.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I became a Member of this Parliament, however, it has been my impression that a part of this House would rather forget this aspect of women’s lives. More serious still, I also have the feeling that the institutions of the European Union have the greatest difficulty developing a global vision of society in our countries. As the debates and regulations go by, a compartmentalised vision of our society appears. Instead of addressing everyone, we compartmentalise: minority after minority, ethnic group after ethnic group. As a French woman and citizen, this vision of the world is particularly alien to me. I am a citizen who should enjoy the same rights and the same prospects as any citizen of the other sex, no more and no less.</p>
<p class="contents">I do smile sometimes in this House, particularly when I hear that the group most hostile to the single currency are women, especially in Denmark. When we decide on policies targeting people with disabilities, or blind people, it is perfectly normal to add women. It is really very annoying that these women, from the depths of their kitchens or household accounts, are rejecting the radiant future of the euro. They must be re-educated.</p>
<p class="contents">The image of the European woman we find in the pages of our reports and directives does not correspond to that of these Danish women, the majority of whom are saying no to the euro. So, new pages describe her as ill informed, isolated, and out of step with everyone else. Danish women will appreciate that.</p>
<p class="contents">I take this opportunity to salute the Danish women Members of Parliament, especially Ulla Sandbaek and Pia Kjaersgaard. They come from different political backgrounds, but together they embody the courage so many men lack. It is my conviction that a method is being outlined today through policies geared to sectors, not to say minorities, in this Parliament. Any kind of national attachment must be destroyed, European societies must be reduced to a collection of isolated individuals in small ethnic, sexual, social or other minorities, all run from a distance by a European State as distant as it is pernickety.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not surprising, therefore, that Mrs Dybkjær’s report refers to the Beijing Platform, which uses women’s rights as a weapon to defend a particular conception of women and their rights, and impose it on the whole world. The Polish delegation to the New York conference already had occasion to appreciate the arrogance of a part of the European delegation incapable of accepting other positions more measured than its own. Other Members of this Parliament had to take up the pen to put things right, and Poland thanked them for it.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of these remarks, we shall vote for this report because we are naturally in favour of equal opportunities, but what equal opportunities means most of all is respect for everyone.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Dam (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Mrs Péry, Commissioner, the position of, and relationship between, men and women in society has changed dramatically over the past decades. The number of dual earner households has grown considerably. Given this development, we applaud a policy which contributes towards the equivalent development of men and women in line with their talents and interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The present report, however, puts forward an exaggerated interpretation of the principle of equality. The diversity or differences with regard to men and women are still not being given enough consideration. There is also the freedom of the individual to consider. As a result, the freedom of choice for women, which they strive for, can very easily fuel frustration and renewed forms of repression.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore find it telling that the report is seeking to establish a numerical balance between men and women across all sectors of society, for example in the labour market. The choice of training and profession for men and women will depend on their own personalities, talents and interests. To respect and value these differences shows that we still have our feet firmly on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The campaigns launched by the Dutch government to encourage girls to select more exact science subjects and so-called male professions, have failed miserably. A European repeat of these debacles appears completely pointless to me.</p>
<p class="contents">I just have to get something off my chest. I find it shocking that the representative of the Council should mention the fact that equality should be enforced, yes enforced, would you believe, in the home. I do hope that she shares my view that the government has no right to intervene in the private sphere.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the report undervalues transductive labour. Bringing up children, especially transferring standards and values, is of vital importance to our society. Whoever denies mothers the freedom of choice to bring up their own children unpaid, will be presented with the bill later on in the form of youth crime and vandalism.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea that women lag behind in paid work compared to men should certainly not be considered as inequality, because it is based on a one-sided, woman-unfriendly vision. After all, it is the cool, rational, enlightened thinking which advances human beings as independent, autonomous creatures and downgrades women to being the second sex. When one adopts this thinking as starting point, it is easy to see why one could be in favour of women’s equality.</p>
<p class="contents">This choice, however, does not offer any guarantees against evil, suffering or injustice. At best, it sustains other types of suppression. Human beings are independent and responsible creatures placed in relation to God, their Creator, on the one hand and their fellow human beings on the other. This means, among other things, that men and women interrelate and need each other in order to do themselves justice as men and women. This is exactly why keeping marriage and family completely out of the picture in this report represents a lost opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These reports have confirmed what we were all already fully aware of. The situation is far from hunky-dory when it comes to equal treatment and equal opportunities for men and women within the EU, despite the fact that the first equal treatment directive concerning equal pay for men and women came into force as long as 25 years ago, and Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome, which came into force in 1957, made provision for the elimination of wage discrimination against women. That was over 40 years ago. After all, we are already discussing the Fifth Action Programme on the equal treatment of men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Dybkjær’s report contains another long list of demands and wishes directed at the Commission, particularly in respect of inquiries, which I do not, however, necessarily consider to be indispensable. But we all know only too well where the real problems lie, and that the lack of political will – particularly in the Member States – the lack of willingness on the part of the social partners, the hesitancy of the political parties when it comes to involving more women in the decision-making processes, and also –let us be honest about this – the mentality of many men and women, are responsible for this unsatisfactory state of affairs. Once again, we have been left in no doubt on that score.</p>
<p class="contents">What I do not see in this report, Commissioner, are calls for the Commission to at last get round to following up Parliament’s very specific proposals. We have a far more pressing need for concrete legislative proposals from the Commission, than we do for studies and fine declarations and speeches.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, improvements are called for in the existing directives, for example those covering equality of opportunity in the sphere of social security, with respect to public and company schemes. I would remind you, in this connection, of our report on the splitting of pension rights in the event of divorce, as a result of which, payments for surviving relatives and the retirement age are to be included in the 1979 directive. I would put you in mind of the overdue improvements made to the 'caffeine-free' free directive of 1986 concerning equal rights for self-employed people, including spouses that help out – those millions of invisible workers, most of whom are women – and whom are engaged in small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises without any form of social security. Five years ago, we unanimously adopted an excellent report on this subject, one of our demands being a framework statute for spouses that help out in the family business. There were two sessions of round-table talks organised by the Commission, and we have not heard another word since. That was three years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">What we really need is for the Commission to at last come up with concrete, legislative proposals, instead of frittering away time and money on reports and inquiries, and wasting time that would be better spent on worthwhile legislative work. The Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities would also do well to take this advice to heart. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Electoral lists comprising 50% men and 50% women could be worth emulating. However, we are still awaiting the decision regarding a formal Council of Ministers. Unfortunately, we are only ever referred to other Councils of Ministers for a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to wait any longer. Other speakers have made the point: we want political action. It is high time for decisions on equal pay for equal work, i.e. for Articles 141 and 13 to be implemented. The Charter of Fundamental Rights has to be more than a fine proclamation. What we need are concrete implementation measures that will enable people to reconcile a career with family life. The Fifth Action Programme will assist us in this, but we as a European Parliament have already come some way ourselves. We have created a network of committees on equality with our female counterparts in the national parliaments, and in November, we will be meeting our female counterparts from the Member States, as well as those from the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We did the same thing, incidentally, in New York, at the Beijing + 5 Conference. I was the rapporteur in Peking and the co-rapporteur in New York. The Polish women were very grateful to us for making it clear that the representative who was there at the time most definitely did not reflect the views of Polish women. I met with some very positive responses there.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind our President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, of the important speech he made here. There must be no glass ceilings in the European edifice. The European Parliament employs 30% women, which is the highest percentage rate of all the institutions. The Commission has 25% women, so at least there is an upward trend. The European Court of Justice could do better, as only two of its fifteen judges are women. Yes, and the picture looks very gloomy in the Council on the equal opportunities policy front. All I can say there, is that the Council is what you might call a developing country where equality for women is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">We have every reason to be concerned. We have heard that the previous Council Presidency first restructured and then scrapped the Ministry for Equality. That gives us great cause for concern, and we expect that as well as stepping up the pace in matters of equal opportunities policy, there will also be concrete measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the vital requirements for improvements in the position of women is firstly to know exactly what the current situation is. That means we need accurate facts and figures. Then the evaluation reports can use clear criteria and give us an objective analysis of progress or the lack of progress. After all, one of the main criticisms that I receive from grassroots women's organisations is that when applying for financial support from the European Union, they have to make very detailed predictions about their future work and its outcome. Yet in reports like this, we do not have anything like the same detailed information.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ensure that information and activities reach women in their own communities, and one effective way of doing that would be by developing and promoting real life case studies which reflect a positive image. I try to look at these reports from the point of view of women in Wales, the constituency I represent, and consider how they are affected by this kind of progress and how they can get access to and use this kind of information.</p>
<p class="contents">I would support the request of the Committee on Women's Rights in this report for a major study of women in the EU and in the candidate countries as a starting point for future work. A lot is being done by women's organisations, by governments, by the European Parliament and the Commission. We have heard from the Minister of the progress that has been made in France and we can learn a lot from this. Greater involvement by women at all levels of government and in all areas of life is essential for deepening democracy and achieving and maintaining peace. We should be encouraging better dialogue with women everywhere – after all the European Union is seen as a pioneer in terms of equality legislation. The reports are welcome and the progress they outline is a step forward, but until we really begin to exchange good practice and base our work on real statistics, we are not in a position to judge whether we are on the right road to achieving real equality between women and men. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In practically every sphere of activity, serious inequalities still exist. Despite the differing situations in Member States, there are generally fewer women in the labour market, they are most affected by unemployment, including long-term unemployment, and by casual labour, part-time work and atypical, insecure and badly paid work. Women’s average salaries are still lower than men’s, by around 28% on average, which is a contributory factor to women making up the bulk of the poor and to preventing them from participating in social and political life.</p>
<p class="contents">Since we know that quality employment that provides rights is a fundamental factor in guaranteeing equality between men and women and in guaranteeing women the same kind of independence as men, it is crucial that we study the causes of this situation and adopt the necessary measures to overcome it, specifically through policies on employment, training, education and on infrastructures for supporting the family and children, giving priority to this issue at a practical level and not just making declarations of intent.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to participation in the decision-making process, either at political level, in the business world or in the trade union movement, women are still in the minority. Whilst this situation can be explained to some extent by the difficulties women face in the labour market and within the family, it is also true that political parties must shoulder their democratic responsibility to guarantee equal opportunities for women to participate in political life and in the decision-making process itself, in order to put an end to the scandalous situation that still exists at the beginning of the new millennium. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to dwell in particular on two terms: <span class="italic">articulation</span> between family and work and <span class="italic">parité au quotidien</span>. These concepts and what they stand for are gaining ground in French society and I hope that this interest will be exported to the rest of Europe. I also wanted to congratulate you on your initiative in introducing the female dimension into the Councils because, as we see on a daily basis, women’s issues are special issues, not just a necessary dimension to every policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Commission reports are concerned, Commissioner, we received them with interest and we examined them in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. However, I have to say that we were dissatisfied with the descriptive nature of the reports and trust that future reports which come under your responsibility will contain a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results. On other words, we need a breakdown of the indicators applied, detailed statistics comparing the situation in the Member States, an analysis of cultural differences in the various European societies and an indication of the factors which act as disincentives to the developments we are seeking and to the development of a European nationality for women which, as we can see on a daily basis, for example from the recent referendum in Denmark, is a sector which we need to address.</p>
<p class="contents">My final comment concerns the situation of women in the countries preparing to join the European Union. Because of the course of our own history and our experience from the policies which we have applied, we have an obligation to help them and I therefore feel that the Commission and the Council should call on the Member States to adopt the mechanisms which allow equality to be applied to all their policies. We have both a political and a moral responsibility for these countries trying to find their way into Europe and for the cohesion of the enlarged Europe which we are preparing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you for your considerable commitment and for the work you have made a point of doing in the interests of equality. We are especially looking forward to your succeeding in implementing a policy of alternate listing of women and men in decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">That is really excellent. I would just like to raise a couple of issues which I believe should, as a matter of urgency, be a part too of the Council’s thinking and of the work it is doing. It concerns not only women in the European Union, but also women in the candidate countries. In the candidate countries, the social exclusion of women has been substantially greater than that of men. It is therefore women who have been hardest hit. Many of them have lost their jobs and, with this, comes violence against women, sex discrimination and the trade in women. Many women are lured to Western Europe with promises of a better life, but the reality is the opposite. They often fall victim to acts of violence and some are forced into prostitution. Consequently <span class="italic">we</span> must demand and support preventive programmes and specific measures, such as strict legislation, witness protection schemes and information campaigns. However, the fact that the existing laws are not enforced and new ones are not created means that the governments of Europe are indirectly allowing the Mafia to continue with its activities. This is therefore an incredibly important issue for us to get to grips with.</p>
<p class="contents">In this area therefore, the Council, especially its men, has a tremendously important job to do in leading Europe in the fight against the Mafia that trades in women, for this slave trade is not something that responsible politicians can push aside, shrug off or ignore. We have a political responsibility to abolish this slavery of modern times. In conclusion, I would like to say something about the men – and it is the men that I address. When I talk about ‘the men’, I mean the men with power. It is Prodi, Chirac, Jospin, Schröder, Blair, Persson and the others who must become involved in this, namely <span class="italic">all</span> 15 of our heads of government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Women are forced into temporary work, they are far more exposed to insecure jobs and unemployment, and on average they are paid 30% less than men.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the proposals that follow do not measure up to the challenge of those recitals. Firstly, because the majority of them are about creating monitoring centres, collecting statistics and carrying out studies. Gender inequality is not exactly a new phenomenon we are just discovering, needing to be studied. As regards work, we cannot seek equality and continue to develop insecurity, flexibility and part-time work. That is part-time work that women are forced into, because 70% of them would like to work full-time.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are witnessing the pauperisation of wage-earning women all over Europe, including France, where 15% of them live on less than FRF 3 650 a month. Worse, so-called equality is sometimes turned against women: for instance, in France today the incorporation of a directive is going to make night work legal for women. A strange notion of equality. Other choices could have been made; night work for men could have been banned instead, when it is not required to meet society’s needs.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, fine words and nothing concrete. That will not be enough. That is what we will be saying in Brussels on 14 October with the World March of Women fighting against violence and for real work for all. Those are the essential conditions for real equality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">From the reports and speeches that we are considering today we can deduce, as many of us already knew, that the problem of equal opportunities is a structural problem and that in order to deal with it we need global strategies, because as women we are not a category or a homogenous social group or indeed any sort of group.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union we are currently running the risk of our debate being elitist and of the progress only reaching some of the more informed and more privileged women, leaving behind the rest, who are young women, immigrant women, single mothers, victims of the white slave trade, etc. They suffer from multiple discrimination. We cannot continue with an elitist debate, we cannot continue to have progress only benefiting those women who enjoy greater opportunities. Our efforts need to be directed at the women who have the most problems, who are certainly the majority in the European Union. We therefore need to assess the real situation of women, we need to draw up indicators and we need to make our political action binding, so that progress really reaches everyone and not just a few. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the rapporteur, whose report not only contains observations on the situation of equal opportunities in the European Union, but also recommends a course of action.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to thank the Minister for the work she is doing in her own country and as President-in-Office of the Council, and I would like to make a connection between the work of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the work of the Commission, focusing on one point: employment. The report before us is, I feel, a major synergistic work. The guidelines for 2001 on equal opportunities in the world of employment are starting to become better defined, more specific and more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the way forward. The Committee on Women's Rights would like to congratulate the Commission and also propose a few even more specific pointers. I truly believe that this report and the Fifth Action Programme which lays down a strategy are the way forward. We might do better to stop complaining, or rather to complain but, at the same time, to show due appreciation for the positive steps which are being taken to ensure that we make increasingly effective progress.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Péry,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council. </span>–<span class="italic"> (FR)</span> Mr President, I will not reply individually, except to Mrs Torres Marques, because her question is really direct and personal. I was indeed sorry to see that Maria De Belém Roseira was no longer the representative. She was very active during the Portuguese Presidency, but it is not up to me to make that decision, it is up to the Minister for Employment, whom we have invited to the conference on gender equality. I will now respond generally on the issues, rather than give individual answers to any one of you.</p>
<p class="contents">Several of you have said gender equality policy did not start a year, two years, or three years ago. Obviously not, and as someone involved with associations for social change – because I too, like many of you, have some thirty years of involvement with these associations behind me – I know how hard the social movement, the feminist movement and the intellectual movement, naturally, have worked to move this issue forward, and today we take our places in roles of responsibility in our institutions. The history of the women’s movement goes back way over fifty years: I sometimes remember Olympe de Gouges, who dared to call for a declaration of women’s rights and gender equality, and was condemned to the scaffold in 1793. Of course the history of feminism is very long.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment is about inequality in the world of work. Ladies and gentlemen, political will is clearly not enough to eliminate every possible social inequality overnight, especially in the world of work. Management, the unions and the market have a role to play, but we do what we can by expressing a political will. I can tell you in one sentence what I am doing about it: I have wasted no time proposing a law to improve equality in the world of work. This is currently being debated in Parliament, and I have introduced a provision, which obviously does not suit everyone in my country, but which is compulsory and will compel each company or profession to negotiate on equality in the workplace every three years, covering salaries, conditions of work, career prospects, and access to lifelong training.</p>
<p class="contents">My third comment is about your doubts: plenty of speeches, plenty of documents, plenty of reports, but not enough actual progress towards quantified targets. It is true that the reality in the European Union is that we have to take decisions as Fifteen and we differ culturally in relation to these issues. Nevertheless, I believe in the need to fight for quantified targets, and to implement policy through indicators. I did not mention this in my speech, but I am fully intending to propose a feasibility study on the gender institution to the Ministerial Conference, because we need an instrument for monitoring those indicators, and for exchanges of good practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth point: the issues of the future. Two of you mentioned new social rights, new fiscal rights. I can tell you that will be the central theme of the Swedish Presidency, and I shall be following it with great interest, because the progress made will certainly inspire French action.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth point: the Charter. It is true that while much has been done compared with the initial stage of this document, we might have hoped for something more dynamic on decision-making. I have not lost hope, however, of improving the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixth point: enlargement. In New York I took the liberty of making myself clear on that issue on behalf of my country. I shall be just as clear today, on behalf of the Presidency. The candidates really must be helped to come up to the level of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. That seems clear. Excluding gender equality from the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>is unimaginable, and of course we shall be just as vigilant on that issue as on the others.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, violence, prostitution, the grip of the Mafia. If Mrs Diamantopoulou wants to take a European initiative, because we have done things before at Community level to combat violence, I shall be there to support her. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first reasons that the structure of the social and economic system is to blame for present inequalities and the policy of the European Union and of all the national governments is based on this reasoning. The second approach says that women, themselves, are to blame for the inequality which exists in society. This reasoning often leads to absurd distortions, one of which was heard here today, i.e. that the way in which women voted in Denmark was determined by some particular female chromosome and not by the social differences which they experience on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, Mrs Péry, the President-in-Office, has given us a superb analysis of the priorities of the French Presidency, which we all believe will be particularly important priorities. I should like in my brief intervention to confine myself to the report. The 97, 98 and 99 reports are not simply working papers. They are political tools. I should like to remind the House that the Commission’s legislative proposal due for debate calls for annual reports from the Member States on the subject of positive action because we really do believe that these reports are political tools for three reasons. Firstly, they give us a picture of the situation. As you will have seen, the reports contain analytical tables, data on each Member State and tables on all the individual sectors. Secondly, because they allow us to make a comparative assessment of the Member States and a comparative assessment of the overall progress of the European Union over time. Thirdly, because they form the basis for strategy, both for the European Union – even in the Charter of Fundamental Rights the fact that we had a picture of the current situation played an important role – and at national level, given that the Member States are able to use the comparative assessment to set national targets.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the reports which you have at your disposal concentrate on and highlight three issues. The first is the participation of women in decision-making. The average participation of women is 18.6% in Europe, 28.9% in regional parliaments and 30% in Parliament and there appears to be a very minor increase in the order of 0.6% from one year to the next. The second interesting comment concerns the wage differential between men and women which, at European level, is hovering at the unacceptable level of 23% to 24% and, in some regions of Europe, is as high as 40%.</p>
<p class="contents">The third interesting statistic concerns domestic violence, the violence which women suffer at European level. I fully accept the comments in the report and the recommendations by Members who have spoken of the need to change the nature of the report. I have taken your comments on board and I see that we need to concentrate on analysing data, especially the results of successful strategies and successful initiatives at national and European level, in order to give the report a strategic slant. However, I need your help here. My services face huge problems collecting data from national governments. There are several countries, although one could cite examples for all countries, where it is impossible for us to collect statistics, where it is impossible for us to collect their experiences and results at national level from innovative policies in time. I believe that, if you work together with your national governments, you can help the Commission to collate this data quickly, so that it in turn can present an analysis of them in the sort of report which you require.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as enlargement is concerned, it is of course, as Mrs Péry has said, a question of <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. However, I would stress that, in working with each of the candidate countries, we have been closely monitoring the question of sexual equality, as regards both the legislative framework and the creation of institutions which can support the application of these policies. As you know, we have starting signing joint reports with each candidate country in order to monitor their adjustment to employment policy on an annual basis. They contain an entire chapter devoted to the participation of women.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, once again, to thank Mrs Dybkjær for the excellent, in-depth work contained in her report, which will be most useful to us in our next report, and I should like especially to thank the French Presidency and Mrs Péry for being so pro-active on the issue of equality during their presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
