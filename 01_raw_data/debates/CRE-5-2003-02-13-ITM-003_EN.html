Throughout this process there has been a lot of consensus and, for a change, most colleagues agree that action needs to be taken. That is why I accept all three amendments which have been tabled to this report.</p>
<p class="contents">How did we get to this stage? Over eight years ago a woman called Margot Cameron attended a surgery held by my colleague, Mr Miller. She said that nobody would listen to her. Her story so inspired my colleague that a petition was lodged with the European Parliament which showed that Margot was not alone. There are many Margots in the UK and across the EU with similar stories concerning problems with silicone. The petition has led to the Commission reclassifying breast implants as a Class III product under the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC. Member States are to adopt and publish laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this directive no later than 1 August 2003. If I am not mistaken, this is the first time that such a petition has led to direct action by the Commission. I hope that more and more EU citizens will find solutions to their problems through this route.</p>
<p class="contents">However, much as Parliament welcomes the Commission's actions, we would like to take this matter still further. As more women choose to have implants - whether for purely cosmetic reasons, reconstruction after breast cancer or breast deformities – we must ensure that people make informed choices and we must put patient safety first.</p>
<p class="contents">My report aims to answer both the legitimate concerns of thousands of women and the need to put patient safety first. Therefore, the report recommends Member States to take measures to increase and improve information for patients through tracking and surveillance, quality control and assurance.</p>
<p class="contents">In this perspective, I particularly want to emphasise three main points. Firstly, the need for responsible advertising. This includes all forms of direct advertising, such as in magazines and the use of 'before and after' pictures. We must clamp down on this misleading advertising that is fuelling demand and which many women pin so much hope on. Perhaps 'before and after' photographs of women who have suffered from ruptured implants would tell a very different side of the story to the readers of glossy magazines. I would like to see the 18-year age limit applied – apart from where there is medical need – in order to protect young women from making ill-informed beauty choices.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the need for information requires proper labelling and marketing, including health warnings explaining the health risks involved. For instance, women should be aware that breast implants will have to be replaced after a time period. It is a grave state of affairs that for too long cosmetic cowboys have got away with not explaining these simple facts. It is for this reason that we require the creation of an international register of accredited plastic surgeons.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there must be responsible research. Before breast implants are placed on the market, manufacturers must collect clinical data on the characteristics and performance of their product. It also means that breast-implant producers need to trace their products. Therefore, the creation of a national breast implant registration to keep women informed in the event of a product fault is vital.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue will not go away. I hope that in the future more women will be able to make informed choices and they will not have to suffer in the way that so many women like Margot have in the past. I hope that the Commission will be able to report back to Parliament on how far the Member States have gone in implementing this reclassification, and will continue to monitor the issue of silicone-gel breast implants, <span class="italic">always </span>putting patient safety first. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The same applies to the members of the Committees on Petitions and Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities who also played a part in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">The report reflects the policy consensus between the European Parliament and the Commission. I am pleased to inform Parliament that, last week, the Commission adopted a directive reclassifying breast implants in the context of the legislation on medical devices. Breast implants are now subject to the most stringent assessment procedures. More precisely, breast implants have been reclassified from class IIB to class III. It requires, in addition, clinical data and design attributes, namely on biocompatibility, physical and mechanical properties. This will increase the level of safety of breast implants.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, at the request of the Commission and the Member States, CEN, the European Standardisation Body, is proceeding to an in-depth review of the European standards on breast implants.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission received encouraging information from Member States regarding national measures taken, or further developed, under the recommendations set out in our communication of November 2001. This information will be made available to Parliament in a Commission staff working document on national measures adopted or planned to be adopted by Member States in relation to breast implants. This paper will be finalised in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that its communication and the production of the forthcoming working document have produced a significant effect. All Member States have acted by verifying existing national policies and by starting to introduce measures as recommended by the communication. Both documents will continue to be a useful element that interest groups and national authorities may use, at national level, to promote best practice and inspire further actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The excellent cooperation between Parliament and the Commission on this subject should be highlighted, since the overall result has been extremely positive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Breast implants are subject to the standard quality and safety requirements for medical devices, being covered – as you also mentioned, Commissioner – by Directive 93/42/EEC.</p>
<p class="contents">It was lobbying from self-help groups of women suffering adverse effects from silicon-gel breast implants that prompted the Commission Communication. Silicon implants were used for years before there was regulation or surveillance of their use. The draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, my colleague, Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten, who unfortunately is unable to be here today, refers in particular to the need for open and transparent information about silicon implants.</p>
<p class="contents">Public health and healthcare issues are for the most part the competence of the Member States. Together with Mrs Stihler, we now call on all of the Member States to introduce a national register including information about how medical aftercare is provided and how it is taken up.</p>
<p class="contents">Personal privacy must be protected. Access to the registers will therefore have to be restricted and their contents treated as confidential. Best practice will have to be publicised and then applied Europe-wide. We need research and further development work to be carried out on safety and implant toleration. Here the introduction of a passport for implant recipients and compulsory aftercare examinations might also be helpful for gathering data.</p>
<p class="contents">Accurate information must not be given in the form of advertising. Advertising will increase demand for implants. What is needed, however, is balanced information. Doctors and nurses – both male and female – have a particular responsibility here to provide patients with objective, complete and scientifically up-to-date information in writing about all the details of their implants, such as the identification number, volume and type.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Mrs Stihler for her balanced report. Ladies and gentlemen, in my view, breast implants are also an integral part of health. They are needed to reconstruct breasts. Aesthetic reasons do often play a role, but if someone thinks that they are inferior then it is their general health that suffers. With the help of implants their sense of well-being can be restored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Petitions, with its ear open to the public, reacted at that time by asking STOA to carry out an independent and intensive study of implants. Following this, it organised a hearing that attracted wide media coverage, and, as rapporteur, I was entrusted with the task of drafting a resolution, which Parliament adopted unanimously on 13 June 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">It will therefore be evident that our vote today on a communication dealing with Community and national provisions on breast implants is a matter of twofold satisfaction to me; firstly, because it gives recognition to the action taken by the Committee on Petitions, which was the true initiator of this communication, and then because Mrs Stihler's excellent work takes up and gives added weight to almost all the proposals made in the June 2001 resolution, especially as regards advertising, the information required to be given to patients, the guarantee of the implants' high quality, research, the responsibilities placed not only on manufacturers, but also on surgeons and clinics, as well as the invitation extended to the Member States to maintain national registers and to make provision for a consent form.</p>
<p class="contents">My only regret is that the idea of issuing a passport to the patients was not retained in the initial report, and it is for that reason that I will be supporting Amendment No 3 to paragraph 10 (ii), resubmitted on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which aims to reintroduce such a passport.</p>
<p class="contents">Although some may object that this is just one more piece of paper, I consider it an effective way to replenish the future European database. Moreover, such a system would, above all, allow the patient to have real knowledge of the implant's specific characteristics.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that I rejoice to be able to vote on this resolution, which itself demonstrates how well the Commission and our Parliamentary committees can work together to meet the expectations of Europe's citizens. It demonstrates that the Committee on Petitions, which the public tends to use as a means of bringing to light the Community system's failings, can also play its part in developing creative and positive Community initiatives. It is also a way in which we can show the petitioners that we do indeed honour our commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She sends her apologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Breast implants are covered by the directive on medical devices. I am very pleased that the Commission – as Commissioner Byrne also explained earlier – has recently announced that it is reclassifying breast implants and is pressing for higher levels of safety for patients.</p>
<p class="contents">Broadly speaking, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats can support the Commission Communication and the report tabled by Mrs Stihler. We have to face up to the following fact in Europe: every year 160 000 women in the European Union suffer from breast cancer. It affects one in eight women. In Germany alone, that means over 50 000 women every year.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is acutely aware of how topical and sensitive this issue is. In the post-operative care of breast cancer patients, breast implants are often a decisive factor in increasing their quality of life. Where breast abnormalities and surgical beauty treatments are concerned, the options available must also be explained and safety guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore calling for a number of decisive measures to be taken, above and beyond the Commission's proposals. It is essential for a minimum age to be set for cosmetic breast operations. These should not be carried out on young women under the age of 18. Operations for medical reasons would be exempt. In addition, advertising for such implants that is directed at the general public should be banned along the lines of the French model. It would then only be permitted to publish objective information in a non-commercial context.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be guaranteed that advice and information will be provided prior to the operation by a doctor specialising in plastic surgery. We think it is vital for this meeting to take place at least four to six weeks before an appointment is agreed for the operation, so as to give the women concerned a cooling-off period to reflect on the objective and reliable information that they have received.</p>
<p class="contents">As in other areas, more emphasis needs to be given to providing patients with information. Before the operation date is agreed, the women concerned should therefore also be given an information sheet. It is important for this to be based on the content already developed by EQUAM. It should contain both a warning about the potential health risks and also a clear appeal only to agree an operation date once all remaining questions are fully resolved. This is also the point made in the amendment that I have tabled to paragraph 9 of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Where silicon implants are concerned, we need high standards of safety and quality at international level. For this reason, we need cross-border registration of breast implants to be made compulsory at international level. In this context, the EU Member States should be advised to become members of the international breast implant register.</p>
<p class="contents">The scientific research carried out over the last few years has yielded some decisive findings in this field. We therefore also think it is important to support this research and guarantee that the scientific work continues across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall the Commission Communication, together with the amendments proposed by Parliament, constitutes an important step in the right direction. It is not a question of making it more difficult to use breast implants, for either medical or cosmetic reasons. The aim of this initiative is to guarantee the highest levels of product safety, ensure that comprehensive information is provided and ultimately to increase the quality of life of the women concerned.</p>

<p class="contents">Time and again, women complain about the damage suffered to their health following the use of breast implants or about operations that have had undesirable cosmetic results. Incidentally, 80% of breast implant operations are carried out for purely cosmetic reasons. The constant physical and emotional suffering caused by the implant operations is often immense. As a rule this ought to be avoidable, as the cause is not the implants <span class="italic">per se</span>. This has been confirmed in studies, and particularly impressively by the STOA study from the year 2000. The causes are more usually the implants not being fitted by specialists, the device not being replaced automatically after a few years and the continuing lack of regular medical aftercare, not to mention the fact that women are still not fully informed about the potential risks, which vary from case to case, before the operation. That is why there is an urgent need to impress on the Member States that they must finally ensure that women are fully informed before an operation of this kind and, above all, that they must stop a plethora of insufficiently qualified beauty surgeons from working by introducing additional qualification requirements and subjecting their clinics to more stringent inspections.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to optimise quality assurance then this is the second step, now that we have already taken the first step, together with the Commission, of putting in place stricter product safety standards. I am thinking of the recent decision to reclassify breast implants as class 3 medical devices.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is also calling for an implant passport to be introduced, which would give information both about the characteristics of the implant and about the necessary post-operative care and would identify the surgeon. The passport should be signed by the doctor and the patient before the operation as a clear declaration of consent. In the light of the many complications that can arise after breast implant operations – which were brought to our attention not least by the petitions sent in by thousands of women in 1998 – I think it is quite frankly scandalous and completely incomprehensible that so far only one Member State has introduced a national implant register. It will come as no surprise either then to learn that at the moment we do not have either precise figures on the implant operations carried out or complete scientific findings based on the adverse effects suffered by the women. That is why it is of the utmost urgency to start setting up a national register for breast implants in all of the Member States immediately, and to join the international breast implant register.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, this whole sorry tale also illustrates yet again why we urgently need multidisciplinary breast centres, in which benign and malignant diseases can be treated and beauty operations carried out under one roof, and where quality is guaranteed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Belgium alone over the past ten years, over 4 000 prosthetic implants were inserted, with, in 1999, 313 women needing hospital in-patient treatment because of complications.</p>
<p class="contents">So there are at least three reasons to justify this action being taken at Community level: improving information for patients in certain cases; shedding the maximum possible light on the potential secondary effects of having a breast implant, in particular by means of research; and, of course, taking into account the petitions presented by citizens' groups, giving consideration to whether or not their request that silicon implants of this sort be subject to an immediate ban is well founded. These three aspirations are set out clearly by Mrs Stihler, whom also I wish to congratulate, in her report, the broad outlines of which the Liberal Group endorses. I am thinking especially of the prohibition of advertising aimed directly at the public, and of the authorisation of prosthetic implants for young women under the age of 18, strictly and solely for medical reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Group does not, however, support all the measures advocated by this report, specifically mandatory entry in national registers, or Amendment No 3, which proposes the introduction of a passport for wearers of implants, which strike us as being like so many ideas which appear to be good but turn out to be misguided. Over and above that, primarily, where the cost and feasibility of such interventions is concerned, should we be contemplating the imposition of requirements that go well beyond those in place for other equally invasive and extensive surgery? I am thinking, for example, of heart surgery, the requirements imposed on which by the Commission are sufficiently restrictive.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, what women expect is clear answers to issues that frequently cause them anguish or even traumatise them, when raised in the event of an illness. It is self-evident that what we owe them is the truth, and the truth is not about imposing a ban that risks simply sending these women across our European borders. The Liberals therefore give their active support to Amendment No 2 tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists. The truth is that women tempted to undergo this sort of operation which – as has been said – is becoming increasingly common, need to be informed and protected, and that is what we have tried to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This gave rise to the STOA report, according to which there was apparently no evidence of a relationship between silicone implants and, for example, cancer. There was, however, a clear indication of the various kinds of inconvenience caused to women who wanted, or felt obliged, to undergo implant operations.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Mrs Stihler’s proposal acknowledges the suggestions, with which we too agree, that were put forward both in the study made of the STOA report, as well as elsewhere, and that, in general, ask for special measures to be adopted as a matter of urgency, one of the most important being an improvement in the independent information provided to women who wish to undergo implants. It is also proposed that the information not come from the private clinics that are to carry out the implants; that the information be exhaustive; that there be a period of reflection so that the women concerned might consider the pros and cons of having the implants carried out; that prior consent be given; that there be follow-up and monitoring where the implants are concerned, as well as a basic investigation into the latter; and, above all, that the Member States subject all the clinics, especially the private ones, to rigorous controls.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, there was a case, which gave rise to a national debate, of a hairdresser’s in the Canary Islands that had given implants to a large number of women without providing any medical guarantee. The problem became public knowledge because one of the women who had been given implants had to have both her breasts removed.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is an extreme case, and something which obviously does not usually happen, but it is vital that the Member States exercise rigorous control over all clinics and over all products that serve as implants, so improving the situation of those women who, for one reason or another, feel obliged to undergo implant operations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the key issues is the ban on the direct advertising of breast implants to the public. The provision of non-commercial information through national public health services is the way forward. France has already introduced a ban. All Member States should do the same in relation to breast implants because they always involve certain risks.</p>
<p class="contents">The promotion of cosmetic surgery in general is a major problem. Action should be taken to prevent situations whereby women and indeed men are coerced into unnecessary surgery which may involve particular risks.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that there are, in many cases, health and psychological reasons for breast implants, but we need to be careful in that regard. I agree with the rapporteur concerning the age limit. Implants in women under the age of 18 should be authorised only on medical grounds. Anyone under 18 years of age is extremely vulnerable and could be coerced into something they may regret in later years. Advertising for cosmetic surgery should carry clear health warnings.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to focus more on promoting and securing acceptance of women as they are, rather than allowing the advertising industry to impose some sort of idea of beauty as the norm. This applies not only to women but also to men. If you look in the back of women's magazines you can see a huge number of adverts encouraging women to put extra things into some parts of their bodies, and to remove parts elsewhere. The advertising industry has a huge amount to answer for. There are cases where it is necessary on health grounds, but it also needs to be - as the rapporteur has said – very well tracked, and information must be made available to patients. In terms of implants for purely cosmetic reasons, we need to look at what the advertising industry is doing in relation to coercing people into something that they may regret in later years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As an oncological surgeon and university research scientist, I read the report very carefully and support many of the proposals it contains. I feel, however, that the tone is excessively alarmist and I will tell you why. For 50 years or so, silicones have been widely used in products for large-scale consumption such as drinks, puddings, cakes, drugs, paediatric materials, pacemakers, cardiac valves, lipsticks, creams and fabrics – and it has been proved that none of these cause cancer in humans. For 40 years, silicone breast implants have been used throughout the world for both aesthetic reasons, as in the case of serious psychological problems, and for reconstruction, as in the case of mastectomies carried out to remove breast cancer where there are no age restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1986, the University of Los Angeles examined 3000 women who had had implants for at least six years and found no risk of increasing neoplasia<span class="bold"> </span>or to mobility. In 1992, the University of Calgary, examining 11 000 women, reached the same conclusions. The American Association of Rheumatologists also promoted two studies on the risk of autoimmune pathology in women with silicone implants, which recorded good tolerance in all cases. It was discovered that the average life of implants is between 15 and 25 years and spontaneous rupture is often asymptomatic. There are therefore no sufficiently serious grounds for preventing the use of implants, except in young women less than 18 years old.</p>
<p class="contents">I must point out that the report makes no reference to breast implants inserted as preventive treatment in cases where the results of predictive genetic tests have shown a high risk of carcinogenesis in patients, tests carried out particularly on the children of mothers who have suffered from cancer, which is a practice which will become increasingly widespread.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards paragraph 10a, I would like to point out that patient consent forms are already in use in all the States of the Union. It is compulsory for the patient to sign a form after receiving all the necessary information, before any treatment is applied, including implants. I therefore feel it superfluous to mention a passport. I also feel it would be useful to set up European and national registers containing data collected on both aesthetic and therapeutic breast implants. Furthermore, it is important for an annual check to be carried out by a breast specialist and a free echography performed, without the need for invasive examinations such as mammographies or CAT scans<span class="bold">,</span> which still subject patients to radiation and are practices which are on the expensive side for national health services. The collection of data on implants and regulated follow-up would contribute to the production of a valid survey allowing a more precise assessment to be carried out, which would certainly be reassuring for all women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is for good reason that it is mainly women who are speaking here. I do not think that this has anything to do with personal experience but rather with the fact that we do, after all, feel a close bond with the thousands of women who submitted the petition to Parliament. It was not that we woke up one morning and said: we must regulate this. The question came from grass roots level and on this basis we have already spent a long time working on creating a good Community framework. I would also like to thank Mrs Stihler very much for her excellent report, and also the Commissioner who I hope will soon present the report from the Member States, as he promised a moment ago. I hope that he will also work hard on following up what we recommend today.</p>
<p class="contents">Without wanting to repeat what has already been said, I would just briefly like to ask what is particularly important, and what our starting points are. Our main aim is to see patients protected. We do not want to patronise them; we want to protect them. That is crucial. We do not want a ban; a woman must be able to decide for herself in good faith whether she wants breast implants or not. What we do want is to ensure that she is properly informed and that she knows what the disadvantages and potential dangers of a breast implant are. We want to guarantee that. That is why we have such a problem with advertising. This is not the same as selling a coffee machine; this is about a medical intervention. We do not want women to be persuaded to change their breasts on the basis of misleading advertising.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is compulsory registration so important? In Europe we know too little about breast implants, we know too little about the dangers, we know too little about where these women are and what the consequences are. That is why proper registration is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, protecting the patient. Yes, protecting young people, yes, making sure that they are given time to think things over. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In cases in which they cannot be restored, they at least want to make sure that the external damage caused is made as invisible as possible. This naturally also applies to women who have had an operation as a result of breast cancer. They thought it was a good solution to replace the lost part of their bodies with an artificial substitute that has the same suppleness as the original living material. These days there are disappointed women who find that they have been poisoned after such treatment. These are the people who are warning against this happening again and are pleading for a ban. The new material generally lasts only a few years; after that the silicone may leak or escape into the body. Those affected by this may have been beautiful for a short time but are ill for a long time afterwards.</p>
<p class="contents">A positive point in the rapporteur’s proposal is to prohibit advertising for this solution and to improve advice on the negative consequences and on alternatives. It may be possible to live with silicone breasts if they are periodically replaced with new material. This approach takes better account of women who are in danger of psychological problems following an operation than does an outright ban, and prevents these treatments from being performed illegally without proper information. A possible advantage is still the fact that gullible women who are not able to check out the dangers and who retain old replacement material in their bodies because they cannot afford or are afraid of repeated operations will continue to get into difficulties in the future. I agree with Mrs McKenna that if it is not possible to severely restrict these practices, a ban may soon be unavoidable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The image, often presented in advertisements, of how young women should look – all slim waists and large breasts – means that there is a considerable increase in the number of breast implants carried out on very young women. The weekly magazines fuel this trend by showing ‘before and after’ pictures. It is therefore high time that, as responsible politicians, we protected patients by beginning to bring some order to this very confused area.</p>
<p class="contents">I completely agree with Mrs Stihler that this is only a step in that direction. I believe that many more binding commitments are required on the part of those who carry out these implants. What I think is the most important part of the proposal is the ‘18 years’ old’ limit whereby non-medical implants are to be prohibited in the case of girls under 18 years of age. The proposal that surgeons and clinics must issue guarantees is also important. Unlike my colleagues, I think that registration at both national and EU levels is justified. When there is insufficient research, a register is needed. I am very satisfied with the report. We, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, fully support the report and the amendments tabled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur told you a story about a woman called Margot Cameron who came to see me eight years ago. She wandered in, nobody would listen to her, and we sat down and looked at the problem she had and started campaigning. It is a success story, because here we are today looking at legislation that we are putting through this Parliament, which is great.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to tell you another story, which does not have such a happy ending. As I have said, this all happened eight years ago when Margot Cameron came to see me. We started campaigning and raised the issue at national level and finally took it to European level. By that time we had contacted groups throughout Europe and brought the issue to the Petitions Committee in 1998, though looking around this room and I do not see anybody who was at that Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember going to that Committee and arguing, along with the women, for that petition. However, I also remember the Commission saying: 'sorry guv, nothing to do with us – it is a Member State issue'. That delay set us back years. It was 2001 before we got any satisfaction out of the Commission. In that period 28 000 further operations were carried out in the UK alone. It is estimated that 20 000 of those implants have either leaked or ruptured during that period. What happened as a result of that delay? We let down not only the women who had signed that petition, but also a lot of women who had gone down the road of getting implants.</p>
<p class="contents">This shows that we have to address these issues and problems more speedily when they arise and not let women suffer in the way they have in the past. Many Member States have banned trilucent implants and have banned saline implants. We have got to look in the future at a ban on silicone implants. Why? Because they affect people's health. If it were men getting the implants, there would be a ban tomorrow, but that is not happening because men are not getting them. I would like to make one final point. This report is entitled 'breast implants', but it is also possible to get silicone implants for other parts of the body, and they cause the same damage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that prostheses are available for the many women who have had to undergo mastectomies is naturally an advantage, and we must not forget that this represents important progress in itself. It is, however, a real disgrace the way people are brazenly abusing the naiveté of many women these days by convincing them that they will have heaven on earth if they have breast implants fitted in order to improve their aesthetic appearance. For whom actually? And what for? I think it is a real scandal that people like my colleague Mrs Van Brempt have had to take reproaches from those who are earning big money from this.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore happy to endorse the congratulations to Mrs Stihler, the congratulations to the people who started this petition campaign at the time and the congratulations to the people who want to take this matter in hand – namely to impose a ban on advertising and to ensure that young people in particular are not caught in the trap of this misleading advertising, to ensure that products are of course reliable and that medical aftercare is organised efficiently at Member State level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A number take the plunge and have recourse to cosmetic surgery. For others, such surgery takes on a reconstructive role and helps them heal their wounds and rebuild their bodies. In the former case, however, it is material external to themselves that their bodies are having to incorporate. In every case, it is essential that prostheses in the form of breast implants be subject to investigation and regulation and that all surgery be accompanied by safety information and be followed up, over the very long term in the case of women patients. In the light of all this, we can but agree with Mrs Stihler’s report and approve the changes proposed with a view to better informing and protecting not only female, but also male, patients.</p>
<p class="contents">I would note, for my part, a number of areas on which our activity must be focused. Although silicone implants are highly disparaged and have been subject to many studies, silicone is not the only component of the prostheses. I therefore think it essential to pursue research and clinical studies in this area, especially where women are concerned, by focusing the research on the long-term risks and on the other components. Moreover, I think it important that our nations and their health services be able to work as part of a network and to share information and good practice in this area so that all women patients in Europe might benefit from the same information and the same guarantees and so that impetus might be given to research.</p>
<p class="contents">Since we are concerned here with the provision of information and follow-up, it is essential that all patients possess all the data concerning their implants and the surgery that they are to undergo. It is also important that they be warned of the risks, the costs, the advantages and the disadvantages connected with the insertion and wearing of breast implants. I should think it worthwhile if, for once, Europe were to take its cue from Thailand and perfect measures designed to protect consumers against this advertising and fashion phenomenon and, in particular, to ban very young women from receiving implants. It is more and more important for all sections of the public to be given clear, scientific and comprehensible information if they are not to be the victims of false advertising and misleading images.</p>
<p class="contents">For the well-being of patients and the medical follow-up they require, I would therefore defend the idea of setting up national and European registers and of centralising data and other information in this field. In compliance with the law on the protection of personal data, such information should of course only be used for the purposes of studies and research in the field of health, particularly women’s health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I first came into contact with this as a political issue in the Committee on Petitions when the long and hard work done by Mr Miller came before us. We finally got some movement from the Commission on the matter. I therefore welcome the announcement today by the Commissioner that implants have been reclassified as medical devices, and the effects that will have on how they may be controlled.</p>
<p class="contents">Breast implant advertising specifically – indeed implant advertising of any kind – should be regulated. It is not acceptable that these implants should be advertised as simple and straightforward, with no indication that there are medical risks involved. There is a particular need to ensure that people under 18 years of age may only have implants as a medical necessity, and their guardians should also be fully informed of the implications of such operations.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a particular need to follow up on research in relation to the effect of breast implants and, as has been pointed out by Mr Miller, implants in other parts of the body. There are question marks relating to silicon implants which have not been answered by studies to date, and I would urge further research on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, could I gently take issue with Mrs Van Brempt, who has done a lot of work in this area, and point out to her that my gender certainly did not pre-programme my views on this issue. I do not think it is necessary to draw attention to the gender of Members who speak on issues in this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
