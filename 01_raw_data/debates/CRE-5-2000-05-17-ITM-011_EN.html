<p class="contents">It is indeed true that information has appeared in a Turkish newspaper about a list of people considered to be undesirable in Turkey. This issue was specifically raised by the Presidency at the Association Council meeting between the European Union and Turkey on 11 April 2000.

Therefore, in my view, it should not have been number one on the list but should have been on the last part-session’s list of questions. There seems to be some system whereby Mr Alavanos and his colleagues always get the first and second questions, and they always attack Turkey.

We do not, however, know today what measures have been taken by successive Councils in order to attempt to establish relations between both these countries, given that today Turkey is still imposing an economic blockade on Armenia.</p>

The first concerns the 1987 resolution on acknowledging the genocide in 1915-1917 and the second question basically concerns political relations between Armenia and Turkey. With regard to the first question, these issues are obviously open to political interpretation, although they are based on a historical assumption which we all acknowledge and which is extremely important, but which is not a precondition for reopening dialogue with Turkey. With regard to relations between Armenia and Turkey, which we hope will be positive in future, all that the European Union has done is to try to ensure that Turkey complies with the European Union’s normal framework of external relations. This framework includes good relations with Armenia, especially on trade matters. These good relations and the whole framework for cooperation on which they are based are part of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> that Turkey must accept. Nevertheless, at international level, we cannot force countries to maintain good relations with one another, as these cannot be imposed by decree. They must result from a political decision. Turkey must practically demonstrate that no matter how it views the situation in Armenia, if it wishes to open negotiations with the European Union and if it wishes to join the European Union, it will, of course, have to respect the whole framework of good relations that the European Union enjoys with Armenia. This has, until now, been a purely bilateral issue and the European Union cannot, therefore, intervene in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I would like to suggest that those honourable Members who are interested in issues such as this should use the Council web page, which is updated daily, to ascertain the dates of signing and the position on ratification, adoption and entry into force of all agreements, and specifically the Mediterranean agreements such as the agreement with Jordan to which the honourable Member’s question refers. </p>
<p class="contents">On this point, the latest information I have is that eight countries have still not ratified the EU-Jordan Association Agreement. As you will be aware, this is a matter for national parliaments, and they have the final say, as these are mixed agreements, in which there is a Community dimension and a national dimension. It is obvious that we cannot interfere in the decisions of national parliaments. Nevertheless, we can and we must make representations to the governments of these countries, and I must say that the Portuguese Presidency intends, at the next informal meeting of Foreign Ministers on the Euro-Mediterranean process, to highlight the importance of making the parliaments of these countries aware of the need to ratify this agreement in particular, as well as other agreements which still remain to be ratified.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to mention an issue that is often overlooked. This is that given that there is a Community dimension to these agreements, and that this dimension concerns trade, the entry into force of these agreements would normally be preceded by a Commission decision. And the Commission has, in fact, as it has done with regard to other Euro-Mediterranean agreements, already brought into force unilateral measures for dismantling customs tariffs, which will provide products from Jordan with easy and swift access to the Community market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Portuguese Presidency also intends to continue the very thorough work that has been done to establish the joint strategy for the Mediterranean, and it has developed various initiatives in this area. Specifically, with regard to the agreement with Jordan, even though we acknowledge and regret the fact that the agreement is not yet in force, previous experience has shown that these agreements take around three years to be ratified. The most rapidly ratified agreement was the agreement with Tunisia, which was signed in July 1995, and which came into force in March 1998; it therefore took just under three years. Our experience with all the other agreements is that they took around three years and I think that the pace of the agreement with Jordan is more or less standard. This depends to a large extent on national parliaments. Nevertheless, the Portuguese Presidency will certainly make the various governments aware of this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you will be aware, when the Council’s mandate for the Seattle Summit was being prepared, many Member States were particularly careful to stress cultural aspects and, above all, the European Union’s need to adopt a very firm position in these negotiations on protecting the specific nature of culture. I would therefore remind you that in the conclusions of the Council meeting on 26 October on the preparation of the Seattle Ministerial Conference, the idea was expressed that during the forthcoming WTO negotiations, the Union would try to ensure, as it did in the Uruguay Round, that the Member States which comprise the Community would be able to preserve their cultural diversity by maintaining their own cultural and audiovisual policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members will be as aware as I am of the fate that befell the launch of the new round of WTO negotiations in Seattle, which has, of course, led to delays in addressing issues of this kind. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that within the specific framework of the GATT agreement, that is, of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, it was specified that negotiations on the so-called built-in agenda would have to begin on 1 January 2000. These negotiations have begun, but there has been no substantial change of position so far – which is something of an understatement – with regard to progress on these issues, given that this whole process is obviously linked to the start of the overall negotiating process. I can also tell you that the Council believes that there is no way that a satisfactory start can be made to the process this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason for asking the question is that we have in our own ideologies many different models at a European Union level which are unique to the European Union as a whole: many times we speak of the European model of agriculture or the European social model, and so on. In particular, with regard to things like audiovisual, we had a discussion today in Parliament on the Randzio-Plath report on transparency and financial dealings between undertakings and state aid. There is a huge threat now to cultural diversity within the European Union because of the import of programmes from America and globalisation even of food chains like McDonalds. That is constantly undermining what is unique not only about Europe as a continent but also about the individual Member States.

France pursues a very independent policy where the French language is concerned. Do you see any evidence of similar tendencies on the part of the Germans, Spanish or Portuguese?

<p class="contents">Turning to the question about financing our policy in Kosovo through the agricultural budget, I must make it absolutely clear that the United Nations mission in Kosovo cannot possibly be financed from agricultural budget headings, since there is no appropriate legal basis for this. The current financial regulations do not allow for appropriations to be transferred between two headings in the financial perspectives. This does not necessarily mean that there is no intention, as specifically announced by the Commission, to propose an amendment to the 2000-2006 financial perspectives which, in the Commission’s view, would not fundamentally affect CAP appropriations. The Council is currently studying this issue, which is highly controversial. We know that in this House, too, a majority is against a review of the financial perspectives which would lead to a reduction in the amount available for the common agricultural policy. Nevertheless, I repeat that the Commission has stated that there is absolutely no danger of direct aid to farmers being reduced and that this is simply a question of taking advantage of savings essentially flowing from changes in the euro/dollar exchange rate. These savings will be extrapolated over the next two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission considers that the post-2002 review of the CAP, which was, as you know, agreed in the Berlin European Council conclusions, will provide a basis for further savings. But as I have said, the Council’s position on this issue is, in political terms, to oppose a review of the financial perspectives. The Council considers that a very thorough assessment must be carried out of the requirements of the Balkans and of the real ability of the people there to absorb these funds, particularly bearing in mind and focusing very closely on the role of the European Union as one of the international funding agencies in this area. This request has already been made to the Commission and to the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. We have therefore asked the Commission to provide a schedule showing the indicative distribution of all the contributions that have been pledged, divided into those components which are donations and those which are loans. The Council feels that it is only on the basis of this kind of information that an accurate assessment of the Commission’s proposals can be made. It is precisely for this reason that the idea of a review of the financial perspectives is not being considered at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council’s view is correct: payments to farmers are at stake. It is truly outrageous that aid is not paid for nuts – which means they cannot continue to be grown – or that farmers are not being given what they are asking for: a reduction in diesel oil prices. Nevertheless, what the Commission does is take funds intended for agriculture, and which have already been approved under Agenda 2000, at the Berlin Summit, as if there were a surplus, and divert them to foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I am in favour of aid to Kosovo, I am not in favour – in fact I consider it an outrage – of taking money intended for agriculture, approved under Agenda 2000 – since if we do this it shows that it has been nothing but a smokescreen – and dedicating it to foreign policy.</p>

In other words, part of the CAP budget will be redistributed.

<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to make one point quite clear: I explained that, at the moment, appropriations allocated to aid for Kosovo are unused CAP appropriations. I repeat: they are unused CAP appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that, with regard to the Commission’s proposal, I stated quite clearly that currently there is not a universally positive attitude to changing the 2000-2006 financial perspectives in the Council. The Council has taken the view that the internal balance of the financial perspectives should not be changed during this phase. It is, however, also obvious that the Berlin European Council conclusions are relevant here, as they show that the financial perspectives for the period 2000-2006 provide for a mid-term review, specifically with regard to the common agricultural policy. Perhaps it would be worthwhile for honourable Members to consider whether the common agricultural policy will ultimately be compatible with the outcome of the next WTO round. The 2000-2006 financial perspectives also provide for a review, which will, for the first time in fact, be dealt with by a qualified majority, and I would also ask the House to bear this point in mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was most interesting. You say that the situation is unclear and that there is a political and military vacuum. In other words, that Iraq does not control its northern area. Now, forgive me Mr President-in-Office, but Iraq does not control its northern area because we do not let it and perhaps we are right not to. But even if we do not let Iraq control its northern area, that does not mean that we have to put up with its being controlled by someone else. What I am hearing is quite absurd. I imagine that you are unable to defend whoever it is who takes the decisions there. Except that, of course, they include members of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps they could inform you of what is happening in the area and tell you, for example, why they are allowing other people to go into and take control of the northern area of Iraq, which they do not allow Iraq to control, i.e. – let us not beat about the bush – why are they allowing military invasion?

<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We feel that the European Charter on small- and medium-sized enterprises due to be approved this June is an extremely important instrument for guaranteeing improvements in the fight against unemployment, in increasing social cohesion and also in improving the foundations on which the new knowledge society is based, by making instruments for innovation more democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that the conclusions of the Lisbon European Council highlighted the role of small- and medium-sized enterprises as the driving force of Europe’s economy and that they in fact generate around 80% of employment in the European Union. Small- and medium-sized enterprises cannot be excluded from the strategic objective outlined in Lisbon, that is the creation of a more competitive, more dynamic, knowledge-based economy. Small- and medium-sized enterprises are essential and they must be given more support. The Council and the Commission are therefore drawing up a Charter for small- and medium-sized enterprises which, as I said, we hope will be approved in June at the Feira European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this Charter is to commit Member States to focus on these instruments and to provide a specific response to the specific needs of small- and medium-sized enterprises. I wish to emphasise that although the issue of a Charter for small- and medium-sized enterprises is not new, the European Council has never quite so clearly demonstrated the importance it attaches to making it a reality. We think that a fairly detailed study must be carried out on this issue, which will not only enable Community instruments to be adjusted to facilitate the work of small- and medium-sized enterprises, but which will also highlight the need for Member States to have a set of procedures enabling them to take action in this area, procedures that should be as uniform as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hopefully, it will not be too long before we have details of the proposals. I am also pleased that the President-in-Office has recognised that the engine of growth in the economy are the SMEs providing 70% of the jobs. Therefore, it is blindingly obvious that SMEs will play an important role if we are to resolve the very high unemployment problems that we have generally in the Union and specifically in various regions of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I did ask a specific question about fisheries. Of course, fisheries by their very nature create much-needed jobs in coastal regions of the Union. Fisheries, unlike any other industry, depend so much on seasonality and weather factors.

<p class="contents">This Charter is, however, a broad policy document and is generically aimed at all small- and medium-sized enterprises. It is not a document that lists measures to be adopted in each sector and assigns priorities to them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter is designed to create a universal regulatory framework for small- and medium-sized enterprises as defined at European level, and also to establish stages for implementing these measures.

<p class="contents">Can the President-in-Office tell us if this Charter will envisage new Community instruments being created to help small- and medium-sized enterprises. For example, funds to help them with training, education, adaptation of premises or the use of new technology.

In fact, the draft version of this Charter will be considered by the Industry Council tomorrow and the Charter will be published in three weeks. Furthermore, I think that, like the Lisbon Special Summit conclusions, which Mr Gallagher will surely acknowledge go somewhat beyond traditional, merely speculative rhetoric, the Charter must provide concrete and timetabled measures, with firm objectives. With regard to the Charter’s real potential, let us wait for it to be published and then we will, of course, be willing to listen to criticism from small- and medium-sized enterprises and in particular from the European organisations that coordinate and represent them. We will be willing to consider all the opinions of small- and medium-sized enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the start of the twenty-first century, which signals a new departure by European society in the direction of greater democracy, cohesion and recognition of the contributions of all citizens, the unacceptable phenomena of racism and social exclusion can be observed. In Greece, the exclusion of physically disabled and paraplegic citizens from two competitions is causing a social and political problem. One competition is for the employment of officials in state banks and the other is for the employment of school teachers (primary and secondary) in state education, and the exclusion is because the new Code for Public Employees includes the term ‘able-bodied’. The Greek Parliament adopted the Code for Public Employees in 1999, almost at the same time as the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which protects citizens of the Member States from all types of discrimination against them (Article 13). In these circumstances, how is the Council intervening to restore the credibility of the European Union’s policies and the dignity of its citizens?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are a proposal for a directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment at work and in professional activities, a proposal for a directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons, irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, and also a proposal for a Council decision establishing a programme of Community action for fighting discrimination between 2000 and 2006. The Commission’s three proposals enshrine different approaches to combating discrimination. The first proposal prohibits discrimination in the field of employment based on racial or ethnic origin, religion or beliefs, disability, age or sexual orientation. The second proposal for a directive prohibits discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin in the areas of employment, education, access to goods and services and in the area of social protection. The proposal for a decision establishing a programme of action for fighting discrimination, which is designed to support and complement the implementation of the directives through exchanges of information and experience, will be implemented by promoting good practice in legislative and other fields.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the fight against discrimination on the grounds of disability is covered by the first proposal for a directive, which seeks to implement the principle of equal treatment in the field of employment and in carrying out professional activities. This proposal covers an area which is crucial to our citizens’ ability to exercise their rights, given that this is an area in which discrimination is more obvious and has a more negative effect on integrating people into society. As Parliament is aware, it is the Commission that has the power of legislative initiative, not the Council, and therefore the proposals that the Council adopts will be based on what the Commission proposes to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, since not everything in the garden can be rosy, I am not completely satisfied at the moment. It is true that Article 13 covers practically all possible – at the moment at least – forms of discrimination. However, subsequent regulatory development and the initiatives being proposed are incomplete and unbalanced.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office of the Council has mentioned three examples and I would like to refer to them specifically. There are certain cases in Article 13 which are susceptible to discrimination, such as the one we are dealing with today, the case of disabled people, which I believe have been implemented in an irregular way. It is true that there are others which are still much less developed, such as discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. However, returning to disability, I believe that the European Union requires more complete legislation which covers every possible type, including cases of double disability. I would like to know the Council’s opinion – as well as that of the Commission – and I would like to know whether it is considering any initiative for cases such as, for example, women and disability, discrimination on the basis of gender and for the kind of disability involved in the case I have referred to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission, by using the information provided by its various committees, can, of course, take into account the opinions expressed by various interest groups, and in particular those which legitimately oppose discrimination. Regardless of your real reason for asking a question of this nature, we must recognise that, in recent years, and particularly since the Treaty of Amsterdam, very specific measures have been adopted in the European Union to ensure that these issues are addressed in a far more appropriate way, taking into consideration the interests of the various parts of society that are affected. In the last few years and over the last decade, the European Union has dedicated a whole approach to this issue and a raft of policies which, although far from ideal, represent a huge qualitative leap forwards. At world level, we can be truly proud of the steps that we have taken in this area. But I do acknowledge, of course, that we still have a great deal to do and that probably this accumulation of legislative proposals on discrimination may even lead to and require a different legal procedure. It is important that we continue to make the Commission aware of this issue and the Council will follow this matter closely and actively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to remind the House that the European Council in Lisbon highlighted the promotion of social inclusion and called on the Commission, and the Council, to take priority actions for specific target groups. One of these groups is the disabled. Member States choose amongst these actions according to their particular situations and subsequently report on their implementation. What is happening in Greece, as described in my question, is causing me a great deal of concern because the procedure described by the Lisbon Council gives national legislation and practices the opportunity to practice indirect discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps a European observatory should be created so that the specific practices of the Member States and the application of European policy can be better monitored? Also, does the Council intend to work with candidate countries on the recognition of the rights of minority groups, given that we know they are not properly respected in many of these countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any event, I must say that the Council follows this type of issue with great interest and I believe that the attention paid by Parliament to such issues is crucial to keeping them on the Community agenda, and in ensuring that the various Member States do not feel tempted to make any exceptions – within their own borders – to what the Union decides as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More recently, at its meeting in April, the Council adopted three additional sanctions against the Burmese regime. At that Council meeting – and against the background of the concern that has been felt for many years – the Union’s concern at the situation in Burma-Myanmar was expressed, specifically with regard to the repeated and active repression of civil and political rights, and the harsh conditions that prevent the people from exercising their economic, social and cultural rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, the Council urged the government of Burma-Myanmar to respect human rights, to restore democracy and to establish dialogue with the opposition, which would lead to national reconciliation in a unified and democratic State. For this reason, the Council decided to renew the common position adopted in relation to Burma-Myanmar for a further six months and, at the same time, to ban exports of equipment that may be used for internal repression or intimidation, and to improve the current visa system, by identifying those people who are covered by this system and those who support it. Furthermore, the Council wishes, with the agreement of all Member States, to refuse to grant an entry visa for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, a decision which could be reversed if it is in the interest of the European Union, to freeze assets held abroad by the persons I have just mentioned, who are associated with these acts of repression, and to make greater efforts to explain and promote the objectives of European Union policy on Burma-Myanmar by establishing meaningful political dialogue. To this end, the European Union plans to send a second EU Troika mission to Rangoon. The Council has furthermore decided to ask the Commission to study the possibilities of increasing humanitarian aid for Burma-Myanmar, with the aim of directly helping the people, and in particular of distinguishing development aid from direct aid to the people, in particular through non-governmental organisations. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that the European Union’s concern about the situation in Burma-Myanmar has been made sufficiently clear and I believe that it matches the concerns that have been expressed by Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am, of course, very happy that the new common position has been established by the Council and that it has strengthened the position as compared with the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I prefer to use the name Burma rather than Myanmar since the people of Burma and now Aung San Suu Kyi, the legitimate leader in Burma, do not refer to it as Myanmar. I should prefer it if Parliament avoided the term Myanmar also. I have to say to the President-in-Office that the net impact of the various measures the European Union has imposed since 1996 has been very limited: the Burmese have not entered into dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and the democratic forces in Burma remain as outside the whole process as ever.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst I express my support, one thing still puzzles me. Whilst we take these measures, there is no progress on the pressure that some of us in Parliament have been trying to exert on the Council in relation to the need for sanctions – sanctions, of course, which Aung San Suu Kyi has consistently called for. Related to that, we continue to oppose the Massachusetts Federal laws which impose very effective sanctions on Burma. We are waiting for the US to decide against these Federal laws. Will that remain the case? If the US decides in favour of Massachusetts, will the European Union then reintroduce our opposition in the World Trade Organisation to these measures taken in Massachusetts?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I admit that the action the European Union has taken in this area may not have changed the situation in any concrete way. I would remind you that in this area, my country spent years, sometimes in relative isolation from the rest of the Community, trying to draw attention to the situation in Indonesia, and the success of that pressure was only measurable against the internal reaction and above all against action by the people of East Timor. It is obvious, however, that EU action in such a far-off place cannot always have an immediate impact on changing the political conditions that mark the current regime, specifically human rights violations and the lack of respect for these countries’ most basic democratic rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would nevertheless like to refer to something that I did not mention just now. The resolution on the human rights situation in Burma adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Commission in April of this year is also important. I would also like to say – and this is an important point that also concerns the overall framework of relations between the European Union and countries in South-East Asia, and acts as an element of cumulative pressure – that relations between the European Union and ASEAN have, since 1998, been through a rather strained period, precisely because of the problems resulting from Burma’s membership of that organisation. Because of the common position on Burma, it was impossible to invite the Burmese delegation to the EU-ASEAN ministerial meeting in Berlin, which led to that meeting being cancelled. I cannot predict what the European Union’s attitude to this situation may be in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any event, I am more than happy to answer question number 20. As stated in the European Council Resolution of 13 December 1997, the meetings of the ‘Euro 11’ group are informal and their aim is to enable Member States to coordinate, through discussion, issues which relate to the responsibilities that they share with regard to the single currency. Formal decisions cannot be taken at these meetings and are, in all cases, as is in fact stated in the Resolution, taken by the Ecofin Council in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Treaty. I think that this is quite clear and that this dual framework works in accordance with its own rationale. By that I mean that Euro 11 is an informal setting, and Ecofin is the formal setting. The function of the first category of meetings is purely to coordinate the countries that have joined Economic and Monetary Union and which are part of the single currency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any event, I must tell you that until then, nothing within the European Union prevents countries meeting in smaller groups than in the normal Community context. We are all aware, from newspapers or from conversations in corridors, that various countries in Europe, particularly the Nordic countries, regularly coordinate their positions in a framework that predates the Community decision-making process. This coordination does not, of course, mean that there is any transfer of power to the specific framework in which these discussions are held. This is purely and simply a coordination of joint positions, and it is perfectly natural that countries that joined the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union and which are members of the single currency should need to find specific measures to express their action and that they should collectively bring these issues to Ecofin. I do not think, however, that the position of the other countries is any more restricted in Ecofin than it was at the beginning. But, let us be frank here: minorities are minorities. This means that the democratic process is at work in Ecofin and there is nothing we can do about that. That is how the EU works. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Euro 11 arrangement forms part of the framework for coordinating relations between certain countries that have a different level of integration or, to use more modern parlance, closer cooperation as predetermined in the Treaty, and this involves certain coordination mechanisms. The Euro 11 Council can obviously discuss whatever it likes, and may even agree that a certain issue is not discussed in Ecofin. This does not mean that the countries that are not members of Euro 11, but which are, of course, members of Ecofin, cannot raise that issue under the Ecofin Council agenda. What must not happen is that a country that is not part of Euro 11 is asked to set the agenda for those that are. I must say one more very simple thing, Mrs Sandbæk.
