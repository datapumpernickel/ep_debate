From the beginning of the reform debate, the Commission has been well aware that any reform leading to a more market-oriented sugar regime will require the Sugar Protocol ACP countries to adjust. The Commission is committed to helping those countries through this adjustment phase and has therefore proposed accompanying measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Before drafting the proposal for a regulation on accompanying measures for Sugar Protocol countries, the Commission had produced an action plan setting out the principles of its proposed support for the Sugar Protocol countries. Discussions have taken place with the ACP countries concerned and this assistance scheme is designed to respond as closely as possible to the needs identified by the countries themselves. It recognises the diversity of impacts between countries and offers support both to the sugar sector and to strengthening alternative economic activities. Social and environmental mitigation measures are also included.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Lehideux, on his commitment and very constructive engagement in support of the Protocol countries. The Commission welcomes the amendments proposed in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission understands the complexity of the challenges facing the ACP countries concerned. The Commission has proposed EUR 40 million for initial investment in 2006, taking into account the Community’s budget availability and the lack of information on the precise needs, which are estimated at this stage. Substantial additional funding will be provided from 2007 onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform of the EU sugar regime will only start being implemented from July 2006 onwards. However, it is important to start supporting the countries concerned from next year onwards, before the maximum impacts of the sugar reform are felt. Anticipating these effects and starting to adapt to the expected changes as early as possible is likely to be the most successful coping strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bernard Lehideux (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has links with the 18 ACP countries via some very old agreements on sugar. It would obviously be inconceivable to sever these close links brutally under the pretext of reforming our sugar regime, however necessary it may be.</p>
<p class="contents">Reform of the CMO in sugar will, of course, have extremely serious economic and financial consequences in countries that have, until now, been able to export to the EU markets. However, its effects will also go far beyond that. For most of these countries, sugar is not just a product like any other. The reform will have an extremely serious social impact in these countries, due to the very special role played by sugar cane cultivation: a social, economic, cultural and environmental role.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is an urgent matter and it is out of the question to wait for the 2007-2013 financial perspective before acting. It is therefore our duty, as you just said, Commissioner, to take measures now that will be applicable from 2006 and may be renewed in 2007 to assist the initial efforts of these countries to restructure their sugar industries or to diversify their economies.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, now is certainly not the time for Parliament to make pronouncements on the definitive measures that should be put in place, but allow me to formally request that the measures put to the ACP countries be up to the challenge. In view of conversations I have had with the Council and with the Commission while drafting this report, I can assure you that this request is not simply a rhetorical one.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to backtrack briefly, if I may. Parliament’s Committee on Development unanimously called for the aid provided by the Commission for 2006, which it considered to be completely inadequate, to be doubled from EUR 40 to 80 million. I bitterly regret the attitude of certain Member States who did everything they could to block this proposal, particularly by refusing to take part in any dialogue on any increase of the 40 million proposed. They would not allow this amount to move by a single euro, and some of them even talked about reducing it. I also find the Commission’s attitude regrettable, as it turned a deaf ear to the incessant and unanimous calls from the ACP countries for a larger sum. The Commission’s refusal to re-examine this figure, which is obviously far too low, meant that the Council would have to take a unanimous decision to increase the proposed amount, which was pretty much mission impossible, despite the efforts of the UK Presidency, I would emphasise.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I can only regret having been defeated in this very place, during the budgetary discussions. One day, this Parliament will have to take a look at the unacceptable way in which the Committee on Budgets deals with the political priorities issued by the other thematic committees. I really cannot understand how a figure of 80 million proposed by all the members of the Committee on Development can just be dismissed out of hand by the members of the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, we were obliged to accept this arrangement hatched without us. Indeed, in order for this regulation to be implemented normally, and in view of the timescale for examining the action plans to be submitted by the ACP countries, it is vital for it to be adopted at first reading. This situation therefore caught us in an impasse: if we took the risk of pushing through a sum of 80 million, that would have lead to a second reading, which would have threatened the very existence of the text.</p>
<p class="contents">True, as I said before, the level of aid is clearly inadequate, but these countries need this money now and cannot be made to wait under the pretext that the Council, the Commission and a number of our fellow Members are not prepared to keep the European Union’s commitments or its word.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, one time does not make a habit. This attitude is, in my view, a very short-term one. At a time when the EU is taking part in the difficult negotiations at the WTO, tomorrow in Hong Kong, the day after elsewhere, I am afraid that the ACP countries risk remembering how flippantly we have treated them. In conclusion, Commissioner, once this regulation has been adopted, the development of this matter will be in the hands of the European Commission and will ultimately depend largely on the welcome it gives to the projects of the ACP countries. I hope that Parliament will be kept regularly informed, via its Committee on Development, which I would like to thank for its constant support, on developments in this important matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, it was all we could manage in the circumstances. By this I mean that we have had to face facts, and to accept that only EUR 40 million will be available to the 18 Sugar Protocol countries as compensation in 2006. Although this compensation will at least be approved at first reading, which we can only hope will mean that it will be paid out in good time, we are all aware that it is nowhere near enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Our own sugar farmers, on the other hand, will receive extremely generous compensation, to the tune of over EUR 5 billion. Hundreds of millions more were added at the last minute in order to reach an agreement, with money apparently no object. While I do not begrudge our sugar farmers this compensation in the slightest, I would be willing to bet that our policies will directly contribute to the future political and social destabilisation of some of the ACP countries, most of which are small island states. These countries are prepared to carry out reforms, to diversify and to modernise, but they will struggle to cope if the total subsidies they receive are cut by 36% in four years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself have visited Guyana and various other countries. Nearly two thirds of jobs in Guyana depend directly or indirectly on sugar. It would be impossible for anyone to deal with cuts of this magnitude in only four years, and so no one should be surprised if the country becomes politically or socially unstable. Such instability would be a direct result of our policy-making in this Chamber. I ask for my words to be taken down, so that no one can claim to be surprised when the inevitable happens.</p>
<p class="contents">Only 10% of jobs in Jamaica depend on sugar, but the crime rate there is already incredibly high, with 1 400 murders having been committed this year alone in a country that numbers two million inhabitants. If this figure were extrapolated to Germany, it would mean over 50 000 murders, whereas the actual number is only around 300. This is a good indication of the social situation in the country, and if we cause the unemployment rate to rise by a further 10%, then it should come as no surprise if Jamaica, too, becomes unstable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If my group supports the report tomorrow it will be with a heavy heart, as the rapporteur has said, because we feel that the EUR 80 million that the Committee on Development voted unanimously for was the minimum. Now we are going to halve that and put only EUR 40 million on the table. We are doing this to get a first reading deal and to ensure rapid disbursement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a paltry sum and even more paltry when compared with the EUR 7 billion we managed to find to support our own producers and companies affected by sugar reform. Perhaps I would not mind so much if I really believed that the money would go to small farmers, but I am not sure that it will. Looking at evidence from the past, I do not believe it will.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last two years Tate &amp; Lyle sugar has had GBP 227 million from the CAP budget. Nestlé, in the UK alone, has had GBP 11 million, and even more in Belgium and Holland. I understand that KLM has had money because it put some runways on some former farming land. We need a lot more transparency about where the CAP funds go. French farmers at the moment are getting just 10% of the CAP subsidies. In Spain 18% of the top farmers received 76% of the funding in 2003. We must get away from the idea that it is our farmers versus the farmers in the developing world. As far as I can see, the little people everywhere are not getting very much at all from the CAP at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the EUR 40 million, it can only be the beginning. I realise this is not your dossier, Commissioner, but I believe you said that there will be substantially more support in the future. If we are going to make poverty history we really must do much more than that in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the 18 protocol countries are not the poorest countries in the world, but they are not the richest either. In fact, they are pretty poor and many of them have just taken the first step on the way to development. I do not think this is the time to pull the rug from under their feet. They need time to adjust to sugar reform and they need money.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about money we should talk about new money from the EU budget. Let us not talk about taking some money off the development budget to give it to the sugar protocol countries; let us not rob the very poorest to give to the slightly less poor. The Commission President has talked a lot about Robin Hood in the last couple of weeks. Let us not play Robin Hood in reverse. Let us find new money to aid these countries. Let us remember that we have sugar reform and banana reform. These are very small island economies, small states, and they need our support.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Commissioner will take that message back to her colleagues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is indeed true that a reduction in the sugar price in Europe will lead to a drop in the income of the 18 ACP countries, but the sugar price that they receive will still be twice as high as the world market price. What I see as particularly important is that this extra money will not end up in the pockets of a handful of traders, but will mainly benefit the poorest farmers, the ordinary farmer. That is why the Commission needs to keep us up-to-date.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, not only is it important for the countries in question to export sugar, but sugar cane can also be used for different purposes. In Brazil, about half of the sugar cane is currently used for the production of alcohol. Well, if cars can run on alcohol there, then so can they elsewhere in the tropics, and I think we ought to offer those countries as much expertise as possible in order to achieve this. Sugar cane can even be used as cattle fodder.</p>
<p class="contents">The 40 million that has been mentioned before is probably the maximum, in my opinion. If it were to transpire that more than this 40 million were required, an additional budget should be submitted if the money can come from different sources. I am not as optimistic as Commissioner Kroes about the level of funds that will become available for foreign aid in the next financial perspectives. I am familiar with the Commission proposals, but if have interpreted the latest noises from the Council correctly, then the Commission might well end up being somewhat disappointed in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By this I mean that these countries should be paid on our terms, so that they can develop their national economies.

<p class="contents">Liberalisation of this kind causes hunger and poverty, and it costs billions. The necessary reduction in quantities could have been achieved equally well by administrative means, without any need for this money. I would ask Mr Gahler to take a closer look at the figures; sugar beet farmers will receive only 10% of this billion-euro sum, with the rest channelled into the restructuring fund for the sugar industry. This is absolutely scandalous, since an enormous amount could have been achieved with this money had it been spent on development aid, or on fostering economic development in the rural areas of these regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must avoid robbing Peter to pay Paul. The money we find for the ACP countries has to be new money. It should be made available immediately and it should be complementary.

Firstly, the sugar reform really is not nearly thorough enough and does not even come close to rectifying the scandalous imbalances that exist in the relationship between the EU and the sugar-producing countries. Secondly, compensation for the ACP countries’ sugar farmers should be at the same level as for the EU’s producers in the sugar industry. This is something that the financial benefits resulting from the reform could easily pay for. Thirdly, it is quite wrong-headed of us to want to meet the challenge presented by the sugar reform by allowing the developing countries to produce bioethanol. The ACP countries’ dependence on Europe will probably only be exacerbated if they are now locked into producing sustenance for our cars instead of food for people. The consequences of such a strategy for global food production could be quite disastrous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is important is that aid from the European Union should make a considerable contribution to greater competitiveness of the industry in the ACP countries, particularly by higher efficiency and greater diversification. After all, those countries need no longer be so dependent on their sugar production in nine years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important for the ACP countries to become competitive to such a degree that they can, in time, hold their own in the face of competition from third-country exporters, such as Brazil, without the EU’s guaranteed price. This is the transformation in respect of which the EU’s sugar policy can, and indeed must, give guidance to the ACP countries and the European sugar industry. The funds required for this must come from Chapters 4 and 1 of the European budget, as this is, after all, a matter of development and agriculture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
