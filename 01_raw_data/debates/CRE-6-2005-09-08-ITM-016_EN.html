I am sure that will come as no surprise to him, for he has presented a very even-handed and forward-looking report on an important subject, and I hope that it will receive the backing of an overwhelming majority in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject of major and neglected diseases in developing countries has a considerable human rights dimension to it. The rights to health and to access to medication are primarily social issues, for it is above all the developing countries that are affected by the neglected diseases, and in them, as so often, the poorest of the poor. It is for that reason that I think it is a good thing that the Bowis Report explicitly puts these in the context of other political issues, such as, for example, the cancellation of the poorest countries’ debts.</p>
<p class="contents">If these countries carry on spending 40% of their gross domestic product on servicing debts, then there will be no changes in the situation or in the health systems of the countries themselves, no matter how many resolutions we adopt in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very glad to see that Mr Bowis devotes a large part of his report to the problem of HIV/AIDS, and, as usual, takes a very progressive line on them. We must be tireless in making the point that the most important thing that can be done to combat HIV/AIDS is to prevent it, and the statement in the Bowis Report that 2004 saw new and extremely high levels of infection is an indication of a political situation of which this House has been critical for a long time, namely that there is too little funding and too little support to enable preventive measures to be properly implemented, and this criticism is primarily directed at the Bush administration in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is wrong to approach this dogmatically, as if it were only a matter of principle, without looking at the reality of the developing countries. I am grateful to Mr Bowis for enabling us in the European Parliament to join with the Commission in showing that the European Union is going down another road.</p>
<p class="contents">In all the statements, whether from the non-governmental organisation ‘Médecins Sans Frontières’ or from the World Health Organisation, one point is underlined, and that is that we will not resolve the problem by relying on market forces; rather, we will get a grip on it only with massive public investment and a greater role for the public sector, not only in Europe but also in the developing countries that are affected. I believe that this point is all too seldom made, while we very often hear demands for less public intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are serious about wanting to resolve this problem, we need an affirmation to that effect, and I was very glad to hear the Commissioner speak today about how consideration is being given to concrete measures of support, which would also involve investment in fundamental research. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that he is right to call for the extension of the Commission’s campaigns against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria to include other neglected diseases. People seem insufficiently aware that diseases like African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and dengue form a major threat to the health of very many people in the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">If medicines are available at all, they are either of very dubious quality or completely obsolete. Virtually no research and development is being done into these neglected diseases. The pharmaceutical industry is mainly interested if the sales are profitable and only invests if there are sufficient incentives. Possible policy measures that could boost investments include tax credits, innovation rewards, pre-qualification assistance and commitments to the purchase of patent rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the regulation that is intended to ensure the implementation of the WHO decision on intellectual property rights (TRIPs) and access to medicines, I hope that the Council and Parliament will reach agreement very quickly on a text that will make it possible for this important decision to be applied immediately in the 25 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, while the Commission and Member States must actively support the implementation of the Doha Declaration and oppose any measure taken by the WHO member states that could undermine these commitments, African leaders should also accept their responsibility in the fight against the major and neglected diseases. It is important that they too should make health care a priority. In this connection, it is irresponsible for certain African governments to levy a tax on the sale or import of medicines, putting these out of the reach of the poor.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community will, however, need to supplement the public and private investments at national level with long-term financial support. We in the European Parliament must continue to press consistently for 35% of development aid to be spent on health and education. Only in that way can we give renewed hope to tens of thousands of people who are still dying of diseases that could, and should, have been wiped out a long time ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are forgotten diseases here in the West, but they make their presence all too sharply felt in the South, with millions of victims every year.</p>
<p class="contents">The tsunami brought people’s suffering to light, and aid flooded in. If we can give these diseases a higher profile and mobilise the same resources, it will be possible to reduce the suffering of millions of people. Yesterday, we voted on the need for paediatric medicine, and Parliament unfortunately accorded additional patent extensions worth many billions of euros to the pharmaceutical companies as compensation, so we need in all fairness to be able to find the mere EUR 3 billion needed for devising treatments for these diseases that affect children and adults in the developing world.</p>
<p class="contents">TB and AIDS exist here in the West, so treatments do too. These diseases mainly affect adults, however, and we do not have treatments suited to children. Public funds need to be invested in this area, for the children of the developing world have no way of financing their medical needs themselves. The money may, for example, come from a 1% tax on the profits of pharmaceutical companies that has to be paid when they have found cures. There are many other solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our shared responsibility to ensure that resources for combating these diseases are created immediately. How developed a civilisation is may be judged on the basis of how it deals with its most vulnerable members. The world’s most vulnerable group consists precisely of these poor and sick children. If we cannot even help them, humanitarianism has gone out of the window, and we should return to the caves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Bowis, on his report. It is a well-balanced, well-written and well-presented report.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are talking about a problem that directly or indirectly affects three-quarters of the world's population, and its possible solutions. This means that immediate practical steps need to be taken and financial and other help provided.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, these diseases require a complex approach. Cooperation is needed between international organisations, NGOs and the private sector, as well as dedicated individuals such as researchers and petitioners. For maximum effectiveness, there needs to be complete dedication, attention and support, both financially and in the form of know-how and experts from the industrialised countries, and close cooperation with developing nations, based on partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, the problem of neglected major diseases cannot only be associated with poor developing countries. Some of the European Union's neighbouring states are not considered developing countries and yet their epidemiological situations and possible solutions are similar in nature to those in the developing world. Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova, as well as Russia, have serious problems with HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis and other diseases. We should include them in our debate and when considering financial and other forms of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">My fifth point is that, although we have discussed the threat of bioterrorism in our committees and at our part-sessions, I wonder whether we are prepared for the inevitable spread of some of the diseases mentioned in this report. There are often disaster scenarios that link the spread of some tropical diseases and their mutations to global warming. There are even warnings that some diseases such as malaria might affect our continent. Do we want to wait until our lives are directly affected before we act? People in the developing world are human beings too and it is our duty to help protect them.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not narrow down the issues presented in this report to the accessibility of drugs and cures for diseases, but should also take into account the situation of those less fortunate than ourselves. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Bowis report underlines that as a result of this, it is virtually only poor people who are affected because there are no profitable markets for the medicines. Moreover, as we have seen in the cases of tuberculosis and malaria, renewed outbreaks of the diseases can be traced back to the lack of sufficient investment in research and development. If this is to change, there must be joint efforts at international level. This illustrates the importance of the dynamic approach for which the Bowis report presses.</p>
<p class="contents">Although some diseases are not given enough attention in the developing countries themselves, it would be useful if there were initiatives in Europe that could support the control of them. The example that springs to mind is leprosy. Should the report not have devoted more attention to this disease? Has the Commission already launched various initiatives in order to combat leprosy?</p>
<p class="contents">One of the points made in the Bowis report is that we should ensure that the EU’s approach, in cooperation with the Member States, is realistic and readily understood.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, we argue in favour of obligations on the part of governments and industry that are imposed by the international community, there is relatively little hope of concrete improvements on the ground. Health is not enforceable but is a result of improving care that is supported locally by the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is important to have an understanding of the issue as a whole. Despite a strong link between disease and poverty, it is unwise to mistake the control of specific diseases for the objective of poverty reduction in general. Understanding is of crucial importance for parliamentary control in terms of the nature of the policy measures and their efficacy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Bowis once again for his stimulating report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to also thank Mr Bowis for accepting these remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with him that aid to developing countries and resolving this problem is a complex issue, but if such aid is to be effective, it needs to be comprehensive and target-oriented. This means not only the need for meticulous statistical calculations of the types of disease and their morbidity, together with their expected rates of spread, but also proposed solutions as set out in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">The diseases at issue are those which, if ignored at the outset as it was the case, for instance, with HIV infections, may spread throughout the world. The fact that we have taken the lesson was evident in the rapid and effective reaction to SARS and bird flu. We in Europe cannot afford to sleep quietly, reassured by the fact that we have resolved the problem of tuberculosis thanks to the availability of drugs and diagnostic capabilities that allow us to effectively prevent the disease, when we know that countless children in Africa are dying of the disease every day.</p>
<p class="contents">When I spoke of comprehensive aid, I also had in mind the supply of drinking water in developing countries, since its shortage directly contributes to the emergence and spread of certain diseases. I also had in mind educational programmes for children and young people concerning, for example, the issue of reproductive health, sex education and hygiene. Within the framework of this aid it is also important to provide guarantees, including financial incentives for pharmaceutical companies that stopped manufacturing certain drugs for tackling diseases of poor people, since there was no one to pay for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, it is necessary to ensure better conditions, in particular safety, for health workers who provide assistance in these regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only 700 000 of the 6 million who needed antiretrovirals could access that treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">The huge human, social and economic fall-out from this is incalculable. 60 million people, again in sub-Saharan Africa, are at risk from sleeping sickness via the tsetse fly. 2 500 million people – two-fifths of the world's population – are at risk from dengue, another mosquito-borne infection, which is now endemic in 100 countries, with no specific treatment or even a vaccine yet.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no specific treatment or vaccine available yet for the ravages of Ebola, which has hit the headlines in recent years in these parts and which has killed 1 200 since the virus was first discovered. The list of neglected diseases continues. We could also add, as our rapporteur does, the 121 million people living with depression. Nearly 9% of men worldwide and nearly 10% of women have a depressive episode each year. 873 000 people commit suicide, and that is probably underestimated. 50 million live with epilepsy, over 80% of them in the developing world; 24 million live with schizophrenia; 37 million live with dementia, mainly Alzheimer's and, with an ageing population, this is increasing all the time.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we have listed the problems, but what are the causes? Lack of clean water, lack of sanitation, lack of essential drugs, the cost of essential drugs, drug resistance issues, ineffective pesticides and drugs, drug toxicity, but above all, the main cause is the lack of political will in the developed world to do something about it. Our response to the SARS pandemic shows what we can do if we make communicable diseases a priority. This led to the establishment of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and, as our excellent rapporteur says, we urgently need the same dynamic approach to deal with the other major global diseases. Mr Bowis led us in relation to the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and he leads us here in this report. Thank you, John, you have done an excellent job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our debate today is particularly topical in the run-up to the major UN General Assembly debate on the millennium development goals.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is also topical owing to the problem created by the emergence of avian influenza and the risks created by its transmission to Europe. That is why I call on Commissioner Michel to activate all the necessary mechanisms and to take all the precautions needed to protect public health in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Every day we see a dramatic increase in diseases in developing countries, especially on the African continent. This situation is an insult to mankind and imposes on the international community, on the UN and on the European Union, the need for global action which will go beyond bombastic pronouncements and will immediately create and implement an integrated strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The increase in diseases is the result of the dramatic economic and social situation in which people live in developing countries. At the meeting of Heads of State or Government in New York, when the millennium goals will be examined, pretty words and wishes may be superfluous, but one thing is certain: none of the goals set will be achieved, especially goal no. 6 on halting and beginning to reverse the spread of AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">International commitments and undertakings are not being kept. Despite the undertaking by G8 to write off the debts of the poorest developing countries, no progress has been made to date. Despite commitments on the integration into national legislation of WTO agreements on intellectual property rights, which help poorer countries import cheaper drugs, no progress has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">Even European countries are delaying ratification and I call on the European Commission to exert all the necessary pressure in this direction. The European Commission must also, within the framework of humanitarian aid, demonstrate particular interest in the granting of bursaries to developing countries for the medical and nursing professions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to comment on a particularly important problem, the problem of the increase in mental and neurological illnesses in conflict and war zones. I refer in particular to the case of Palestine, where Israeli occupation, the blockade of the occupied territories, poverty and imprisonment have dramatically increased the proportion of mental illness, especially among young people and women. The European Commission should address the problem by financing treatment programmes in cooperation with the World Health Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty and the continuing spread of illnesses are the slavery of modern times. We bear a huge responsibility. A responsibility towards world peace, security and stability.</p>

In recent years waiving or reducing royalties on drugs for poor countries has been championed by the EU and I urge us not to be fainthearted in pressing for more concessions, whatever the complexity of the arguments, many of which I do not fully believe, and I say that as a European patent attorney, as well as a politician.</p>
<p class="contents">Only yesterday we voted measures to compensate for the cost of research for paediatric medicine. Clearly, when market forces of themselves will not provide cost-effective research for drugs for our own children, it is not surprising that there are even fewer resources available for developing and poor countries. For malaria and TB, which are already increasing in developed countries, there are several partnership research projects under way which include a pledge to make the eventual drugs affordable for developing countries. One such project is being led by Oxford University. It aims to produce a malaria vaccine and is being run in conjunction with an Oxford biotech company and a German pharmaceutical company. A TB vaccine is being similarly investigated elsewhere by others.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as being preventative, vaccines are usually one-off treatments, something which is an additional benefit in environments and countries where drug storage and dosage regimes are hard to follow or supply routes are insecure. But we have to recognise that, especially for lesser-known diseases, public funding will be essential and I believe that the EU should include this in its programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I can support this report, as will many, simply from my heart and sense of humanity, but there are reasons to support it with your pockets, for with many of these diseases delay in action will come back to bite in other ways later. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the eve of the United Nations Summit in New York, where the Millennium Goals will be at the centre of debate, this report forms part of a highly topical subject area. It is pointless to remind you that we already know that these goals will not be achieved in the timeframe that we had set ourselves and that they are about to be added to the list of promises broken by the rich nations.</p>
<p class="contents">As three out of eight of the principal Millennium Goals concern health care issues, the work of my fellow Member, Mr Bowis, should ensure there is a greater level of awareness of this reality. In addition to showing the necessary awareness of the situation, I would like the European Parliament to deliver a strong and clear message to the Member States to revive the goals. The health care issues that the poorest countries must face fuel the spiral of their under development.</p>
<p class="contents">The observation is simple; those who today have most need of treatments do not have access to them. Why? Either because they are expensive or because fundamental research and the development of research are inadequate, indeed non-existent, for certain major and neglected diseases. Furthermore, when these drugs do exist and are affordable, the populations in some cases do not have access to them, as they are not adapted to the particular sanitation conditions in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is more serious and of a structural nature; while the fundamental research is mainly carried out by the public sector, the development of these drugs is almost entirely in the hands of the private sector. Without a guarantee of profits, the pharmaceutical industry has no interest at all in investing in the development of new molecules. Any innovation is therefore dependent on obtaining highly profitable patents. It is therefore practically impossible for populations with weak purchasing power, the vast majority of whom come from the countries targeted by the Millennium Goals, to obtain these drugs, which are vital nonetheless. This logic also leads to prices being fixed at an artificially high level. In the era of globalisation, ladies and gentlemen, the health of each person must be the responsibility of all. As regards drugs, it is needs that must dictate our strategy for action to deal with the worldwide issue of health and development.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we must also encourage and support developing countries so that they might devote a minimum of 20% of their budgets to health care policies, policies of investment in research and development or policies for adapting intellectual property rules. These countries’ financial resources are, therefore, insufficient on their own. There can be no progress in today’s world as regards the major challenge of health care without a shared commitment from the public authorities and the private sector. The pharmaceutical industry must emerge from an exclusively profit-making mind-set and revise its commitments and its priorities, in particular in the research and development sector but also in the marketing sector. As for the public authorities, they must lay down legal frameworks, set objectives and offer perspectives that guarantee the common good while respecting the interests of each person.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore draw the attention of the Council and of the Commission to the need to take initiatives: to draft a new international treaty on research and development in medicine, to include within the seventh European Union Research Framework Programme a specific reference to research and development for neglected diseases, which would be guaranteed funding, to ensure that the Doha Declaration on compulsory licences is not challenged by bilateral trade agreements, and, finally, to encourage the swift entry into force of the Community regulation, currently being debated by Parliament and the Council, enabling the generic medicines industry to produce treatments that will prevent health care disasters with tragic repercussions for a large part of our planet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament has decided, by an overwhelming majority, to double the funding for the Seventh Framework Programme for Research. I hope that the Council will act in line with our decision and enable this Seventh Framework Programme to enter into force in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with doubling the budget, we also need to get the world of business involved, which, in the developing countries, means those small and medium-sized businesses that move to places where the only state structures present have to date proved themselves incapable of getting a grip on the problems. It follows that we should promote localised production in small and medium-sized businesses, along with those small businessmen who really are familiar with the needs and aspirations of local people, and, above all, we should also focus our attention on the services they use, such as the water supply, which has already been mentioned today. We should be promoting small businesses that would take responsibility for the local and regional water supply and have the right idea how to go about obtaining fresh drinking water, which is so much needed and sought after.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of development aid, we should endeavour to give guarantees, support and loans to entrepreneurs who declare themselves willing to attend to the needs of the local people in a coordinated way and in a global context. I think this would be a good use of resources and ask the Commissioner to consult with his fellow-Commissioner Mr Verheugen, for an initiative of this sort surely needs to be put centre stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The people in the developing countries, who are the subject of this debate, want to be allowed to live, and to live in a manner worthy of human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">As one might put it: ‘poor, sick, unemployed, hopeless’ – in these countries the one state often leads to the other. I regard this report as an eye-opener; it raises awareness, cries out and brings us face to face with diseases that we cannot even pronounce properly even if we have any idea how many millions of people suffer from them. No sooner did avian flu pop up than we in Europe declared ourselves prepared for it. Have we, in Europe, made preparations against infection with these diseases? We have not. Are we prepared and willing to help people fight these diseases in their own countries? Not to any adequate extent.</p>
<p class="contents">I want, then, to put forward three proposals. Here comes the first; under the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council, we resolved to raise Europe’s development aid payments to 0.7%. We must, I think, as a matter of urgency, join together with the Member States in planning how much of that can be spent on combating disease and on the health sector, with due regard for poverty, work and health.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we should increase the funding for research into them in Europe. Thirdly, I ask that all organisations, such as the one I chair, that receive EU funds in connection with development policy, should be invited to a conference at which we could consider how, together, we might be more effectively active in these fields in the developing countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am in agreement with nearly all that has been said on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">This comes at just the right moment today: two days ago, I was in fact at the rearmament conference, if I dare say so, of the Global Fund to fight against AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. There, I specifically<span class="bold"> </span>announced a number of measures I intended to take, in particular to boost the research into diseases that are endemic in developing countries and poor countries and that, unfortunately, do not always interest the pharmaceutical industry, on the grounds of poor cost-effectiveness. I am therefore more or less in agreement in saying that the public authorities and the Member States must obviously become more involved in these policies. I also announced a number of measures to encourage health professionals living in Europe or elsewhere, and who are part of the diaspora, to return to their countries. We could implement a number of incentives to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not conceal the fact that I am increasingly tempted to propose a progressive plan to you shortly in order systematically to increase the proportion of our budgets devoted to education and health care, either in the tenth EDF, or in the forthcoming budget, since this issue has still not been resolved. In actual fact, I increasingly believe that education and health care are of the utmost importance. Even though we must, of course, urgently respond to a series of difficulties and harness the resources to do this, we must reflect seriously on a real – I would say almost systematic – strategy in the areas of education and health care.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard people talk about a figure of 20%, indeed 35%. I believe that it is perhaps difficult to envisage 35% for the moment, but we could certainly plan a gradual increase over several years of the resources invested in these two sectors. I also believe, although I will no doubt come back to this point later on during the debate on the European Union policy and the debate on budgetary aid, that it would be advisable to open negotiations with the governments on sectoral aid. This would also enable us, within a specific and coherent framework with minimum conditions, to encourage governments, as public authorities, to take charge of these priority sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken note of many ideas that also appear in this report. I can assure you that I will draw a great deal of inspiration from them in order to carry out and propose policies to you in this area. Like you, I am very alert to this area, and I wish to thank all of the speakers and the rapporteur for having made available to us this excellent tool, which is a source of inspiration and which I will be sure to use. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The health systems in developing countries are permanently in trouble: repaying and servicing the debt take up roughly 40% of GDP, while the resources allocated to education and health remain pitifully low. In addition to the efforts made by individual countries, the international community must, in any case, agree to supplement those investments with adequate long-term financial support.</p>
<p class="contents">The hope is that the seventh framework programme, like the strategic Millennium Goals, will include a specific reference to research into the diseases that affect those countries and also allocate the appropriate funding. It is an absurd and, in many respects, intolerable fact that, because there are no profitable markets, there is practically no research being conducted into those diseases that almost exclusively affect poor people in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a situation needs to be put right quickly by means of a serious, tangible and prompt international commitment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
