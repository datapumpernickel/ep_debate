<p class="contents">By making continued activity at VW Forest conditional on greater flexibility and an increase in hours of work without an increase in pay, WW Forest management has blackmailed the workforce over employment. The workers only had the choice of accepting or seeing the factory close. In its resolution of 14 March 2006 on relocation in the context of regional development, the European Parliament called for measures to be contemplated against this type of employment blackmail, which might be termed ‘reverse’ relocation as it results in poorer working conditions without relocation of the company's activities.</p>

<p class="contents">The EU can nevertheless contribute to changes and restructuring, and to ensuring that these are conducted responsibly, through the structural funds and in particular the European social fund. The Commission has also held political dialogue in the context of the restructuring forum, with the aim of enhancing the exchange of experiences and tried and tested approaches between the main actors, and in particular between governments, social partners and the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union moreover has a legal framework for informing and consulting employees. I mention this because there are a number of measures that apply to the authorisation and management of restructuring, in particular the directives on collective redundancies, company relocations and European works councils, as well as the directive setting out the general framework for informing and consulting employees.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential to ensure compliance with Community legislation when it comes to informing and consulting employees. I would emphasise, though, that the task of ensuring that Community legislation is upheld falls primarily to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission fully respects the principle of autonomy for the social partners and emphasises the key role of social dialogue in resolving issues relating to organised labour and industrial relations. In this regard, the European works councils have an important role to play in supporting social dialogue at national and Community levels.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2003, the social partners adopted European-level reference principles for managing change and the social impact of change. The Commission supports the social partners in promoting and introducing these principles throughout the EU.</p>

I would simply remind you that I asked this question with a specific context in mind, namely the events at Volkswagen, but that what has happened at Volkswagen is repeated everyday within the EU. Relocations have become a common occurrence these days: we only talk about the largest ones, but they happen all the time. In my own country of Belgium, Opel recently decided to sack thousands of workers. That is the result of a very, very aggressive economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure, Commissioner, that you remember that we voted, by a very large majority, in favour of a resolution on relocations that aimed not to prevent them, because that would not be possible, but in any event to ensure that public money did not encourage them. When I say 'public money', I am referring mainly to the Structural Funds.</p>

You said before, in an initial answer, that you, as a Commissioner, are a guardian of the laws and treaties of the Union. I am well aware that this role imposes certain obligations, but of course you are also an initiator of legislation. I would therefore be interested to learn whether you do not believe it would be beneficial if the Commission finally abandoned the path of making laws for large companies, for economic operators and for all who derive huge profits from business activity and began to make laws for employees too, in order to ensure that this sort of thing becomes a rather less common occurrence in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to mention some important research, which demonstrates that relocations, in the traditional sense of the term, account for less than 2% of annual changes in employment in the EU. In other words, it is not a large amount compared to the overall movement of workers. On the other hand, that 2% applies to the EU as a whole, which means that it involves tens of thousands of people, and that is a considerable amount.</p>
<p class="contents">Your question concerns restructuring. This world is constantly changing and a great many businesses are restructuring. In this case, the Commission is taking a proactive approach. The matter is also being tackled by the restructuring forum, which resolves issues such as how best to respond to restructuring from a social and economic perspective, and this includes the search for perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that some things are not as they may first appear. Although the textiles industry, for example, has undergone major restructuring, a number of firms, particularly in Sweden but also in other parts of the world, have found their place in the textile sector, especially with the production of fabrics that are, from a technical standpoint, very demanding to work with.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, a great many openings have arisen in the area of environmental goods, machinery and so forth. In any event, I cannot at this moment offer any specific suggestions and ideas. I can only point out that, on the one hand, there are companies and branches of industry that are in decline and on the other hand, there are sectors in these branches that are developing rapidly and even new areas appearing, such as that of environmental technology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">While studying the records of the European Parliament, I noticed that there have been several oral questions on the topic of EU restrictions on the liquids which passengers may carry onto aircraft. The Commission answered Parliament in detail at its sitting of 12 February.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will know, I am not the Commissioner with primary expertise in this field and, therefore, I would humbly suggest that the answers already given by my more knowledgeable colleagues on this matter are sufficient. Nevertheless, to summarise the answers to previous questions, it must be said that, in spite of the legislation being classified as EU-restricted as required by Article 8(1) of framework Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002, the rules on liquids are being applied by the Member States in a proper and equal manner throughout the Community. The responsibility for applying the rules lies with the Member States and the Commission monitors this via its regular inspections.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, the honourable Member wishes to have additional information on this question, I would propose that he raises his questions during the debate on aviation security. Coincidentally, this debate takes place tonight and my colleague Mr Barrot, the Vice-President with responsibilities for transport, will be present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all: why is it necessary to have secret regulations? The rules on aviation security, including those adopted in Regulation (EC) No 1546/2006, are not placed in the public domain because potential terrorists could use the information for their purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission aviation security legislation is classified as ‘EU restricted’ in line with Commission Decision 2001/844/EC, ECSC, Euratom. How are our airports and airlines supposed to apply regulations – which are directly applicable rules – that are secret? The regulations on aviation security are addressed to the appropriate authority of each Member State. They have an obligation under Article 8(1) of framework Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 to communicate the information to interested parties on a need-to-know basis in accordance with applicable national rules for the dissemination of sensitive information. Thus airport security staff will get clear instructions on their obligations, not from the Official Journal of the European Union, but from the appropriate national authority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This new regulation, which forms part of the implementation of the state aid action plan, will replace existing instruments, including Regulation (EC) No 2204/2002. The Commission adopted a first draft of the regulation just today. This will allow the Commission to consult Member States and listen to the views of other interested stakeholders, including the European Parliament, in the coming months, in line with the procedure established by Council Regulation (EC) No 994/98 on the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty establishing the European Community to certain categories of horizontal state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Block exemption regulations only apply to measures which constitute state aid within the meaning of Article 87 of the EC Treaty. The fact that Regulation (EC) No 2204/2002 includes provisions on employment aid in favour of disabled workers does not mean that all state measures in favour of disabled workers are to be considered as state aid. As made clear in recital 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2204/2002, some state measures in favour of disabled workers do not qualify as state aid, for instance because they are general in nature. Such measures will continue not to be considered as state aid in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the block exemption is to ensure that Member States are not obliged to notify the Commission of those state measures which do indeed constitute state aid under Article 88 of the EC Treaty, as long as the aid measure concerned fulfils a number of conditions as specified in the regulations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Commission proposes (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2006&amp;nu_doc=0486">COM(2006)0486</a> – C6-0319/2006 – <a href="https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=en&amp;reference=2006/0165(CNS)">2006/0165(CNS)</a>) to amend Directive 92/84/EEC<a href="#def_1_4" name="ref_1_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> with a view to increasing the minimum rates of excise duty on alcoholic beverages. This proposal was backed by the argument that since 1992 the minimum rates of excise duty had not been adjusted to take inflation into account, which is 31%.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to note that throughout the last 15 years the existence of minimum excise duties has not led to convergence of the rates of excise duty within the EU. The high excise duty on alcoholic beverages is the main reason and incentive for the increase of smuggling, in Eastern Europe in particular. For instance, taxation of home production of rakia was introduced in Bulgaria, and this caused considerable public discontent.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission consider that, in view of the considerable differences in income within the EU, especially after the last two enlargements, there should still be minimum rates of excise duty on alcoholic products? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I said in my press statement when the proposal was presented on 8 September 2006, the minimum rates are the cornerstone of the EU excise duty system, which was agreed in 1992 as the minimum necessary for the functioning of the internal market. Revalorising them is a necessary step to restore the position to that which was agreed in 1992.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that greater convergence of the rates of excise duty in the different Member States is needed so as to reduce distortions of competition and fraud. However, as the honourable Member will be aware, without the agreement of all the Member States nothing can change. But to simply conclude, as the honourable Member suggests, that this is a reason for abolishing the minimum rate does not seem to be the appropriate solution in view of the need for some harmonisation within the common market, and is therefore not a viable proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to provide some more information on the issue. At the Council meeting, we found strong resistance from many new Member States, which claimed that they had nothing to do with the point of departure in 1993 when they were not part of the European Union. Together with the Presidency, we therefore presented a compromise proposal. In the compromise proposal, the point of departure was changed to 1 May 2004, the date of accession of the 10 new Member States. That immediately resulted in a much lower rate of inflation: instead of 31%, the new proposed rate is only 4.5%. That was the new proposal, but it was also vetoed by one Member State: the Czech Republic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Оставам с впечатлението, че Вие сте решили да увеличите всички нива на акцизите. Вече има Ваши предложения за по-високи акцизи върху алкохолните продукти и върху дизела. Нивата на доходи в страни като България и Румъния са повече от десет пъти по-ниски в сравнение със „старите“ страни-членки на Европейския съюз. Това създава непропорционално по-висока данъчна тежест и сериозни стимули за неплащане на данъци и „сива“ икономика. Така че тези идеи за увеличение на акцизното облагане ще доведат до още по-сериозни протести, протести които вече са факт в България. Имаше митинги, имаше подписки срещу увеличението на акцизното облагане. Предложенията, които Вие сте внесли, не са обосновани. Не виждам икономическата логика зад тях. Те ще доведат единствено до още по-високи стимули за неплащане на данъци. Например, вземете предвид, че за 15 години акцизните ставки върху алкохолните продукти не са довели до сближаване на нивата. За 15 години. Така че това, което правите няма да има ефект. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, I want to clarify that the Commission is not even dreaming of increasing or harmonising the corporate tax rate – that is very far from our intention. What we have in mind, and what we have already tabled as a general proposal – not even a legislative proposal – is the harmonisation of the tax base only, i.e. the calculation of the tax base, which is now different in each and every Member State. We have 27 different ways of calculating the tax base, which results in enormous compliance costs and administrative burdens for companies. The lack of consolidation and of transparency makes it very difficult, or senseless, to compare the corporate tax rate of Ireland, which is 12.5 %, with the corporate tax rate of France, which is over 30 %, because we cannot compare the two tax bases.</p>
<p class="contents">We have no intention of harmonising the tax rates, only the method of calculation of the tax base, and certainly we have no power to force things. If the present legislative proposal, according to our time schedule, receives unanimity in early 2008, then of course Ireland, and all the other Member States, should comply. If there is no consensus – and I think that at least at the beginning there will be no consensus – then what we can do is to present a new proposal, not for all the 27 Member States but only for those who want to join. That is what we call enhanced cooperation. Enhanced cooperation is optional. Only those Member States that agree with the purpose of the exercise would participate, and Ireland, according to the best of my knowledge, will not be among the countries that will champion participation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe that after a while, when the positive experiences are well known, then even those Member States that are reluctant for the time being and that will not join at the beginning of the enhanced cooperation can join later, because one of the conditions of enhanced cooperation is to leave the door open for other Member States who may wish to join in at a later stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question no 47 by Gianluca Susta (<a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2007-0216_EN.html">H-0216/07</a>)</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: European Schools - enrolment</span></p>
<p class="contents">The enrolment procedure for the Brussels European Schools is currently under way, under the supervision of the Central Enrolment Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">That authority is, in practice, an empty shell, because it lacks the necessary staff and resources. In particular, it is not collecting the data required for effective monitoring of current and future enrolments (for example, there are no figures on the number of siblings to be enrolled over coming years). Furthermore, not enough information is being provided; among other things, families are not sent any acknowledgement of enrolment.</p>
<p class="contents">Would the Commission not agree that, once again, a lack of professionalism on the part of the schools secretariat together with negligence on the part of the relevant DG Admin departments are likely to mean that the Board of Governors' efforts to ensure a transparent, impartial enrolment procedure will come to nothing and, above all, that enrolment policy will not improve in the future?</p>
<p class="contents">What steps does the Commission intend to take to prevent the Berkendael enrolment process from ending in failure?</p>
<p class="contents">How does it intend to ensure that appeals against enrolment decisions may be lodged with the Complaints Boards, where there are suitable legal grounds for doing so, as from the current enrolment procedure? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Board of Governors of the European Schools created a Central Enrolment Authority in order to deal with the very difficult situation caused by the host country concerning the offer of a site for the fourth school in Brussels. The Commission has constantly worked in favour of a clear and objective enrolment policy with the necessary degree of flexibility and with the possibility for parents to appeal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also kept parents and their representatives regularly informed during the school year. Therefore, the Commission does not share the opinion of the honourable Member that it has neglected its responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">As clearly stipulated by the Board of Governors in its communication adopted in January 2007, the enrolment policy for 2007-2008 will apply for this school year only. The enrolment policy for next year will be based on an in-depth analysis and the close monitoring of the situation during and after the first year of functioning of the Berkendael European School. The policy will also take into account all the pertinent elements and the progress of the pupils of the different European schools in Brussels during the 2007-2008 school year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Secretary-General of the European Schools prepared clear procedures for individual appeals and submitted a proposal to the Board of Governors to be approved at its April meeting, in order to give parents the possibility to make appeals during the current enrolment campaign. A proposal to modify the general rules of the European Schools in order to extend the powers of the Complaints Board to decisions related to enrolment was discussed by the Mixed Pedagogical Committee in March 2007, the Administrative and Financial Committee on 19 to 21 March 2007 and the Central Enrolment Authority on 28 March before being submitted to the Board of Governors on 17 April.</p>
<p class="contents">Prior to the submission of the proposal to the Board of Governors, the Commission requested that the necessary measures should be taken to ensure that deadlines for replying to the appeals are compatible with the calendar of the beginning of the next school year. The Commission is pleased that an interim ruling was adopted by the Board of Governors on 17 and 18 April and that shorter deadlines for the potential lodging of appeals by parents have been set. During that meeting, the Commission nevertheless insisted that an evaluation of the changes to procedures and to the necessary means of the Complaints Board is carried out as soon as possible in order to meet the requirements associated with the extension of its powers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the main schools are overcrowded, so, as you probably know, the Belgian authorities have designated an additional site for the next school in Laeken. Berkendael is a temporary site. So far, I have no information that parents have refused to accept the Berkendael site. I know that there have been discussions but, as you know, the European schools are an autonomous entity managed by a Board of Governors, in which all Member States are represented. All alternative sites and any proposals concerning the infrastructure of schools depend on the Belgian authorities, for whom the issue of the social infrastructure for the European institutions has become increasingly difficult. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, given the very poor provision of public transport, I should like to ask you how anyone could have hit on the idea of locating the fourth school in Laeken. The school buses that will be laid on will have to transport pupils across the entire city, which will waste a great deal of the children's time.

There are not too many sites in Brussels which meet all the necessary requirements of this complicated task. So far this has been in the hands of the Belgian authorities: they make proposals for annex sites and temporary sites and we cannot change a lot. We have tried to find other solutions together with the Board of Governors but so far that is fixed by the Belgian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to category 3 and a possible ‘ghetto’ for European officials in category 3 schools – I am using a particular type of language that is very familiar to me – these are students who are not the children of staff in the European institutions. The children of staff in other international institutions are in what is known as category 2. Category 3 involves free places which are allocated to children of other parents, based on availability. As I said, it is increasingly complicated to provide parents working in our institutions with the necessary places in our childcare facilities and schools. Of course, under this framework of rules and conditions, we must give preference to our own staff - the children of those working in the European institutions. However, I fully agree with you that there is a problem and we must think of ways of developing the European school system. There are some additional ideas on how to make this system more flexible and to develop other types of schools, among which the most promising is the type 3 school, which is actually a type of European school. Under certain conditions, these schools may provide the European baccalaureate certificate. This is the most promising part of this project and we cannot do without it. The system is in a very serious impasse, but this proposal was adopted by the Member States at a Council meeting involving representatives of ministers of education, in which I also participated.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic idea is there, therefore, and we may have many more European schools providing the European baccalaureate as a particular type of education certificate, which would be a much more open system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This modification extended the Agency’s mandate to 2015 and mandated the Agency to run the information network on education in Europe – Eurydice – from 2008. The decision was taken having heard the positive opinion from the European Parliament and the Council’s regulatory Executive Agency Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">A private body currently runs this programme on the basis of a contract with the Commission, which expires at the end of this year. The Commission has no particular difficulty in recruiting existing staff, but staff policy in executive agencies must ensure, in particular, that selection procedures for contract agents are transparent and give equal treatment to all interested candidates. To this end, the Agency has drawn to the attention of the staff working on the Eurydice activity that the selection process for contract agents was recently launched by the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO). If they take part in this selection process and are successful, the Agency will be able to offer them a contract as a contract agent.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the EPSO selection process covers a range of profiles. Provided they pass the EPSO selection process, the specific experience of staff currently working on the Eurydice activity would be taken into consideration upon recruitment. Moreover, the Agency has already committed itself to waiting for the results of the EPSO selection before recruiting the contract agents it will need for the Eurydice activity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not the case. The contract between the European institution and the private body will end and the functions will be taken over by a European agency, so this is a different process and it is really impossible to transfer people from a private body to the staff of the European Union without normal procedures. You must understand that you have in the European institutions people who are working full- or part-time – up to 40 000 people – and the rules to recruit people are very strict and very seriously followed and watched by staff unions, so the Commission is committed to following these rules very clearly. The rules are that everybody must be treated equally, and to recruit people from outside, the procedure must be under very clear staff regulations and rules, so that is the basis.</p>
<p class="contents">We had these problems when, under the administrative reforms, we transferred people from different types of contracts to the contract agent model, which was adopted as part of the administrative reform. It worked quite smoothly, so I think that those people have every possibility to continue their work, but they must pass the necessary procedures, and this is the selection procedure of EPSO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The funds earmarked for the running of Parliament's buildings in Strasbourg – the IPE-0, IPE-1 and IPE-2 (otherwise known as the WIC and SDM Buildings) – could be put to uses that are of greater benefit to society, such as scientific research. The existence of overpayments amounting, according to the estimates made by Parliament's Administration, to at least € 32 million over the 25-year lease period, has given rise to much controversy.

Of course, the Commission is solely responsible for its buildings and is not in a position to comment on the other institutions’ plans. As far as the Commission is concerned, every effort is made to ensure that the funding of accommodation for Commission staff is judiciously managed to minimise administrative costs in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission closely follows the property market in Brussels and Luxembourg and has proven to be a successful negotiator of the financial conditions for its buildings. The Commission analyses the cost-effectiveness of the various options – purchase or leasehold. The Commission has established a policy of decentralisation by locating some of its offices and DGs outside the European quarters of Brussels and Luxembourg. In so doing, not only are the prices of these decentralised buildings lower than those of the equivalent buildings in the European quarter, but there is also less pressure on property prices in the European quarter. And, very importantly, the Commission pays special attention to building efficiency by ensuring the flexibility of the fittings and by using the maximum available surface. Waste of space is reduced to a minimum. The Eco-Management and Audit Scheme was launched in 2002 to improve energy performance, consumption of resources and emissions checks in buildings.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently developing a new life-cycle cost methodology to assess the technical quality of buildings, including energy efficiency. This is expected to be applied as of September 2008. All the less efficient buildings are progressively being replaced by better designed buildings at lower cost.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much for explaining Parliament’s buildings policy, but, as I said, this is the Commission and we do not comment on other institutions’ building plans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This provision clearly states that Member States should take appropriate steps to prevent any discrimination at any stage of the management or the preparation of the European structural funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the negotiations and of the monitoring of the programme and projects, the Commission pays particular attention to ensuring that this cross-cutting principle of non-discrimination is fully respected. The Commission implementing rules also contain the obligation for Member States and regions to report on the implementation of the operational programmes, also with regard to the respect and promotion of equal opportunities principles in the context of the annual and final implementation reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the part of the question which refers to the less-favoured areas, countries and regions, cohesion policy takes a very strongly proactive approach towards the problem of poverty, which is certainly higher within those less-favoured countries and regions. Through the allocation method, this policy provides those less-favoured regions and countries with relatively higher financial resources. Also in the course of the programming and implementation of programmes, we also emphasise growth and job creation, supporting investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the European Social Fund in particular, we pursue very specific actions which are targeted to reinforcing the social inclusion of disadvantaged people with a view to their sustainable integration and employment. For the period 2007-2013 we have also done the categorisation of investment, which we use to monitor the programming. Then we will also monitor the implementation. In this categorisation of expenditures there are also several categories related to discrimination. For example, in the operational programmes we already have measures that are already visible at this stage to improve access to employment and increase the sustainable participation and progress of women at the level of EUR 2.7 billion to be invested across Europe. With regard to the specific actions to increase migrants’ participation in employment, this is EUR 1.9 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a category for improving the social inclusion of less-favoured people, especially the re-entry into employment of disadvantaged people. We already see today that across the Member States there will be nearly EUR 8 billion invested in the years to come in this category, addressing the concerns that you have expressed in your question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Regional policy in respect of island regions</span></p>
<p class="contents">The designation of 2007 as the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities for All' affects the regional policy of the EU. In order to have equal opportunities, island, mountainous, sub-mountainous, and sparsely populated areas, such as the Greek islands, need more flexible criteria for eligibility and some individual places with special problems (e.g. difficulty of access, climate, particular economic activity) require special treatment in the context of regional policy.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Commission's view of the Union's treatment hitherto of such regions? How does it explain their continuing disadvantaged position compared with the spectacular progress of other mainland and densely populated areas? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you know, the policy’s priority is to reduce socio-economic disparities between the regions and we do so through the allocation of available financial resources to the regions on the basis of their relative prosperity. However, we also examine the kinds of investment needed. We support growth-enhancing investment in the case of the less-advantaged regions, such as islands, in order to address their concerns. For the period 2007-2013 we have recognised the special situation of certain territories – not only islands but also sparsely populated and mountainous areas. We have proposed specific provisions, one of which is a higher cofinancing rate, but there are also additional financial allocations for many of those disadvantaged areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also included a specific chapter in our strategic guidelines to focus Member States’ attention on the territorial dimension of cohesion policy, in which we have underlined and emphasised the importance of those territorial units suffering from different kinds of handicaps. At this stage of the negotiations with the Member States, we are also ensuring that specific constraints which exist in those areas and islands are duly taken into account by the Member States, especially in the preparation of the operational programmes and adoption of measures for the following ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already carried out a preliminary assessment of the programmes presented to the Commission for the negotiations to see to what extent islands will be beneficiaries in the future. So far, the Commission has earmarked EUR 3.6 billion for islands. There is also a specific allocation for the outermost regions, which are also islands, and this will be EUR 3.8 billion. We have also agreed with our colleagues responsible for ESPON in Luxembourg to work on better indicators for those disadvantaged areas, in order to have more up-to-date information on those specific territories.</p>
<p class="contents">In other portfolios too, especially that of Commissioner Kroes, who is responsible for state aid, we have asked for special treatment for small islands as regards aid to help business start-ups. A 5% bonus is offered to those islands.</p>
<p class="contents">The second part of your question states that those areas remain in a disadvantaged position compared to other territories. I must say that the performance of those territories so far has not been uniform and negative. We have a range of studies that clearly demonstrate that many of those areas, in particular islands, suffer rather from their size and demography than from their specific geographical location. Many areas have experienced a significant improvement. Madeira, the Canary Islands and also areas of Greece, such as Notio Aigaio, have clearly caught up well.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to make a lengthy reply, because many people come to us with the same concerns about those disadvantaged territories. They are very close to our heart. We really care about the situation in those regions and we can also see some results. That said, I know that there is still a long way to go and we need your cooperation in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have introduced some changes also to our regulations, to our approach, to have this better visibility. This policy is based on the principle of shared management, and within this shared responsibility with Member States it is for the Member States in fact to ensure appropriate information and publicity on the structural funds intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also put into the regulation for the period 2007-2013 the requirement which is in a way consolidating and strengthening the requirements that we have today in our regulation. It says clearly that for every operational programme there should be an operational officer; for every operational programme there should be a communication plan. We also put into the regulation the minimum requirements for this kind of operational plan for communication. The information obligation also concerns final beneficiaries who must inform the public by putting up a billboard during the implementation of big projects which are also linked with physical investment and the purchase of physical material. There is also the requirement to have a permanent explanatory plaque should inform the public of European participation in the project. This is also true for training projects, where the participants must be informed by the beneficiary that EU funding is involved.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also introduced a brand new element to this through a Commission regulation. We will also have a publication giving the list of beneficiaries, as well as the amounts of public funding that they receive. So there will be national databases which will have to be publicly accessible, then the Commission will also establish a website and include on that the links to those databases. All that should be in place early next year.</p>
<p class="contents">There will also be databases created by both DG REGIO and DG EMPL containing the information at programme level – not at project level, which concerns Member States, but at programme level. It will be classified by country and by region. This will also contain the description of the operational programmes. So there will certainly be access to information: that is absolutely clear.</p>
<p class="contents">We started the exchange of experience between all the communication officers involved in November or December last year, but we will continue, reaching full speed at the end of this year. So at the end of this year we will be having the first big meeting with the communication officers of all the operational programmes just to share best practice and to exchange information about the communication activities which will have been developed by that time. I hope that through those efforts and new regulations we will be able to make this policy even more visible to the citizens. We also hope that this increased transparency will also have a positive impact on the quality of the policy and on the management of the policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as I know there is a procedure about which I am sure Mr van Nistelrooij knows, but as far as we know today, there is still an internal discussion within the Dutch Government and no proposal has yet been made to the Council to modify the Treaty, because this process would require the modification of the Treaty and only at that stage would the Commission be asked to present its opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">But in the meantime, before the Council has asked us, or before the whole process is started, we have been working with the Netherlands Foreign Ministry, providing them with the information, what this would mean, what kind of pros and cons should be taken into account, what the consequences would be for those territories if they become new outermost regions, and I hope that this information that the Commission has provided so far can help the Dutch Government to make the decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the whole process can only take place when the Council gets the application from the Dutch Government and, as I said, only then can the Commission formally make an assessment of the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">What I can say today is that the three islands that we are talking about have a very small population – just 30 000. So in terms of adding to the challenges that the funds are facing, it is not much. However, we all know that the budgetary framework has been decided for the years up to 2013, so any additional funds would have to be negotiated and decided on by the Council in particular. This would most likely be part of the whole process of change of the budget, but we are still far from this stage at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My question to you is whether you would be prepared to carry out this follow-up study together with the Dutch Government. Assessment data are available from regions such as Guadeloupe and Martinique. Would you be prepared to collaborate, so that the decision taken in due course is the most favourable? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can certainly do that, but if the islands were to change their status and the amendment of the Treaty were to take place, then EU law would be applicable and would be implemented in these territories, including all the regulations which are related to European regional policy.
