<p class="contents">As you will recall, ladies and gentlemen, at the Rhodes meeting I was given the mandate to try to present, in time for the Thessaloniki European Council, a document on issues related to European security, although this will probably not be the last document on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I must emphasise that what is significant is that for the first time the European Union wishes to have a document of this type; there is a desire not only for Member States to have their own documents, but also for the European Union, collectively, to have a document on its security strategy. I believe that this is a first, and I want to underline that this is a major step forwards in building a Europe which moves ahead by political means.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I base my approach on a fundamental principle, which underpins the entire content of the document. A Europe of these dimensions, with 25 democratic countries, which will soon have a population twice as large as that of the United States of America and four times that of Japan (and I take as examples the large countries that, like ours, have a strong currency), a Europe which accounts for approximately one quarter of gross world product must not fail, I repeat, to be an international player. Whether we want to or not, we will have to be an international player. This principle, in which I firmly believe – and in which I hope you also believe, ladies and gentlemen – must underpin our entire approach to managing the process of achieving security in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The document is about to be completed and will be presented to the Heads of Government next Thursday and Friday in Thessaloniki. I now wish to summarise its structure for you.</p>
<p class="contents">It opens with an analysis of the security environment in which we live, which obviously includes regional conflicts and the causes of these conflicts that affect us: poverty, exclusion, or a lack of natural resources. The report then goes on to look at more recent threats such as international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and failed states.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of this analysis, it moves on to a second chapter which addresses what must, in our opinion, be the main strategic objectives for Europe’s security. Logically, the first strategic objective must be to extend and stabilise the security zone around the European Union, in other words, around our continent, specifically to the east and the south.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the document that the Commission presented recently on the new Europe and Europe’s borders is largely concerned with where and how the European Union should start developing its security environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important point about strategic security objectives must, in our opinion, be to strengthen the international order. We could probably describe Europe’s place in the international order in this way: we are effective multilateralists and it is on effective multilateralism that we must base our theory of the world order. For this reason, we are working and wish to continue working to protect Europe’s security through all organisations and specifically through the United Nations. Of course, there are players that have more individual roles to play, such as the United States, the Russian Federation and other large countries or major international players.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to say, however, and we have attempted to make the document reflect this deeply-considered idea, is that in order to ensure an effective multilateral system and more specifically the credibility of the United Nations system, we must in theory be prepared to ensure that all the principles on which the United Nations is founded are observed and that this organisation has the credibility that it deserves.</p>
<p class="contents">When some of the principles underpinning the Charter and some Security Council resolutions are not observed, the European Union cannot remain passive and must act; and it must act with all the considerable means available to it. Fortunately, the European Union has a whole panoply of means for acting that range from diplomatic activity to armed peacekeeping action.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hughes, who is not present at the moment, made a useful incidental observation on how the European Union can also play a major role in effective dialogue in the event of conflict. We must have the courage, however, to say to ourselves that when rules, the principles that we have all decided to defend in the context of this effective multilateralism are flouted, the European Union must also be willing to face up to this breach of international agreements or contracts, be they political or of any other type.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the third point that must be made is how to deal with the new threats, which are terrorism, the proliferation of weapons and failed states ... On these issues which are new or which involve new aspects, although some of them have been around for many years, we have to say that they are risks and threats of a different kind to those that we have experienced before. The first difference is that they can be perpetrated from a distance. Throughout the cold-war era, we were used to having threats at our borders. Today we are facing perhaps the first threat situated far from our border and we consequently need to deploy our capacities beyond our borders. I therefore believe that when we were given the mandate in Helsinki, at the end of 1999, to start considering how the European Union could undertake civilian and military action, this possibility was also being considered.</p>
<p class="contents">These new threats are also dynamic, and we must therefore prevent them and try, as soon as possible, to ensure that they are not allowed to become a reality, whether they are caused by hunger, climate change or other types of conflict, such as ethnic or religious struggles. I believe that swift prevention is an obligation incumbent upon us and must form one strand of the philosophy underlying the European Union’s action.</p>
<p class="contents">These new threats are more complex, more complicated than anything we have experienced before and consequently our response to them cannot be a simple one. We cannot respond to something that is complex with simplicity; our response must also be complex and it would, in my opinion, be a mistake to think that there can be a military solution to these problems. I do not believe that there can be and what we therefore have to do is make use of all the means, the entire panoply of means available to the European Union as a whole. These range, as I have said, from diplomacy, humanitarian aid, crisis management, trade, sanctions etc. to managing crises with military means. I believe, however, that it would be an extremely serious mistake to think that the only solution to this type is a military one. I also believe it would be wrong to think that the focus of the war against these new threats should be strictly military.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like the document to end with a call for a Europe with clearly-defined characteristics, a Europe that must be more active on the world stage and which must therefore have the political will to act.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the debate that has taken place in recent months in the Convention leads to the conclusion, not only by Parliament but also by the citizens of our continent, that if we genuinely want to assume our rightful position in the world, with the wealth and the well-being that we enjoy, we also have obligations associated with these benefits and these obligations must be met. There must, therefore, be greater activity, a greater political will to act and this, I believe, is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">If we wish to act, therefore, we must have the capacity to act; and hence we must also make the necessary effort, which involves developing military and civilian capacities; and I cannot conceal the fact that having greater capacities to act and to exert influence in the world also requires more resources.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament and national parliaments, national governments, will have to face up to this reality; otherwise our words will be somewhat hypocritical. We cannot cry when we see the suffering of others on television and yet not be willing to do what needs to be done. In order to do what needs to be done, we must have the resources and these resources are going to have to come from the citizens of our continent, of our own European Union, who will also have to be generous enough to pay for the resources necessary to undertake the action that we are being asked every day to carry out.</p>
<p class="contents">In my first speech, I spoke about the operation in the Congo. This is an example of what we might have to do in future and it will surely be on a larger scale. We are able to undertake such action at the moment because of the means we can pool together, but also because of the means available to some nations in particular that can take on this role; others cannot. We must all, therefore, make an effort to maintain a level of capacities that will enable us to play the role we say we want to play.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat, the Europe we want is a Europe that has greater visibility, a will to act, and the means with which to put this will into practice; it is a Europe that also has the necessary coherence to act, and by this I mean that there must be coherence, within the European Union and in all of its institutions and between the European Union and its Member States so that the entire effort, for example the diplomatic effort, can bear fruit. Consider for a moment that the European Union’s diplomatic network, with all of its Member States, would be considerably greater than that of the country with the largest diplomatic network. If we put it to the service of a cause, we would probably be a thousand times more effective than we are at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the document that we shall be presenting to the Heads of State and Government on Thursday and Friday in Thessaloniki follows this approach, which I believe is in line with the ideas of most Members of this Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. Mr President, over the last three or four years the High Representative and I have made speeches on this subject which I guess you could measure by the metre, and if you were to look at them, you would find that they were all remarkably similar and reflected the arguments which the High Representative has put again so forcefully and ably today.</p>
<p class="contents">In many respects it is remarkable that the European Union has proceeded so far and so fast towards a Common Foreign and Security Policy, and towards a Security and Defence Policy without the benefit – until now – of a formal Security Strategy. The Commission very much welcomes the decision to rectify that omission and looks forward to the debates that will take place on the strategy document which is going to come forward shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">On the defence and military side there has been impressive progress in creating European capacities that the Union is already beginning to put to use. As the High Representative has said, we need to be explicit about our strategic purposes, and the circumstances in which the European Union might deploy force. As I have said before and as he has said, we also have to challenge our colleagues in government and our electorates about the gap which exists between ambition and what people are prepared to pay, and what people are prepared to cooperate over.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, as I have said before, is not a silent and disinterested onlooker in this debate. We have no direct role in defence and military matters, and even in the absence of my honourable friend Mr Van Orden, I repeat that we do not aspire to a direct role in defence and military matters. But whatever the EU does militarily – whether in conflict prevention, crisis management or post-conflict reconstruction – is inevitably part of a wider European strategy including many elements for which the Commission does indeed have the lead responsibility. The European Union needs a seamless approach, which is why the High Representative and I – with our respective services – have worked so closely together, and why I am pleased that the European Convention has proposed even closer integration in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The real point I want to make, however, is that defence and military issues are only one dimension – and for the European Union still a relatively small dimension – of any 'Security Strategy' which is worthy of the name.</p>
<p class="contents">In a sense, the EU itself – its creation, its development and its enlargement – can be seen as a European Security Strategy, and it has been a brilliantly effective one. The Union has provided the central economic and political organising principle for our continent over the last half century, helping to secure democracy and stability for countries emerging from dictatorship and oppression. Through the Wider Europe agenda, too, we seek to extend stability to our neighbours and the circle of friends around us. Perhaps the central element in any security strategy for Europe must be to ensure that the EU itself continues to prosper and to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond that, the EU is a major contributor to international security in a host of different contexts: through, for example, our contribution to global trade. The EU has played a central role in the creation and development of the World Trade Organisation, and we are now engaged in the Doha Development Round. It would be hard to exaggerate the importance of that work for global security, because security and prosperity are so closely intertwined.</p>
<p class="contents">We also contribute to global security through external development assistance. I have pointed out to the House before that we are responsible – the EU, the Commission and Member States – for about 55% of all such assistance worldwide, and for about two-thirds of all grant assistance. That is a vital contribution to security because poverty and inequality are not just moral issues but also security issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Through our assistance, too, we work for human rights and for better governance. Again, these are security issues linked, for example, to the fight against terrorism, because inequality and oppression are the breeding ground of hatred, intolerance and violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, however, the EU can contribute to international security through its work in – and support for – multinational frameworks and disciplines that are increasingly necessary and important for managing the affairs of an interdependent world. I am thinking here of UN disarmament and non-proliferation Conventions; environmental Treaties such as the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change; and, of course, the International Criminal Court. I could go on – but the point is clear. We cannot simply divide between our security interests on the one hand and our development and trade interests on the other. In order to prevent future violent conflicts we have to have policies on environmental degradation, poverty and global governance, AIDS, Justice and Home Affairs, nuclear safety, and so on. I think the point is clear.</p>
<p class="contents">So the underlying conclusion is that effective multilateralism should be the motto on the European Union’s banner. That is the essence of our security strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall say a brief word about small arms and light weapons, because that too underlines the importance of practical and effective multilateralism. We are committed to combating the spread of small arms around the world. A code of conduct on arms exports was adopted five years ago, under which Member States set high common standards for the management of conventional arms transfers. The code has since established itself as a comprehensive international arms export regime. In a joint action covering small arms later in 1998 the EU pledged to promote a number of principles including commitments by all countries to supply small arms only to governments, and to import and hold arms exclusively for their legitimate security needs. The EU has set aside funds for the provision of financial and technical assistance to small arms programmes and projects around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to the publication of the document on security. As the High Representative said, this will be the beginning of a very important debate, and of course much of that debate will take place in these hallowed chambers.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, ladies and gentlemen, it is my belief that events in the current and previous year have made apparent our real need for clear thinking on this issue. Commissioner Patten has described the many areas in which the European Union is actively involved, and it might well make sense for us to view them as parts of a coherent whole in order to make clear how much these – in many areas, thoroughly presentable – instruments benefit each other. This is where issues connected to overseas and development aid will of course be of correspondingly great importance. What this means is that potential tensions need to be reduced where the prevention of poverty is concerned, and both those actively involved and the European public need to become more aware of the fact that these are also instruments whereby we conduct foreign policy, and that they are in the interests of our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of this discussion about prevention, an area in which so much is being done, Mr Solana is indeed right to say, as he has done in this debate, that we have to find the right combination of prevention, military capacity, and the measures needed for reconstruction in the aftermath of action. I believe that there is something missing here, either in terms of awareness or of practice. If – as we are right to do – we do indeed perform these preventive tasks, we see that they, in themselves, do not give the European Union any greater influence, as the military option has to be available to us if we are to be able to make it clear that we could also take other kinds of action. This was our experience in the Balkans in the early 1990s, when the European negotiators brought about some thirty-four ceasefire agreements – I am not sure precisely how many – and the reason why none of them came to anything was that Milosevic knew perfectly well that we lacked the military capacity to ensure that these ceasefire agreements were kept to. Bit by bit, right up to the Cologne Summit, and, beyond that, in Saint-Malo and on many other occasions, we learned the necessary lessons from this, which have now enabled us to progress further.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, too, though, we see that this must first be incorporated into a real strategy, that it is not yet fully operational, and that we do not yet know how it is to work, as, of course, we have to evaluate certain of its constituent parts in relation to this. What priority do we in fact give to combating terrorism, and to what extent do the instruments enable us to do that? The argument adduced by the Americans in relation to the war in Iraq was also to some degree an argument about terrorism. Are we ourselves clear in our own minds about the extent to which traditional military means can be deployed to combat terrorism? The same applies to the area of non-proliferation. If we could do as – for example – the Israelis did in Iraq in the early 1980s, and destroy a nuclear power plant with a single pre-emptive strike, thereby preventing the development of any nuclear capability, could this be part of such a strategy, one that might enable us, with less or scarcely any loss of human life, to develop capacities to prevent immense dangers and subsequent wars? I believe that we have to answer these questions. On this occasion, I am framing them as questions, but they ought to form part of a specific and consistent approach if we are to be able to put something on the table in the way that the Bush administration has done, where we can identify both similarities and differences and will very definitely be enabled to conduct on a stable basis the dialogue with the United States that is necessary if we are to start working together or perhaps achieve a rapprochement, and that will help enable the Americans to abandon unilateralism.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that the European Union is itself a security policy measure; that is one of the primary reasons for its existence. The wider Europe that this is intended, astutely enough, to organise on a multilateral rather than merely bilateral basis, which is meant to be the European Economic Area with something added; our relations with Russia and the developing world and also with the Mediterranean countries – all these things are vitally important, but, in this context, we must indeed give some thought to the future of our relations with the United States, and it is my belief that, in the long term, NATO will not, on its own, be a sustainable bond between us. As regards NATO and transatlantic relations, there are two conditions, which we too must fulfil: only if we are strong will we be partners to be taken seriously, and there is no partnership when, rather than both sharing in decisions, one partner takes the decisions and the other merely follows behind. We have to play our part in creating the right conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point in relation to all this is that we have to put our relations on a broader basis, one that has to do with more than security policy and the military, and that is why we need again to seize the initiative and have the sort of discussions that we had at the beginning of the 1990s, which I might perhaps sum up under the heading of ‘transatlantic market place’ in order, on this basis, to put something in place in many of the areas in which the European Union is competent. We, and the USA, have treaties with every country on earth, but we have no treaty with each other. If such a strategy is to be complete, I believe that we should give some thought to this.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wiersma (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, Mr High Representative, Commissioner, the development of a European security strategy is a major step forward. After all, by establishing the principles and objectives of the policy, it becomes more coherent and provides a framework for what has been achieved over the past few years. It does not guarantee that the European Union will also speak with one voice, but it does make it more logical and easier to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The confusion surrounding Iraq, but also the new US security strategy, lie behind today's debate. The need for such a debate, however, is born out of the European Union's increased ambition to play a greater security role. Fortunately, this ambition remains unabated even after this year's events. The details of the document to be presented in Thessaloniki are as yet unknown, but we assume, as Mr Solana has already indicated, that the strategy is based on a broad interpretation of security.</p>
<p class="contents">A lack of security has many causes and requires a large number of varied instruments to combat it. New threats, such as international terrorism, require more attention. We also back the implementation of an EU action plan against the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Countries that violate agreements or form a great risk must be tackled, Iran being a case in point. The threat of violence should not, however, be the first line of attack, but the EU should also consider how the Treaty could be further reinforced to combat the spread of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few months, much has been said about the European Union's deficient military capacity. We are said to offer too little counterweight to US supremacy. In my view, this is the wrong approach. It is not about having to outdo the Americans militarily, but about being able to act just as effectively in a different way and with a different combination of resources whenever we deem this necessary. This should not be done unilaterally – that is not our style – but within multilateral frameworks and, in particular, with the involvement of the UN. We have never ruled out the use of military force, but it should be seen as a last resort when all other avenues have been exhausted. It should be deployed effectively and proportionately. This is why, even after the event, we remain doubtful as to the justification of the war against Iraq. We hope that the EU strategy will be clear about the role of the military instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this philosophy, we nevertheless have to conclude that the development of the military dimension of the Common Foreign and Security Policy is trailing behind our ambitions. We therefore support the intentions to ratchet up the speed and develop more activities in this area, and we are prepared to hold an open discussion about the financial implications. Mr Solana made a passionate plea for an open debate of this kind a moment ago.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we are confident about another priority, namely conflict management and crisis management, being fully integrated in the new strategy. This is still the current CFSP's strongest asset. Closer to home, also in Europe, we operate more effectively than outside it. We assume that the High Representative is taking these experiences into consideration, and we are also looking forward to seeing how the strategy will work out for the different regions where the European Union wants to be active.</p>
<p class="contents">When he and the Council work towards an approach characterised by what I indicated above, he can count on my group's unqualified support. A new and valuable discussion has commenced, and we want to take an active part in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is in the interests of both the EU and the United States. That is something we owe to ourselves, as well as to the Americans who, for many years, have been the guarantors of peace in Western Europe. We therefore need closer institutional ties between NATO and the EU so that we might react more consistently to the new global challenges in terms of combating international terrorism, organised crime and the spread of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective is therefore the continued development of the EU’s defence dimension – which is also supported by the United States – as the European pillar within NATO. The EU must increasingly work in partnership with the Americans, and not in opposition to them. The transatlantic alliance can only be maintained in the long term if a proper European defence identity is introduced. The news we received from the foreign ministers’ meeting in Luxembourg concerning a stronger and more pro-active foreign and defence policy was therefore encouraging, and it is with great excitement that we now await the High Representative’s proposal for the first common European security strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">We can be happy about the fact that the Council generally wishes to strengthen European defence and cooperation around research and development in this area, but the proposal should also fully support the re-establishment of the transatlantic partnership. In this connection, it has been gratifying to read what has been termed the Allbright declaration on this partnership. The declaration also states that the partnership is the supporting pillar of NATO cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that that is the task to which we first have to put our minds, and I should like to see us beginning to talk about what our priorities are to be. I think the main priority should be for the EU to be the mainstay of an international legal order and of international agreements and for it to be among those backing international weapons control. Some of those priorities have been given all too little weight for many years, and it is an obvious task for a specifically cooperative organisation like the EU, which is based upon agreements between old enemies. We must continue that tradition, extend it to the international level and ensure that we become the mainstay of the UN so that international law again comes to prevail.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to hear what the Council’s and the Commission’s plans are in anticipation of the UN meeting in July on the control of light weapons, for this is one of those areas in which the EU could have a role to play. We are of course one of the main producers of these weapons, and we also try to control them. We have a code of conduct from 1998 – mentioned, I believe, by Commissioner Patten – but, of course, weapons prove, all the same, to end up in the wrong hands and on the wrong markets. We need to follow this agreement up, with the possibility of monitoring weapons throughout their life cycle. We can do this with dairy cows in the EU. Would it not be marvellous if we could do the same with weapons? What plans exist for doing so? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are those who say that our real security lies in mediation, cooperation and prevention. Then there are others who say that our security depends on our defence and intervention capacities and associate it more with military aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned, the basis of our security is the credibility of our politics. Are we credible when in our association agreements with the Maghreb countries, for example, or other countries, we insert an Article 2 that talks about human rights and democracy and then quickly forget this article in our actual relations with these countries? No, no one takes us seriously! We sign association agreements and whenever things get complicated we forget one of the aspects of our security: being surrounded by democracies. The more democracies there are, the less the risk of war. Are we credible? Elmar Brok is right when he asks if we were credible in the Balkans. No. We proclaimed: peace, peace, peace. Men were massacred and we had no power to intervene. We therefore were not credible.</p>
<p class="contents">When we are told that our positions must be consistent with those of the Americans, that we must not go against the Americans, I say that we should be neither for or against the Americans. Yet is it credible to say that we are going to war because there are weapons of mass destruction when in fact there are none and it is a lie? We are not credible. Do Europeans have the right to say that a lie is a lie? Are all pro-Americans still annoyed when we say that the Americans lied, that Colin Powell lied in the Security Council? Let us take another example. Are we credible when we invoke international law as an argument? Yet is international law, as it exists today, the Bible? No. Is a Security Council without Brazil, without India, without South Africa a Security Council for today’s world? No. Therefore, fighting for international law is to fight to reform it, to change it. We must stop saying the same thing over and over: international law as it currently stands came from the Cold War and the Cold War is no longer our problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end with a comment on terrorism. Once again, are we credible in this respect when on the one hand, along with others, we quite rightly say that we had to intervene in Afghanistan to combat the terrorism, yet on the other hand we remain silent on everything that has happened in Guantanamo? Fighting and struggling against terrorism is to fight and struggle for the rule of law, wherever it may be, during war and in the different forms of war. If we do not succeed in resolving these problems together, we are not credible. Therefore, as far as I am concerned, the basis of security is credibility.</p>

It will not be the first strategy, or first draft of a strategy, to be presented, and it will certainly not be the last. Unlike Mr Cohn-Bendit, I take the view that the weak point of this strategy is in fact the point in time at which it is being presented. The impression is given that it is a counter-strategy in response to the USA. The European Union and its security strategy would, I think, have been important enough, without being made to be that sort of initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">What is true is that the scenario in which we are now living is a new one, characterised by insecurity brought on by regional crisis situations making themselves manifest in international terrorist networks and acts of terrorism, to which they are also exposed. It is also true, though, that the USA and the EU take a different view of this threat, and respond to it in different ways. The USA sees itself as being at war with international terrorism and claim that this entitles them to launch pre-emptive strikes. That is what they did in Afghanistan and in Iraq, putting their trust in their military strength, which nothing in the European Union can match.</p>
<p class="contents">The European presence and the definition of its tasks are quite different under such circumstances. Up to now, Europeans have been neither able nor willing to open up military fronts in dealing with international threats. I therefore regard their involvement in crisis situations – whether in Afghanistan, from which I returned only yesterday, or in the Congo, as is now being planned – as something to be honoured, but too symbolic and too inconsistent. Simply showing the flag is far from enough. Important though they may be, presences of this sort therefore expose themselves to security risks that are hard to calculate and often call forth expectations that we cannot fulfil.</p>
<p class="contents">For as long as the Member States of the European Union are not prepared to top up their defence budgets too and make the necessary funds and manpower available, all these doctrines and strategies will seem like empty forms of words. In view of the opposing views within the EU, the attempt at a common strategy seems more like an attempt at concealing differences of opinion rather than removing them, and that is something of which we should beware. The devising of strategies and the creation of joint roles such as that of a European Foreign Minister – which I essentially welcome – do nothing to make up for the lack of the political will to give life to a common European policy and security strategy. The problem of a dualism between the USA and the European Union, and of their mutual alienation, can only adversely affect the quest for a common European security strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This confirms that the choice to create an EU 'minister for foreign affairs' is the right choice, but I hope that he will not function later on like Janus who, according to mythology, changed his face to suit the circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">During the last decade, we have increasingly noticed the difference between the European Union and the USA on important issues. The International Court for crimes against humanity, the Middle East crisis, the crisis in Iraq, the general perception about preventive war and so on. In practice, this gives rise to the need for the European Union to define its own independent strategy so that, on the basis of this independence, it can redefine its relations with America and correct its mistakes. This redefinition is a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span>, because the axis of the Union's strategy must again rest on its relations with the USA. Good accounts make good friends.</p>
<p class="contents">What, however, should this strategy rest on? On certain positions in principle and an equal footing. And an equal footing, in this particular case, means parity. What does parity mean? That you have your own opinion, but you also have your own capabilities so that, if necessary, you can formulate your opinion as a policy, negotiate it and obtain results.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in a new era. So-called one-sided threats are completing older procedures and crisis conditions and thus the European Union is obliged <span class="italic">de facto </span>to play a new international role. And personality on strategy issues is precisely what the new international role calls for. This personality cannot result from minor moves. It must be the result of an international analysis, an international definition of its personality and its principles. I believe that we shall do well and that Mr Solana's proposals will be the first step towards the Union's subsequently acquiring independence in its relations with all the powers of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some half a billion small arms and light weapons are in circulation worldwide, more than half of which are illegal. In 46 of the 49 major conflicts since 1990, weapons of this kind were used. These weapons are also largely responsible for the phenomenon of child soldiers. Small arms and light weapons are easy to come by, in some places for USD 15; they are easy to operate, easy to conceal and transport and, above all, are ever so deadly.</p>
<p class="contents">According to an independent study in 2001, small arms claim the lives of more than 1 000 people, mainly innocent people, every day. Internationally, there are hardly any rules in the area of the production and spread of small arms and light weapons. The Ottawa Treaty on the use of anti-personnel mines forms an exception to this. Unfortunately, we have to establish that the largest producers of small arms and light weapons, namely the US, Russia and China, are also the most fervent opponents to international legislation in the style of Ottawa. In order to get a real grip on the proliferation of small arms, transparency is what is first and foremost required. The UN register for conventional weapons should be opened to this category of weapons. The rules on arms exports must be stepped up. The application of identifying marks during the production of new weapons must become compulsory, so that their origins can be traced more easily. I share Commissioner Patten's view that the 1998 European code of conduct should serve as a model for a worldwide, binding agreement on arms exports and transfers.</p>
<p class="contents">During the UN Conference next July, the European Union should take the lead in the fight against the illegal trade in small arms and light weapons. Indeed, there is a risk that all efforts in the field of conflict prevention will be in vain if the root causes are not tackled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In recent events in the Congo, approximately 50 000 people have been victims of the use of light weapons. We are also sending soldiers to stop the fighting there despite the fact that most of the fighting is taking place with weapons supplied by countries within the European Union. People in the Congo have not actually made these weapons: they have come from countries in the EU – including France, Belgium, the UK, etc. – and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">There seems to be a complete contradiction: we are sending people to stop the fighting in places where the weapons used originate in the countries of origin of the so-called 'fighting preventers'. In relation to the UN review on the programme of action coming up in July 2003, we also need to look at things that remain to be done. We must close loopholes on the end-use of weapons; on where they actually go and how are they used. There is a serious loophole in relation to where weapons go, who uses them and what the end consequence is.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to tackle very seriously the brokers of arms. There are people making huge amounts of money by dealing in arms, by ensuring that countries and people can actually get arms from the arms suppliers.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Frahm mentioned in relation to registration, it is absolutely incredible that you can actually trace a piece of meat or an agricultural product, yet you cannot trace a lethal weapon. It is about time the EU owned up to its responsibility and made it impossible for light arms to be traded like this, causing the death and destruction of many innocent people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Globally, more than half a billion small arms are in circulation. The use of these arms is responsible for the death of about 500 000 people every year. Small arms claim 300 000 victims in wars and roughly another 200 000 in non-war situations.</p>
<p class="contents">In <span class="italic">Bowling for Columbine</span>, the documentary maker, Michael Moore, showed recently the consequences small arms have, even in a country such as the United States: homicides at secondary schools, among youth gangs and in the criminal world. Invariably, the weapons have been obtained illegally. Many people are, however, the victims of small arms and light weapons, including in conflicts such as the present one in Congo.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to combat the illegal trade in small arms, adequate legislation is required, as well as regulations with regard to the trade in – and production, transit and possession of – small arms, and the distributive trade in weapons must also be monitored. Weapons must be easy to trace and therefore be provided with a clear mark. Moreover, records must be kept and it must be possible to exchange this information. To prevent small arms from entering the illegal circuit, adequate stock management, safe transport and storage, and the destruction of surplus weapons are necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the UN Conference in New York in three weeks' time, it is important for the EU to play a pioneering role once again. It can do this by calling for proper monitoring procedures for these weapons, by stepping up existing legislation on monitoring the distributive trade, by insisting on effective traceability and clear marking of weapons, and by pressing home all these requests by being the first in Europe to tackle this legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I often talk about the importance of Europe speaking with one voice. This step towards unity has been made by the fact that six groups in the European Parliament are united in making this plea. The Council and the Member States are still to follow suit. I hope that they will follow this example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As in 2001, when the United Nations Conference on the illegal trade in light weapons was held and we welcomed the action plan, we now welcome the assessment meeting that will take place next month. Precisely with regard to this assessment meeting, we wish to recall, as has already been said, that 500 million small arms and light weapons are at large in the world and cause thousands of deaths every day, according to the 2001 Independent Weapons Study. Furthermore, most of the victims are women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">The illegal trade in small arms and light weapons to developing countries, which are often embroiled in conflicts, originates mainly in Member States of the European Union, in addition –as has also already been pointed out – to the United States and Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The Conference and the action plan now under review have not managed to establish a binding international legal instrument that prohibits illegal trading. The European Union must focus its efforts on producing a code of conduct that prevents weapons reaching these warring countries, regimes that systematically breach human rights and armed groups that, as has already been said, recruit child soldiers. We should, therefore, translate these aims into joint action, first by the Member States, whose national laws on the matter are – unfortunately – totally disparate, and then apply these to the international community as a whole. The assessment meeting presents a good opportunity to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">Light weapons must fall under the control of an international system, as has been done with anti-personnel mines and chemical and biological weapons. The European Union should, therefore, take the following proposals to New York: firstly, to establish an international registry of weapons sales; secondly, a specific ban on the sales of light weapons to regimes that breach human rights and thirdly, to establish a system for tracing weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with these requests to the Council and to the Member State governments, requests that we put forward in the resolution we would like to see adopted, we also wish to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to step up its cooperation in demobilising armed groups in developing countries. At present this applies most particularly to Africa. The current conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Liberia amongst others demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the policy we have implemented to date and the need to monitor weapons sales. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also believe – as many speakers have said – that it is good news that the European Union can now start thinking seriously and jointly about a common security strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for this to happen, however – and I repeat what several speakers have said – it is absolutely crucial not only to have in place good documents and good structures; there must also be the political will to act in worldwide organisations in a way that reflects the European Union’s significance in terms of population, wealth, etc. if the political will to do so exists, it can be done. Otherwise, however magnificent the papers we produce on the subject might be, they will again be simply papers and nothing else.</p>
