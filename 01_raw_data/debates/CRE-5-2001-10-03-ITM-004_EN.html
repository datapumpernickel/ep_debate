This was written by Mr Prodi in a guest column in the <span class="italic">'Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</span>' on 27 July this year. I indeed hear this gospel, but I have no faith! The Miller report is evidence to the contrary, defining things that are self-explanatory. It tells us, for example, what a floor is, what is meant by 'behind' and 'in front' and informs us that provision must be made for passages through which two coaxial cylinders must be able to pass. The whole thing is actually absurd, but – and here I refer back to the quotation from Romano Prodi – Europe's citizens will rightly ask themselves whether we have nothing more important to occupy us. It was therefore with extreme annoyance that I took part in this brief vote on the Miller report.</p>

Until now, we had an almost total legislative silence about the environmental damage caused by noise. Our parliaments lent a deaf ear, although this in no way reflected the real-life experience of the citizens of the Union. More than a quarter of them, one hundred million, believe they are the victims of noise and the economic repercussions of this noise in the environment oscillates at between EUR 10 and 40 billion. So we can only welcome the pioneering measures set out in this report. We do indeed need to introduce noise mapping. It is as necessary and salutary as the mapping of dangerous sites, which we now realise, all too late, is a vital measure. This information is useful only if it is given to the public quite transparently. It is meaningful only if it is constantly updated in terms of geography and choice of indicators. Lastly, identifying these noise nuisances will only be useful and effective if it is accompanied by penal and coercive measures against the noise-makers, be they civil, public or military. Over and above these practical imperatives, we can really only combat euro-noise today if we do so at European Community level. We therefore continue to call for common European standards. Noise respects no frontiers; noise penetrates every wall, resounds through every space. We therefore urged all our parliamentary colleagues to support this report and we welcome the outcome. Noise pollution reaches us in diffuse, sporadic and intangible ways; often it even forms part of our daily environment. Noise is not as black as oil, or as acrid as chemical waste; yet it is just as harmful, in condensed form. I hope therefore that the demands set out in this report will not be regarded simply as sound and fury but that the European Union will manage to make them resound for a long time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But Europe must not come along and act as a kind of noise extinguisher to make up for mistakes in land use planning.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not calling the general objective into question; but if our action is to be effective, it must be pragmatic, like the action we took on air quality.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not up to Europe to introduce unilateral standards and impose them on everybody throughout its territory with no regard for specific local conditions. Europe is already intervening in relation to tyres, aircraft engines, road surfaces…</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for the measures to take account of these territorial disparities. Europe must do more to make the Member States aware of their responsibilities here, it must urge the local authorities to take the necessary measures on the basis of the local situation, rather than deciding on their behalf. In this case I subscribe to the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take airports as an example: it would be ineffective to set uniform noise limits for all airports. Conditions vary widely from one airport to another. Each airport is unique (runway configuration, distribution of traffic and so forth). The impact of aircraft noise differs from one airport to another and it would make more sense to take measures to reduce noise emissions at national, regional and local levels. Moreover, it seems quite incredible to find no distinction drawn between international and regional airports!</p>
<p class="contents">Nor should we forget that airports are important to the area concerned. Air transport infrastructure is a vital factor in industries' choice of where to locate their plant, and therefore vital in terms of jobs too.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also remind you that the title of the directive is 'Noise evaluation and management'. So evaluation comes before management. How can one think of fixing limit values without first carrying out a precise, horizontal study, based on agreed, common evaluation criteria? Furthermore, the first stage would be to set up a system for evaluating noise levels in the different Member States and to draw exact noise maps region by region. Only when this information is available should Member States be encouraged to formulate an effective action plan, working together with all the local authorities and elected representatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People’s night rest is increasingly being threatened by continuous noise. Unfortunately, the Council and the Commission’s standpoint still harks back to the first half of the twentieth century, a time when cities, traffic and the economy were on a much smaller scale and growth was still welcome. That is apparent from, among other things, the fresh attempts to protect the position of airline companies. Instead of tackling overcapacity by imposing a tax on fuel, thus removing the competitive edge compared with more environmentally-friendly modes of transport, there is now a renewed attempt to reduce the tax burden for the sake of continued growth in air traffic and airports. Mr De Roo is right – also at second reading – to adhere to previous choices made by Parliament with regard to the restriction of night-time pollution, short terms, clear definitions of noise pollution, and daughter directives on noise emissions of lorries, buses, motorcycles, trains and aircraft. It is now only the need for a majority of 314 votes to break the opposition that threatens to lead to a long-term stalemate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I believe it adopts a balanced position and takes account of the well-being and health of the citizens who are, indeed, being more and more exposed to noise pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the substance, I agree with the Commission's idea of harmonising the noise indicators and the methods of evaluating ambient noise. Next, thanks to these common indicators and evaluation methods, it will indeed be possible to compile information on noise exposure, in the form of 'noise maps' without, at least for the moment, fixing noise limit values for the entire European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I wanted to continue excluding military airports from the scope of the framework directive. I am glad no amendment calling for their inclusion was tabled at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also satisfied with the deadline for incorporating the directive into national law (30 June 2003) and for proposing the daughter directives that will ensue (namely <span class="bold">three years </span>after the entry into force of the framework directive).</p>
<p class="contents">However, let me emphasise that the subsidiarity principle must be respected fully and that Member States must have some margin for manoeuvre, based on common indicators and methods, so that they can take account of special factors (different geographical situations, for example) especially in relation to airports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This trust puts profit first, that is, the profits of its shareholders, to the detriment of safety. It did not take all the necessary measures to avoid an accident happening or, at any rate, to prevent it having such tragic consequences for the factory workers and the local population.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we refuse to join in the congratulations addressed to the French authorities. These authorities, from the town council to the government, were not able or not willing to take steps to check the AZF factory in Toulouse properly, as is also true of the many other high-risk sites, and to force the TotalFinaElf trust and its ilk to take the essential precautions.</p>
<p class="contents">As for providing <span class="italic">'appropriate aid…to the populations affected'</span>, even after the accident, that assistance did not match the scale of the damage. The sum of one and a half billion released by the government will cover only a quarter of the damage caused. How long will those who have lost their homes and are living in precarious conditions have to wait to be housed?</p>
<p class="contents">However, quite apart from the fact that this aid is inadequate, the taxpayer was supposed to pay it. Why should the taxpayers have to use their money to pay for the damage for which TotalFinaElf is to blame? That company should pay for this in full, including of course the total wages of the workers forced out of work, both at AZF and its subcontractors and in all the local firms that had to shut down. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know that numerous Member States of the EU have not applied the revised ‘Seveso’ directive, even though they should have been doing so since 1999. Even worse, a number of countries are clearly not even applying the original ‘Seveso’ directive properly.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that our joint resolution calls on the Commission to publish a table, within the next three months, of all the industrial plants in the EU which are highly dangerous and are located in residential areas and which, were an accident to happen, could cause damage on a scale similar to that caused by the accident in Toulouse.</p>
<p class="contents">One such plant, Petrola Hellas plc, is located a stone's throw from the densely populated areas of Elefsina, Aspropyrgo and Mandra and has already applied for planning permission to extend over a 130 hectare plot of land located in the buffer zone between the current Petrola plant and the Pyrkal munitions factory.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that, according to witnesses working in the factory in question, the factory operator has not provided the public with the safety report or the emergency plans setting out action to be taken in the event of an accident, as required under the Seveso directive. Other factories in the area are guilty of similar practices (no plans, failure to inform local authorities and the public). The usual procedure is to send a very basic file to the ministry and ignore the rest of the provisions of the Seveso directive. Just how interested and concerned the Greek authorities are in preventing major disasters and limiting their impact is obvious from the environment Commissioner's reply to my question on the matter. The Commissioner replied that he had written to the Greek authorities on 7 June 2000 asking for information on the extension to the Petrola plant but that the Greek authorities had not yet replied to the letter in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like the Commission, the rapporteur believes this procedure should be refocused towards giving greater right of asylum to applicants who want 'to find safety'.</p>
<p class="contents">We already established, at the last part-session, what practical consequences this policy would have, when we considered the Commission's proposal on minimum standards for the procedure for granting refugee status.

<p class="contents">How many applications are unfounded? Probably nine out of ten. The Commission forgets these figures, just as it minimises the total number of applications, which it puts at 200 000 for the entire EU in 2000, while according to the figures we have it was as much as 375 000, counting only 10 out of the 15 EU countries! This underestimate is made deliberately. It allows the problem to be minimised. In fact it is immense.</p>
<p class="contents">The member countries must not accept the Commission's proposals, for they would constrain them to observe a common procedure that would start out flexible, only to become increasingly rigid, as is clearly stated on page 8 of the communication. That procedure would end up by granting unlimited rights of asylum and, in addition, broaden the concept of ‘refugee’ set out in the 1951 convention by extending it to other forms of temporary protection. All this is totally ill-timed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would do better to present us with proposals for establishing a policy on the return of applicants whose claim has been rejected. It would also do better to present us with proposals aimed at giving priority to assisting refugees in their region of origin. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my view, voting for this report means, above all, endorsing the ambitious approach set out by the Tampere European Council, namely not just the statement that 'in the longer term, Community rules should lead to a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for those granted asylum valid throughout the Union', but also the commitment of that same Tampere European Council to the 'full and inclusive' interpretation of the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, to vote for this report means to support the idea that a common asylum policy must adhere to high standards for the protection of the refugees, include a common definition of the concept of 'refugee' and give a full and inclusive interpretation of the Geneva Convention, taking account of persecution both by state and by non-state agents, as well as the asylum seekers' fear of future persecution.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe it is important to draw your attention to the fact that the common, 'full and inclusive' interpretation of the Geneva Convention must include the possibility of granting asylum in cases where the persecution is not carried out by the state. The Member States take many different views on this particular point. In other words, the further development of the common policy calls for further harmonisation of procedures throughout the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, note that while it is important to encourage this kind of single procedure, this must not restrict the possibilities for the individual to obtain refugee status under the terms of the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, voting for this report also means emphasising the fact that the use of concepts such as 'safe third countries', 'safe country of origin', 'accelerated procedures' and 'procedures for manifestly unfounded applications' must only be used where justified and include legally binding guarantees.</p>

The problem of the influx into the Member States of the ΕU of people who have lost everything, of people who are in danger in their own country, either because they are being politically persecuted or for reasons of economic survival.</p>
<p class="contents">Reports and other EU documents on the matter always contain a paragraph referring to the need to combat the causes of asylum-seeking and immigration. Of course, what they fail to mention is the criminal responsibility of imperialism, which has exploited the natural and human resources of third world countries for centuries and which has no hesitation in setting up and bringing down what are usually authoritarian governments in order to serve its economic interests. The furious struggle of the imperialist forces to overturn Socialism, the war which they ignited in the Balkans and the recent tragic example of the war planned against their own Taliban and Bin Laden resulted and will continue to result in millions of unfortunate people hanging about in the countries of the ΕU and elsewhere, looking for a place in the sun. Consequently, we should have no delusions about the fact that, as long as imperialism prevails, asylum-seeking and immigration will live and rule.</p>
<p class="contents">So the question is, how can we manage the problem better? In this respect, the Evans report on granting asylum contains a number of positive points and proposals. However, it is still a wish list. For example, it quite rightly points out that the concept of ‘safe’ countries of origin or ‘safe’ third countries is very fluid and the danger here is that people will be deported to countries in which they are at risk, that is, they will literally be sent into the lion's den. A typical example is Turkey, a candidate country, which the ΕU considers has made steady progress in the field of human rights. In reality, as we all know, people are imprisoned in Turkey for their ideas, hunger strikers and other people fighting for democracy are murdered, parties which represent millions of Kurds or opponents of the regime (such as the Communist party) are banned, trade unionists are arrested and so on. And yet there are countries in the ΕU, including Greece, which deport opponents of the regime to this ‘safe’ country.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the conditions of survival of refugees are concerned, a typical example is Greece, where thousands of Kurds live in shanty towns in Lavrio and Afghans and other refugees sleep in cardboard boxes on the beaches in Athens, deprived of even the basic necessities.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, the report quite rightly highlights the huge delay in processing asylum applications and the fact that the Member States are unwilling to grant asylum. In Greece, for example, an average of 5% a year are approved and only this year did this rise to 7%.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall vote in favour of the Evans report because it proposes improvements to the current system of protection for refugees. However, we feel that only solidarity and a united fight by both refugees and workers in the Member States of the ΕU in a bid to claim dignified living conditions for everyone and, more to the point, wipe out the reasons for refugees and poverty will provide a definitive solution to the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is often the best educated and the most privileged who manage to enter Europe, often at the expense of useful roles they could be playing in their countries of origin. Such individual solutions, however, are necessary to those whose only chance of survival is to flee from war and suppression. It is not acceptable to send people to their deaths by establishing quota and to refuse access to others. Neither is it justifiable to send people back before the problem in their country of origin has been solved. Moreover, some refugees will want to stay on because their children and grandchildren have meanwhile been raised in the new country of residence. Some EU Member States admit many more refugees than others. It is remarkable that both those in favour of restricting and those in favour of extending the permits have for years been calling for a more centralised and standardised European policy. I can only agree with this if it means that the EU Member States will be more generous in applying minimum standards than those agreed in the Geneva Convention. It is easier to organise and supervise the protection of refugees on a small scale than by a remote bureaucracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is time that the Member States of the European Union applied that Convention in full.</p>

I did so because although the report as amended is, as we would say in English, all over the place – some points do not correspond with others and there are contradictions left, right and centre – there are a few (and I am sure Mrs McKenna will look at them) but significant positive aspects to the report. For example, it recognises the right of third-country nationals legally resident in the European Union to free movement in Europe. Equally, it gives the right to vote in local elections.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are negative aspects. I doubt whether all the people who voted for paragraph 35 could have read it, because it restricts the right of residence, accommodation and education. That is inherently racist and we should oppose it.

In any case, despite Mr Pirker’s laudable efforts, this report is ambiguous in the way it is worded in general, because it does not dare to say clearly that the Commission’s approach, in its communication on immigration, is wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, to a large extent it hides the phenomenon of illegal immigration, and it proposes only partial or distant solutions. In particular, the approach involving co-development with the countries of origin will no doubt be of value in the long term, but it does not mean that we do not need to strengthen our border controls now.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Commission is more or less opening the floodgates to legal immigration. It says that European policy should be based on the fact that migratory pressure will continue (page 14), and from this it draws the conclusion that legislation should be designed so as to facilitate, rather than hinder, the admission of economic migrants (page 19). We, however, do not draw that conclusion at all. On the contrary, we believe that a quota policy should be adopted, with quota levels determined by each Member State on its own behalf, and in our opinion those quotas should be filled, as a matter of priority, by nationals of countries in Eastern Europe, who will soon be members of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the integration of immigrants, the Commission invites us to recognise that integration is a two-way process requiring adaptation by both the immigrants and the society that receives them (page 21). This is not our opinion either. The strangers who come knocking at our door more often than not come from countries which have completely failed to let their population live decently, or even to feed it. It is obviously in the immigrants’ interest to adjust to our way of life and our values. To take the opposite view would be to do them a great disservice, and it would also, in return, do a great disservice to the countries of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It appears that the European Union is only interested in using labour from third countries to meet the needs and shortages of European capitalism, indifferent to the obstacles this may create to those countries’ own development by depriving them of vital human resources.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, therefore, crucial that we find a new perspective on cooperation and development policy, particularly with third countries, in order to contribute towards greater support for their development and provide their populations with decent standards of living, something which the report, unfortunately, does not touch upon. With regard to immigrants, it is important to guarantee and respect all their rights. Hence the proposals we submitted on upholding the legalisation of all immigrants, our insistence on the need for recognition of civil and political rights, namely the right to vote in local and European elections and the guarantee of equal treatment in terms of economic, cultural and social rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad that Parliament is finally taking a decision on such an important subject.</p>
<p class="contents">For almost twenty years, immigration as a subject of public debate has been treated only emotionally or unrealistically. How could it have been otherwise, when the subject has virtually become a major stake in the internal policy of every Member State of the European Community? It also has to be admitted that, in the eyes of the public, the policies being followed are, on the one hand, inefficient when it comes to combating illegal immigration and, on the other, unjust in the case of proper immigration which is legal and useful to the development of our society.</p>
<p class="contents">It has now become vital to make a clear distinction, both in law and in practice, between proper immigration and improper immigration, and finally to define criteria and then stick to them. While several international and European organisations all emphasise the risk of shortages of qualified workers in Europe, we must learn to adapt, like certain Anglo-Saxon countries, and open up European society to the immigrants that it so badly needs in several sectors, including informatics and new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, real courage consists in campaigning for deep-seated change in the world economic order. Justice and ethics would then count for much more than they do in the moralising extremism of those who would like to demand total freedom to live and work in Europe, like those who would like to turn our European Community into a mere sanctuary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is time to stop letting all these illegal immigrants in and put an end to the free movement of traffickers and terrorists within the Union. We must show some instinct for survival.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorist cells have recently been identified in various Member States of the Union, in particular in France and Belgium, among illegal immigrants. Since the opening up of borders and the Schengen Agreements, some immigrant communities have systematically organised themselves into networks of religious and ethnic infiltration, and as a result they are a fertile breeding ground for terrorism, and also for delinquency, trafficking and violent crimes of all kinds.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet what, in the face of all this, is Brussels’ policy? It closes its eyes and ignores the evil. At the very best it feebly condemns the constant increase in international crime. So what are its solutions? Encourage immigration, legalise illegal immigrants, give identity papers to all those who have entered our territory illegally, create and allow the creation of no-go areas where the law does not apply, such as the Sangatte Centre in France. Broadly speaking, that is what is being preached by the report that we are voting on. It tells us that we must populate Europe because Europe has a population deficit. Europe needs manpower, so in order to meet that need we must have a global and voluntary immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The National Front <span class="italic">Députés</span> have for years been constantly denouncing this irresponsible and suicidal policy coming from Brussels. The fight against illegal immigration must clearly be based on the principle of zero tolerance. Illegal immigrants must be sent back to their country of origin. Our borders must be re-established, because proof has finally been given to all signatory parties to the Schengen Agreements that those borders are an essential element in the security of our countries. Therefore, before committing ourselves to a Community immigration policy, let us start by establishing a Community security policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our opinion, there is too great an emphasis placed on what should be done to limit immigration, instead of highlighting the positive and necessary aspects of increased immigration, including the immigration of labour. In several cases, we should like to go further with regard to becoming more receptive to increased labour migration.</p>
<p class="contents">We are particularly critical of Paragraph 15, which states that ‘immigrants are expected to respect the community of values – as set out in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights – and to show a willingness to integrate into society in the Member States’. We do not currently require the citizens of Europe to respect the community of values referred to in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is how this paragraph will actually be interpreted. A wave of anti-Muslim sentiment is currently sweeping across Europe. In Sweden and in several other Member States, Muslims have been harassed. Politicians in individual Member States have, in our opinion, made some astonishing statements.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concern is that the wording of Paragraph 15 is in danger of providing further scope for intolerance and xenophobia. There is a risk that the diversity of Europe could be lost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first of these departures is the new tone of firmness and rigour demonstrated both by the presidency and even by the Commission. The events of 11 September have something to do with that. The ideology of ‘fewer and fewer controls’ has given way to the realisation that terrorism feeds on our laxity. It is not by chance that the Europe of the Fifteen, the European Union, has emerged from the inquiry into the killings of 11 September as being the privileged location for the organisation, preparation and mounting of the terrorist attacks in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary now for the good intentions just expressed by the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commission to be translated into action and sustained in the long term. It is, in fact, high time that the fight against illegal immigration and the fight against the abuse of the asylum procedure should no longer be mere formulae to be bandied about, but should become policies to be implemented with determination.</p>
<p class="contents">The second departure is more distressing. This is the obvious discrepancy that has appeared between the new tone of the Council and the Commission, which is a positive signal of awareness, and the persistence of an ideological attitude among most of the Members who have spoken, which continues to confuse control with violation of freedoms, and which wants to increase the number of guarantees to the benefit of those who are abusing our reception and asylum procedures, to the detriment of the security and protection of our citizens and the interests of those who, because they really are being persecuted, ought to find asylum here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is unacceptable for the European Union to base its code of conduct in arms exports on the criterion of the ‘needs of the European defence industry’, because this negates any substantive measures which might be mentioned. The European Union should move to get the USA, Russia, China and all the other major arms exporters to adopt binding rules of conduct and their unwillingness should not be a reason for the European Union to relax or otherwise fail to act properly. At the same time, we need an observatory at European level, we need records and transparency on arms exports so that we can put an immediate end to the scandalous practice of selling arms to forces of crime and destabilisation which have no hesitation in using terrorism to turn their arms against the European Union and its citizens.</p>

Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September in America, the profit expectations of the arms industry have risen. The only possible justification for producing weapons is in self-defence against external enemies who aim to take over, suppress us or wipe us out. The production of arms as an economic activity, to make profit by means of exporting to regions where people want to buy those weapons, means that money is considered more important than human life. Against the wishes of Parliament, last year, the Council pressed ahead with lifting the arms embargo against Indonesia, despite the violence in East Timor, the Moluccas, Aceh and West Papua. Mr Titley’s proposal contains only a non-legislative reference, but includes a number of improvements on the current situation, such as the legal enforcement of the Code of Conduct for arms exports, and its application to candidate countries. He is right to request that permission from the Member States be required by European companies to transfer licences for the production of military equipment outside of European territory. I support him in his aims of a worldwide agreement, annual reports on the application of the Code of Conduct and a refusal to allow the supply of weapons to countries that do not provide information to the UN conventional weapons register. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are told that GALILEO testifies to a desire to ensure the independence of Europe from the United States which, with its Global Positioning System (GPS), has launched a similar programme. In fact, what it really does is provide an enormous market for European businesses, in other words a new source of profits for their owners and shareholders. For it is they who will be the primary beneficiaries of GALILEO – indeed they already are – whether in the telecommunications sector, the transport sector or the space sector, since GALILEO involves the launching of a network of thirty satellites.</p>
<p class="contents">Public funding amounting to almost EUR 2 billion has already been budgeted for and to some extent released by the European Union and the European Space Agency. As for private investors, they are reluctant to pay a single penny. Yet the European Union is not planning to call for their financial involvement until the final phase of the project, after it has been launched and guaranteed by public money. According to the reporter, however, the private investors who have been promised responsibility for managing GALILEO and therefore ‘possible revenue flows from GALILEO services’, are unwilling to take any ‘economic risk’. They are waiting for a ‘positive signal from the political side’ of Europe. In other words they are waiting to be told that the political side will take on responsibility for all the costs, leaving the investors with nothing to do but collect the profits.</p>
<p class="contents">Though the European authorities are revelling in the supposed virtues of private initiative, the capitalists, for their part, want paying with more than words. They want guaranteed profits, without any risk, and they know that they can count on both European and national authorities to give them what they want.</p>

Remember that the GALILEO project is intended to deploy a set of satellites orbiting about 20 000 km above the Earth. All those satellites would be linked to a network of control stations on the ground. Cover would thus be worldwide, making it possible to improve considerably the management of air, sea and road traffic and to support search and rescue operations.</p>
<p class="contents">This technology already exists in the USA (the GPS system) and in Russia (the GLONASS system). It is currently financed and controlled by the military authorities in those two countries. The quality and continuity of its use for civilian purposes are dependent on those authorities who may, at any time, discontinue or downgrade the signal. In Europe, on the other hand, the GALILEO programme will be managed and controlled by civilians. It is proposed that the system should be developed in four stages, namely a definition phase in 2000, a development and validation phase up to 2005, a deployment phase up to 2007 and an operational phase after that. Ideally then, the GALILEO system should be operational from 2008 onwards, thereby responding to the wishes expressed at the European Council in Stockholm and to the European Union’s urgent needs in this field. This, at any rate, is what emerges from the report by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of financing, it seems to me to be important to clear up the question of how this will be organised before coming to a final decision. I also deplore the fact that some Member States are reluctant to lend their support to this project. I therefore invite the Commission to take the necessary steps to break down this reluctance. It will then have the task of defining a general financing structure, and that will have to be done between now and 15 November 2001 if we want to be reasonably sure of meeting the 2008 deadline. The European Parliament will have to be consulted on the Commission’s draft. Once this draft has been approved, it should be possible to encourage the involvement of European industry in the financing of the later stages in the medium and long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let us remember, briefly, that the GALILEO satellite navigation programme is an ambitious project which provides for the deployment of an arrangement of satellites in orbit at a distance of about 20 000 km from the Earth, linked to a network of ground control stations.</p>
<p class="contents">This definition shows us how important it is to vote in favour of this report, as I shall be doing. The implementation of the GALILEO project will enable us to have world coverage which can be used not only for controlling air, sea and road traffic but also for supporting search and rescue operations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, although it is necessary, for the above-mentioned reasons, to vote in favour of the report, thereby allowing the EU to develop a system which the European Council in Stockholm considered was important enough to be launched ‘without delay’, we should do so while bearing in mind those areas – highlighted in the report – which may prove to be problematical in future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, in fact, extremely important that we should remain vigilant regarding the possibility of such a system being used for military purposes. It is possible that the system might be misused, and it is up to us to be aware of this and to ensure that such a thing cannot happen.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it should be noted that the immediate funding of such a project will not be without its problems. Member States, or at least some of them, are reluctant to lend their financial support to the implementation of GALILEO, and private investors do not seem to be particularly enthusiastic about the idea of participating in such a project either. In other words, before coming to a final decision, the budgetary authorities of the European Union need to have an accurate understanding of the financing involved, which means that the Commission will have to prepare proposals for the management structures for the GALILEO project.</p>

Its creation may be an advantage for the mobile telecommunications services, which can use it for localisation applications requested by users if the financial cost does not render such use prohibitive. It is also necessary to take the cost of financing it into account, especially the share that may be demanded of countries that do not participate directly in its creation, in order not to hinder its implementation in the various Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such a navigation system by satellite might have become part of a strategy to make Europe less reliant on the US. There are plenty of reasons for this. America is threatening us with increased global warming, again with an anti-missile shield dating from the ‘Star Wars’ period, with meat containing hormones, noisy aircraft, the ECHELON tapping system, a monopoly of patents and with a dollar which, as international currency, has for decades passed on the deficits of the American balance of payments to the outside world. At the moment, it is even threatening to drag us into a war against the third world. Restricted access of American products manufactured under poor working and environmental conditions to the European market might force America to pay more attention to labour, the environment, public health, animal torture, human rights and peace. Only in a confrontation of that kind could we possibly have a need for GALILEO. As long as such a confrontation is not forthcoming, the GALILEO project remains a contribution of the European taxpayer to industry in the field of electronics and space travel, and that industry is largely subject to military interests. It would be preferable to spend the money for GALILEO on environmental care and useful collective facilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It sets out the European scoreboard for innovation, drawn up on the basis of statistics available at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">An analysis shows that despite the efforts made by Member States to promote innovation, Europe’s performance is still trailing behind that of its main competitors. Yet innovation was one of the strategic priorities identified by the European Council in Lisbon in March 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the Commission makes several recommendations to Member States with a view to improving their policies on encouraging innovative enterprises and support for innovation throughout the whole of the economic and social fabric. The Member States are invited to improve their policies on encouraging innovative enterprises, removing obstacles to initiatives and innovators, encouraging private investment in research and innovation, and improving the rules governing the use of the results obtained by publicly funded research.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally I support these proposals. I believe that the projects that are covered by this philosophy will be able to obtain funds as part of the Sixth FRDP.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has identified three key sectors in which Community intervention and Member States’ commitment are necessary. These are the creation of entrepreneurship at the educational level, the promotion of the training of workers, and the promotion of innovation among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). He also emphasises the need to take into consideration the needs of the SMEs, since they represent 60 million undertakings and 60% of jobs in the European Union. Innovation cannot exist without the SMEs. I agree with him there, of course, but I have to admit that we have been hearing the same speeches for years, all about the essential role of the SMEs in the European economy and the need to remove the many obstacles to their development. Alas, little progress has been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I took this into account when I drafted my report on the Sixth FRDP, and as far as possible I tried to guarantee the SMEs access to European research and development funding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Time and again the EU has been criticised for failing to keep abreast of technological innovation and is sorely lagging behind its American counterparts in this field. The EU should do more to exploit its potential to innovate in this field and this was recognised, as the report outlines, in the Lisbon, so-called, dot.com Summit. European Member States need to collude and pool their separate specialisms and create a system of 'benchmarking'. To supplement these measures the report rightly calls for more high quality education. This will do much to boost the EU's Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, these innovations cannot progress unless there is a loosening of bureaucratic regulations. If we decrease the amount of red tape which currently hinders European innovation, then we will go some way in becoming more able to compete with America. This will promote more start-ups and new ventures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In order to avoid any useless multiplication of the costs represented by these requests for roll-call votes, we withdraw our first two amendments and retain only Amendment No 3, which we believe is enough to demonstrate the sad reality of the situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The exhaustion of trade mark rights affects all branded products. As President of the Wine Intergroup, I would like to concentrate on the consequences for this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The international exhaustion of trade mark rights will be of no advantage to the consumer in the European Union as regards food and drink, as is confirmed by the study produced by National Economic Research Associates (NERA) at the Commission's request. European consumers could indeed be put at a disadvantage in the longer term by our industries’ losing the opportunity to develop new products and to offer the consumer new services. Should yields decrease decisively through parallel imports from third countries, there will also be a decline in motivation to invest in new markets.</p>
<p class="contents">In the event of the international trade mark rights becoming exhausted, complex distribution networks will come into being and it will become more difficult to put a stop to trade mark piracy. There is no doubt that disadvantages will result for the consumer and for the manufacturer of branded goods, for example with regard to consumer health protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore speaking out against the international exhaustion of trade mark rights. However, in view of events since the report was drafted, I will not be voting against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Therefore, while it is clear that large-scale, incisive cultural measures need to be taken to teach all people respect for others and acceptance, it is equally clear that civil society must use every tool available to it to fight those political, cultural, economic and religious systems which breed and are based on racism.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect for diversities must include, however, constant, enlightened action on the part of civil<span class="bold"> </span>society so that the objective of respect for human rights and dignity is achieved throughout the world. Therefore, the behaviour of those civilised Western – and other – cultures which are fighting against religious or ritualistic practices, for example, which physically or psychologically damage a person, cannot be considered to be racist. In being subjected to these practices, women continue to be treated not as human beings entitled to exercise all rights but as objects subject to customs which prevent or limit their participation in society and politics.</p>
<p class="contents">The entire history of mankind has, I am sad to say, been marked by collective and individual racist behaviour. In condemning the racism of the past, the political world must avoid falling into the trap of fresh racist behaviour now. Indeed, we cannot disregard the fact that there is a form of political racism currently in existence: the racism indulged in by those who condemn the ideas of others merely because they are the expression of a different political hue. That is why we call upon Parliament, the Commission and the Council to take much more effective action both within and outside the Community than they have done thus far, to promote a culture of mutual respect among people and governments, which, if it is to be genuine, must not tolerate attitudes, ideas or behaviour which fail to respect human dignity, whether they are based on religious, cultural, economic or political ideals.</p>

<p class="contents">In fact, here we have a conference convened under the aegis of the United Nations allowing itself to be overrun and exploited by a grouping of Islamist NGOs, with the active or benevolent complicity of a significant number of states, mainly in the Arab-Muslim world, some of which are usually described as 'moderates', a conference that goes so far as to suggest an untenable equation of Zionism with racism, while our representatives go on sitting there as though nothing had happened.</p>
<p class="contents">In face of the attitude of the United States and Israel, whose departure from the conference was a sign that the threshold of the unacceptable had been crossed, the European Union, by remaining, and however much it denies this today, ran the risk of appearing to support these shameful equations and intolerable excesses that the philosopher Alain Finkielkraut summarised as follows: 'In Durban, anti-racism has taken over anti-Semitism and the denial of humanity'.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europeans should have left for the sake of their honour and dignity, which would have sent out a strong and salutary signal to the UN and its General Secretariat and encouraged them to take a firm stance in face of the attempt by Islamism to impose its ideological influence, and genuinely to represent the interests and values of the international community. Any show of complaisance towards the kind of equations proposed in Durban can indeed be interpreted as a sign of weakness on our part and of encouragement towards those who have set themselves the objective of destroying our values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
