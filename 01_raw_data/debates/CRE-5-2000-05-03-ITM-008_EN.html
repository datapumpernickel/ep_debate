<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Palacio Vallelersundi (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the recommendation which it is my honour to present, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, proposes that the plenary adopts the common position without amendments. I have to say that this attitude has also been adopted by the various political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to stress that, by approving the Council’s common position on electronic commerce tomorrow, this House will be showing a very great degree of political responsibility of great institutional significance. Furthermore, by approving this directive, Parliament will be taking a decisive step in favour of the competitiveness of European businesses in the ‘on line’ economy and will be setting a milestone so that both consumers and companies will be able to operate in the internal market with the same guarantees and the same ease with which they operate in their domestic markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive ensures that companies and citizens are able to provide and receive information society services throughout the European Union, which will thereby become a genuinely border-free area. European companies will be able to offer goods, services and information within the Union in accordance with the regulations of the Member State in which they are established and, therefore, in normalised circumstances, without being bound by 14 different sets of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to arrive at these results, the directive harmonises certain areas, in particular – to name the main ones – the place where the operators are established, their obligations in terms of transparency, the requirements for transparency in commercial communications, the conditions required for the conclusion and validity of electronic contracts, the responsibility of Internet intermediaries, the settlement of disputes, as well as the competences of national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In other areas, the directive is supported by the existing instruments intended to facilitate harmonisation and the mutual recognition of national legislations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the directive includes – and this is important – all information society services, both business to business and business to user services, such as those which allow electronic operations to take place – interactive telesales of goods and services, on-line ‘shops’, for example; services which are offered free, such as those financed through advertising or sponsorship, the on-line press, on-line databases, on-line financial services, on-line professional services – lawyers, doctors or other professionals – leisure services such as video on demand, direct marketing and all services accessed via the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive is also – as I have already said – a great example of interinstitutional cooperation. This directive is a magnificent example of teamwork by Parliament, the Commission and the Council. Therefore, Parliament’s position on first reading, in particular its decisive support for the principle of the country of origin, was crucial to the Council in order to avoid the balance of the text being jeopardised.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, the common position follows the guidelines set by Parliament and, apart from some marginal cases, no significant amendments are added to the annex which provides for the exceptions relating to the principle I have mentioned. Balance is also maintained with regard to the provisions concerning consumer protection and the responsibility of intermediaries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my thanks, as rapporteur, for the cooperation of all my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs, and in particular the leaders of the various political groups – especially the support of Mrs Berger and Mr Harbour from my Group – and the other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position, therefore, maintains the balance between the various general objectives and the various interests, and we have not therefore tabled any amendments. It is clearly not a perfect text, but we consider it to be a reasonable and acceptable one, and it is crucial that it is adopted as soon as possible. I will not repeat – although it is true – that Internet time is much shorter than time as we have known it up to now.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also understand that this directive is a priority in terms of guaranteeing the development of electronic commerce. We must take account of the globalisation of the economy and competition from US companies and the legal framework of the internal market which strives, as on the Internet, for a space with no internal boundaries. All of these elements are Community assets as far as the competitiveness of European companies is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the development of new technologies and market-related innovations make it essential that we establish a legal framework for the development of commerce, while, as this directive ensures, areas are set aside which are suitable for self-regulation and for the development of specific codes of conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive, furthermore, will provide a significant stimulus to small- and medium-sized businesses so that they will embrace, without delay, this commerce without frontiers. They are currently not doing so because of the legal uncertainty involved in dealing with many different sets of legislation within Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, several Member States are already legislating in this area and, without this directive, we could see a genuine fragmentation of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive, furthermore, Mr President, is a milestone which will affect all Community initiatives which have an impact on electronic commerce. The legal framework established by this directive will facilitate the adoption of other Community directives, such as the one on copyright, the distance marketing of financial services or the controversial Brussels Convention on jurisdiction, and will clearly help to remove the risk of incompatibility between these initiatives and the principles of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament intends to monitor closely the transposition and application of the directive in national legislations, and I have therefore included two recommendations, two reminders to the Commission, which I hope will be approved tomorrow, not within the framework of the directive, but within the framework of the legislative resolution; one on the procedures for the detection and withdrawal of illicit material, and another on the drafting of codes of conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President – and with this I will end – it is symbolic that Parliament is approving this directive on the eve of the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the declaration by Robert Schuman, in which he stated that Europe would not be created in an instant but through achieving specific objectives which would create genuine solidarity between citizens and businesses. Fifty years ago, ‘specific objectives’ referred to the European Coal and Steel Community; today, as this directive points out, they refer to the information society. For this reason, Mr President, I believe that tomorrow this Parliament will be worthy of congratulation, and this congratulation can also be extended to the other Community institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce directive is such a very difficult subject because it is a typical example of how runaway technological advances and market growth can outstrip legislation. European legislative procedures happen to be particularly complex and the market is simply developing at a faster pace. Another problem facing us when we had to consider this directive at both first and second reading was that we realised that in many areas EU harmonisation has not made enough progress yet, for much of what was said in the discussion of this draft directive in fact showed up serious weaknesses and major problems here.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of example let me just take the debate on the country of origin principle or, alternatively, the country of destination principle. In both cases, both alternatives, we as the legislator looked rather like the Odysseus of ancient times negotiating his way between Scylla and Charybdis, quite simply because we will create injustices in either case, whether for the producer or for the recipient of the product or service. We might also create other problems, which would later prove difficult to resolve in legal practice, for instance if a Portuguese judge suddenly has to apply German law, or indeed if a Spanish judge suddenly has to apply Italian law, in relation to a fairly simple case of secondary importance, simply because such combinations of circumstances could arise.</p>
<p class="contents">So I must admit that I am not entirely satisfied with all the points of the common position before us. I still have criticisms about many of them. On the other hand, at the moment we do not need a second reading consultation, and certainly not a conciliation procedure. We must come to a rapid decision so that we can finally offer the users on this market a legal framework, even if, as the rapporteur rightly pointed out, it may not be perfect in every way and may still have a number of weaknesses.</p>
<p class="contents">But that is why I also expect the European Commission to monitor the implementation of this directive carefully and, if this should prove necessary, to submit practical proposals for amending it during the current legislative term. I also believe that we may then have made further progress towards harmonising many areas of the law. Let me just give you as an instance the forthcoming harmonisation of civil law. Here the Commission has already given the appropriate instructions. The Tampere Council called for reports and voted on them. The European Parliament will also be considering this matter again in the near future and I think the decisions that emerge from this process could also serve as the basis for the further development of this <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We found this strategy convincing and we too can recommend that the plenary of the House adopt the Council’s common position on the <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce directive unamended. We do so primarily because we believe that this key component of the European legal framework for the information society needs to be implemented swiftly. Let me emphasise that another reason why we are able to adopt it unamended is because the Council – exceptionally, I am tempted to say – has incorporated many of the European Parliament’s amendments at first reading. That does not mean, however, that we do not still see much room for improvement, as other speakers have pointed out as well, and some of our wishes have not been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">But if we are prepared to set these wishes aside for now, for the sake of the speedy adoption and implementation of this directive, we also expect the Member States, when they implement it, with appropriate monitoring by the Commission, to resolve all the questions that are still not one hundred percent settled without this being at the expense of aspects that are important to us, in particular consumer protection. Here I am thinking above all of the interpretation of Article 1(3), which is still worded in a very ambivalent way. I hope that article will not be used to undermine national provisions on health protection, such as the ban on the mail order sales of certain medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we are also entitled to expect that the proposed codes of conduct, which will give those involved in <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce a very wide margin for self-regulation, will be drawn up as soon as possible and that they will be very comprehensive, with the participation of consumer protection organisations, in such a manner as to be really binding and easy to implement. I think we can also describe the rules that we adopted on provider liability as generous. I can only hope that they stand the test of time and that we will not have to revise them again in three years’ time in light of practical experience.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of the <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce directive does represent a very, very important step, yet a few other key building blocks for the <span class="italic">e</span>-Europe are still missing. As the rapporteur pointed out, the Council is dragging its feet on the common position on the distance marketing of financial services, on copyright in the information society. We also need to make more rapid progress in setting up out-of-court settlement procedures and the small claims procedure. Finally, I hope that the directive we are to adopt will also serve as a good stepping-stone towards finding equally good global solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know the proposal is not absolutely perfect but the general feedback, both at a recent hearing in committee and from those who have lobbied Members has been: ‘let’s have what might be an imperfect directive with a review rather than none at all’. Speed with certainty in this fast-moving new world is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we have an initial road-map; a reference point for European businesses trading on the Web; a road-map that has clearly established the country of origin principle while still protecting consumer interest. That is a good balance. This should really open up the internal market to the many and increasing opportunities which <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce promises to businesses of all sizes, but particularly SMEs. We must continually be aware that the Web is not limited to Europe. It is, of course, global. A large part of consumer transactions from Europe on the Web is directed at American sites and in future may well be directed at Asian sites. European business has to keep up and the key to this will be confidence. We have to aspire to the establishment of the highest quality of <span class="italic">e</span>-businesses in Europe. Companies setting up or changing to this way of doing business have to look carefully at the way they operate, at the information and the service they provide to customers if they are to survive. We should also take care to provide coherent legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Confidence is essential. There are many opportunities but what of the threats? Only this weekend we have seen in London the down-side of the communications and information revolution that the Web has created by putting elements in society in touch with one another, who have then wrought violence on the streets of London. This may be extreme but there will be unscrupulous people who will set up scams on the Web. One bad news story may blow confidence in <span class="italic">e</span>-trade for years. <span class="italic">E</span>-commerce is in its early stages. We need, as legislators, to be watchful, not necessarily interventionist, but wary of implications as the medium grows.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur has given us an extremely good basis. The ELDR Group will stick to her original ‘no-amendment’ line. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But on this occasion I wish to say that it would not be overdone if I, on behalf of myself and my Group, particularly thank and congratulate the rapporteur on her work. Perhaps I might also, as a new Member of the House, and therefore of the committee, thank her for the marvellous job she does as the chairman of our committee – for the courtesy and kindness, but firmness with which she carries out its business.</p>
<p class="contents">I have some sympathy with Commissioner Bolkestein here today. Parliamentary debates are not always marked by tremendous cut-and-thrust but today I fear it is a procession because we are all standing up and saying that we agree with each other. Is this, we ask ourselves, the death of ideology? I suppose we could excuse ourselves with the thought that we are debating more with the medium here than the message. We are dealing with the creation of a new medium and therefore one which creates an urgent and acute need for regulation and for common regulation on a grand scale. It is therefore, and I think we are all correct about this, vital that we get on with it and that we do not risk unnecessary delay in bringing this into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I was very grateful to my colleague, Mrs Ahern, also from the committee, for raising some points of continuing concern tonight and I would like to thank again the rapporteur for the device whereby she has introduced in an addendum to the resolution the points about the intermediate service providers and codes of conduct. That is important and I hope that the Commission will be taking that on board.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming as I do from one of the very remote parts of Europe, it is exciting to speculate on the possibility that these new media will help to correct the apparently unstoppable drift to the centre and the decay of the outlying parts of all our countries and societies. In these circumstances we should welcome the chance to bring in an effective regulation on <span class="italic">e-</span>commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also remember that there is another kind of exclusion other than geographical. There is the lack of skill in these technologies. We are also challenged – albeit outside the scope of this directive – to make sure that we do not have an exclusion of people by ignorance or the lack of access to the instruments of this medium of communication. So let us be sure that we carry the directive but do not forget the other problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Harbour (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, can I join in the very warm welcome to my colleague, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi’s approach, and commend her on the drive and persistence with which she has advocated this directive and the approach that we have taken. It is an indication also of the approach this committee will take on all the subsequent legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to perhaps put a distinctive slant on this legislation. I am one of the few engineers in Parliament, certainly in the Legal Affairs Committee which is dominated by lawyers, and can put a rather different point of view sometimes. It seems to me that this piece of legislation can be likened in the technological world to the operating system of the whole legal framework that we are putting in place in the European Union for electronic commerce. It is this operating system within which a lot of other key legislation will be fitted, such as the copyright and information society and distance selling of financial services. All of those things were fitted into the overall framework of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">So essentially this is the core principle. I hesitate to call it the Windows because that produces rather unfortunate competitive issues these days but those of you who are software experts will know what I mean when I use the word “Linux”. For those of you that are not so technologically enabled, Linux is a competitor to Windows that is owned and updated by the users. That essentially is what we have here. We have a system that is going to be operated by the users and the point I want to make this evening in now thinking ahead, because we are confident we are going to get this directive through, is to say to the Commission that we need to have a very comprehensive and a very fast feedback from the users about the problems and issues that they are encountering in using this directive. Clearly the Internet world is going to be highly suitable for the Commission to set that up.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to know about issues where Member Governments have blocked transactions. We want to know where the directive is being tested in the courts. We want to know where consumers have had problems and feel that their rights are not protected. We want to know for some of the special cases which we have not been able to cover this time, like gambling – the effect on national lotteries – pharmaceuticals and books, the real problems that they are having. All of those I suggest need to be covered by the feedback.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point I want to make is about speed. Mrs Palacio referred in her introduction to Internet years and the speed of approach. We were challenged by the Commission and by the Council to get this directive through as quickly as possible. I say to both of them, and in particular to representatives of the Council here, we have risen to that challenge and we now expect Member Governments to behave with the same speed to get this legislation transposed. We encourage the Commission and the Council to get the remaining bits of that legislation to us as quickly as possible because that is what Europe needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There can be no doubt that the job of the Parliament tomorrow is without further ado to vote through the report unanimously.</p>
<p class="contents">Commission, Parliament and Council have had ample time to discuss and debate at both first and second reading and, as the rapporteur said, most of Parliament’s views now feature in the Council common position. It is therefore a balanced proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remind ourselves that the Lisbon special EU Summit in March set us new targets and deadlines to make better use of the Internet, strengthening Europe’s competitiveness in the knowledge economy. This therefore means we need to create a clear and simple, predictable and consistent legal framework for electronic commerce. It is now an economic and political imperative. The directive will go a significant way towards creating the framework which is necessary to provide the confidence that both business and consumers desire to maximise the potential of <span class="italic">e-</span>business.</p>
<p class="contents">From the wealth of letters and comments that I have received as a member of the Legal Affairs Committee, I know it is not possible to please all interested parties. Concerns still exist but I believe that Council, Commission and Parliament have struck the right balance between the need to protect public policy and consumers and at the same time promote and support the growth of <span class="italic">e</span>-business.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore strongly recommend that Parliament endorses and adopts Mrs Palacio’s report, which represents a common position. We do this in the full knowledge that the <span class="italic">e</span>-economy is evolving at a rapid pace. We are witnessing in the 21st century the equivalent of the Industrial Revolution. That means, as policymakers and institutions, we are still navigating our way through uncharted terrain. We need therefore to continue, as Mr Harbour said, to have a full consultation and debate on both the outstanding and arising issues for business and consumers. In particular, this is the case given the global nature of <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce. We have in this directive an article which allows us to do that. Article 21 of the common position provides for a review and we should use the time until then to deepen and further our knowledge on this critical sector of the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would warn against complacency. We need to continue to consult with interested parties in this debate and we need to ensure that the result is a national legislation and that we produce clear, appropriate and speedy legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The legal framework of the internal market plays a crucial role in this. The present proposal removes a whole raft of obstacles and uncertainties which businesses are still having to negotiate in the field of <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce. These uncertainties have been there for far too long because the Council needed nearly a year to determine its positions. </p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the copyright directive has been with the Council since February 1999, i.e. for over a year now. In the light of the speed of developments, neither industry nor consumers benefit from such delays. Parliament works significantly faster. </p>
<p class="contents">The country of origin principle is one of the internal market’s cornerstones. It is therefore obvious that this should be extended to cross-border <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce. One cause for concern in this respect, however, is that this principle will only apply to trade between businesses for the time being. Revisions of private international law for the benefit of on-line trade with consumers are in the pipeline. It is crucial in this respect that disputes are settled out of court as much as possible. After all, court proceedings are drawn-out and costly. I would therefore call on the Commission to support initiatives to this effect. </p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that the present directive is not being dealt with in conjunction with, and at the same time as, the copyright directive, because there are inconsistencies in terms of liability of service providers. How does the Commissioner intend to create unambiguous and legally secure positions for service providers? I would like a reply to this question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will not go into the technical and legal details, which were covered by the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio with her usual competence, and I would like to thank her for the extremely skilful way in which she handled the legislative procedure for this directive. </p>
<p class="contents">A further point: the new economy is something which the European economic and social model will have to address, and it must exploit all the opportunities for development and new jobs it provides. We are witnessing a new industrial revolution. Consequently, the structure of the European economy is in need of legal infrastructures and, tomorrow, we are going to meet that need. The absence of legal infrastructures is holding back development. The internal market has become a reality and the fundamental freedoms enshrined by the Treaty of Rome as objectives have indeed been achieved, but whilst in the past the creation of the internal market was an end in itself leading to economic development, now new challenges have arisen for a market which is being forced to compete with the rest of the world by the globalisation of the economy. </p>
<p class="contents">The European economic and social model, which is based on the social market economy, is quite capable of dealing with world-wide competition, provided that it succeeds in evolving, eliminating all the unnecessary rigid constraints which are responsible for its continuing weakness in some areas. It is no longer good enough just to create any old market: the internal market must be competitive, regulated in such a way as to allow firms to produce and trade quality goods and services at costs which are compatible with those of competitors. This constituted the historic change brought about by electronic commerce – a revolution whose scope and implications are still not fully understood. We only need to think back to the issues we have worked on in the past: risk capital, highly skilled services, innovation tools and the protection of intellectual and industrial property. All these areas will have to evolve, and, in many cases, change completely. </p>
<p class="contents">A malicious thought has come to me: what will become of the petty national protectionist behaviour which we have witnessed in recent years? Now, at this time of revolution, a large number of issues dear to the European People’s Party must be reassessed. The social market economy also means solidarity and paying due attention to the more vulnerable strata of society which, in the industrial revolution sparked off by the Internet, also now include those who do not know how to use a computer. This potential for growth is our challenge for the future! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new technology is in the process of transforming our lives and, together with the new currency, can create a completely new Europe. However, we are not alone in the world; <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce means competition, not only for companies but also for politicians. Faulty regulations and obstacles both old and new can mean our failing to make the most of our historic opportunity for new freedom and success. </p>
<p class="contents">The development of information technology provides new opportunities to communicate and to disseminate information simply and cheaply. The increased flow of information through Bulletin Board Systems, electronic mail and the Internet ought not to be subject to greater restrictions than traditional information channels and communication facilities. A guiding principle for the new technology ought to be that everyone should have considerable freedom to make use of it and exploit the advantages it has to offer and that everyone should also be responsible for what they do. </p>
<p class="contents">The basis of a democracy must be that freedom of expression should be protected, not restricted. Communication using computers should be viewed in the same way as any medium of communication. </p>
<p class="contents">It is stated in one of the items, item 48, that the directive does not affect Member States’ ability to prevent a certain amount of illegal activity by imposing demands upon service providers who store information from their clients. I proposed that that sentence should be removed because it does not have anything to do with the criteria for being able to impose the restrictions concerned. It is not appropriate for the Member States to decide this issue or to demand that service providers be held liable for the actual details of the information provided. That would be as absurd as making a café owner liable for monitoring what is said across the café tables. Is there anyone who wants to see a utilitarian nanny State? I do not think so. I therefore also support Amendment No 1, which I think is extremely important and deals precisely with this issue. </p>
<p class="contents">E-commerce crime, or <span class="italic">cyber crime </span>as it is called, should, in my view, be combated by means of better working methods on the part of the police and not by means of legislation which is in danger of compromising basic democratic values. </p>
<p class="contents">It is time to implement the decisions about quality labelling and, in cooperation with the service providers, to devise practical codes of conduct without thereby raising the cost levels for consumers or introducing costly bureaucracy. <span class="italic">Freedom with responsibility </span>ought to be the motto for continued work on developing this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome her recommendation that we should not suggest any amendments to the common position. All current surveys show the great economic potential of electronic business. The previous speakers have already described that in graphic terms, so I need not go into the subject or this aspect of it again.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe continues to trail behind the USA in e-business. Yet we have a real chance to catch up. Europe is presently seeing a wave of Internet companies being set up. We must give political support to this trend. We must also encourage stronger competition on the local telephone markets to make Internet connection cheaper. In this context, let me also give special thanks to the Commission, to Mr Bolkestein and his colleague, Mr Liikanen, who has also done an excellent job here with the TC package he forwarded to us in Parliament a few months ago. Many thanks! I think that means we have a very good policy in that area as well.</p>
<p class="contents">At European level, the creation of the European single market and the introduction of the euro are certainly decisive factors in the promotion of electronic business. Furthermore, e-business will be encouraged tomorrow when we adopt a legal framework for electronic commerce in the European Union. That will send out a clear signal. It will show that Europe is open and is able to promote the Internet as a new form of communication and commerce. I believe it is also a good signal in terms of attracting foreign investment.</p>
<p class="contents">On the content of the directive, I just want to emphasise one key point which some of the previous speakers have also addressed. It is the question of the regulations that a web trader has to comply with for cross-border transactions. Here the regulation provides that what is known as the principle of the country of origin should apply. That means that a service provider is subject only to the control and the legal system of the Member State in which he is established. The aim is to prevent him from having to comply with the different legal provisions of all the countries in which his clients may reside. That saves him a considerable financial outlay in these transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it also creates a new situation, to which industry and national legislators will have to adjust. Divergent rules in the Member States, on advertising, for instance, will mean that Internet providers in the European Union are treated differently. That is why we need changes to the law and more far-reaching harmonisation in some respects. In Germany, for example, we may well have to abolish the law on discounts and the regulations on free gifts.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad the directive also contains a review clause. I would ask the Commission to take that very seriously. We in Parliament will, of course, follow developments in e-business closely and give appropriate support to any Commission proposals for a revision of the directive in a few years’ time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not merely that she is not proposing any amendments – although that is an example that some rapporteurs might follow with advantage, rather it is because she has recognised the overriding importance of taking this legislation forward and putting it on the statute book.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been mentioned this evening, <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce and online business are developing very rapidly and it is very important that we put in place a legislative framework in Europe within which it can develop and flourish. Indeed, as Mrs Wallis said, you must remember it is not only within Europe. It is actually a global industry and it is around the world that we want to see a proper framework established.</p>
<p class="contents">It is always easy to be wise after the event and no doubt if we do proceed apace we may not achieve a 100% satisfactory outcome. It is one of the interesting characteristics of the Community system of legislation that it is relatively easy to bring forward amending legislation. This can be done quickly if necessary, as Mr Lehne pointed out. So there is no reason to delay. Speed on this occasion is of the essence. It is important that we are not distracted from setting a framework within which <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce can develop for the benefit of both business and the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">Professor MacCormick said that there seems to be a very great deal of agreement about the need to go forward without amending this proposal. One of my colleagues in another parliament, of which I have the privilege to be a Member, always says ‘the one way of identifying things when you are wrong is when everybody is in agreement about it’. On this occasion I do not believe we are wrong to approach this matter in that way and I hope this Parliament will agree with me with a big majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, it is essential that we have a legal framework in place as soon as possible. However, I would like to make certain observations which may be useful in this second phase which is so necessary. We should not forget that the Internet is international. We are talking about a directive for the internal market, but, as its original name, the ‘World Wide Web’, suggests, it is international and we should bear this in mind as a fundamental reference, above all because the Internet is going to determine Europe’s economic position in the future, as well as its political position and its ability to influence the global, social and cultural environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe it is fundamental that we bear in mind that the bulk of this success stems from the creation of new companies, the creation of small- and medium-sized enterprises. Therefore, in the review which is carried out, it is essential that we remember not only the consumers – who in any event must make their own decisions and must use mechanisms for encrypting and protecting their data in accordance with laws and with technology – but also the SMEs, because otherwise there will soon be little electronic commerce in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It therefore seems essential to make a genuine effort to homogenise the rules of the internal market and, at the same time, work energetically to unify the principles applied on a global level with regard to electronic commerce. There is no point in having sound regulations for our internal market if we lose sight of the bigger picture.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve this, it is also important to bear in mind that the regulations of the country of origin are fundamental, since, without them, small- and medium-sized businesses would find it difficult to operate and would encounter obstacles to achieving their objectives, because they do not have access to the same resources as large companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The electronic market is a prime market in terms of growth, employment and future prospects, and not just in Europe. We must therefore exploit all its opportunities and it is important that this regulation on electronic commerce has removed the barriers created by divergent legislative provisions and the ensuing legal uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur analyses the common position in the spirit of constructive criticism. Let me pick up on two points of detail that are very close to my heart and where I would have liked to see the common position worded more clearly. First, there is the question of the sale of medicines and, secondly, the protection of books as a cultural asset in connection with the existing fixed book price agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">On the first point, let me say briefly that in my country, Austria, we have banned the sale of medicines by mail order. So there is some concern that firms established in Member States where this is allowed could encourage Austrian patients to order and buy medicines through the Internet. In view of the health risks alone, I once again ask for extra clarification in the common position, so as to ensure that advertising activities and agreements with a view to the mail order of medicines are excluded from the area coordinated by the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns cultural assets. Article 1(6) is the only article in the directive that refers, and then only in very general terms, to the cultural area, to the protection and promotion of cultural diversity. I think that is not good enough. So I would ask for it to be made clear that the directive does not apply to the fixed book price schemes introduced via legislation or arrangement in some Member States. Furthermore, operators established in Member States other than the countries concerned should not be allowed to undermine these schemes when selling to an end consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned, the question of <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce in medicines and the protection of cultural diversity will be an important issue in the review scheduled in three years’ time, which I welcome. I ask the Commission to devote special attention to these two points. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seemed it was the representatives of our political group that were going at such a rate, and I did not notice. I am a little out of breath. Hopefully, however, it will not have an effect on the matter in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">It was easy to agree with the explanations given in section 6 by the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, as to why Parliament wishes to adopt the Directive under discussion in accordance with the common position. As so many have already said, the matter is urgent, and I agree. Stressing the importance of the review clause is only prudent in such urgent legislative plans as these. I am satisfied that, as in the directive on electronic money for which I was rapporteur, a review clause is to be included.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive in hand is immensely important as regards the competitiveness of the EU. It is pointless to deny that a veritable race is going on between the various continents in the area of electronic commerce. There is competition with regard to speed and innovation. From the point of view of unemployment within Europe, which remains high, we should remember that it is the early bird that catches the worm. New jobs will be created where the new technology is first introduced. We cannot watch from the wings while Europe consistently lags behind the United States and other global challengers.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, Parliament will not solve the challenges of <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce by intervening itself in a big way or through regulation. Wisdom is not always a characteristic of politicians, be they in the Commission, the Council, or in this Chamber. Too much regulation will freeze commerce over the Internet and prevent it from adapting to new circumstances and technical developments. This must also be borne in mind, especially in relation to the second reading of the copyright directive soon to take place here. To derive maximum benefit from <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce we have to ensure there is real competition in the telecommunications networks. Like Mrs Niebler, I would also like to thank Mr Liikanen, and express my gratitude for the work the Commission has done with such determination in this area. Only through competition will we be able to reduce costs, and thus increase the length of time people use the Internet, as well as increase the volume of electronic commerce. If we just sit here talking about details, we will not manage to lay down even elementary up-to-date standards for electronic commerce. How do we imagine we will be prepared for the next stage, <span class="italic">m</span>-commerce, or wireless commerce, if we cannot meet the demands of <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce? That is why I support the previous speakers regarding the adoption of the common position with no amendments.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. </span>– <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, could I first of all convey my thanks and compliments to the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio, for the way in which she has handled this matter. She has taken into account the importance of, and urgent need for, this directive, and she has cleared the way for the prompt and final approval thereof. On behalf of the Commission, I would like to express my great appreciation for the crucial role which Parliament, and the rapporteur in particular, have played in the negotiations on this directive. Mrs Palacio has spoken about a milestone in the development of the European Union. I think that she is right and it is indeed a lucky coincidence that this milestone should be reached a few days short of the fiftieth anniversary of Europe Day which will take place next Tuesday. </p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s approach to this directive and the effect Parliament has had on bringing about the common position could well serve as a model for future cooperation between the institutions. I will return to this in a moment, but on behalf of my staff, I would very quickly like to thank those Members of this House who have carried out the Commission’s work. I would like to thank those Members of this House who, in turn, have thanked the Commission for the work it has done. Once again, this is something which my staff will greatly appreciate and I am grateful to the Members for their comments. </p>
<p class="contents">I probably do not need to stress the urgency with which clear and flexible legislation is needed for <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce within the European Union. This is legislation which will offer legal certainty to industry and the consumer. Rapid approval of this directive is vital in order to attain this goal. In fact, heads of government stressed this recently at the Lisbon Summit, as was pointed out by Mrs McCarthy, among others. The directive must ensure that the principles of the internal market also apply to the information society services and that small- and medium-sized businesses, in particular, can consider the entire European market as their home market. Many in this House, especially the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio, have emphasised this aspect for the benefit of small- and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore of the opinion that the directive will stimulate European integration and will, consequently, lead to greater economic growth, more investments in innovation and more jobs in Europe. It will also have a favourable effect on the European industry’s competitive position within the global market and this aspect too has been stressed by a number of Members in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the directive strikes a very precise balance between all private and public interests involved. This has also been acknowledged by various MEPs. Mrs Wallis spoke of the right balance that has been struck and this was echoed by Mrs McCarthy.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members are left feeling not completely satisfied. This is understandable. When the right balance is struck, this invariably means that one or other party cannot achieve its ambitions. Mr Lehne mentioned that he was not 100% satisfied and Mrs Wallis too has said that it is better to have what might be an imperfect directive with a review rather than none at all. This is, of course, true. As I said, I understand that not everybody can be happy when the right balance is struck. The French language captures this sentiment rather beautifully with the expression: <span class="italic">on ne peut pas contenter tout le monde et sa belle-mère </span>[You can’t please all of the people all of the time].</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has not tabled any amendments and has thus paved the way for a swift approval. This is a wise and much appreciated decision taken by all major political groups. I too would like to express my appreciation for this. Parliament has been extremely sensible, if I may say so. The decision is justified, not only on account of the pressing nature of the directive, but also because the common position offers a sound and – I repeat – well-balanced compromise. This compromise is in line with the internal market’s direct approach, which received huge support at first reading and which was supplemented by Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">Parliament tabled a number of amendments at first reading which proved to make a positive contribution to the common position and which elucidated and reinforced the Commission’s original proposal. Those amendments have been incorporated in the Commission’s amended proposal and subsequently in the common position. It should also be stressed that Parliament’s rapid approval of this directive without any further amendments was made possible thanks to the excellent cooperation between the rapporteur, the Finnish Presidency and the European Commission. This has also been highlighted by the rapporteur and the Commission is grateful for this. </p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the common position fully reflects the support which Parliament has given to the internal market approach at first reading. I think that we should, and can, learn from this close cooperation between Parliament, the Presidency and the Commission in order to accelerate the decision-making process in policy areas which fall under the codecision procedure. In my opinion, further consultation is necessary in order to find out how we can improve this approach in future. </p>
<p class="contents">As a necessary step following on from all these efforts, the Commission will now commit itself, at Parliament’s request, to a swift and accurate transposition of the directive, taking into consideration the balance which has been struck between all the different interests and which undertakes to ensure that the directive is implemented correctly. This mainly applies to the country of origin principle which has been mentioned many times this evening, as well as the liability of intermediaries, which is also a very important aspect of this directive. In this connection, the Commission will be happy to meet Parliament’s request to issue guidelines for codes of conduct and to stimulate the establishment of effective procedures for notification and removal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a few words regarding the specific questions which have been raised by Members of your House. First of all, I would like to address a comment made by Mr Harbour regarding feedback. In answer to Mr Harbour’s remarks, I would like to say that the Commission plans to monitor the implementation of a feedback structure by the various Member States very closely. The Commission most definitely intends to encourage all interested parties to keep the Commission abreast of all the possible problems which could crop up. The Commission will be setting up a website with this goal in mind, thus enabling interactive exchange with all parties, with the intention of taking these remarks on board when this directive is up for review in three years’ time. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this review, Mr Lehne expressed the hope that it will take place under the mandate of this Commission. This Commission will still be within its mandate, at least if Parliament so wishes, because, as you are aware, the Commission as a whole is, of course, reliant on assent from this Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">I will now move on to a question raised by Mrs Plooij who spoke about the way in which the different directives have to be aligned with each other. I would like to inform Mrs Plooij that the directive on copyright in the information society will be discussed during the forthcoming Internal Market Council, which will take place on 25 May. The Portuguese Presidency will make every effort to reach a common position during that Internal Market Council. One of the key topics which is still being discussed concerns the exemptions which can be made on copyright and, more specifically, exemptions for the benefit of technical copies, which are necessary to ensure that a free flow of data remains possible on the web. Needless to say, this point is very closely linked to the provisions of the <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce directive which we are debating this evening, provisions which concern the liability of service providers. I would like to assure Mrs Plooij that the Commission is absolutely determined to ensure that both directives are brought into line with each other with regard to this important matter, in order to create legal certainty, which is needed both by parties entitled and service providers in the information society. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to address a comment from Mr Karas. He has spoken about the trade in pharmaceutics. I would like to point out that the introduction onto the market of pharmaceutics by means of advertising and sale, etc. is bound by strict national and Community rules. Distance selling, particularly of pharmaceutics, is greatly restricted or even banned in certain Member States. Those restrictions also apply to selling via the Internet. Given the Internet’s global dimension, there is indeed a risk that Community legislation on advertising and sales of pharmaceutics via the Internet could be by-passed by companies based outside the European Union. The risk is there. This is why the Commission is now working together with the Member States to find solutions to this problem and to examine whether and on which points Community legislation is necessary in this field. </p>
<p class="contents">This concludes the remarks which I would like to make on behalf of the Commission at the end of this debate. I would once again like to convey my heartfelt thanks, first of all to the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio, and also to all the others who have taken part in this debate for their constructive attitude, as a result of which no further amendments were tabled at second reading. It has also facilitated the swift adoption of this directive, at least I assume so, because the vote is tomorrow, so that we can swiftly move on to the next stage and implement <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce for the benefit of all EU economies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
