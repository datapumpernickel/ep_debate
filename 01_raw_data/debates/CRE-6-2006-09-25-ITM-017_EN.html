I would first of all like to express my gratitude to Mrs Trüpel of the Committee on Culture and Education, but also to the other committees involved in this report because others were engaged, and also to the political groups for their constructive discussions with the Presidency and with the Commission that have led us to the agreement on this recommendation on key competences.</p>
<p class="contents">All institutions have made efforts in order to find a balanced text and to allow a first reading agreement. We all agreed on the importance of this proposal for European citizens and for developing consistent and comprehensive lifelong learning strategies which should help Europe to fulfil its goal of becoming a Europe of knowledge, a knowledge-friendly Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of this recommendation is to identify and define the skills that everyone needs for living, learning and working in a knowledge society. It covers the traditional skills such as literacy and information communication technologies – digital grammar – but it also goes beyond them by including skills which are important for citizenship, for living together in more and more varied societies. I believe that this recommendation after approval should be translated as quickly as possible into concrete measures in order to help people in their studies and training.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim is to improve citizens’ employability, job opportunities and chances for the future. I think that a lot of work was done, especially by Mrs Trüpel and her colleagues, to analyse, discuss and amend our initial proposal. As a result of the successful negotiations, I think a number of clarifications and improvements have been made, while keeping the text short and concise. I think that the recommendation now better addresses the literacy problem and the need for equal opportunities, the need for procedures to validate skills and to evaluate achievements.</p>
<p class="contents">Target groups now include those with low skills and specific groups such as people returning to work; moreover, a number of definitions of competences have been clarified. This report, together with some other reports and with the programme which we will have from New Year 2007 for lifelong learning, could create much better conditions for the value of knowledge, for the value of qualifications and for a knowledge-friendly Europe. I appreciate the strong support in this Parliament – whether we speak about the programme or legislative tools – for education and learning and training policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank you all for your cooperation in achieving this base for a recommendation and also I look forward to further support when we come to implementation.</p>

<p class="contents">Looking back briefly, let me say that the recommendation on key competences for lifelong learning takes as its starting point the changed state of the world, with a globalised economy in which Europe stands a chance only if we provide our people with better education and training, which is why education policy is meant to be – and must be – an integral part of the Lisbon Strategy. Being a continent without much in the way of its own raw materials, our chances of having a future in a globalised economy are closely tied up with the resources of education and research; it is in people’s qualities and skills that our future potential is to be found, and that is why the Member States and the European Union must invest more in education and clarify their thinking about what skills are actually needed in a knowledge-based society. That is the purpose of the recommendations on the eight key competences, and I will repeat that these are no more than recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">The key competences are: firstly, communication in one's mother tongue; secondly, communication in foreign languages; thirdly, competences in maths, science and technology; fourth, digital competence; fifth, learning to learn; sixth, interpersonal, intercultural and social competences, and civic competence; seventh, entrepreneurship, and the eighth is cultural expression. All of them are needed for social cohesion, employability and personal development. It is intended that the Member States should be supported making policies enabling all young people, once their basic education is completed, to possess sufficient key competences to be able to embark on adult life, and adults to develop these competences in line with the latest knowledge throughout their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">The key competences are not ranked in any kind of hierarchy; while they are all equal in value, they do of course overlap, and they all contribute towards a successful life in a knowledge-based society. These competences are defined as a combination of knowledge, skills and attitudes. It is the key competences that we all need if we are to enjoy personal satisfaction in the knowledge society, that we need for our own personal development, for active participation, social integration and employment. The concept of mankind underpinning this definition of key competences bears the stamp of humanism, and what breathes life into this recommendation is the idea that competences are not to be considered solely in terms of the uses to which they can be put, but that education is always of value in itself as well.</p>
<p class="contents">This concept of key skills includes such attitudes as critical thinking, creativity, the seizing of initiative, problem-solving, the willingness to take risks, decision-making and entrepreneurial flair. As I see it, we have, politically speaking, opted for the right approach in giving the Member States these definitions as guidelines for their educational policies, thereby enabling them to prepare themselves better for the future. My particular concern was that it should, in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission, be made clear that, no matter how ambitious these key skills are – for we must all keep on learning if we are to succeed and be content in a knowledge-based society – the social aspect must not be forgotten, for not everyone starts from the same point or with the same opportunities. That is why it is particularly important to help and support people with learning difficulties by reason of their background or social position, those who have dropped out of school, people with poor literacy skills, the long-term unemployed or people who want to get back to work after a long break, not least – and in particular – women returning to work after having children. All these circumstances need to be taken into account if people are to be given the specific help they need to make use of their educational opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Following a number of rounds of negotiations with the Council, we were able to agree on a recommendation that is socially aware and emphasises gender equality, while at the same time being very ambitious. I regard this compromise as a good one, and so my recommendation to all the Members of this House is that they adopt this text in the version agreed at first reading. The negotiations were constructive and interesting, and for that I want to extend the warmest of thanks to the Members of this House, to the Commission and to the Council.</p>

People need to learn at every stage of life; key competences need to be acquired and constantly refreshed – such things as command of one’s mother tongue and of foreign languages, technical and mathematical expertise, social skills and awareness of other cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">Help is available from the European level to develop these skills and thereby help make individuals more employable. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted – unanimously, indeed – my opinion, in which we had achieved compromises across party lines. My concern was with something to which the Commission draft does not yet give much emphasis, namely better provision for disadvantaged groups, such as people with disabilities, the long-term unemployed and those who dropped out of school early, all of whom find difficulties placed in their way when it comes to acquiring new skills on their own initiative. If they are to make up for what they lack, they need to be provided with something tailor-made for them. Young people on housing estates with high levels of unemployment feel abandoned and frustrated too; they need psychological support and special help if they are to gain self-confidence and be motivated to work to improve the conditions under which they and their families live. The object of lifelong learning is the acquisition of key competences in order, not only to adapt oneself to change, but also, and in particular, to be an active agent of change.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee is in favour of these competences being tested every three years at national, regional and local level, and the results of these tests being published, for only then will it become clear in which areas real progress has been achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recommendation should help to improve the quality of life for all EU citizens. In other words, it can help hundreds of millions of people. Given those numbers, it is extremely difficult to create a structure and definition of key competences that is optimal, well-balanced, appropriate and user-friendly and that would also meet expectations, help integrate people into society, and contribute to the fulfilment of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment. The recommendation attempts to define the skills that will form the modern profile of the European citizen, skills that all EU citizens could and should be able to achieve. I feel this is a lofty ambition and that it is a long way from being fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">As a reference tool, this document should prove useful. Its clear weakness is, of course, that it attempts to profile the citizen in all the complex aspects of life, yet without defining a hierarchy of the competences involved. Just as every scientific project has different goals and different methods for achieving those goals, the target competences of an integrated social nature should be identified; in this case, for example, I refer to relations between people and relations between cultures, or business skills and the more methodical competences that lead to the achievement of goals. I mention the relationship to scientific projects deliberately, because competences in the field of science, including scientific principles and methods, are among the key competences. The significance of key competences is all the greater in relation to an information society and a knowledge-based society. I feel there is a lack of emphasis here on how society must be based on mutual respect and democracy. For me, the social principle is a priority and I regard people’s ability to live together as the most important competence. I wish to congratulate Mrs Trüpel, as she has made a very positive contribution to the quality of this document. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Globalisation presents us with huge challenges; ordinary people are obliged to adapt themselves with ever-greater speed and flexibility to new conditions, and in this, education – in both the social and economic sense – acquires strategic significance. If you want equality of opportunity in Europe, you must ensure that education is made accessible to all and that disadvantages – whether resulting from personal, social, cultural or economic circumstances – are minimised, and this is particularly relevant in view of the forthcoming ‘Year of Equal Opportunities for All’.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the Lisbon Strategy’s ambitious goal of making Europe the world’s most dynamic knowledge-based economic area, making outsiders of wide swathes of the population is something we cannot afford, and so we, in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, welcome the reference framework that Mrs Trüpel has outlined, which includes the eight key competences. It is particularly such disadvantaged groups as those whose parental homes or lack of primary education denied them the opportunity of secure and sound vocational training who must not be excluded. People with learning disabilities, those who dropped out of school, the long-term unemployed and those returning to work after having a family – which means primarily women – not to mention older people, migrants and the disabled, must be supported in their endeavours by targeted policies and programmes, such as those for lifelong learning, although we are well aware that the regulation of education systems is largely a matter for the Member States and is also highly diverse. It is only recently that educational matters in Germany have, by means of the reform of federalism, been transferred from the national level and handed over to the regions, and so I urge that agreement be speedily reached on a European frame of reference. To take a narrowly and pettily national view of education and of lifelong learning would be to capitulate in the face of the challenges of today’s world, our response to which will, at the end of the day, determine whether the European economic and social model proves to be a success or a failure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Eight competences are listed in the report, but I personally believe that the fifth competence, ‘learning to learn’, is one of the more important, because lifelong learning is a process. It enables us not only to adapt to change but also to manage change, and I believe it helps us effect change. In this context, it not only contributes to achieving the Lisbon objectives or to coping with globalisation, but also greatly enhances our quality of life. Education is not just about knowledge and jobs: it is also about the development of the whole person. Lifelong learning is an enabling process. It often gives people a second chance or, indeed, a third chance, or simply another chance.</p>
<p class="contents">As a former teacher of 20 years, I am fully aware that formal schooling is just one part of education and that lifelong learning should be a natural continuation of that process. It is crucial that lifelong learning is accessible to all and that realistic, practical and accessible opportunities are available so that citizens may acquire basic skills or indeed enhance their existing skills.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, appropriate provision should be made to include, in particular, those with special needs, early school-leavers, people with a disability, the long-term unemployed and those with poor literacy or numeracy skills. A recent survey in my own area of North Leitrim, West Cavan, indicated low levels of literacy among men in rural areas in particular. This needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency, in particular because it is crucial to realise that poor literacy skills act as a barrier to political participation. I agree with a previous speaker that is not just an educational issue but a fundamental democratic one.</p>

<p class="contents">We very rarely disagree about culture and education, and that is terrific; the only thing is that we have no money, and that is a problem that we all have to deal with, so I am glad that we have been able to roll out the mobility charter as part of the new lifelong learning programme and are, today, discussing the key competences, which – since this is an area in which we have no power – can be seen only as recommendations. What we can do, though, is make suggestions. A week ago, I was in Sarajevo at a major conference on lifelong learning, at which we discussed key competences – a concept that everyone is taking on board. I think it sends out a wonderful signal when we make such suggestions and countries that are not yet in the European Union act on them.</p>
<p class="contents">Striking a positive note, I would like to observe that this will provide a frame of reference for key competences, which make it possible for people to adapt themselves to a changing labour market in a knowledge-based society. I would also like to say how glad I am that this proposal advances the development of national strategies for lifelong learning and thus also curriculum reforms, while also, of course, promoting the standardisation of adult and continuing education in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the recommendation relating to the inclusion of people with special needs, about which much has been said, and about how to bring the European dimension into civic competences, which means how to impart knowledge of our European history and foster awareness of our European cultural identity. I would suggest that you buy a copy of the Franco-German history books that have been on the market for the past three months, and which are wonderful in the way they show what European identity means.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to urge that we should not, on the basis of this recommendation, indulge in excessively utopian fantasies of what 2010 is going to be like; superlatives are not, in essence, of any use to us. Let us instead build on it a realistic possibility for all members of the public to acquire basic skills and develop them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Shock therapy ensured Estonia’s rapid return to the European cultural and economic area. But Estonian society has split into winners and losers. Among the working population, the winners are the young people, who in this new situation quickly acquired the necessary diploma and skills. The losers are those who are nearing pension age. They were considered relics who could not be retrained.</p>
<p class="contents">The acquisition of the eight key competencies proposed by the commission would definitely make it easier for workers to adapt to the changing requirements in the labour market. American workers change professions an average of three times during their lifetimes. This will soon become common in Europe as well. With the increase in life expectancy, a forty-five-year-old worker will be only half way through his or her career. This means new initiatives in middle age, although age discrimination is still undoubtedly a reality for workers in middle and lower-level jobs throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">In introducing the system of lifelong learning, we must change societal perception. The eight key competencies must be given a content that would give workers confidence in the future; a confidence arising from their belief in their own ability to develop. At the same time, employers must be encouraged to invest in experienced people from outside. Europe must become accustomed to lifelong learning as an everyday phenomenon and an integral part of working life; otherwise, the achievement of the Lisbon objectives will only be wishful thinking.</p>

This report, this recommendation concerning key competences, is about using the same funds more efficiently so as to ensure better outcomes. Last year there were six million student dropouts in the European Union. This is an enormous number. I believe that this number alone should be enough to make us focus more on what subjects are taught and how they are taught, on curriculum content and on improving the supply side, as our schools all too often produce young graduates who join the ranks of the unemployed.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make just a few observations for everyone to consider. This understanding of key competences implies a kind of equilibrium and a single space both for economic competitiveness and social cohesion or social responsibility. The same argument can be used regarding the relationship between the humanities and the natural sciences. Both are necessary. I believe that the key competences reflect this. As Mrs Pack has said, this serves as a basis of reform for many countries in the Western Balkans, the new Member States, and even in the old ones. It is a good thing that we can stimulate and in a way unify this process and progress towards modernising educational content.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to underscore what Mrs Harkin has said, namely that the key competence is learning to learn rather than wait for encyclopaedic knowledge to be acquired in school; being able to handle information, experience and an environment which are increasingly more complex and more global. In addition, the cultural faculty for perceiving and expressing oneself, as well as interpersonal and intersocial relations are extremely important in shaping personalities and mature citizens. I would therefore like to thank Mrs Trüpel again for her excellent presentation of the committee’s position. I believe that this will be reflected in the vote. I am looking forward to more progress in implementing the key competences and skills. This is a process.</p>
