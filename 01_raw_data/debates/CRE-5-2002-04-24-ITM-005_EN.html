<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wynn (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, looking around we could have met in the bar. It would have been a lot more cosy than this. It is nice to see those of you who are here. Whilst this appears on the agenda as the Wynn report, it has only just become the Wynn report. It was the Costa Neves report. Carlos Costa Neves, who was the budget rapporteur for 2002, has now moved on to the Portuguese Government, and I for one was sorry to see him leave. He has done a sterling job and I want to put on record my thanks for the work that he has done on the 2002 Budget. I understand that the PPE-DE group have now nominated Mr Podestà as the new rapporteur. So I am the in-between bit. Hence you have the Wynn report on Supplementary and Amending Budget No 2. The Council and one or two Members are concerned about the amendments that we have tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States, quite rightly, want the money back that was not spent last year. This amounts to around EUR 10 billion, a significant amount of money. It is not the total amount, however, because one amount went back last year, and there is probably still another one or two billion which will come forward in Supplementary and Amending Budget No 3. We have a choice of whether to give the money back to the Member States or whether we try to put it to use in other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing that has been made clear to us is that in next year's budget there could be shortfalls, especially in the Structural Funds, where the Category 2 expenditure on payments may well have to be exceeded. Therefore, one of the reasons for our amendments is to alleviate that problem next year by making the monies available this year. Consequently, the Member States will not receive ten billion back, but something in the region of EUR 5.5 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council and certain Member States have queried the legality of the amendment and our right to do this. The simple answer is yes, we do have this right. We have done similar things since 1994, which have never been challenged by the Council, because it recognises that, at the end of the day, it is the Treaty that counts, and the Treaty gives Parliament the final say on the budget when the President signs the budget. Consequently, what we consider a routine operation in amending this SAB has given one or two of our friends in the Council some ideas about challenging it from a legal point of view. I think they would be unwise to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem seems to be that we will delay the new system of own resources by not voting the SAB through in its entirety tomorrow. Well, yes, we will, but that is not our fault. The Commission, out of the goodness of its heart, was trying to do the Council a favour by putting these changes into this SAB. We want to see them too, but quite frankly, the sooner we get the SAB voted at our second reading, on the assumption that the Council does not agree with our first reading, then the changes will come about.</p>
<p class="contents">A third criticism from the Council is that there is no chance whatsoever of spending the money this year. If that is the case, we could do something about it later on. As I said SAB 3 is coming. We have asked the Commission for information on how the money can be spent, whether it can be spent in time or whether all of it can be spent. If the Commission comments support the Council's position, then of course we will have to re-consider. If we do not do it under SAB 2, then we could certainly do it under SAB 3. For those trying to read between the lines, I hope that message is pretty clear, because this is not just about this particular SAB. There are other consequences. If I use the words 'Financial Regulation' then the penny may drop with some people and they may begin to understand what I am talking about when I keep mentioning SAB 3.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect here is that some Member States, including my own, will say that there will be a hole in their own budgets. They are right. The easiest way to fill that hole is to get this business sorted out as quickly as possible. This is linked, however, not only to SAB 2 or SAB 3, but also to the Financial Regulation. I would hope that with the good cooperation of all three institutions this issue can be put to rest in the not too distant future, to make the Council happy, to make ourselves happy and to make sure that the Commission can get on with doing the job that it wants to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Garriga Polledo (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I do not believe I can improvise a five-minute speech on budgetary affairs. In any event, Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues from the Committee on Budgets and everybody else interested in budgetary affairs, the Wynn report – which was previously the Costa Neves report and which will very shortly be the Podestà report, which means that it will be one of the most well-agreed and negotiated reports of this whole legislative period – contains some very interesting points for Parliament to discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, and this is an issue which affects the Commission, as our chairman Terry Wynn has pointed out, we should ask ourselves why so many amending and supplementary budgets are needed, since they very often entail administrative costs because a new procedure has to be undertaken and, above all, because these distort and devalue the annual budgetary procedure, as we all know, because we have discussed this many times. It would be preferable for us to restrict in some way this possibility of making so many amending budgets. This does not mean that Parliament does not agree with the policy of amending budgets. What is more, this Parliament, as you are well aware, is totally prepared to defend its rights so that amending budgets continue to exist in the current procedure, in their current form and with Parliament’s current rights. Therefore, we agree upon the basis, that is to say, that we agree that amending budgets should continue to exist, and that this Parliament should have something to say with regard to all of them.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking in this case about a budget of balances, an enormous budget and surplus. We are talking about EUR 10 billion plus another estimated EUR 1.2 billion. We are talking, more or less, about EUR 12 billion. This is money which was already budgeted for and which will be given back to the Member States because of an underspend. A budgetary surplus in national budgetary policy is a good thing, it is a saving. It will often be the result of efforts not to spend and is money that will revert to national coffers or to taxpayers. However, in this case we are talking about a different kind of surplus. We are talking about an underspend in budget appropriations that were approved at the time by the European Parliament. We are talking about poor execution and poor management. We do not know whether this is the responsibility of the Commission, of the Member States, of the regional authorities or whoever, but, in any case, we find ourselves having to cope with the reality of EUR 12 billion that has been poorly managed and that will have to be returned to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not good news for anyone concerned. It is not good news for the Commission nor for Parliament. Neither, essentially, is this good news for Finance Ministers, although it would appear to be so, for these are European funds, Community funds that have a multiplier effect in national economies. If they are not used, evidently this multiplier effect will not take place. Therefore, essentially, to have to give back this money as it is is a lost opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on the positive side, this budget will allow us to analyse how to reduce the balance of outstanding payments and needs for 2003 payments. Obviously, in order to enter into the payments for 2003, it is a good idea to start with payments for 2002, and for this reason amendments to payment appropriations of EUR 4.5 billion have been put forward, with which I believe this House will totally agree, because these affect all categories of expenditure. From the Structural Funds or the Leonardo programmes to the external action programmes, they cover the whole range of budgetary needs for payments.</p>
<p class="contents">We know this does not have to be a definitive position. Political life is a life of negotiation. We will have to negotiate with the Commission and the Council. Perhaps so many payment appropriations are not necessary. The effort needed for 2003 will perhaps be greater. Maybe the Council will want to reflect on the correct way to carry out interinstitutional relations, particularly with Parliament. I am sure that, in any event, the task of the three institutions this remaining month before the second part-session in May, in which we will make a definitive decision, will be a month of much negotiation and we are of course all very optimistic in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One could get the impression that, for the Finance Ministers, Easter means great big Easter eggs from Europe, which take the form of returned funds, which of course take some pressure off the national budgets, and on which we in this House have to take decisions at the beginning of each year. As has already been said far more than once, with this Supplementary and Amending Budget we will be talking about EUR 10 billion, and the EUR 2 billion that have as good as been announced are yet to be put in front of us. We must, though, remember that at the end of last year we repaid EUR 1.2 billion, whether on a one-off basis or in anticipation, which means that for this one year we are talking about over EUR 13 billion in unused resources.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, at the end of every year, when Christmas is approaching, we do not necessarily have Christmas presents for Parliament, and each time we have to fight to raise small amounts that are not allocated to important political tasks. Over the last three years we had Kosovo, where we really had to fight hard to end up with any money at all. This had to do with Serbia, it had to do with aid for fisheries in the southern parts of this EU of ours – in Spain and Portugal – and we even had to dig into our emergency reserves in order to guarantee the continuing reconstruction of the Balkans last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet today's backflow is not really cause for rejoicing, as it only means that there are resources that have not been utilised. This can mean that the programmes for which they were intended were not there, or that serious work was not done in the Member States, or that the options for giving help to the public have not been sufficiently exhausted. What it does mean in any case is that all of what has been announced must at some point or other be implemented, and every one of today's payment reimbursements is a burden for the future, because, if it is not paid out today, it will be paid out at some point in the future, and so only limited rejoicing is called for. I think that we have to make it clear that this is not really helping.</p>
<p class="contents">As long as two years ago, I suggested on one occasion that, instead of letting all the money be returned, we should put some – 10% of the returnable resources, for example – into, as it were, a reserve or emergency fund. That would, for a start, be another way of going about things. Funds would not be constantly moved back and forth, so we would, instead, be able to make rather more reliable plans, and it would also help us to move forward in other areas. Supplementary and Amending Budgets can be talked about and looked at from many different angles, this one being one of them.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Parliament intend to amend the Supplementary and Amending Budget in such a way that a substantial amount does not go straight back to the Member States. We have just heard that there are payments that have to be made in many areas, with past commitments having to be met. In the coming days and weeks, we will be intensively seeking discussions with the Council. We will pay precise attention to how amenable to discussions the Council is, and to how openly it deals with us. I do think we can find good solutions to this. We must all be aware that cooperation means that all are ready to talk to each other. That is as much the case as regards the Supplementary and Amending Budget as it is in the Budget procedure. We are ready, but we are also prepared for very intensive discussions with each other and, if need be, for an in-depth exchange of arguments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Supplementary and Amending Budget before us includes two important matters: the new basis for collecting the own resources, and carrying over last year’s surplus to cover this year’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The collection cost for Traditional Own Resources is increasing from 10% to 25% and the value added charge is falling from 1% to around half a per cent. The change is based on the new Council decision, which has only just been ratified. It will particularly benefit the EU’s net contributors. Germany’s annual contribution will fall by around EUR 847 million, that of the Netherlands by EUR 505 million, and that of Sweden and Austria by around EUR 140 million. Italy’s contribution will increase by approximately EUR 757 million and that of France by EUR 458 million. The decision shows how sensitive an issue EU contributions are in terms of internal policy, because they only represent around 1% of GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">A politically harder question is last year’s unused appropriations, which, according to the explanatory statement, amount to the enormous sum of EUR 18 billion, or 20% of the entire budget. Unused appropriations for Structural Funds alone amounted to EUR 10.5 billion, or 32% of the total. Last year EUR 6.5 billion of these funds remained unused.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason for this underutilization is first and foremost Commission bureaucracy. It is difficult to put decisions into effect. The procedure whereby decisions are taken is confused and vague. The entire process lacks any clear approach or personal accountability. Documents lie around buried under the official machinery and nobody cares about, or takes the responsibility for, delays with regard to decisions. If the budget were so poorly implemented in any Member State the government would fall straightaway. The Commission must therefore really make more of an effort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the rapporteur has rightly pointed out in the explanatory statement, the supplementary and amending budget which we are to vote on tomorrow has two distinguishing features. Firstly, it budgets for 2002 a preliminary amount of EUR 10 billion of the surplus carried over from 2001. This surplus, which is mainly the result of underspends in the areas of Structural Funds and Agriculture, is equivalent to a ‘reimbursement’ to Member States as it will decrease their payments for the 2002 Budget. Secondly, it recalculates the financing of the 2002 Budget on the basis of the new Council Decision on own resources and, as a result, the share of Traditional Own Resources in collection costs that Member States are allowed to keep has increased from 10% to 25%.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what interests me most at the moment is the first feature of this budget. If we do not allow our attention to be diverted by the populist view that it is good to save money, the full gravity of the situation becomes apparent: in other words, the European Commission, the symbol – rightly or wrongly – for millions of European citizens, of Europe, of integration, of the future, has proved incapable of implementing the budget as adopted by Parliament and the Council, and is now left with a surplus of 12 per cent. However, there is another side to the matter: the Member States, which are constantly asking for more money for structural actions and which, on the eve of enlargement, are fighting tough political battles in order not to lose Community structural support for their citizens, have been unable to implement the commitments undertaken and have not asked for payments which have already been appropriated.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, ladies and gentlemen, the problem is fairly universal and it is one that needs urgent resolution, for it is an offence to our fellow citizens and genuinely exposes us to the ridicule of a public which is becoming increasingly less disposed to understand and increasingly more liable, on the other hand, to let itself be influenced by summary criticism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unanimity is sometimes the expression of the desire of an institution to set out its stall, to make its voice heard over that of an arm of the budgetary authority which sometimes forgets the balance between Parliament and the Council and attempts to encroach upon our powers, our prerogatives and the role that we have in relation to public opinion. Yet, this problem, because of the fact that such a considerable amount was not spent, is a serious problem, it is not possible to simply ask us for a full discharge, perhaps a blank cheque, without even giving it some thought, without even asking the questions that we are asking this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">However this situation unfolds, therefore, I think that we have behaved properly towards the electorate, towards the citizens of Europe, towards ourselves, in investigating the DAB and in doing so, telling the Council to be aware that both our institutions have to decide, as that is what the Treaties stipulate and that is what logic dictates as well. We have a DAB balance; we also have responsibilities as a budgetary authority. We are fulfilling them, we are awaiting the Council’s response, we are also waiting for the Commission’s next steps and we shall issue an opinion at second reading, because this is a problem. It is right to raise it and we have done well to raise it in this way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The 2000 settlement presented a surplus in the payment forecasts of some EUR 11 billion; that for 2001 could end up at around EUR 14 billion, a surplus that will, logically, lighten Member States’ contributions in years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these conditions, doubts are cast upon these procedures and their legitimate use is undermined. These imbalances are largely concentrated in category 2. We already know that the first few years of the implementation of regional and cohesion policy, the programming phase, takes up a great deal of time, resources and energy. Suffice it to say that the approval of the Community Support Framework for objective 1 regions took place in October 2000, with regard to Spain, and this decision is the prerequisite for cofinancing.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the 2001 consumption of payments, under this heading, produces some worrying information. The rate of implementation dropped 10 points in relation to the previous year and, with regard to the total intended for objective 1 regions, it dropped 6 points. The final result is therefore a considerable increase in the RAL.</p>
<p class="contents">The current regulations of the Structural Funds should, therefore, be analysed in the light of this. Faced with enlargement, it should be improved to allow better financial management of the programmes for obvious reasons: because regional policy is at the heart of the European project and is fundamental for the progress of the integration process, and because it is a key instrument that enjoys the widest consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">Similar problems, but involving lower figures, arise in headings 3 and 4: consumption of payments in external actions in 2001 also dropped 5 points in relation to the previous year – to be specific, initiatives promoting democracy and human rights only reached 56% of the anticipated payments. I believe, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that Parliament’s amendments have no other purpose than to temporarily slow down a saving that, to a large extent, is of a transitory nature for the Member States and does not aim to hinder the management of financial flows in Member States, but to remedy a situation that is neither politically nor financially reasonable.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission should improve its working systems both in the preparatory phase and in the execution phase. In this regard, the difficulties in payments anticipated for 2003 should be resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Council should understand that Parliament exercises its competencies as budgetary authority with all that this implies and that this modified amending budget means that, even when, with regard to own resources, Parliament is not on an equal footing with the Council, in this and in other areas that are currently being discussed, what citizens are asking for is a stable institutional balance and a dialogue which obtains practical results, because there are no other alternatives that would produce improved benefits for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is because there is a great need for structural funding to be spent in our various countries and regions. We are now some two and a half years through the seven-year programme 2000-2006. We are thus over 30% of the way through, and we have grossly underspent. What we are doing now is giving the Member States the chance to get their act together and to spend this money, to help improve the environment, working conditions and employment prospects throughout our European Union. This is for the betterment of the economy as a whole and of conditions in our areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We are taking a responsible attitude and I am delighted that we have unanimity round the Chamber this evening. I hope this will be reflected in the voting tomorrow. It is very important indeed for us to make sure that the countries spend this money, to allow the private sector to get its act together because, at the end of 2006, with enlargement, we, the existing fifteen countries, will lose the ability to have structural funding. The other five or ten countries coming into the European Union will demand structural funding for their countries. We will have a very rapid cut-off. It may well be that we do not even allow any overlapping into the year 2007-2008 on the spend if it gets further behind. I therefore urge every single government throughout the European Union to use this money, use it effectively and use it quickly. I thoroughly endorse the Chairman's guidance to us, as team captains so to speak, to make sure that we vote conclusively together tomorrow to withhold the necessary money and urge those countries to spend it properly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Member States do not just want their money back, they are actually owed it under the Treaty, and the Commission has accordingly submitted the Supplementary and Amending Budget. The money from the Member States' contributions to the European Budget that we have not used over the past year should, in accordance with the legislation, be given back by us to the Member States as quickly as possible on economic grounds alone, as anything else would result in economic losses.</p>
<p class="contents">We had a very large surplus last year, and I will be coming back in this speech to its various elements. The Supplementary and Amending Budget also comprises several elements, namely, firstly, the surplus from last year and secondly the implementation of the new own resources decision, which has various constituent parts. The new own resources decision, as agreed in Berlin, was meant to enter into force with effect from 1 January 2002, but, as several Member States were late in ratifying it, the 2000 Budget still had to be based on the old own resources decision. What this means in real terms is that some of the present Member States had to pay higher contributions than they would have to under the new own resources decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The new own resources decision has various elements to it: 25% of customs receipts can remain with the Member States, and the share from VAT receipts is reduced, while that in terms of GNP is increased, thus resulting in the financial burden being shifted. There is also the third element: four Member States get, so to speak, a rebate on the rebate paid to the United Kingdom, that is, one rebate on another.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what has been decided, and is now to be put into practice, the Commission having for that reason linked it with the surplus. Member States will be enabled to keep 25% of customs receipts with effect from 1 January 2001. The money that would have been required for this has of course been set off against the surplus, as it would otherwise have had to be returned and then collected back again.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruption: Very good!)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It gives me great pleasure to hear that, Mr Walter!</p>
<p class="contents">I would now, though, like to briefly say something about how a surplus of these dimensions came about. It is the case, as has been said here already, that the surplus or under-utilisation in the area of the Structural Funds is around the order of EUR 10 billion. I must again point out that, at this stage of the new programme, it is no longer a case of the Commission being too slow in authorising projects; rather, we now have the stipulation that the Commission makes repayments to the Member States when these submit an invoice for a programme that has been implemented. If there are no invoices, then nothing can be paid out. In 2000, we still had the option of making advance payments, as provided for by the relevant regulation. In 2001, that was no longer possible, and the question does indeed arise as to why the Member States' estimates last year of the resources they required to implement the programmes were far in excess of the sums subsequently called for.</p>
<p class="contents">Still in connection with the surplus, there are two other things I would like to mention. Firstly, in the agricultural policy area, there were actually savings of the order of EUR 2 billion, mainly because the weakness that affected the market for cattle following the BSE crisis turned out not to last for as long as had at first been surmised, and the market recovered more quickly. Other market areas were in a better position than prior estimates had suggested. We are talking here about real savings in which we can take pleasure. Secondly, in foreign policy, that is, in category 4, almost 90% of the resources available were drawn on. In the second year, we achieved an improvement on the former position, and I believe that it has to be clearly underlined that the administrative reforms introduced by my fellow-Commissioners Chris Patten and Poul Nielson in the field of foreign policy are now bearing real fruit. The charge that the EU makes great promises but never really gets anything done will not stick any more.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States are of course waiting for last year's high surplus to be returned to their budgets. It is of such dimensions that it is now of real economic relevance to the budgets of the Member States. When you consider that the economic slowdown that we have had since 11 September has of course had its effects on the Member States' budgets, it is absolutely clear that they are awaiting the repayment from the European Budget precisely in order to avoid greater deficits. The Commission takes the view that it would be sensible in terms of overall economic responsibility to avoid delays. Let me now summarise Mr Walter's and Mr Wynn's contributions: We have not given back any Easter eggs, and a glance at the timetable indicates that there will not be any bouquets for Whitsun either, but I will gladly accede to the request of the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets not to let them turn into Christmas presents! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
