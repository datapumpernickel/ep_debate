We have designed a coherent strategy maximising the use of all our instruments to promote respect for democracy, the rule of law and human rights in a region that poses formidable challenges in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication proposes to use our essential elements clause much better through our political dialogue with partner countries. It explains how further to involve civil society. Crucially, it invites our Mediterranean partners to develop nationally owned human rights strategies. This is an innovation. It is not the only one. Countries which progress well will be rewarded with additional MEDA funds. This is in addition to the MEDA projects already under way to help reform the judiciary and promote good governance – currently funded to the tune of EUR 100 million.</p>
<p class="contents">It is easy simply to dismiss the chance of success of these projects. Yet, as we all know, the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection of human rights and the rule of law rests with governments. Any strategy that ignores this fact is doomed to failure. That is also why the Sana’a conference – which I know the honourable Member attended – was such a breakthrough, and one on which we must build. I am pleased that the Director-General of my own department, Mr Landaburu, was also able to attend that extremely important and significant conference.</p>
<p class="contents">No real progress will be achieved without a freely functioning, vibrant civil society. This is where the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights comes into play. EUR 25 million have been allocated to this region for the period 2002-2004. In addition, a substantial proportion of the extra EUR 17.5 million, which this House voted to the European Initiative at the end of last year, will be used to reinforce support to grass roots organisations working to defend human rights and democratisation in this part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication has already produced encouraging results, in Morocco and Jordan in particular. It was warmly welcomed by the Council. Key partners in civil society have also recognised its value. The full support of the European Parliament will be crucial to the success of this, which is, I repeat, a ground-breaking approach, in one of the most difficult regions of the world with respect to human rights and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament's resolution also takes up aspects of the management of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights and Parliament’s role in the shaping of the initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would like to recall that we have come a very long way since 1994. That was the budget year in which, for the first time, nine separate budget lines were linked up under one heading. Five years later in 1999, implementation of these budget lines was put on a firm legal basis with two regulations, one for developing countries and one for ‘other countries’ – Wider Europe, MEDA, the Balkans and others. These basic facts define the objectives of the European Initiative, shape its instruments, and set up the administrative procedures. The European Parliament was fully involved in the making of these regulations. I trust that Parliament will support the extension of the Initiative beyond 2004, in line with its current legislative framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has always kept Parliament fully informed of our thinking. Our communication of May 2001 on the European Union’s role in promoting human rights and democratisation in third countries, which proposed a more strategic approach for the Initiative, was welcomed and fully supported by the European Parliament. In the same vein, since 2002, the Commission has kept Parliament informed about the multi-annual programming of the Initiative, and its annual updates, and sought appropriate discussion with Parliament on our priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Members are fully aware of the procedural constraints under which the Commission operates, which are contained in the human rights regulations, the financial regulation, comitology and so on. It is not in the Commission’s power to change these rules. But I am fully committed, and my services are ready, to continue the fruitful dialogue we have had so far on all issues concerning human rights and democratisation, including the strategy and objectives of our assistance to third countries. On this basis, I would call on Parliament to give full support to a speedy extension of the regulations before this Parliament is dissolved in order to have a stable framework in place for the next Parliament and Commission to build upon.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just make two additional comments. The work we are doing in the field of democratisation and human rights in the wider Middle East is crucial not only to the sustainable economic and political development of countries in that region, but also to the relationship between Europe and the Islamic world, particularly those parts of the Islamic world which are closer to our own geographical borders. This is an area in which we have been working in general terms for some time. I recently read the statements by a very distinguished American public official about what was required in order to develop a more stable, secure and plural region in the Middle East. I read those comments with interest and wished I had been able to say immediately to him that they are very good ideas – we call them the Barcelona Process and we have been working on them since the mid-1990s.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to recognise that this is not simply a bright idea for a Monday morning to be forgotten by the end of the week. This is a long-term process and we have to commit ourselves to it, I hope with more vigour and occasional tough-mindedness. We have to recognise that there must be linkages between financial support and behaviour on the ground. We also have to recognise that we are working with the grain of societies and with the grain of people's aspirations.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is quite simply that a number of honourable Members in this Chamber speak with very considerable authority on this subject. I am thinking of the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, of the honourable Member who was once speaking from this bench and also of my honourable friend who will, I hope, catch your eye later in the debate, Mr President. They have played a key role in developing the European Union's policies on democracy and human rights. It stands to reason that we should listen very carefully to their views on the institutional arrangements that we need to put in place and on how we can sharpen up our performance and ensure that what we do is better focused and more effective throughout the region. I just want to underline that, as far as I am concerned, speaking for the Commission, we are open-minded about the ideas that Members of Parliament will put to us and simply want to ensure that what we do is as effective as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Two admirable reports by the UNDP have underlined the significance of this work and I, for one, want to ensure that we in Europe rise to the challenge of those reports and do not simply regard them as containing a few good ideas that can be brought out and dusted down from time to time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it is an important step, and can also provide an integrated approach to various policies. As the Commissioner has said, this is about the integration of the Barcelona process with the ‘Wider Europe’ strategy and the issues related to the funding of MEDA and other programmes. These, I believe, must also include human rights and democracy, for lasting peace can come into being only if the state, civil society, the political forces and parties guarantee, in the long term, deep roots for democracy and the rule of law, which always provides the greatest certainty of peaceful development.</p>
<p class="contents">This is of enormous significance for us, not only because of human rights, which should be guaranteed by other means, but also because stabilising regions like this on the basis of democracy and the rule of law is the best security policy we can pursue in our own interests; we should indeed ensure that stability prevails there in such a way that people have a future and do not fall prey to fundamentalism, as they would otherwise be justified in doing. This is what underlies many political problems in countries in the Middle East, making it more difficult to lead them towards a better future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is specifically in matters such as these, Commissioner, that I see it as important that non-governmental organisations should be brought on board, but please allow me to comment on what you have just said in your conclusion. It strikes me as important that – as was previously the case in Central and Eastern Europe – such democracy programmes should increasingly draw on the experience of the European Parliament and of its MEPs, not only by consulting them, but also by involving them in the decision-making process. Whilst I am not defending a breach of the separation of powers, the fact is that we, with our own experience gained from the daily business of building up democracy, parties and<span class="italic"> </span>grassroots democracy, have more knowledge than is to be found in an administrative body, in which people are trained to look at things from a completely different angle, and I do not believe that this is about simply coming up with theoretical concepts that cost a lot of money but produce no results. It is far more about setting up effective structures on the ground. Perhaps we should revert to this former practice; it would be an interesting area in which to experiment and see what progress this enables us to make.</p>
<p class="contents">May I make a final comment? In the past, I believe, both the Commission and Parliament paid insufficient attention to whether or not our resolutions on human rights and democracy were actually implemented. In this respect, monitoring and implementation were our weak points. We came up with some tremendous resolutions, and then that was that. The possibility of checking whether or not anything is done about them seems to me to be acquiring ever-greater importance; it, too, is tied in with the integrative process of which I spoke at the beginning. I believe that many agreements should be linked to the establishment of human rights, and that much funding should be linked to the development of democracy, in order thereby to establish checks and balances that make possible the practical application of democracy and human rights, on which stability depends, and saves them from being merely fine-sounding words. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Almost ten years on from the Barcelona process we note that there is still a serious lack of democracy in these countries, which has also been pointed out in numerous United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reports. Indeed, we must ask ourselves if the policy that we have implemented to date and, above all, the instruments put forward in this area, were adequate given the ambitious objectives of the Barcelona strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 2 of the clause of the bilateral association agreements has turned out to be broadly insufficient. I am, however, asking a more complex question: are bilateral agreements adequate instruments for promoting the development of human rights? I believe that these agreements have helped to give international recognition to regimes that would otherwise have had no legitimacy. We need to be very careful about this, and I believe that the Commission communication poses this question.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the ten points; the Initiative for Democracy that the European Parliament wants is an interesting instrument because it is one of the few instruments which allows measures to be carried out independent of governments. Indeed, all the others fall within the intergovernmental sphere, even if you are right, Commissioner, when you state that we need to remember that part of this dialogue must also involve the ruling classes. Nevertheless, I would like this instrument to be more consistent with the rest of our policies, otherwise there is a risk that it will be a way to legitimise the other policies, which are essentially <span class="italic">realpolitik</span>. This incentive is, therefore, excellent, it is good for countries prepared to go down this road and it is just as excellent regarding the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which could have interesting potential. It is extremely important for the Sana’a Conference, which has brought the issue to the attention of governments and civil society. I ask myself, however, if there should not be a permanent and unequivocal push for democracy from the European institutions, which is also based on new instruments. For example, Commissioner, why not try, with these countries, to have a multilateral convention on human rights, which is also based on institutions that are able to guarantee these rights? Compared to the current situation, this would give rise to a different dynamic.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I tabled an amendment to Article 11, because I think that farming out this policy to an external agency somewhat contradicts the debate that we have had up until now, since it should be the European institutions that have the power to implement this policy. Therefore, as regards financial procedures, should the Commission not have instruments that are adapted to implementing these objectives? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Autocratic regimes can only maintain their hold on power by means of repression and by restricting freedom. The worst hit are the people who are badly governed and lag behind economically and socially. This forms a breeding ground for radicalism on the part of disaffected people that impacts on not only the region itself, but also the rest of the world. The European Union must do everything in its power to exert a positive influence on the situation, therefore. The partnerships provide a good framework for this; one, however, of which we have up to now made insufficient, and insufficiently binding, use. Financial aid alone, without political conditions, will only lead to a deterioration in the situation, and for that reason I welcome this spur to the reinvigoration of policy wholeheartedly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication, with its ten priorities, is truly excellent. Many of the proposed actions are in line with the specific suggestions I made in my report on human rights last year. The intentions and approach are good, but, of course, results are by no means guaranteed. We are ultimately aiming to induce the regimes to make fundamental changes in their behaviour that they would not have been inclined to make of their own accord. The new actions must not lead to bureaucratisation, but rather to specific objectives that are tested systematically. It is very important to give the situation a positive boost.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commissioner tell us how our partners have reacted up to now, apart from Morocco and Jordan, which he has already mentioned? Can he also explain how the EU’s approach relates to the policy of the United States with regard to the region? To what extent is there transatlantic coordination? The proposed spur to action comes not a moment too soon. Further deterioration in the region could have far-reaching consequences. Many regimes say that security is more important than democracy. This contradiction could hardly be more mistaken. It is precisely a lack of democracy that makes the situation hopeless and dangerous. Anyone striving for security and prosperity must first safeguard democracy and human rights. I should like to hear answers from the Commissioner to my questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I heard you welcome the efforts of the Moroccan authorities. For my part, I have just read the very recent report of the IFRM which was presented yesterday and which demonstrates the extent to which 11 September has had devastating effects in these countries, taking the form of many arbitrary imprisonments all over the place, which clearly represent a genuine violation of respect for human rights. So while we welcome the very interesting and noteworthy progress made in relation to the family code, certain extremely worrying elements nevertheless remain. I say this to demonstrate that the very considerable efforts agreed by the Commission and by this Parliament – which you stress yourselves – to reinforce all the mechanisms for action and assessment concerning respect for human rights are determined not only by the international context, but also by the relations that the EU’s Member States individually maintain with these different countries.</p>
<p class="contents">How many programmes will we need in order to cancel out the disastrous effect of President Chirac’s visit to Tunisia, where he stated that there were no human rights problems, and, in the middle of a hunger strike by an eminent lawyer, that the main right is the right to eat? How many programmes will we need in order to remedy that?</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware that, in the evaluation of the association agreements, the constraints of the <span class="italic">realpolitik</span> on the part of the States are terrifying. We truly need to consolidate the Community efforts resulting from the support of the associations, of the NGOs, of civil society and, as we know, of the Members of this Parliament and the Commission. So there are actors who can perhaps overcome that handicap.</p>
<p class="contents">But I would like to ask you directly, Commissioner, about any responsibility you may have in this regard. In Tunisia, how can we explain that, while the Ben Ali government is in the process of holding back the funds allocated to the Tunisian Human Rights League, the Commission is initiating a clearly nonsensical programme aimed at providing support for media that do not exist, which are shackled, entirely in the hands of Ben Ali? Everybody knows that Ben Ali is going to use this not inconsiderable sum to fund his presidential propaganda. Do you realise that or do you not? How is such a thing possible? That is something I really wonder about, as it is precisely on us that such a decision depends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much remains to be done, however. The situation in that region remains volatile. Indeed, aid must not be misused for further tolerating conditions or for keeping regimes in power that have been violating human rights for years. We, the European Union, must not perpetuate any taboos. Major obstacles to the achievement of our objectives include the further rise of Islam on the one hand, and the continuing immigration problem on the other. We must make it clear that further waves of immigration are in the interests of neither Maghreb countries nor Europe. Those countries certainly do not stand to gain from the brain drain or other such phenomena. Besides, further immigration hinders the integration of the immigrants already present in Europe. We must continue to make an issue of this. It is a matter of continuing our efforts to bring about greater democracy and stability in these countries, both in their interests and in ours, including in the context of the policy of good neighbourly relations that is now in the pipeline. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thank the Commissioner, whose work as Governor of Hong Kong ensured the continuation of the democratic life of that territory, which I hope will spark changes in the wider China.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my pleasure to be rapporteur on the communication 'Reinvigorating EU actions on human rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partners'. We welcome the communication and its ten points for action. We note that it was published in 2003. Since that time, the MEDA process has taken on a new lease of life, with the agreements in December to establish the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum. In December also, the Council, while failing to agree on the European Constitution, did at least agree that the paper presented by the Commissioner and by the High Representative entitled 'Strengthening the EU's relations with the Arab world' would be adopted in March. We welcome that.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also rapporteur on the two regulations dealing with the continuation of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights in 2005 and 2006. While endorsing the communication on 'Reinvigorating EU actions on human rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partners', we are also examining these two regulations. Parliament will vote today on whether to have a say in the priorities and running of this programme, the European democracy initiative, because the resolution put forward by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy today points out that this fund, which uniquely requires no host country consent, should be more focused, especially on what I describe as the 'arc of instability' from Russia to Morocco, where democracy is fragile, or on the Arab world, where it is non-existent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner's references to the UNDP report underline the importance attached to it by the Commission, but unfortunately the Commission needs to put its money where its mouth is. We need to examine very closely the way in which the European Union is funding programmes in this region. For example, he mentioned a figure of EUR 100 million for good governance in the MEDA region. In fact, in the wider Mediterranean, my understanding is that EUR 500 million a year is available for good governance. But of this, only EUR 7 million is currently budgeted through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights. Reference has been made in this House this morning to forthcoming elections in Algeria and Tunisia, where very little money is getting through to the NGOs and activists who are looking for a free media and the development of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately – I have had some experience as the originator of this democracy programme – it is now rather bureaucratic and errs on the side of safety. The only way of dealing with this is to try and adapt it to the realities of the present situation. An unstable world to our east and south demands special actions. Having had experience of working in this field in the 1990s with the ex-Soviet Union, through an external agency which had an agility and freedom to manoeuvre not enjoyed by the Commission and the deniability not available to the Council, I can say that, with the advantage of Parliament's involvement, we have a much more effective programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Commissioner's assertion that he will be open-minded about further suggestions we might make as a Parliament. I intend to bring these forward, especially since I understand this morning that the Council has decided to withdraw the regulations as presented and to present them in a new format, thereby delaying yet further the adoption of the regulations. This debate will continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are convinced that the enormous challenge of developing these neighbouring regions can only be possible, in terms of European responsibilities, if we combine responsibility and management. In other words, through the sound implementation of association agreements with strong political and cultural impetus, in a context in which the norm is increasingly represented by voices and images of poverty, fanaticism and terrorism rather than by the aims of genuinely moving towards freedom, social cohesion and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore support this initiative and we advocate that in terms of the European Union’s general policy, as far as human rights are concerned, we should not resort to closing our eyes, on the one hand, for the sake of a false <span class="italic">realpolitik</span>, nor, on the other hand, be content with mere condemnations or protests. We must be ‘consequentialist’ in our policies towards the countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean. In other words, our priority must always be to consider the consequences of our policies in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner has said quite rightly, there is a strategy which will soon be ten years old – that of the Barcelona process – and all we have to do is remember that, since Barcelona is an Olympic city, the entrance to the Commission's offices should display the motto '<span class="italic">Citius, altius, fortius</span>' for the development of our Euro-Mediterranean policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The capital of the Catalan nation was indeed worthy of being the place where a policy aimed at building bridges across the Mediterranean was launched. I must mention here in passing the memory of two illustrious Catalans who anticipated this policy each in their own way in the Middle Ages: Raymond Lull and Anselme Turmeda. I welcome the intelligent and understanding effort implemented by this policy, and in particular in the documents which are the subject of our debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, given the general situation, I wonder about this policy’s chances. In order to fly the flag for democracy and human rights, we must be exemplary. We are far from it. As recently as yesterday, lawyers in this lovely city of Strasbourg publicly placed a funeral wreath in front of the prefecture mourning the death of the presumption of innocence as a result of a law which has just been voted on in France. A year ago, a Spanish judge ordered the closure of <span class="italic">Egunkaria</span>, the only daily newspaper in the Basque language, and imprisoned several journalists – some are still in prison. To this day, one year later, no contradictory debate has been organised to justify this blatant violation of press freedom. The criminal war waged by the United States against Iraq was subject to the active or passive complicity of the majority of Member States of the enlarged Union. This horrific wound is still bleeding, and it will do so for a long time. For many Muslims in the world it is an additional humiliation.</p>
<p class="contents">This list is unfortunately far from exhaustive. If we are not careful, the obsession with security and the hijacking of the war against terror for partisan ends will undermine this policy, and many others, despite all the intelligence and good will of those who will try to implement it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The signals we are receiving are weak, perhaps superficial, perhaps devised with the ulterior motive of doing nothing at all, but what is not in doubt is that, in the last two years, signals have been sent, which we would do well to pick up on and pursue.<span class="italic"> </span>I say this because I have the impression that there is very little awareness of this in our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Flautre who spoke before me has, for example, already highlighted the Tunisian issue, with a series of extremely conflicting positions, and perhaps it is not a coincidence that it was two representatives from Tunisian civil society that were prevented from taking part in the afore-mentioned Sana’a Conference: this is the only thing that I was able to notice in the organisation of this conference.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we must stop being excessively prudent because our actions must have credibility. We lose credibility, for example, when we do not enforce the clauses of Article 2: we are not credible in the eyes of governments – who, in fact, consider us to be relatively malleable partners – nor are we in the eyes of non-governmental actors, whose trust we are losing. I say this because, for example, we are drawing closer to the meeting for the ratification of the Lebanon Agreement and I believe, Commissioner, that it is important to note, in this House, the lack of progress on the independence of Lebanon’s judiciary and the fact that relations with the European Union should be subject to this requirement being met.</p>
<p class="contents">Aside from individual references to specific positions, I believe that action by the European Commission or Europe in general is important: there is much demand for Europe – perhaps in comparison with the alternative – and great things are expected of it.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of Sana’a has been stressed here. Why is it important, Commissioner? Well, it is important because of the format of the Conference: governments and non-governmental actors have for the first time found themselves on an equal footing in discussing and wrangling, but also in creating a final statement that, in my opinion, creates the requirements for a consultation process, which perhaps our US friends are less prone to emphasise and less inclined towards. I believe that it would be an important signal, Commissioner, in the context of our discussion, to ensure that Sana’a is followed up, in such a way that it does not remain just one of many such events but becomes a process that is monitored. The involvement of women has also been extraordinary and exceptional vitality came from women’s organisations, which really must be given assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have something to work on, Commissioner, that has arisen from the consultation we held with our partners and from the texts they have produced, a course of action that cannot be said to be handed down from above, because it has been requested by the partners themselves. I believe that this merits a very solid follow-up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps this type of debate or, rather, series of monologues that we have in the European Parliament could be a touch more lively. As one of the last speakers, I hope that the Commissioner will nonetheless manage to listen to one more speaker.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish, in fact, to refer to two things mentioned by the Commissioner for External Relations in his speech. The first thing he emphasised was that we must improve relations between Europe and the Islamic world. We must develop more stable, more secure and more pluralistic countries in the Middle East and around the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing the Commissioner said concerned the links between our financial support and behaviour at what he called grass roots level, that is to say how matters appear out in the cities, towns and villages when it comes to observing human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to talk about a subject that is almost taboo from a political point of view. It concerns the interplay between religion and politics. As the Commissioner said, our relations with the Islamic world are an extremely sensitive area, both internally in the European Union and in our various Member States. I mean that religion and freedom of religion are of fundamental significance for the development of human rights and, ultimately, of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Religion must not, of course, take over the political system, but nor can religious life be kept completely separate from the rest of society. I believe that the types of solutions that exist in certain countries, for example in Iran where an Islamicist Council of Guardians says who may stand in elections and who may not, is completely unreasonable. Nor am I convinced that the French or Turkish solution, in which religious symbols are to be banned in schools, is the right one.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish, therefore, to refer to what Commissioner Patten has said about our relations with the Islamic world and about Mr van den Bos’s report on human rights, adopted by Parliament in July 2003. A number of amendments were approved, emphasising every person’s right to seek their own faith, the right to change religion and the right not to belong to any religion.</p>
<p class="contents">The value of being free to conduct missionary work, irrespective of whether the country concerned is predominantly Christian, Muslim or Jewish, was also emphasised. The fundamental principles are that of the equal value of human beings, irrespective of religion, gender or ethnicity, the principle of non-discrimination and the principle whereby religion stands for non-violence, love and reconciliation. The equal value of human beings, irrespective of their religious affiliation, is emphasised. I believe that the conversation about the significance of religion for the good society and for combating the misuse of religion itself to issue threats, perpetrate violence and oppression and justify terrorism and discrimination against people is an important and fundamental part of our relations with the Islamic Mediterranean countries. Let the dialogue about religion and the good use of religion in the proper sense of the word be an important part of our relations with countries around the Mediterranean. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As a general principle, it has become our prime concern to demand the same respect and the same application from all our partners, without wrongful interpretation, differentiation or a selective approach. In addition to this, our insistence on control of the application and operation of the principles of democracy, human rights, the rights of national minorities and sexual equality are uniform and undivided for everyone, everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The linking of European financial aid with compliance with absolute respect for the above rights is also uniform for everyone, everywhere. This truth is repeated and emphasised in the relevant motion by the European Parliament to our Mediterranean partners, in order to avoid misunderstandings or different interpretations. Good accounts make good friends.</p>
<p class="contents">Deepening political dialogue on issues of democracy and respect for human rights at all levels certainly helps to consolidate our bilateral relations and transactions and to further deepen them.</p>
<p class="contents">The exchange of information, knowledge and experience by all the partners, as the motion comments, helps to further serve the desired approach on the basis of principles and rules which are common to and respected by everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's contacts with civil society and the reports on its findings to all the partners are a simple, straightforward tool for evaluating the present situation, to be praised, or an intervention to be corrected.</p>
<p class="contents">With the recent excellent upgrading of the Mediterranean Forum to Parliamentary Assembly, a huge step has been taken towards democratic dialogue and creative consultation and understanding between the partners on both sides of the Mediterranean. This political dialogue will help enormously to resolve possible problems or misunderstandings and to support the procedure of rapprochement and cooperation, which will serve stability and the peaceful development and coexistence of the entire Mediterranean area.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that those developments in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, which are still obstructing an unimpeded approach, come to an end as quickly as possible, without walls and divisions, for the good of the entire area and its inhabitants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is particularly positive that the Commission recognises that the marginalisation of women undermines political representation and obstructs economic and social development in the area. It is true that women in Mediterranean and Arab countries, despite a certain improvement in conditions over recent years, continue to be the victims of sexual discrimination and inequality. Illiteracy, poverty, domestic violence, inadequate medical and pharmaceutical care, little participation in professional and political life, these are the main features of the life of women on the southern shores of the Mediterranean basin and in the countries of the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Worst of all, however, is that women are the main victims of religious and political fundamentalism, ultra-conservatism and autocratic regimes which base their power to a large degree on controlling the sexual conduct of women, their way of life, their reproductive functions and even the way they dress. Certainly, the best defence against the powers of retrogression and intolerance is to strengthen the secular aspect of the state and the legal democratic order.</p>
<p class="contents">Our message must be clear. No political system, religious movement, tradition or custom can take precedence over respect for the fundamental freedoms of women, human rights and the rule of law. The more these basic elements of a democratic state are missing from numerous countries of the Mediterranean, the more the hopes for economic and social development and an improvement in the position of women will remain dim and the resolutions passed by the conferences held within the framework of the Barcelona process will remain dead letter.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are asking the European Commission and the representation of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly to use all the mechanisms at its disposal in order to include clear clauses and commitments on the recognition and protection of human rights and the rights of women and the principles of the rule of law as <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>for the development of the countries of the Mediterranean and the elevation of the Mediterranean basin to an area of peace and cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I should like to respond to one or two questions from what has been an important and useful debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I was asked how our proposals had been received by our partners. The fairest diplomatic answer is that the ideas have been received rather cautiously in some countries but much more positively in others – Jordan and Morocco spring to mind. Whatever the response, the ideas that we have put forward are now a central part of the debate, a central part of the dialogue with these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to remember that what we are talking about is not negative conditionality, but positive encouragement. We are talking about setting aside part of our MEDA funds each year and allocating them to those countries which enter into specific partnerships with us to develop democracy and human rights. That is an important shift of emphasis and an important way of trying to use our development assistance and cooperation to promote political objectives which we all know are crucial, not only to the stability and wellbeing of societies, but also to their long-term economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">In pressing our views on issues such as human rights in Tunisia – to which the honourable Member rightly referred – we have to be vigorous and avoid being counterproductive. A couple of weeks ago in another part of the world – when pressing the case for the rule of law and civil liberty – I was accused of being neo-colonial. I had to point out that as far as I was concerned that was a terrible insult: I had been the real thing; I had been a real colonial oppressor and not simply a neo-colonial has-been.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We have to be careful about how we proceed with the debate. It is also important to recognise that it is a long process and that, as Mrs Bonino said, we need to be consistent. We need to show that we mean what we say. We have to be mindful of our credibility and we have to make sure that this is a debate we conduct on the basis of mutual esteem, on the basis that we are on an equal footing.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also asked how our arguments and ideas tied in with those of the United States on democracy and the wider Middle East. It is fair to say that this is a subject about which we have a decade of experience. We welcome the United States' interest. I am sure there will be a lot of discussions, as there were last weekend at the Munich security conference.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we do not lose the distinctiveness of our own approach. I hope that we do not lose sight of the fact that this is a long-term process and I hope that, as the honourable Member said late in the debate, that we do not lose sight of the relevance of the Middle East dispute, of the relationship between Israel and Palestine, to the discussion about democracy in the wider region, because at the moment undoubtedly some in the Arab world doubt our credentials and goodwill because they do not think we are doing enough to resolve the problems of Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly I would like to repeat again to Mr McMillan-Scott that we go into these debates with an open mind. We recognise the experience and the wisdom of Parliament and we are sure that together Parliament, Commission and Council will be able to frame a policy which will not only continue to command the attention of the whole House, but will actually lead to the sort of beneficial consequences that we wish to see.</p>

The committee voted by 11 votes to 8 to suppress a scientific report on inedibles, in respect of which the European Academy of Sciences' advisory committee stated: 'This report is, overall, a reasonable, impartial and balanced piece of work on a very difficult topic.' The peer review would lead me to conclude that it should definitely be published.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the general public realise that this decision was made on the basis of grave political errors, rather than believing that the committee has become a majority-owned property of European chocolate manufacturers.</p>
