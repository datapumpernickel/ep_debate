<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jové Peres (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES) </span>Mr President, it is now two years since the COM in olive oil was last reviewed.</p>
<p class="contents">Hoping to receive more and better information on the actual situation in the sector, the Commission has postponed the final review for two years. It has presented a proposal with a bearing on quality aspects and market actions. Although the proposal’s aim is commendable, it does have a number of shortcomings concerning three issues: the market situation, checks, and the marketing of blended oil.</p>
<p class="contents">Public intervention purchases were done away with in the 1998 reform, against Parliament’s wishes. This decision was taken even though their average cost was the lowest in existence. As a result, market prices have fallen dramatically and the producers’ income has dropped.</p>
<p class="contents">This matter is not part of the Commission’s proposal, but that does not justify turning a blind eye to the consequences of the last revision. In its replies to the Court of Auditors, the Commission stated that it would make provision for closer checks in this revision. It has to be said that in general, it has failed to do so. The report therefore formulates proposals to improve the efficiency of controls by increasing the frequency with which oil mills are to submit information and introducing similar conditions for aid to pomace oil.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has been speaking out about the problems ensuing from marketing blends of olive oil and other fats since 1996. We have called for similar protection to that in place for milk and butter, for example. Unfortunately, no regulations have been adopted in response to these requests. On this occasion, the proposal’s shortcoming is all the more conspicuous since the Commission’s proposal focuses on quality strategy. The European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture therefore proposes a ban on marketing blends of olive oil and other fats, in line with measures already in place in most of the producer countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the content of the proposal, the designations proposed by the Commission have been somewhat modified. In addition, the report proposes a number of measures concerning labelling. The most significant of these is aimed at preventing the designation ‘olive oil’ being used as an advertising slogan, thus confusing the consumers. In cases where olive oil was not the only fat contained in a food product, the use of the denomination ‘olive oil’ would therefore be restricted to the quantitative description of ingredients.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as labelling is concerned, the inclusion of two other details is proposed: the origin of the oil, namely the place where the olives were grown, and in the case of ordinary oil, a requirement to state that it is produced from refined and virgin oils.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust the Commission will respond more positively to these points than it has in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">On 25 October last, for instance, the Commission rejected some thirty of our amendments to the proposal for the COM in fruit and vegetables on the grounds that they would be included in a later report. That report has now been published, but the substance of our amendments was not included.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, our document includes a number of amendments aimed at making the Commission’s proposal more flexible and precise. The Commission intends it to be implemented in two years’ time, through the collaboration of what it terms the ‘organisations of economic agents’. Since the actions planned are to be financed partly from a deduction withheld from aid to production, it follows that producers will be involved in the administration. Some clearly defined entities already exist, such as producers’ organisations, their associations and interbranch bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the circumstances, a two-year period for the introduction of the proposed actions should not be necessary. A clear list of actions which may not be included should also be drafted, to provide legal certainty and speed up and facilitate the preparation of programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, special thanks are due above all to the members of the Committee on Agriculture. Their amendments have enriched the report considerably, bringing it into line with the requirements of producers and consumers in all the states involved. This was evident at the meeting organised by the Italian Ministry of Agriculture in Verona as recently as last April. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My first thanks go to the Commission, which spared no effort during the drafting of this report to make themselves available, to answer the questions put to them and to explain their decisions. I also wish to thank our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the draftsman of the opinion on this report, Vincenzo Lavarra and the rapporteur on the olive oil sector, Mr Jové Peres. My sincere thanks go to them for their contributions and for the way in which they cooperated so willingly with me. I wish to make very special mention of the excellent study on the environmental impact of the common organisation of the market in olive oil, produced for the Commission’s Directorate-General for the Environment by accredited institutions for agro-environmental analysis, from which I shall quote frequently in this speech.</p>
<p class="contents">The COM in olive oil is based on aid for production. In other words, it encourages higher productivity as a means of increasing farmers’ incomes. The average production of an olive grove varies between 200 kg and 500 kg per hectare per year for traditional olive groves in poorer areas and between around 8 and 10 tonnes per hectare per year in the more intensively cultivated groves with the best soil. Since it is possible, then, to increase the productivity of olive groves by 10 or even 20 times, a policy geared towards increasing the quantity produced has inevitably led to traditional olive groves and the most difficult land to cultivate being abandoned and has led to the intensification of production on more fertile land. </p>
<p class="contents">Traditional plantations have a low density of trees, which are generally old – trees that are centuries old are common – also contain arable crops or grazing land for sheep or goats, are frequently planted in terraces and are very labour intensive. The value of olive trees for heritage and for the landscape in terms of protecting land from floods and landslides or in terms of increasing biodiversity is incalculable. The study to which I just referred counted 120 plant species, 70 species of vertebrates and 160 species of invertebrates in traditional olive groves in the province of Cordoba in Andalusia. Ancient olive groves and trees play a particularly important role in preserving many species of birds. The value of subsidies for production is too low in this area and traditional olive groves are being abandoned throughout the Mediterranean, with the inevitable damaging consequences for the environment and for rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">Modern intensive plantations have a high density of low-yield trees, which are chopped down after a few years. These plantations use copious amounts of water for irrigation, up to 350 kg of fertiliser per hectare and pesticides and herbicides to clear the soil of vegetation. These plantations do not use terraces, which often creates slopes of more than 12%. It is estimated that modern olive groves in Andalusia have caused erosion of 80 tonnes per hectare, whereas more than 50 tonnes of erosion per hectare is considered to be an extremely serious level.</p>
<p class="contents">The around 1 million new intensive plantations in Andalusia are therefore causing erosion at a rate of 80 million tonnes of soil per year, making this one of the main factors for desertification in the southern Iberian Peninsula. Although fewer studies have been made of the problem in these areas, it also affects huge swathes of the Peloponnese, Crete, the Aegean islands and Tuscany. In areas such as Liguria and in many parts of Portugal, erosion is caused more by traditional olive groves being abandoned than by the establishment of modern groves.</p>
<p class="contents">The current system of production-related aid is not only stimulating the human and environmental desertification of the southern part of our continent, but is also making the work of those who adulterate olive oil easier, enabling them to cheat the Community budget, cheat consumers of their right to buy a natural, high-quality product, and cheat the farmers. The level of fraud and irregularities uncovered by this Court of Auditors report on the olive oil sector is far too high. It is true that there is every indication that the only reason for more fraud being discovered in olive oil than in milk is that there are tighter controls, not because there is any greater propensity to commit fraud in that sector. The European institutions must make the fight against the adulteration of food in areas such as meat, milk, wine and olive oil absolute political priorities, which will inevitably mean overhauling the way in which the CAP operates. Preserving and improving the environment and farmers’ incomes is the prime objective of the agricultural chapter of the Treaty. Our current approach, however, is proving of greater benefit to the agro-industrial conglomerates than to agriculture. It is causing the desertification of the poorest rural areas, is having a damaging effect on the environment and makes the sale of bogus products easier. We therefore need to abandon the old COM system of providing incentives for productivity and to create a new CAP that focuses on protecting farmers’ incomes, the rural world, quality and the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should also like to thank the European Commission for its report on quality strategy for olive oil and for the draft regulation. Both these documents are sound in principle. Nonetheless, the proposal in question has been much improved by Parliament’s report. Allow me to highlight a number of areas where this is the case. Regarding checks, we fully agree that they should basically be undertaken at the level of the oil mills. This is a far more efficient method of monitoring. The geographical oil information system should become complementary to it. Secondly, as far as mixtures of olive oil and other fats are concerned, we advocate a total ban on marketing. In so doing, we are responding to requests made by the producer countries. The consumer can easily be misled by such mixtures, and olive oil’s reputation will be adversely affected. It should be noted that this in no way restricts consumer choice, as any individual interested in such a mixture can produce it for personal consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, following revision of the COM in 1998 and the end of intervention aid buying, aid to private storage became the only way of regulating market prices.</p>
<p class="contents">This measure has not been implemented correctly, however. As a result, price levels have been below the limits set by the Council for many months, when such measures had not been authorised. It is therefore very positive that Parliament’s report should call for the automatic opening of private storage. This will allow olive oil prices to be maintained at an appropriate level.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to refer to aid for the production of olive pomace oil. Its purpose is to ensure that the by-products of olive mills are handled in an environmentally-friendly way. We feel that such aid should be calculated with reference to the amount of pomace oil actually produced, and should not be awarded on a lump sum basis as is currently the case. Furthermore, this proposal is certain to have a beneficial impact on quality strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall just take a few minutes to comment on the proposal for a Council regulation on the new COM for olive oil, first thanking Mr Jové Peres for the competence and willingness he has shown, which have led to the considerable understanding of our Committee. The conditions were not right for a thorough reform and so we have chosen to bring forward the introduction of some important rules allowing this sector to face the new challenges posed by the World Trade Organisation, the liberalisation of the markets and the reform of the common agricultural policy. This has been the driving force that has led us to identify specific rules and requests for new aid.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, for us it is important to give the origin of the oil as the place where the olives were harvested and not where it was produced. We have the duty of transparency and of coherence with the principles of traceability: it is a matter of courtesy to the producers and the consumers. I hope the Council will approve our position and issue an order to revise Regulation 2815.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally worthy of consideration are the ban on blending olive oil with other oils or fats and the incentive to the producer organisation to increase market supply capacity, because this is the paradox to overcome: a rising demand for consumption of this precious commodity and a fall in prices.</p>
<p class="contents">With these measures we think the whole sector can be sustained, and I am pleased to finish with a particular comment on the method we have used, that is to say the meeting of Parliament with the whole sector, which has led to these points which I hope we will approve today in this House and which I hope may guide the final decision of the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means there may be a unanimous vote in Parliament tomorrow, and there is hope that a strong proposal may reach the Council, strong because it is expressed by a unanimous Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that in the debate about the reform of the common agricultural policy, which is beginning to be discussed, the conviction is emerging from many parts that in time aid for production will gradually be cut down. Producers are not frightened by this prospect as long as it is possible to sell on the market at a fair price. This objective can be pursued essentially in two ways: either by organising a promotion, information and consumer awareness campaign as well as advertising the product, which is the only way to make quality prevail on the market, or by preventing and discouraging fraud and adulteration. The latter is a problem that cannot be left just to the Member States, but one that the whole Union must face by understanding that it is responsible. The amendments tabled and approved are a step in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Here I shall ask the Commission a formal question. With this resolution we are going to intervene in Regulation 1638/98. There is, however, an amendment which explicitly seeks an undertaking regarding Regulation 2815, the regulation which provides for the possibility of marketing oil without labelling and lays down the origin of the product linked to the place of pressing and not the place of harvesting. Commissioner Fischler gave me and Mr Lavarra an undertaking that at the time of the COM reform this Regulation too would somehow be eliminated or at least modified. The Regulation expires on 31 October 2001. My question is this: what is the Commission going to do? Does it intend to keep faith with this undertaking and also with this approved amendment which will surely be approved by Parliament tomorrow, and thus not renew this Regulation from November 2001 onwards, or change it in line with the wishes of the highest democratic assembly? We ask for an explicit undertaking by the Commission because while we are discussing and legally intervening in Regulation 1638 we do not want the other Regulation to go off in a different direction which does not allow for the possibility of its being legally amended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my opinion, the Commission’s proposal to extend the current aid regime for a further two years is sound. However, I share the sector’s concern at the Commission’s intention to resort entirely to an operational geographical oil information system for future monitoring of this regime.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel this could prove a good monitoring tool, but only a complementary one. We believe it would be more useful and fairer to put in place appropriate checks at the oil mills, not just a geographical information system. Hopefully, such checks would be more effective in preventing fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not agree with the Commission’s proposal where it introduces a new concept, that of economic operators. This concept is quite unclear. Any one of us could set up tomorrow as an economic agents’ organisation and withhold significant funds from those genuinely involved in oil production, namely producers’ or interbranch organisations recognised by the Member States themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">In our judgement, the key element of the strategy to promote quality is a permanent ban on the marketing of blends of olive oil and other fats. This is essential to pursue fraudulent blending with seed oil. The ban must be central to management of the olive oil market, so as to avoid defrauding customers and to establish a clear policy on quality and food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We endorse the general feeling within the Committee on Agriculture concerning the new designations. They result from extensive consultation with the sector, as does the reduction of maximum permitted acidity for extra virgin oil.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, no other crop is so closely linked with the people of the Mediterranean and with their culture. No other crop shaped the landscape over thousands of years, as this one has. We are convinced of the environmental value of olive groves in maintaining biodiversity and stemming the advance of desertification. Those of us who live in the area are especially aware of this.</p>
<p class="contents">In drafting programmes aimed at improving the environmental impact of olive groves, consideration should therefore also be given to recycling material removed when pruning the groves. Both the olive wood and the leaves can be used commercially, thus taking full advantage of all the by-products of cultivation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This extension is to be welcomed, but the Commission has failed to provide a solution on three points that were not resolved in the 1998 reform. These are: the establishment of compensation aid for small producers, as proposed by Parliament; a ban on the sale of olive oil mixed with other fats and labelling that does not mislead the consumer and which only gives the name ‘olive oil’ to products made from olives.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, doing away with mechanisms for public intervention and replacing them with private stockpiling has not managed to prevent a fall in prices and the consequences of this on reducing farmers’ incomes.</p>
<p class="contents">Salvador Jové’s report seeks to resolve some of these fundamental issues, particularly with regard to blends, and I support his ideas on this matter. The report by Paulo Casaca undermines the European Parliament’s resolutions by using an opinion on the report by the Court of Auditors to go ahead with proposals to replace the current system of aid for production with direct aid to farmers, which opens the way to the Commission’s option of per tree premiums.</p>
<p class="contents">We must reject this proposal. Aid per tree would not only have damaging consequences for production and for employment – with the olives not being harvested – but we would also lose a key element for monitoring the production of olive oil and its quality. This would consequently increase opportunities for fraudulent practices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have requested that a Community database be set up for oil and that Regulation 2568/91 be revised, in order to check analytically for the presence of hazelnut oil in the olive oil imported into Italy. Unfortunately the answers have never been reassuring, and sometimes they have been quite alarming. The observations made in the explanatory statement in the Peres report are all true, highlighting once again the demand for a guaranteed income for farmers and respect for the space and special character of the Mediterranean environment, the strong demand to prevent aid per tree by supporting aid based on production, and the valuing of the quality and genuineness of the product to protect the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that Parliament’s position is not yet in tune with the Commission’s, and I hope that at least some fundamental amendments in the Peres report will be approved to clarify the important function of the producer organisations as a useful presence on the market, to value interprofessionalism, to protect the consumer from any abuses by preventing the blending of olive oil with other vegetable oils, to establish the place of production of the olives as the place of origin, and lastly something which particularly concerns the south of Italy and the Puglia region: to add some cultivars to the genetic mark, preventing them from being regarded as defects of organoleptic characteristics whereas instead they are expressions of techniques and special characters that can be found in the production specifications of protected denomination of origin olive oils</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By chance, by a strange stroke of luck, we have the competent Commissioner here today. The financial resources and the aid that the producers expect will become a sort of financial bottleneck which must in no way affect the solidity of any of the above-mentioned dossiers.</p>
<p class="contents">Oil in particular should be safeguarded as a sector because it represents European agricultural values throughout the world. We must work so that quality and safety and also the multiple uses of the product can be the key to the future of Community olive oil production. To achieve this aim it is necessary, however, that in the period before these important dates arrive there should be a review, reappraisal and enhancement of the role of producer associations especially; in fact, the centralisation of the operators is essential for achieving consumer protection based on labelling and traceability. From this viewpoint, the introduction of a clear classification of oils can only result in greater access to the competitive advantages of guaranteed production. In addition, alongside the financial aspects of a sector like that of oil, the Community law on designation of origin must necessarily be revisited.</p>
<p class="contents">The European principle must in fact become that of identifying the origin of the oil with the place where the olives are produced and no longer with the place where they are crushed, as has debatably been the case until now. In this context the blending of olive oil with other vegetable oils, in the absence of labelling that will identify each component in the blend, damages the image of the producer, the consumer and the <span class="italic">Codex Alimentarius</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">It would in fact be deplorable if we were to find ourselves facing not just the existing uncontrolled piracy of digital music but also unfair competition in foodstuffs, playing on false denominations and bogus labels. Adulteration must be repressed, especially in the area of foodstuffs, because what is at stake are the interests of consumer safety and the producers’ right to entrepreneurial freedom. The whole olive oil sector, supported by the political institution at whatever level, should assume the responsibility of carrying out the activities of management and market control through concentration and the marketing of the product, to the benefit of quality, certification, research, promotion and traceability.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mr Peres for the truly excellent results of his work. This evening I take the opportunity – and I shall repeat this in the House tomorrow – to say that we have a problem with the Italian translation: the translation of ‘<span class="italic">brut</span>’, referring to oil, as ‘<span class="italic">greggio</span>’ (crude) is not acceptable in my country and so tomorrow I shall ask for the Italian version to use the term ‘<span class="italic">naturale</span>’ (natural) or ‘<span class="italic">vergine</span>’ (virgin). </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to cite two examples here. First: one of the main objectives of production aid is to give olive farmers a fair income and guarantee market balance. As the Court of Auditors quite rightly states, the objective of production aid in relation to producers' income has never been defined. In other words, no one knows if this objective has ever been achieved, because we have never been able to assess it. The same applies to market balance. In 1998, the Commission established that there are 180 million olive trees. That came as something of a surprise, because Olistat had reckoned with a lot fewer trees, some 140 million. That is a difference of 40 million trees, a discrepancy of about 31%. Just consider, you think you have market balance and then you find out that you have 30% too much stock. The increase in stock over the last two years does, in fact, indicate that there is a surplus.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there were similar weaknesses in the consumption aid abolished at the end of 1998. There was no obligation to keep records or ledgers of accounts payable. As a result, there was a huge amount of fraud and irregularity. EUR 429 million in undue amounts have still not been recovered for the 1985-1998 period. Only 6% has been recovered so far. Just think how financial control and recovery were reorganised in connection with the reform of the Commission. We really do have our work cut out here.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as export refunds are concerned, just 13% of the money has been recovered. Anyone who takes the protection of European taxpayers seriously just wants to get on and reform this agricultural policy. Mr Casaca's report shows us how. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The area which we are discussing is not important just for the regions; it is also a very important area for the European budget. After all, this year's budget includes EUR 2.4 billion for the olive oil sector. In this respect, it is also an extremely important area when it comes to audits by the European Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Casaca has dealt with the special report by the Court of Auditors. Mr Jové Peres has led the debate on the Commission proposal. Strictly speaking, these two areas are totally separate because the special report by the Court of Auditors addresses the measures and aid applied over a three-year transitional period before the Council decision in 1998, whereas the Commission proposal relates to measures to be taken from November 2001 onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">First to Mr Casaca's report. The Commission can accept most of the points in Mr Casaca's motion for a resolution on the Court of Auditors' report. However, I should like to take a more detailed position on two points.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission stated in the middle of last year, during its examination of the Court of Auditor's report, that improving the control system would, of course, be an important issue in the forthcoming reform of the common organisation of the market. Having examined this question closely, it is clear that radical reforms are needed if any decisive improvement is to be made. However, come what may, we need a geographical information system. As the right conditions will not all be in place for this sort of reform in 2001, the Commission suggested at the end of last year that, the decisive importance of the geographical information system notwithstanding, the reform should be postponed for two years. Besides, the Court of Auditors' proposals suggested other ways of making improvements here. After highly constructive talks with the Member States, these improvements were set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 648/2000.</p>
<p class="contents">This motion for a resolution expresses surprise at the fact that the Commission questions the reliability of the International Olive Oil Council's statistics. These doubts should come as no surprise. They were expressed at every Council meeting between 1995 and 1998. The Commission checked the data in question and clarified the details with the Member States on several occasions. The International Olive Oil Council's statistics for 1999 had to be revised for the purpose of standardising the data. This resulted in a 30% reduction in the stock calculated. It was also found that it was best to assume that national statistics had a margin of error of 10-12%.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the following to say about Mr Jové Peres's report: the report on the Commission proposal on the future common organisation of the market in olive oil is divided into two parts, dealing with two different subjects. The first part deals with postponing the decision on the reform in the olive oil sector for two years, until we have more accurate data and a more reliable control system, and the second part deals with the introduction of a new regulation on classifying olive oil and the quality strategy for olive oil.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed amendments relate to four main issues: market measures and final reform, controls of the current regulation, classification and labelling of olive oil and the activities of the organisations of market operators. I should like to comment on all four.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as general market aspects are concerned, the Commission agrees with Amendment No 2 on the need to assess the results of the transitional period. The Commission acknowledges Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 9 but cannot formally accept them because they anticipate the decision on final reform, which the Commission wants to leave open at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot accept Amendments Nos 3, 6 and 26 on automatic private storage arrangements even where the market situation has no need of them. Nor can the Commission endorse Amendments Nos 1 and 46 on aid for actual olive-residue oil production because this would complicate controls still further. Similarly, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 27 extending production refunds to products not in international competition with cheap olive oil.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Amendment No 37, concerning the basic ban on the planting of additional olive groves, the Commission takes the view that conversions and the legal consequences with respect to land use would give rise to huge problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Numerous provisions on control measures have already been issued during the course of the year. The outstanding problems are connected with marketing structures. No decisive progress can be made until we introduce the geographical information system which the Commission has suggested as the basis on which aid should be granted from 2003 onwards. Most of the substance of the amendments proposed here has already been taken into account in the Commission's regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 7, 11 and 14 call for greater involvement of the Commission and additional research.</p>
<p class="contents">But the Commission is already working closely with the Member States on controls without, however, disregarding the fact that they have the final say. Research programmes have already been funded under the general procedure in the areas which you mention.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 8, 10, 22, 23, 24 and 36 relate to improved monitoring of mills, the main concern being to use electronic data transmission. The relevant Commission Regulation (EC) No 2366/98 already provides a legal basis for priority monitoring of mills. As a result, at least 30% of mills must be controlled <span class="italic">in situ</span>. In addition, the mills must send in data on their stock accounts at the end of every month. These data have already been compared with the information available on olive oil production and marketing. The proposal for a computerised system for monitoring on a day-to-day basis is being examined. If it proves to be sensible and practicable, the Commission could issue the corresponding regulation. However, we must bear in mind that, unfortunately, the IT tools for the Member States for which provision has been made are still not fully ready for use.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as classification and labelling are concerned, as addressed in Amendments Nos 16, 18 and 45, together with Amendments Nos 19 and 35, we have taken note of your proposals, especially the call for the place where the olives were grown to be taken as the place of origin. However, as these questions come under the Commission's jurisdiction, the Commission cannot agree to their being included in the basic Council regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 33 and 34 call for the specific reference to olive oil as an ingredient to be banned on food labels. These proposals are questionable from a commercial point of view and the Commission therefore takes the view that food labelling should comply with Directive 2000/13 (EC).</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the Commission is aware of the fact that the olive oil sector is calling for a ban on the marketing of mixtures of olive oils and other fats. However, the Commission cannot ban healthy, properly labelled products for which there is a demand simply to protect sales of another product. We therefore reject Amendments Nos 17, 20 and 32.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission will make sure that suitable labelling requirements are drafted. It goes without saying that olive oil sold under one of the four compulsory names is still pure olive oil and has all the qualities which make it such.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 47 suggests that the term “natural” should be used instead of the term “crude” and Amendment No 48 adds the term “ordinary olive oil” to the term “standard olive oil”. The Commission is unable to accept this at the moment because it prefers to find terms which correspond more closely to the perceptions of the sector as a whole. The Commission will, however, include your suggestions in subsequent Council discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Under Amendment No 21, the new classification would enter into force on 1 November 2002, i.e. a year before the date proposed by the Commission. As it will be impossible to complete the necessary implementing measures, market adjustments and international negotiations by then, the Commission cannot agree to this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as organisations of market operators are concerned, the Commission agrees to Amendment No 12 with its more general wording of the objectives, Amendment No 25 proposing that table olives be included in current provisions for quality improvement programmes and Amendment No 30 subject to legal examination and with the words “for recognised interbranch organisations”. The very specific Amendment No 13 could be helpful for measures promoted in environmental programmes, but not for the basic regulation of the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards measures for which organisations of market operators can claim a grant, the Commission is prepared to examine the inclusion of table olives and the assurance of origin. However, the details of possible measures must be decided by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The various methods for promoting sales must stay within the harmonised framework which applies to all agricultural products, which is why I have to reject Amendments Nos 39, 40 and 43. If an organisation of market operators is to be licensed, it must meet certain criteria which the Commission has yet to decide.</p>
<p class="contents">The restructuring of the olive oil sector was less comprehensive than in other sectors and new discussions and conditions therefore appear to be needed. The Commission has taken note of your request that organisations of producers and branch organisations be given priority. However, there seems to be little point at present in restricting measures which could help to improve the quality and hence sales of olive oil.</p>
<p class="contents">Numerous proposed amendments call for new regulations on organisations of market operators to enter into force as quickly as possible. This is certainly a good idea. However, we need a good two years to work out detailed regulations for the sector, for the organisations of market operators and their programmes, for checking programmes and for the Member States to check and licence organisations and design the monitoring tools needed. If we rush things, we will jeopardise the success of the quality strategy, which is why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 15, 28, 29, 31, 38, 41, 42 and 44. However, I can confirm that the Commission does appreciate almost half the proposed amendments, even if it can only directly accept a few of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The remainder are mostly provisions for which the Commission itself is responsible and which will be drafted and amended over coming months, taking account of your recommendations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
