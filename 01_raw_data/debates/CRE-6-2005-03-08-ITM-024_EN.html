The fact that we are removing some of the obstacles to trade faced by the poor countries is obviously a good thing. Trade does contribute to freedom, development and, especially, the prosperity that the poor countries are in extreme need of. What is depressing, however, is the fact that there is any need at all for a special preference system for the poor countries and the fact that the consequences of Europe’s general trade policy are such that, in order to sleep well at night, we have to make exceptions to it for the sake of the poor. Experience shows, moreover, that, as a policy, the preference system has, in very many ways, so far been of a symbolic nature. Few poor countries have made use of the system, not least because it has been so complicated. The objective must, of course, be for us to liberalise trade policy to the extent that we abandon the preference system in its entirety.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union which, in spite of everything, is based upon a wise appreciation of the beneficial effects of free trade, should of course dare to go the whole way. If we do not do so, how can trade, and indeed the world, become freer?</p>
<p class="contents">During the debate on this matter, I doubted, however, whether some MEPs remembered that European cooperation was based upon free trade. More than one attempt was made in this House too to protect European sugar production and the textile industry which now already operate behind high tariff barriers – and all this at the expense of producers in poor countries. I, for my part, obviously voted against these attempts, but there are still mumblings about our still having a long way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally should like to see the new preference system actually go further, with already low customs duties abolished, opportunities for enhancing the regions improved and the system further simplified.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish to repeat my hope that, within the not too distant future, we shall reach a point at which European trade policy is so free, open and untrammelled that we do not in actual fact need any preference system, for European trade policy must be permeated by the same basic idea from which the EU proceeds, namely free trade. Otherwise, we shall not experience Europe as Europe is, in actual fact, supposed to be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to highlight the considerable steps forward made in this new regulation, not only in terms of simplification, with the reduction in the number of systems, while concentrating the benefits of the GSP in the countries that need them most, or in terms of encouraging compliance with practices that are in line with sustainable development and good governance, but also in terms of the quick adoption of the new regulation, in order to provide additional commercial support as soon as possible for the countries affected by the tsunami.</p>
<p class="contents">On this last point, I am, however, concerned about the capacity of the beneficiary countries, and particularly those affected by the tidal wave, to take the necessary administrative steps quickly in order to benefit from the new system. Will the Commission have enough time to correctly evaluate the needs of the countries concerned? I think that the rapporteur’s proposal of a transitional period until January 2006 is the most reasonable, especially as we know that these long and complex procedures have always limited the use of the scheme by poor countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, with regard to rules of origin, although I welcome the greater flexibility in the text, it should be a priority for the European Union to harmonise these rules at international level, in particular within the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">Developing countries have to adapt to the specific rules of origin of each country that grants them a system of preferences, which makes the process very complicated and costly, to the point that sometimes it loses all commercial value. I would also like to stress that Parliament asks the Commission to closely monitor the application of the new system, in order to determine whether it achieves its objectives, country by country. The Commission needs to evaluate the system regularly, monitor its implementation and keep Parliament informed, which was not done in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by saying that the GSP is not an instrument that can promote development in the poorest countries and their full integration into international trade. If we really want to help poor countries to benefit from globalisation, we need to rethink world trade rules as a whole so that they are fairer, linking trade with sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While talking about the scheme of generalised tariff preferences, I would like to address the question of the rules of origin and inter-regional cumulation with regards to the textile sector. It is necessary to apply the principle of origin which has been in force until now and refrain from inter-regional cumulation. Inter-regional cumulation would simplify the application of the rules of origin, however it would be the more competitive countries, China for example, which would gain any real benefit from this, not the least developed countries. The abolition of the rules of origin would open the EU market to another 30 developing countries, including competitive India, while countries affected by the tsunami, for example Sri Lanka, would be unable to compete realistically. Those EU Member States which have transferred their textile manufacturing to Asian states would benefit, while the textile industry of the EU's southern and new Member States would suffer, unemployment would increase with the collapse of the textile sector and this would not help implement the Lisbon goals. When talking of global cumulation, the concept of the EU common market would on the whole become incomprehensible. I would like to stress that the Committee on International Trade has rejected the proposal on inter-regional and global cumulation. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to stress that our institution has not had sufficient time to consider and debate this complex subject in depth. Nevertheless, the report by the Committee on International Trade improves the Commission’s proposal and makes it more democratic, by enhancing the role of Parliament, and makes many aspects of it more balanced.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the imminent entry into force of the new system of generalised preferences (SGP), it will perhaps be necessary to carry out a prompt assessment in order to ascertain the scope of the modifications introduced, and Parliament's control function is going to be extremely important in relation to complex issues, such as the practical application of rules of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress my very positive view of the reference in the report to certain practical problems which may be faced by third countries in terms of immediate compliance with certain related international agreements, as in the case of El Salvador. Furthermore, I am glad that our amendments have been incorporated, which draw attention to the sensitivity of fisheries products, in general, and tuna, in particular, which are subject to great legal requirements in the European Union and imports of which must be properly controlled, in order to prevent further problems for a very sensitive industry which, furthermore, operates in European objective 1 regions which are very dependent, economically and socially, on this activity. I am pleased that we have persuaded the Commission to accept them, as Commissioner Mandelson acknowledged this morning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">More importantly, however, I wish to thank Mr Sánchez Presedo for considering the impact of the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative, particularly in the area of sugar, especially in the light of the forthcoming reform of our common organisation of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent example of the Balkans showed that limited access to the European market sometimes has the disadvantage of contributing to the development of an illegal triangular trade, which in the case of the fifty less advanced countries would probably generate a massive influx of sugar into the European market. Therefore, as the reform of the COM means that European countries will now experience fluctuations and will therefore be subject to the vagaries of the market, a significant increase in the supply of sugar will result in a huge drop in prices in the Union, at the same time removing the economic value of the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative for the least advanced countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, following the repeated requests from the least advanced countries themselves and in line with the recommendations of the Committee on Agriculture, this report on the generalised system of preferences leaves open the possibility of adapting the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative by allowing, if necessary, an extension of the transitional period preceding the complete opening up of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">This significant step forward due to the clear-sightedness of the rapporteur is necessary for the economic survival of the least advanced countries. It will give them time, in accordance with the reform of the COM in sugar, to modernise their production structures in order to adapt to the new European order. This is why it is imperative that the European Parliament adopts this text in order to take into account the specific nature of some sectors and so that the generalised system of preferences really fulfils its prime objective, which is the development of the countries that are most in need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">No one can dispute the role of international trade as a necessary factor in economic development and the reduction of poverty, even more so when development is linked to other important components, such as environmental protection, social responsibility and proper governance.</p>
<p class="contents">The scheme of generalised tariff preferences is a very useful tool for aiding developing countries. It is a most generous tool; however, its long period of application through renewals is leading to the unforced conclusion that it needs to focus on the countries that really need it and on fundamentally competitive products.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as sensitive products for the European Union are concerned, such as sugar, the abolition of duty and quotas on the basis of the timetable proposed by the Commission contains two risks. The first risk is from mass imports of sugar on to the European market after 2009. This will harm sugar beet manufacturers and the uncompetitive sugar industries in Europe. The second risk is inherent in the fact that the liberalisation of imports in application of the 'everything but arms' initiative, in conjunction with the strict proposal to review the COM in sugar, is expected to benefit not the less developed countries, which need a longer transitional period, nor the ACP countries, but the export interests of the oligarchies. Consequently, it is necessary for the provision to suspend duty to be subject to longer deadlines and smaller quotas which, I hope, will be laid down when the COM in sugar is reformed.</p>

Commissioner Mandelson made it clear this morning that the Commission’s aim in bringing forward this revision of the GSP was to ensure better targeting of trade preferences to benefit the least developed and most vulnerable countries, simplify the GSP system and make it more transparent, improve access to the GSP system by improving the rules of origin and encourage good governance in the countries that benefit from the system. All the rapporteur’s amendments take the Commission proposals further in that direction and I hope that the Commissioner will look closely at each of the amendments the rapporteur has proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also had good cooperation between the Commission and Parliament in bringing forward the implementation date for this measure. It was originally to come into force at the end of the year. It is now planned to come into force from April onwards, to respond to the tsunami crisis. While the volume of aid given to the countries affected by the tsunami has been welcomed, this measure will do more for them in the longer term. By providing them with an opportunity to trade more easily with the European Union, we are giving them a hand up rather than a handout.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the rapporteur has indicated that he is prepared to accept an amendment that Mr Karim and myself put forward. This would technically allow Pakistan to qualify for GSP aid. I should to emphasise that, although that would allow them to qualify under the statistics, they will still have to meet the good governance clauses by signing up for the appropriate international agreements, so this would be a carrot to Pakistan to sign up to important international social conventions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since being brought into being in 1971, the general preferential system has become a special instrument of European Union development policy. At the same time it is important to stress that the European Union was the first to apply this system in practice, from its birth to today, and today the EU is still the biggest donor to this system, with the United States only the second, lagging a long way behind the Union. I am happy that there is the opportunity for Parliament to give its opinion, and I very much hope that it will receive attention at the Commission and the Council. Similarly it is excellent to see the system being simplified, and the switch from five pillars to three, which will probably, because of simplification, better meet its goals in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to emphasise the origination regulation, which the Commission deals with in its statement. With regard to the form, content and procedural complexity of the origination regulation however, and its overall complexity, the result is that it is very hard to use, especially for the less developed countries. Although the draft regulation does not bring too many changes to the current regime, the European Parliament, in its opinion of 14 October last year, which was passed with a large majority, declared that extending it to span the regions and make it fully global is absolutely necessary. Finally I cannot stress enough the necessity of this – my colleague Mr van den Berg underlined this point this morning – that we extend the temporary period until 1 January 2006. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The system of generalised preferences has played a fundamental role in reducing poverty and improving the economies of the developing countries. As rapporteur on the negotiations within the WTO, within the framework of the Doha programme for development, I would like to stress that these systems can benefit each other mutually.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is necessary for this new SGP to be fully compatible with the agreement reached in Geneva last summer and with the negotiations being carried out in the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">I share their rapporteur’s concern about the erosion of preferences which result from the tariff reductions agreed in the WTO. I therefore believe it would be extremely appropriate for the Commission, once the round has finished, to produce a report on the possible impact of those agreements on the SGP and to propose appropriate measures to guarantee that the system is fully effective.</p>
<p class="contents">This would help to reduce the reservations of certain developing countries about the trade liberalisation proposed within the framework of the Doha negotiations, since the Union would take the necessary measures to maintain the current preferential treatment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is certainly also a good thing that a number of new products will be included in the scheme. In addition, the recent change to the proposal in response to the tsunami disaster deserves our support. As a result of it, the countries in question can enjoy the benefits of the new scheme more quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Like a number of fellow Members, I should, though, make a brief comment on the date of introduction. The countries need to submit an application to the Commission by as soon as 31 May. This is incredibly quick, and it is therefore advisable to build in the necessary flexibility and provide for a sufficiently lengthy transitional period. The countries that qualify for GSP plus, in particular, should be able to join the scheme after May 2005. Moreover, the Commission should pay special attention to capacity building<span class="italic"> </span>in those countries and should also, as far as possible, provide them with technical assistance in the transposition of, for example, the international conventions, thus enabling them to take optimum advantage of the GSP plus benefits. Meanwhile, negotiations on economic partner agreements are being continued. We must ensure that countries which do not ultimately wish to conclude an agreement in this manner still fall within the scope of GSP plus.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to argue in favour of regular assessments of the scheme’s impact, both within the EU and on developing countries, since circumstances are subject to almost constant change – something of which what is currently happening in the areas of textiles and sugar provides sufficient evidence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
