<p class="contents">Globalisation increases with every day that passes. It is a good sign that we are trading more and more across borders. We need a free flow of goods within the European Union, as well as an ever freer flow of goods in the world. It is, however, important that this should not lead to our seeing a freer flow of viruses. Where mad cow disease is concerned, it feels as though the European Union has gone into the free market back to front. First of all, a free market was created, and then we began to investigate whether the rules were adequate for a free market.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, a number of gratifying measures have been adopted. For example, we have created the European Food Authority. Moreover, food legislation has been reviewed, and this will lead to sound legislation once all the legal acts have entered into force. Experience so far is alarming, however. A look back shows that many Member States have been poor at complying with the legislation. It is, then, not only the defective legislation but also inadequate compliance with this that have resulted in the present position. It is extremely important that we now remedy this and become better at complying with the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">If we consider the connection between these different diseases, we can see that scrapie, which is the oldest TSE disease, was discovered as long as several hundred years ago, while BSE, which attacks bovines, was not discovered until 1986. We are obviously at a stage where a lot is happening. Life continues, and so does its negative sides. We must therefore be prepared for the possibility of constantly discovering new problems.</p>
<p class="contents">During the autumn, there was some anxiety that BSE might also be able to attack sheep. That is presumably the background to Paragraph 11, about the need to monitor sheep, being included in the report. I believe that its inclusion is a mistake and call upon Members not to vote in favour of it, for it appears that the investigation which was to have been carried out on sheep’s brains was most likely carried out on cows’ brains. Scientists too, of course, make mistakes from time to time.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem with BSE is that it is a disease which crosses the species barrier. This means that there is a risk of people too being infected. We know that Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a major worry in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to point out some of the measures we propose for the future in the report. First of all, I want to state that, for ethical reasons, ruminants must obviously never be fed with meat meal. They are not carnivores by nature and nor, therefore, must they be forced to eat meat. It is, however, sensible – and we return to this in the second report – for primary produce that is suitable for human consumption also perhaps to be used as feed. The problem is that there is a risk of disease if an animal eats other animals of the same species. What is termed a cannibalism ban ought therefore to be introduced, prohibiting the feeding of animals with feed produced from animals of the same species.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a considerable risk of infection, and there has been little in the way of compliance. We must therefore probably observe that it will not be possible within the foreseeable future to remove the ban on feeding omnivores with meat meal and bone meal. In the long term, when there is better compliance, it may perhaps be possible to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the important issue of sanctions, I want to put a direct question to Commissioner Byrne. If individual Member States do not meet their Treaty obligations, the EU must have powers to intervene by taking measures to guarantee food safety – an issue that we also address in a number of points in the report. We also believe that the Commission must be able to impose sanctions upon Member States that have not done enough to apply this type of legislation. It would be particularly interesting to hear the Commissioner’s view on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to repeat what I actually stated at the beginning of my speech. Research is needed within both this and other adjacent areas if we are to be alert to new problems’ and diseases’ arising. Diseases of this kind are dangerous to both animals and human beings, and it is incredibly important that we in the EU devote adequate resources to maintaining the fight against them at a high level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development were drafting our opinion and yet again pointing out that all Member States should now be carrying out their checks properly, we did think that, well, that has to be re-emphasised. We could not have guessed that it would become such a live issue, yet we are now learning from Germany, mainly from Bavaria and the Rhineland Palatinate, that the tests were done carelessly and the checking handed over to private firms which were ill-suited to it. One can only scratch one's head in bafflement. One can, of course, tell the Commission to better exercise supervisory control, but one can scarcely demand that any more, as the people at the bottom know just as well what it is all about. Let us face it, BSE is a dangerous disease, and it is actually scandalous that tests are done only from the age of thirty months. Most of the animals that end up in the slaughter line have not been tested.</p>
<p class="contents">Take Great Britain, where tests are still not being done at all, because animals over 30 months old are not permitted to enter the food chain, even though tests are, of course, necessary in order to establish the incidence of BSE among animals that are not getting into the food chain. When it comes to the scientists who made a laughing-stock of themselves by examining sheep whose brains then turned out to be those of cattle, we cannot of course say, ‘OK, then there is no danger to sheep.’ There is a danger to sheep, so they too have to be tested.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the circulation of animal bone meal, there are still evidently thousands of tonnes of infected or potentially infected animal bone meal making their way around the world, so that BSE is still spreading further afield and cropping up in places where we had never expected it. We see here, Commissioner Byrne, that the feed ban is evidently inadequate. It must be stated where the stuff has to go and how it is to be destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has also made clear, the same applies to feeding with swill and food leftovers, which has, over and over again, brought us foot-and-mouth disease and rinderpest when feed contained these in untreated form. This means that, here too, we can do nothing by means of a ban on its own, but must say where the stuff should go. If we had voted on the so-called interim report – ‘The Handling of Animal By-products’ – all of ten years ago, we would, of course, be under far less pressure from BSE, and if we had had it all along, there would have been no BSE. I would say the same about swill and food leftovers: if we had had proper handling of these food leftovers, there would have been no infection with foot-and-mouth disease and rinderpest.</p>
<p class="contents">We must reach the stage where one system prescribes this for all countries. Those who have an economic interest in bringing about the proper handling of animal by-products must be granted licences and punished by their withdrawal if they fail to do what the law prescribes. Whoever breaks this law must lose his livelihood, because human health in our country is at stake here. We must be bold in showing this rigour, or else – even in ten years' time – we will still be discussing the recurrence of lapses.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Byrne, I wish to expressly confirm to you that the Commission bears no responsibility for these latest failures. They are the responsibility of the Member States. The Commission has also done good work on the drafting of the interim report and on its presentation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Member States have, on several occasions, shown how hard they are finding it to manage this crisis. The European Union must not, therefore, shirk its responsibilities in this matter, particularly with the prospect of the forthcoming enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial, today, to better coordinate everyone’s efforts to put an end to this epidemic and to prevent further crises arising in the future. Our objective is food safety. We will only be able to achieve this objective by means of better coordination of the policies implemented in each State, and through greater harmonisation of screening procedures and of the fight against the disease.</p>
<p class="contents">My group, however, is divided over the measures to be adopted in this field, although I personally fully support the report by Mr Olsson. On the whole, my colleagues fully support these measures, which must enable us to achieve the objective of food safety. The differences of opinion concern the approaches to be taken. This is something I regret, because this obligation to public health must not allow us to relax the rigour to which we have subscribed under the precautionary principle. The aim is not to pit farmers and environmentalists or farmers and health specialists against one another. Farmers want to produce and to be able to guarantee the quality of their products; environmentalists, like those responsible for public health, want to contribute to a sustainable development, but everyone’s objectives are, in fact, the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, this obligation to public health does not allow any relaxation of rigour in terms of implementing the precautionary principle and the principle of zero tolerance, respecting the ban on feeding animals with animal meal, and the destruction of existing stocks of such meal. I can see that our British colleagues are having a hard time and that they would like to find alternatives to destroying the entire national herd, but none of this should allow us to relax the rigor that we want to see in this monitoring of the BSE crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude, Madam President, by reminding you that, in this field, it is crucial that the Commission is able to put a number of sanctions in place and that it ensures that the necessary inspections are made by the Food and Veterinary Office. Community legislation must be implemented more systematically and must be implemented in all the Member States in the same way. Sanctions must be followed up and we must be able to guarantee consumers the highest level of safety in order to restore the public’s confidence in their farmers and in their political leaders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the English version. I am speaking here on behalf of Mrs Roth-Behrendt, as her father died yesterday and she has had to return home. I am sure the whole House will join me in expressing sympathy to her.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the things I want to say. First and foremost, we still do not know enough about BSE and about how it is spread. We certainly do not know enough about its incidence in all the Member States of the Community. We know that we still have it in the UK and although in the coming year it may be that other Member States have more cases than us, that is not a cause for satisfaction for us, but rather for commiseration with those who are still discovering the full horror of what this may mean for them. In the UK we have had over a hundred cases of the human form of CJD. We pray that other Member States will not go through that agony either.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner will be entitled to say to us, when we talk about inadequate testing, that the Commission has said time after time that the real truth about BSE was hidden because there was no effective testing. If this debate does one thing at least, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and others have said, it may impress upon us that the Member States need to be able to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that Mr Olsson accepts that there is an equality of effectiveness between the way the UK takes out animals at 30 months and the slaughter of affected herds and testing of individual animals before they enter the food chain in other European countries. I would not want to see any misunderstandings about that. I believe we need more effective checks for contamination. There are some late, worrying statistics in the UK and elsewhere about animals born after the checks were put into effect, which are still now showing symptoms of BSE. There are obvious suspicions about the hoarding of meat and bonemeal and about where and how the testing is effected.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Olsson wants the FBO to be in effect the monitoring agency. I do not mind that, but I believe that nothing should subtract from the responsibility of the individual Member States to ensure that their testing and external controls are effective and are carried through.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the question of animal waste to herbivores. We will be debating this when Mrs Paulsen's report comes back for its chequered second reading. I would simply say that I am in that party in this House that believes, with Mr Olsson, that we should outlaw the feeding of animal waste of any form to ruminant animals. It is high time that was done.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the issue of sheep, I would just say to Mr Olsson that when we look at that lamentable failure over the testing of what turned out to be cows' brains, all that tells us is that there was incompetence of a grotesque kind. It does not tell us that we have proof positive that BSE has not jumped species once again and got into the sheep population. I would like to hear the Commissioner's views on those things and I apologise for repeating some of the other excellent remarks made in this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Control of infectious diseases goes hand in hand with proper monitoring. Close consideration should be given to how infectious diseases are monitored by European Union institutions. We must likewise question the methods of countries outside the EU and impose stricter import controls like those carried out in Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must remember, if regulations are drawn up, that it is important to impose penalties on Member States which fail to implement EU legislation on feed and foodstuffs, otherwise regulations are not worth the paper they are written on.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on Members to let common sense prevail. Of course we need to test animals for BSE, but let us base the tests on sound scientific practices. There is no proof that testing animals at 24 months is foolproof. On the contrary, animals can develop BSE after 24 months. I have had no satisfactory answers as to what this calculation is based upon. The 30-month threshold currently imposed seems to be working. The forecasts are that the UK will be BSE-free by 2005, and this has been achieved using the 30-month threshold. Meat under 30 months can now be exported from the UK and it is true to say that it has proved to be a safe product for the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">Another concern is the compulsory testing of sheep. Again I urge caution and call again on sound scientific evidence. The whole UK flock was nearly wiped out last year because of the discovery of BSE in sheep. However, luckily someone questioned the validity of the findings and it was then discovered that the test was actually carried out on a cow's brain after all. This episode did little to restore farmers' confidence in proper scientific research. We need to develop a comprehensive animal health strategy and ask ourselves what we have learned from BSE. The main thing, without a doubt, is not to tamper with nature on ethical grounds. Herbivores must not be made to eat meat or fishmeal. However, we must now concentrate on the future and work on a policy and strategy to undo the damage to the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the farming community has suffered a great blow over the past few years. Let us work together now towards a food safety policy and a reform of the common agricultural policy which moves us away from a so-called consumer-led policy that led to intensification – but let us not move either to a consumer-led policy based on unfounded theories. We must regain consumer confidence by producing a policy that will embrace all aspects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although they involved a lot of distortion and scaremongering, reports played a significant role in preventing such occurrences from being forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">The breaches in the investigation of BSE which have become public knowledge in recent days represent setbacks for all those who have campaigned to introduce a high level of consumer health protection in food production, and I think they had had some of those already.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely the great public interest in this subject, and the apparent avoidability of the most recent instances of human health being put in danger, that justifies the introduction of strict sanctions as asked for by the report, in order to finally stop new cases of BSE flaring up.</p>
<p class="contents">The highest standards in food production should apply in the European Union. Such is the most significant statement in the White Paper on Food Safety. The legal framework this requires must, as I understand things, be allied to a recognised early warning system through the EU countries, so that suspicion that human health has been endangered will result in the products being designated and their manufacturers named in public.</p>
<p class="contents">As a rule, public warnings are always desirable, above all when it is suspected that a product has been widely distributed, which is always the likely case in the never-ending cycle of food production.</p>
<p class="contents">It makes sense to me that specific food producers should be publicly named and warned where, in future, there is the mere suspicion of danger through unhygienic production practices or basic materials. The widely-honoured principle is this: checks on animal feed are the preliminary stages of foodstuffs inspection.</p>
<p class="contents">The report's demands are indeed far-reaching. Practical experience will show whether breach of a specific duty by the withholding of information should have the same consequence as fraud against the financial interest of the European Community. The whole importance of the report lies in the necessity of referring again and again to the need to abide by existing prohibitions and instructions.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to observe in conclusion that Mr Olsson's report is of contemporary relevance and shows close acquaintance with the present situation. I do not believe that it is a plan of campaign for the next BSE crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Europe, which is largely responsible for this tragic health crisis, must learn the lessons from it, particularly with regard to the failings that have occurred. Instead of giving the Commission and the Veterinary Office greater powers, it would be better to harmonise the measures that need to be taken and then implement them effectively. How, for example, is it possible that the list of specific risk material varies from one State to another? The European Union, the largest consumer of agricultural produce, must impose its requirements for food safety on extra-Community policy. In other words, it must apply to imports similar rules to those that regulate European production.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to research policy, all means must be harnessed: research into the disease, methods of transmission, means of prevention, the updating of tests on living animals, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to waste treatment, how is animal meal stored? How is it going to be processed?</p>
<p class="contents">This crisis also has a major economic and social aspect, with the threat to entire swathes of the farming sector. The fall in the number of farms clearly illustrates the professional crisis affecting young farmers. How, indeed, can they contemplate the future with ease if the high-quality products adapted to the new expectations of consumers are not selling?</p>
<p class="contents">Other professions lower down the food chain are also affected. This is true of small butchers and specialist butchers, who refuse to give up their right to remove bones in their shops when they only work with healthy carcasses.</p>
<p class="contents">Farmers have already made huge efforts to ensure quality, labelling and traceability, for which they are not always compensated. Large-scale distribution continues, in fact, to favour cheap meat, even if this means importing from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as we are told, society has opted for quality, it must stand shoulder to shoulder with farmers in this process. It has become crucial to launch information campaigns to reopen dialogue and to finally restore confidence between consumers and producers. This step is essential to finding a way out of a crisis that is still unfolding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Souchet (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, the first thing we must bear in mind at the outset of this evening’s useful and necessary debate on the monitoring of the BSE crisis is the confusion, the distress, the suffering and the fury of farmers, whose possibilities, prices and morale have all been struck by a veritable earthquake that has shaken their world, ruined years of work on breeding and good practices and has caused them to be distrusted by consumers, which they feel is particularly unfair.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned to see that, in many farming regions, as you know, Madam President, large numbers of still young farmers are leaving the business because, unable to put up with the consequences of a crisis for which they are not responsible any longer, they are forced to stop farming. In some cases, their despair leads them to take violent action, even to commit suicide.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, which reacted so badly and so slowly to the outbreak of this crisis, first by denying it and then by playing down its severity, appears today, probably to get itself off the hook, to be prolonging the matter by imposing whole ranges of measures which do nothing to allay consumers’ concerns; they risk destabilising the markets and increase the costs of making changes to the industry, whilst at the same time proving itself to be more generous in laying down regulations than in providing money. The European testing programme for scrapie enters into force this month. Is this good timing when each test costs as much as a sheep’s carcase and cannot currently distinguish between the prion which causes scrapie, which is harmless to humans, and the prion that causes BSE, which can be transmitted to humans? Furthermore, Argentinian meat imports have started up again. Is this really the right time, when some parts of Argentina remain infected with foot-and-mouth disease? Incidentally, the special purchases programme, set up by the Commission is about to be abolished, on 31 March, and according to Agenda 2000, the intervention mechanism for beef and veal is due to end on 30 June 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission to state unequivocally that these deadlines will be put back, because going ahead with these blows to the beef and veal industry would be like cutting off the oxygen to an injured person who is being resuscitated. Instead, we feel that at a time when the BSE epidemic is at very different stages in the various Member States, it is the vigilance of the States themselves that provides the bests results. In the United Kingdom, where the disease originated and which has had 99% of all clinical cases, the measures, which admittedly took a long time to be adopted and an even longer time to be properly implemented, are now bearing fruit. The number of BSE cases has steadily fallen by 40% per year to reach fewer than 1000 cases last year, whereas in 1992, there were 36 000. In France, where the epidemic is more recent and where systematic screening over the last eighteen months seemed to initially increase the number of cases, there has been a slight decrease since the end of 2000. The other countries affected have a lower rate of prevalence and also appear to be in control of the situation. As you are aware, it is now Japan’s turn to be infected by the epizooty that we have experienced.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, we must now, therefore, allow the authorities of the Member States to get on with their work so that farmers can regain the total confidence of consumers, whilst, within the Union, resolutely making the necessary efforts to provide real traceability. Consequently, with regard to France’s maintaining its ban on British animals and meats, the European Court in Luxembourg – the judgment should be read in its entirety – has acknowledged that the ban was largely justified due to the still insufficiently reliable traceability within the industry in the United Kingdom. It is also crucial to effectively implement, by means of systematic and rigorous inspections, the same quality and safety requirements, in order to provide consumers with the same guarantees for meats imported from third countries as for Community meats.</p>
<p class="contents">Item 25 of the draft resolution that has been presented to us makes a timely insistence on the importance of this issue by emphasising the Commission’s responsibility to “ensure that the same safeguards are applied with regard to imports from third countries as apply to Community products, in particular as regards BSE testing, the temporary ban on feeding meat-and-bone meal and the proper removal of specific risk material.” Furthermore, the Commission should also inform us, as well as the Member States, of the results of its inspections. To sum up, Madam President, consumer confidence, which is crucial if our farmers are going to find new hope, will only fully return when they see that in the European Union, public health protection comes before the dogma of free trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report’s explanatory statement gives a perfect account of the BSE crisis from its origins in the United Kingdom in the 1980s.</p>
<p class="contents">The 180 000 infected bovine animals in Great Britain, in addition to the 1 325 in the rest of Europe by the year 2000 and the 101 human cases of new variant CJD have raised serious issues about animal feed and have highlighted the far from harmless effect of this feed on the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, fortunately, we can congratulate ourselves on the scientific advances made in discovering the cause of the disease and on the efforts being made by the Commission and the Member States to eradicate it once and for all. However, there are still some loose ends that need to be tied up in order to complete these investigations and implement the measures that are strictly necessary, because the measures that have been implemented are extremely costly to public and private funds, and for this reason, we must not ask for anything that is unnecessary, even though it costs nothing to ask.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I wish to put forward the idea that, until there is scientific evidence to support it, we should neither gratuitously request that the age for obligatory BSE testing be lowered, nor should we ask for the list of risk material to be extended. It would be a different issue altogether were veterinary scientists to recommend this, but, as things stand, they have not done so.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to conclusion No 27, which calls for a reform of the CAP to tackle this problem, I would say that the CAP deals with a great deal more than food safety alone and that this safety is sufficiently complex to be addressed within the reform of the CAP. This is well understood by the Commission and hence the White Paper on Food Safety, the European Food Authority and all the legislation on food safety and animal feed that we are revising in this legislative period.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the framework in which the technical and regulatory actions to be taken to guarantee food safety in the whole food production chain and not in the CAP are established, although one side-effect of it could be to impact on some aspects of the CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as has been said on many occasions, we think that if the crisis was not tackled earlier, it was not due to a lack of research, studies or mandatory regulations. It was due to a failure to implement standards and to a breakdown in the appropriate controls for their implementation. These are areas in which we should have more influence in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is beyond me why, after putting so many strict measures in place, we are still fighting BSE. Due to the unknown incubation period, the measures that have been taken only take effect in the longer term. It is therefore possible for new cases of the serious Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease to emerge, against which we are still powerless to do anything. We have to be very frank about this.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we can also state that, by the compulsory removal of specific risk material, a guarantee is put in place that the carrier of the disease no longer ends up in the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">Since it is no longer permitted to feed cattle animal and bone meal, I expect that, in time, the number of cattle infected with BSE will be relatively small. At some point, we hope that tests will show that we are at the level we were at prior to the BSE crisis, namely a few cases per annum.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the testing of cattle for BSE has disastrous side-effects. If one cow appears to be infected, the entire herd is slaughtered. However, this makes no sense. BSE is not the same as foot-and-mouth disease. Infection is caused through the feed and is passed on down the breeding line. That is why the birth and feed group need to be traced and tested, and not the cattle accidentally sharing the same shed. It is irresponsible to sacrifice healthy animals to a false sense of consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">We went against God’s creation by turning ruminants into cannibals. We cannot conceal our shortcomings with futile measures. We will once again abuse God’s creation if we slaughter and destroy animals unnecessarily. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our objective is to guarantee food safety, and we will not have reached it as long as our knowledge of this disease is incomplete.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I particularly support the demand for the resources needed for continued research into TSE diseases to be made available by the Commission. We need to learn more about these diseases and epidemics, which were previously unknown, in order to be able to combat them more effectively. Society's hysteria, which was particularly marked in Germany, is diminishing. People are going back to eating meat, and are again buying it cheaply.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for clarity about who, in the European Union, is to bear the costs of additional impositions such as tests and investigations, and conditions for this must be the same from one Member State to another. We must, in the same way, see to it that regulations are transposed in the same way in every Member State. The provisions of the TSE Regulation need to be stringently applied, with tough penalties imposed for disregarding or fraudulently evading them, not only as regards the production and utilisation of animal feeds but also tests, regulations on slaughtering and the disposal of hazardous material.</p>
<p class="contents">Animal feed is the target of criticism as much as ever and will continue to be so until we have open declaration and can at last check to ensure that only what is listed on the container is actually in it. We cannot carry on being driven by fear of fraud, improper treatment and erroneous identification to destroy valuable substances and, apart from that, to import materials or feed from overseas, for example, where we have no influence on their production and composition. That is why I put working towards openness, ease of control, and truthfulness right at the top of the list, for only by them will we achieve credibility and trustworthiness. Until that day, the ban on feeding omnivores with meat and bone meal will have to stay in place.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows from this, though, that the Commission urgently needs to develop innovative methods of disposal and recycling, such as, for example, the production of biodiesel from tallow or fats. It must at least be made clear that unprocessed offal, waste water, fat and tallow still have to be treated.</p>

As a farmer myself, and someone who had a beef herd, I can testify to the wholesale damage and destruction that BSE has done – not only to the beef industry in my own country, but also in Member States throughout the Union. So I welcome his efforts in fighting BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a scourge that we must defeat across the whole of Europe. I welcome any moves that will strengthen the efforts already made in the UK and by the Commission to stamp out BSE. However, the report also raises some serious questions that are to be addressed if we are to maintain the efforts to improve food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I do not believe that the whole-herd slaughter policy has any scientific base for adoption. BSE is not a contagious disease and cannot be spread between cattle. As we have seen with foot-and-mouth, to adopt the scatter-gun approach to disease control policy of mass culling does nothing to instil confidence in the consumer and only serves to spread further concern. In fact, if a farmer has to lose his whole herd for one case of BSE he may be less inclined to declare the animal and may bury it instead. I ask Commissioner Byrne to review the whole slaughter policy for BSE in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there have recently been worrying cases in the UK of beef being illegally imported from Ireland, which breaches the UK's very strict regulations. In the UK at present we have a scheme in place which prohibits beef over 30 months from entering the food chain. In one recent case, beef over 30 months from a plant in Cork was shipped illegally for processing and then resale within the UK. It is a testament to the tough and stringent controls in place in my own country that this particular breach was picked up so quickly and effectively. But I call on the Commission and other Member States to ensure that their own authorities are as vigilant against this dangerous trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there have been far too many cases of meat containing specified risk material being exported into the United Kingdom. The growing number of cases and the fact that they come from so many Member States – Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Ireland, to name but a few – must be a huge concern for us all. I am not seeking to apportion blame in any way, but if we wish to see the farming industry – particularly the beef industry – flourish in Europe, we must all shoulder the responsibility to enforce the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">What I am calling for is a mood of resilience and an ardour to implement the EU regulations and the tough controls that we have in place, and for us to work together to improve the inspection regimes in all Member States. I call upon the Commission to take a more robust attitude to the enforcement of this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have found in the United Kingdom that the only way to rebuild the beef industry is to rebuild consumer confidence. We will only do that by guaranteeing the public a safe product that they can trust. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Feeding with infective animal meals or fats is still regarded as the principal trigger for BSE. It is irresponsible, in view of the experience we had of poor adherence to the ban on feeding ruminants with animal meal, to think at present in terms of lifting the general EU-wide ban on it. Moreover, consumers would find it incomprehensible.</p>
<p class="contents">All animal meals still kept in stock, as well as feed containing them, must be destroyed without delay in order to prevent future cross-contamination of feedingstuffs. There is a particular and connected danger presented by the animal meals, some of them infective, still stored in other states. The smallest amounts of this material is sufficient to cause infections, and this is yet another reason not to lift the ban on feeding with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Guaranteeing the safety of humans and animals most certainly and fundamentally presupposes a working and stringent system of controls in the Member States. I welcome the strict prescription of effective tests for BSE in all the Member States, and also the demand that the age for testing be reduced to 24 months. The Commission must also intervene in favour of the introduction of the open declaration of all feed ingredients in all nation states. Even before the Central and Eastern European states accede to the EU, they need to set up working systems alongside our own to oversee the safety of food and feedingstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an especially urgent need for slaughterhouses to be reorganised so that the immediate removal and disposal of hazardous materials in accordance with European directives may be guaranteed. Imported food must be every bit as safe as that produced in the European Union, and so tests for BSE must now be made obligatory in countries outside the EU. The safety of food, including that which is imported, is a fundamental requirement for consumers who want to eat healthily. We must make it our concern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is right and proper, for in this tragedy – a tragedy which is equally great for all – there are in effect two victims, also equally affected: the consumer and the farmer.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember the long hours of debate, the on-site inspections carried out at the beginning of the committee of inquiry’s work and then during the work of the supervisory committee monitoring the committee of inquiry, set up because Parliament did not have confidence even in the information provided by the Commission; in effect, it proved to be severely lacking in many areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we know more than we did then, for the world of science has also provided some answers and clarified the main issues somewhat. We now know that the bulk of the blame for this tragic affair lies with the State, with the world of politics. Basically, there are some Member States which have been less diligent in enforcing precautionary rules and, above all, bans, over the past two years. Other States seem, once again, to have adopted, as in the past, the approach of a conspiracy of silence, in what could be described as an irresponsible attempt to hide and minimise the impact of the tragedy or – at least – the problem. Already, in the past, precisely this attitude of lack of transparency has caused the most severe damage for farmers, for they were the butt of suspicion, mistrust and discouragement on the part of the consumer. I therefore feel that the most important part of the Olsson report is precisely its loud call to governments to enforce the rules properly and thereby restore the confidence of the citizens, whether they are consumers or farmers, with an adequate information campaign and, most importantly, with sufficient support not least for those who are the direct victims of the tragedy: the farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Preventative consumer protection is on everybody's lips, but my understanding of these things leads me to believe that our role as politicians is not to give additional impetus to the emotional discussions that are still being carried on about the ongoing handling of the BSE crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I do not want to help discussion of matters concerning BSE to slavishly follow the spirit of the age. In view of current events in Germany, I favour the strictest controls right along the food production chain. We also, of course, need the toughest sanctions when offences are committed. In the meantime, I advocate testing for BSE from 24 months.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, when can we actually expect science to come up with definite findings on how individual animals get the disease? I think that when that does come to light, we could say goodbye in no time to the idea of killing off all our livestock. Until then, going down the road of mass slaughter is only one alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">The feeding of omnivores with meat and bone meal will no doubt continue to be prohibited, at that for a variety of reasons. We will certainly maintain the current ban on feeding with animal meals for as long as the open declaration of feedingstuffs is not made mandatory and for as long as the processing of offal from healthy animals cannot be carried out with any guarantee of safety. I will mention, though, the formulation used in Mr Olsson's report. He, too, says ‘for the foreseeable future’. ‘For the foreseeable future’ means, for me, that the future may perhaps find us back on a better road ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that it is easy for us to explain to any critically-minded consumer that healthy meat on healthy bone is part of good diet. Processed healthy bone in animal meal is, though, apparently a danger to the omnivore. Just try making sense of that. We could take numerous other examples to illustrate this state of affairs. I take the view that we, bearing as we do political responsibility, have to get back to discussing things in a more matter-of-fact way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We urgently need new research into what causes it and how it spreads. There is no reliable proof of the quality of the screening process. The call to lower the age of animals to be tested from thirty months to twenty-four months is hardly relevant. In most cases, the disease is still diagnosed in animals when they start to behave strangely.</p>
<p class="contents">The possible connection between calf feed and BSE must be studied. There has been no clear explanation for recent individual outbreaks of the disease. It is nevertheless worth supporting the disposal of stocks of bonemeal and tallow. The disease must not be allowed to spread by accident as a result of contaminated feed. There must be unambiguous declaration of ingredients in animal feed, and responsible cattle breeders must be able to make the right choice on the basis of reliable information when purchasing animal feed. The wellbeing and health of animals must be safeguarded.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no transitional periods allowed for new Member States joining the Community with regard to food hygiene and declarations of quality and ingredients, as the new Member States will be joining a real internal market. The applicant countries must be given technical and financial support in the prevention of the BSE risk. We have to ensure that the measures will also continue after the enlargement process is over.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot was done last year to bring BSE under control and this brought results: for example, consumer confidence in beef is starting to return. At this stage it is reasonable to remain cool, reinforce the measures that exist, and await the outcome of new studies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The common concern of us all is, without any ifs and buts, the maximum possible safety of our food, which, though, should also look good and taste good.</p>
<p class="contents">To produce this food, we need farmers, we need agriculture and we need agro-food production. That is still the case. It is this fact that prescribes the frame of reference in which we are at present working on this own-initiative report. The report rightly highlights a series of shortcomings, no doubt the most serious of which is the appreciable difference in the ways Community legislation is implemented in the absence of any common level of protection. This is where, in my view, the Commission is meant to be able to intervene and should be in a position to do so. The precautionary principle must be adhered to by any means available.</p>
<p class="contents">Current events in Bavaria and the Rhineland Palatinate show how important responsible controls are. We must therefore hold fast to the imposition of strict sanctions when binding regulations are not complied with, but I counsel a more cautious approach where a scientific justification has not, to date, been found. I cannot therefore go along with testing for BSE as early as 24 months, with the ban on feeding with leftover food, even if it has been treated in accordance with contemporary scientific knowledge, and, likewise, the idea of slaughtering the whole stock when a case of BSE occurs, which is something I reject.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an urgent need for more research into comprehensive food safety. We need farmers to be well-trained, good managers, motivated and – which is most important – respected by society, and these farmers need a fair price for what they produce. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ever since the first case of BSE occurred, Parliament has always very closely observed and discussed the steps taken at both European and national level to deal with the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for us, the farmers right across Europe, that all possible steps should be taken to avoid future food crises. The precautionary principle, already mentioned by many of my fellow Members, must be adhered to, and the latest medical findings must be taken into account. One difficulty that has become apparent is that of the marked divergences between Member States in the way they implement EU regulations and the partial absence of details as to how and to what extent Community legislation is being transposed. I am in good company when I say that, above all, though, much firmer measures must be taken in respect of non-compliance, including the removal of hazardous material.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that it is sensible to provide for the reduction to 24 months of the age at which tests are carried out. I think this would give rise to unjustifiable costs. Tests should continue to be carried out at 30 months in order to obtain secure results. I therefore also support those amendments that provide for this. As I have already said, the greatest protection is offered by proper slaughtering and removal of hazardous material.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make another observation. I really would like to make the point that the common agricultural policy surely already does justice to the objective of food safety even now. In my opinion, there is no absolute link between the continuing handling of BSE and the treatment of food leftovers. The BSE crisis was, as we know, triggered by the production of animal meal under improper conditions and the equally improper feeding of it to ruminants. The problems of recycling should be dealt with in another report.</p>
<p class="contents">A second consideration to which we should give attention is that the subject of animals, which are actually omnivorous, should be dealt with elsewhere, in a report of its own and not in this report, which is actually only on the ongoing handling of BSE in ruminants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to thank him for this report. His extensive experience in this area is evident from the detail and the high quality of this report, and I thank him for that.</p>
<p class="contents">There is too little time available to speak of the recommendations that the Commission can support. I would like, therefore, to concentrate on those recommendations with which we differ or where there appear to be differences within Parliament itself. The recommendation to reduce the age of testing of bovines to 24 months is an example of this. Almost eight million tests were carried out last year on healthy animals aged over 30 months. The youngest positive case in these animals was aged 41 months. This suggests that there is no immediate urgency to lower the current age limit. However, the situation will remain under review.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue where there is some confusion is in relation to the Commission action in cases of poor implementation of BSE measures by the Member States themselves. I have gone on record repeatedly to the effect that the existing enforcement mechanisms, namely the infringement proceedings, do not have sufficient teeth.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's intention is to present a proposal to the Council and Parliament shortly on food and feed controls. This proposal will fundamentally review the inspection systems in the Member States. In the process it will also propose much stronger action, including stronger sanctions, which many of you have referred to as having been contained in Mr Olsson's report.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of financial penalties in the case of fraud or serious malfunctioning of a national control system is being considered in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">The incidence of BSE in the Community gives mixed signals. The total number of cases in 2001, excluding the UK, is likely to be in the region of 1,000 cases. This is more or less double the 482 cases registered in 2000. However, most of this increase was due to the impact of the generalised testing of healthy and at-risk animals with the newly available rapid tests.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, frankly, Member States that previously were not looking very hard for BSE have now learned their lesson and have hugely improved their surveillance efforts. Nonetheless, there is still room for improvement in the area of implementation, as the reports of the FVO consistently highlight.</p>
<p class="contents">Another continued difficulty is the problem in the Member States in coping with the huge volume of meat and bonemeal which must be destroyed. The Commission has actively reminded Member States of their obligations to respect Community law in this regard and I would refer to a number of contributions from Members of the House on this matter, and would draw your attention to the fact that there is legislation in place relating to this issue which must be complied with by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the continued uncertainty over the possible presence of BSE in sheep is also of concern, and many of you referred to this. A decision was taken only last week to substantially increase the level of testing for TSEs in sheep. This will provide a much better picture of the potential problem facing the Community if the presence of BSE in natural conditions is ever confirmed in sheep.</p>
<p class="contents">So, I greatly welcome this opportunity to respond to Parliament's initiative in the report. It is only a little over a year since the most recent crisis peaked. We have made a lot of progress in the meantime. At this stage I should summarise the key measures that have been put in place. First of all, the use of meat and bonemeal in animal feed has been suspended. Testing for BSE has been introduced for all healthy animals aged over 30 months and for at-risk and casualty animals over 24 months. The list of SRMs has been extended, notably to include the vertebral column and the entire intestine of bovines, and mechanically recovered meat from the bones of ruminants has been banned.</p>
<p class="contents">There has also been very important progress on the legislative front. Regulation No 999/2001 on TSEs was finally agreed and entered into force on 1 July 2001. Very good progress has also been made on the animal by-products proposal, with the question of how to deal with catering wastes as the main obstacle to final agreement. The agreement also on the open declaration of animal feedingstuffs and on the Food Safety Authority will also greatly strengthen the overall framework in relation to TSEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to imports from third countries, there are already a comprehensive series of measures in place under the TSE Regulation and its implementing provisions. The FAO has undertaken a series of inspection missions in the candidate countries in recent weeks and months. Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay will also be visited shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports on these missions are now coming on stream. It appears that while there has been some progress, further important efforts are still required to achieve full compliance in these countries. I am very concerned that they should not repeat the mistakes of the Member States in their handling of the BSE problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will be actively calling on the countries concerned to take urgent corrective action. I also intend to raise the matter in the meeting of the Agriculture Council with the candidate countries scheduled for next month.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by thanking Mr Olsson for his report. I want to assure Parliament that the Commission's attention remains firmly fixed on TSEs. I am insistent that there will be no complacency. I know that Parliament will continue to keep a close eye – rightly – on eradicating this disease.</p>
<p class="contents">There were a number of points raised by Members that I would like to refer to.</p>
<p class="contents">In the UK there is now testing of all bovines born between August 1996 – the date of MBM ban – and the end of 1997. The youngest positive test was found at 41 months. That is in respect of eight million tests of healthy animals.</p>
<p class="contents">I should emphasise that there is no question ever of lifting the ban on the feeding of meat and bonemeal to ruminants. That ban is in place and will remain so. There is no debate concerning that issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am really looking forward to our being able to adopt a position in this House on the Commission’s proposal concerning the way in which the issue is to be handled. I see this as a major step forward when it comes both to this issue and to the control and inspection of foodstuffs generally.</p>
<p class="contents">I can also tell the Commissioner that I share his view of the proposal to reduce the age of animals that are to be tested for BSE to 24 months. That was not my proposal. Rather, it came from elsewhere. I shall therefore help vote down this proposal tomorrow, using the same arguments that the Commissioner used.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to take the opportunity of thanking you, my fellow MEPs, for all your kind words. It has been a pleasure to work on this report. I would, however, emphasise in conclusion that the danger is not over. As we have seen during 2001, new cases have been discovered in many other countries, not only within the EU but also in the candidate countries, Slovenia and Slovakia, as well as in Japan. BSE is still a problem. I share the view expressed by Mr Whitehead concerning the BSE investigation which proved to have been carried out on cows’ brains instead of sheep’s brains. That means that the <span class="italic">only</span> thing we know in many of these situations is that we really do not know anything, or that we do not know a sufficient amount. That is why there is a need for research. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
