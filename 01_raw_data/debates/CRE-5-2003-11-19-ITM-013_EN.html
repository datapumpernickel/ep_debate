<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Coelho (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, Commissioner Vitorino, ladies and gentlemen, in 1990 the Schengen Agreement was signed and the need was acknowledged to step up controls in order to prevent threats to our citizens’ security, such as organised crime, terrorism, trafficking in human beings and drugs and illegal immigration, amongst others, from entering the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Applying the principle of free movement and abolishing controls at national borders has heightened the importance of controls at our external borders. We know that free movement within the territory of the Schengen States is a freedom that in return requires not only a strengthening of our external borders but also a rapid and efficient exchange of information under border controls and police cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Schengen Information System (SIS) has played quite an important role, which we are attempting to extend even further by creating a second generation of the SIS that has been designed for SIS II. The SIS operates as an information system that enables the competent authorities in the Member States to investigate and receive alerts on persons and on objects. The system currently operates in thirteen Member States and in two other States - Iceland and Norway - and it is hoped that it will soon become partially operational in the United Kingdom and in Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">The SIS is the largest database in Europe and has a dual function: it contributes to maintaining public order and security and to immigration, by supporting the measures intended to compensate for the free movement of persons. The proposals presented to us for the creation of SIS II are intended to extend the system’s capacity and to introduce new technical and research possibilities, taking advantage of the most up-to-date developments in the field of information technology.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s plan is that the system should be up and running in 2006. This new system is being created in order to address three major issues. Firstly, enlargement, so as to be able to integrate the new Member States, which will require the capacity to integrate more users, more Member States, and also new categories of users. There is already agreement in Council on allowing new authorities to access SIS, but it is not yet known what these authorities will be. The second development is that the current system has functions covering two categories of information (persons and objects). The intention is not only to increase the number of data categories that will be included, that is, new objects and functions, but also to increase the capacity to process this information, to interlink alerts, to modify the duration of the alerts, and to store and transfer biometric data, especially photographs and fingerprints. The Council has taken no decision on what new categories of objects or persons will be included. The third and last issue – that of economy – is that, despite having more functions and more users, the system must be more homogeneous, more flexible, more secure and perform better. It must also be manageable and cost-effective.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, therefore, right to consider that we are no longer talking only about a limited measure of compensation, introduced to facilitate the free movement of persons, as set out in the Schengen Convention, in Articles 92 and 102 to be specific. Indeed, a document issued by the Presidency in February 2002 even suggested that the SIS could be used for the purpose of police information in the broadest sense. The nature of the SIS consequently underwent a metamorphosis, albeit an imperceptible one; the issue of precisely what the SIS’s objective is to be in future or how this ‘broadest sense’ referred to by the Presidency can be defined remains open. In my opinion, only when the question about the definition of the objectives of the SIS is answered in a clear and politically acceptable way can the debate on issues such as new functions or new users be properly answered.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, discussions are ongoing on proposals for the introduction of new functions, new users, a new architecture, new synergies, in particular with the visa information system, and new management. Discussions are still taking place on the location, too. These amendments, which we hope will be accepted, obviously have repercussions for data protection and for the protection of citizens’ fundamental rights. We reiterate that any decision taken must always be accompanied by the highest data protection standards, specifically the requirements stipulated by Article 118 of the Schengen Convention, in a constant attempt to achieve the right balance between security and freedom. I hope that this report will help to make the debate on SIS II more transparent, to accentuate the need for Parliament to monitor the process, to emphasise the need for its management to be supervised by Community bodies and to ensure that greater effectiveness always goes hand in hand with the desirable and necessary reinforcement of the issues of data protection and of safeguarding citizens’ rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Coelho for his report, which clearly highlights the fundamental challenges presented by the second generation of the Schengen Information System, known as SIS II, and I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate him personally on the initiative that he put forward for the hearing on 6 October in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on this matter, because this hearing directly reflects his concern to give the citizens detailed and clear explanations of the usefulness of the work that has been undertaken on the Schengen Information System, with which the Commission fully agrees. I should like to reiterate the fact that the Schengen Information System is a key instrument for the principle of abolishing internal border controls and that, naturally, its development and day-to-day running must take place with scrupulous regard for the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the issue that the rapporteur raised, concerning the nature of the Schengen Information System, I should like to recall that, since the very beginning, police authorities have been authorised users of the System, in particular in the context of their monitoring activities within EU territory. The Schengen Information System must now, however, be set in a different context – the context in which it came into existence. Initially, the system was designed as a measure of compensation for the abolition of internal borders, set in a clearly intergovernmental framework. Since the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis </span>was integrated into the European Union, the Schengen Information System has been central to the area of freedom, security and justice. The acceptance of the United Kingdom and Ireland’s partial participation in the Schengen system without these countries abolishing controls at their borders confirms this development. The Spanish initiatives to extend the functions of the existing system and which provide for Europol and Eurojust having access to some of the system’s data – I stress, to some of the system’s data - also form part of this development.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards SIS II, the Council has to date confined itself to accepting its existing functions and to providing broad guidelines on new functions. The debate on precisely what new functions of the system will be implemented in order to enhance its effectiveness and whether these will further alter the nature of the existing system is still to take place. I therefore welcome the fact that Parliament wishes to play an active role in this crucial debate, which must be as transparent and wide-ranging as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As you all know, the Commission was given the mandate to develop SIS II, but the current Schengen Information System, known as SIS I+, is managed by France, under the terms of Article°92 of the Schengen Convention, and does not, therefore, fall within the sphere of the Commission’s competence. Mr Coelho’s report on SIS II is based on the Commission’s work to develop this new generation, and the Commission has given a commitment to adopt, in the near future, a new communication to Parliament and the Council detailing the state of the work on developing SIS II in the first quarter of 2003, as well as the important issue the rapporteur highlighted, concerning the technical synergies that will be possible with the future visa information system, known as ‘VIS’. To give you a brief overview of the work that has been undertaken, I should like to remind you that the results of the feasibility study conducted by the Commission were immediately conveyed to Parliament, in the Spring of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently, the project to develop SIS II is at the stage of publishing the call for tender. The Commission services have spent the last few months drawing up the specifications for this tender in close cooperation with the Member States and have kept the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs informed on a regular basis. In his report, Mr Coelho highlights the fundamental challenges in terms of data protection and the importance of involving the authorities responsible for data protection in the development of SIS II. The Commission is fully aware of these challenges, both as regards the system’s development, and concerning the preparation of its legal base. This legal base will include rules on data protection that will also cover access by private individuals. The Commission is also holding regular and intensive meetings with the Joint Supervisory Authority, and has included specifications on data protection in the tender.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Coelho’s report refers specifically to the need to harmonise the principles of data protection. Although this call for harmonisation goes beyond the issue of SIS II, the Commission intends, in the course of next year, 2004, to propose a legal instrument on rules for the protection of personal data under the third pillar. I therefore wish, once again, to emphasise the importance the Commission attaches to Parliament’s full involvement in the debates that will take place, which I hope will be as transparent as possible, and to which this report will certainly make a decisive contribution. I hope that this report wins the support of this House, </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">SIS I was set up as a compensatory measure to allow free movement of people, but, in recent years, it has started to be seen more as an instrument, which is also useful in terms of police cooperation. The data from SIS II and SIS I can, in other words, now become a useful resource for purposes other than those initially intended. Furthermore, the enlargement of the European Union means that it is necessary to develop a second generation information system by 2006. Consequently, the Council framework decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States also provides for recourse to the SIS and, therefore, for the need for it to be updated in due time.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of all this, it is necessary for the Council to promote a public debate on the nature of SIS and on the political objectives to be achieved with SIS II to ensure that the development of this system takes place in a transparent and democratic way. An assessment will, of course, be made on respect for fundamental rights, and it will therefore be necessary to entrust the strategic management of this and other information systems to an extremely reliable European agency: an agency run by an administrative board composed of representatives of the European institutions and the Member States; an agency that is, moreover, financed by the European Union budget and, therefore, subject to Parliament’s control. A swift decision is therefore needed by the SIS centre on the location, if possible the definitive location. In addition to this, a study needs to be carried out on the possibility of amalgamating the various databases that exist today or will be launched in the coming months and years – the SIS banks, Europol, VIS, Eurojust and so on – on the basis of a single technical platform, in order to create a comprehensive, integrated information system across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, a great deal of attention needs to be paid to the potential implications of a system of this kind for privacy, human rights and the risks involved in including biometric data. Citizens should, therefore, be well informed so that nasty surprises are avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude with a point which could seem somewhat out of place, relating to the immigration emergency. Everyone can see that the illegal entry of immigrants into the Union’s area of free movement calls precisely for SIS II to carry out an unexpected role: a role of managing data and security that was not conceivable when the first generation Schengen Information System was launched. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, however, gradually becoming an instrument of police cooperation, because the Council is seeking progressively to confer new functions on it and to allow various authorities to access its database.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Schengen Joint Supervisory Authority states, the proposals to develop the SIS and the creation of SIS II constitute a sea-change in the nature of the system itself: whereas the SIS only alerts the relevant authorities in the event that an individual, whose details are on file, crosses the Schengen border, SIS II will probably become a multifunctional research tool. This would represent a shift from an approach of reactive security to an approach of active security.</p>
<p class="contents">The prospect of a new system that would enable the authorities to share information on millions of individuals for different purposes, probably using the most advanced technologies including biometric data analysis, forces us to consider the impact that this new system could have on citizens’ rights, freedoms and guarantees. In particular, the right to the protection of personal data recently confirmed in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and integrated into the draft European Constitution drawn up by the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the need to improve cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs and, in particular, the linking and cross-referencing of information between different databases is one of the objectives of the European Union that the Member States are obliged to pursue. We all understand the need for efficient information systems that are capable of meeting the challenges laid down for us by international terrorism and by cross-border crime, but this action must never endanger the fundamental principles on which the Union is founded as a Community ruled by law. The balance between privacy and security must not be altered by adopting information and communication technologies that have been created by governments as a response to the increased risks posed by new and dangerous criminal phenomena. When the available technologies constitute a threat to the integrity of personal information that should be protected, we are obliged to adopt appropriate legislation that provides for any potential abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mr Coelho, and I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate him, contains a set of proposals that move broadly in the right direction: the need for a genuine public debate on the objectives of SIS II; the need to develop SIS II in a democratic and transparent way, enabling the citizens to access more information about the system and giving people whose personal data are kept on the system to access and correct this data; merging the various existing databases, which will enable us to create a coherent and comprehensive data protection system, which will enable detailed analysis; new authorisations for granting access to the SIS to new authorities; the creation of a European Agency for the Strategic Management of the SIS, monitored and subject to control by the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we have here is a non-binding recommendation in an area outside Parliament’s competence. This lack of real significance is in sharp contrast, however, to the importance of the underlying subject. The subject is frighteningly important. It has to do with nothing less than national, supranational and international police authorities’ uncontrolled use of the information and monitoring systems forming part of what is termed the second generation Schengen Information System, known as SIS II. I am able to say that George Orwell’s nightmare visions of Big Brother pale in comparison with this state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The systems are to a large extent secret, particularly for those implicated. Evermore extended use is being made, officially and unofficially, of the information collected. In reality, there is no democratic, parliamentary and judicial control. The original rationale behind the Schengen Information System, or what was known as SIS I – namely nothing more nor less than the securing of border controls – has long since been replaced by an ambition to collect police information in the broad sense of the term. Involving more and more information on more and more subjects, the Schengen Information System, or SIS, and, for that matter, Sirene are outside the domain of the law and not subject to controls. I am unfamiliar with my fellow MEP’s, Mr Coelho’s, background and motives. I have no reason to doubt his concerns. What I contest is the realism and usefulness of the proposals. I am more in agreement with the premises of the minority statement which, in my purely personal opinion, should have emphasised still more strongly that we are not concerned here with the mere dangers of misuse and of a legal vacuum. The misuse of such a legal vacuum is an almost inevitable consequence of the police state factors that are already present and that have been approved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is, therefore, a gradual shift from compensatory instrument for free movement to an instrument for police cooperation. Instead, I will use my speaking time to simply ask you for a Christmas present: for you to bring us, by Christmas, a nice chart including an exhaustive list of the data that has been handled and the way in which it has been handled within all of these data bases, the categories of data, the legal basis, the method of handling each type of data, the rights of the individual to access and correct data regarding them and abuses concerning them, and the method used for each type of data for transfer outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I do not know if I am particularly inattentive or incompetent on this subject, but I have not yet succeeded in finding a source, a document, which indicates what data has been transferred, how, where and according to what rules.

We refuse to approve this electronic database for personal information, a system which the author wishes to update, since it is a tool of police repression, and we reject even more the policy which this tool is intended to serve.</p>
<p class="contents">The States for whom the fight against terrorism serves as a universal justification want this database to receive supplementary data and to be combined with the system managing visas. The ability to consult it would be extended to judicial authorities which have not so far had access to it. This tool of repression is drawn up personally against migrant workers, preventing them from coming to the European Union while at the same time threatening the freedom of everybody. To spend millions of euros on sophisticated surveillance equipment and on a system for sharing information on people who crossed a border which was open to them and which is now being slammed in their faces is scandalous. This is the way to create and perpetuate the dramatic situations in which unscrupulous smugglers prosper.</p>
<p class="contents">We are opposed to the policy of a fortress Europe, surrounded by barbed wire, whether electronic or simply legal. This is a retrograde, reactionary and inhuman policy. The destiny of the peoples of the south of the European Union has forever been linked to that of the people of the other side of the Mediterranean, from Morocco to Egypt. The populations of the new member countries of the east of Europe have thousands of links with the populations of the countries of the ex-Soviet Union. To restrict the freedom of movement between the European Union and the neighbouring countries is a cruel blow against these people. We reject it and we will vote against. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To an overwhelming extent, most of the personal data stored in the present-day SIS relates to people who have been refused entry into the EU. The development of a second-generation SIS is not just, though, about building up its storage capacity and fortifying the new borders in the East; what is even worse is that its operations are being extended by the introduction of new database categories and search options, the aim being to facilitate the use of SIS II for manhunts. This amounts to a fundamental change in the database’s character.</p>
<p class="contents">What was a racist index of persons barred from entering the EU is becoming a powerful instrument in the hands of the state’s apparatus of repression, enabling it to track people down. This SIS is the first satellite in Europe’s ‘star wars’ programme to monitor immigration; we can reject it and, for that reason, we must. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To be honest, however, I do not think that demonising the Schengen Information System is the best strategy, but everyone is responsible for his or her own political positions. What I would say to you quite clearly is that the Schengen Information System is essentially a system for managing the European Union’s external border and that this is a prerequisite for safeguarding freedom of movement within the European area. Consequently, if we wish to continue to guarantee the principle of abolishing our internal borders, we must be able to assume our responsibilities by better monitoring the external borders. This issue does not only concern entering and leaving European Union territory; it also concerns guaranteeing security within the EU. The political option that I wish to reiterate here is of a different nature.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the crucial issue facing us consists of recognising the advantages of the Schengen Information System. I have a Christmas present for Mr Cappato, but this is not it. I have something else to give, but <span class="italic">aspettiamo per Natale</span> [let us wait for Christmas], because this would be a less exciting present. No, it is something else. On the issue that Mr Cappato raised, I wish to say two things: first of all, there are no plans for any form of transfer of data from the Schengen Information System to third countries. Access to the Schengen database is reserved exclusively for the Member States of the European Union. As regards the type of data to be included in the system, I believe I answered this point in my speech when I said that the debate on what specific data is to be included in the system is yet to take place. We conducted a feasibility study, which we forwarded to the European Parliament, identifying the requests made to us by Member States. The proper identification of this data has not yet taken place and the Commission is currently preparing a communication that it will publish by the end of the year, in which we will make an assessment of the state of the current debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand people’s doubts and fears, but I do wish to say one thing: there is a considerable difference between the fact that I, as Commissioner, am talking to you here about the Schengen Information System II and the fact that, in relation to the first system, there was no Commissioner to give an answer here, about what was being done. There is a considerable difference between that situation and the fact that I am standing here telling you that the Commission will present a proposal to harmonise the control and protection of personal data under the third pillar and that there must be democratic and judicial control of the system’s workings. Therein lies the difference between the first and the second Schengen Information Systems and this difference has only been possible precisely because the system has been integrated into the entire Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>, with the support of this Parliament on which, incidentally, I hope I will be able to count for a favourable vote on Mr Coelho’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
