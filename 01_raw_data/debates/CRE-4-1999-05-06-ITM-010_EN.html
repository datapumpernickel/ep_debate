You know that there are personal reasons why I am addressing these words to you. We are, if you like, opponents and competitors in politics, since we both come from the Aachen region. You were mayor of that important European city for 16 years and alongside that a Member of the European Parliament for 20 years. I was mayor of Aachen"s smaller neighbour for just a few years, and we did our best to get our hands on your trade tax by stealing your biggest factories. However, this has not affected our friendship or the work we have done together for Europe. I think I can say on behalf of many in my group that you have been one of the most honourable and reliable Europeans in this House. Many thanks for all your work!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Schmid report deals with an extremely sensitive subject – the modern communications society on the threshold of the 21st century. People value their privacy, and every democratic country has legislation which protects its citizens against arbitrary State interference in their private lives. This is why the police are only allowed to tap telephones or intercept faxes and letters under lawful conditions, and then only in certain strictly limited cases and only with a court order. The conditions for such activities are regulated under national law, and rightly so.</p>
<p class="contents">This draft Council Resolution on the lawful interception of telecommunications does not interfere with national law here, since whether we like it or not, resolutions under the third pillar have this somewhat circumscribed nature. In future, under the Amsterdam Treaty, it will be more accurate to call them ‘common positions", but they will still have no binding legal force. They simply indicate that the Member States have agreed on a common course of action. A resolution was used in 1995 to agree what interception meant in the technical sense, such as whether only the content of a telephone conversation should be recorded, or the time and the recipient"s telephone number as well.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two reasons for having these telephone and fax agreements between the Member States. Setting up interception facilities involves costs for the system operator, but in the single market the level of costs must be similar everywhere if distortions of competition are to be avoided. So one country cannot impose costs on its operators which are not charged in other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in the case of cross‐border requests for legal assistance, we need to be clear about what interception actually means. The draft resolution before us extends the scope of the agreement to include mobile telephones and Internet communications. This is an extremely sensitive area. It is a logical extension because it will protect people"s privacy, but it does not mean that we are protecting a particular technical communication medium. The two must be clearly distinguished.</p>
<p class="contents">There is opposition to these agreements and the planned procedures, which is very interesting and is worth looking at more closely. There are some Internet freaks who are very concerned that we are trying to interfere with their freedom to communicate and think that free communication is under threat. They need to realise that the Internet is not outside the law, and that in a democratic society there cannot be any areas where people can just do what they like. I was Parliament"s rapporteur for the establishment of joint measures to combat child pornography, and I can tell you that what is happening on the Internet cries out for some form of regulation, however hard it might be to put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Internet service providers also have some misgivings because of the costs involved. We have included an amendment in the report to answer these concerns. There is also no fixed timetable for implementation, which is a weak point. There is opposition too from those with an interest in money laundering and tax evasion. The draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights, Mr Florio, has expressed such misgivings. He has been good enough to air the concern that regulations on interception might also be applied to bank transactions on the Internet. The ‘<span class="italic">Handelsblatt</span> ", which is hardly what you would call a Socialist newspaper, wrote last December, and I quote, ‘The Internet is the ideal medium for tax evasion. A firm called Privacy Solutions is openly advertising itself on the Internet with the following words: ‘Your office is in cyberspace, the tax authorities will never find you!’" People have a civil right to protect their privacy, but there is no civil right to crime, money laundering or tax evasion!</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who totally rejects the lawful interception of modern communications, which we have heard many speakers do, is simply aiding and abetting criminals, albeit unintentionally. However difficult it may be to translate joint agreements into practical action, it is absolutely essential that we should recognise that the freedom which the new telecommunications give us is still something that is open to abuse. This is an appeal to the sense of responsibility of those able to take advantage of this freedom, but it is also a challenge to the national authorities to find intelligent ways of stopping these freedoms from being abused, which is harmful to the public interest and creates particular problems for the tax system and the collection of taxes. My colleague Mr Schmid has tried to contribute to these efforts in this report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cederschiöld </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, the interception of telecommunications is a sensitive matter, since it touches upon the personal integrity of ordinary people. We are engaged in the eternal process of finding the right balance between safeguarding that integrity and combating crime. Nobody wishes to see Orwell"s Big Brother take over, but nor do we want to expose the public to uncontrollable levels of crime. The current exercise is simply a matter of updating an existing resolution on telecommunications interception, bringing it into line with modem technology. This is a very low‐key text from the legislative point of view. National legislation is not infringed upon; Member States implement the provisions only if they so wish, and in the way they choose.</p>
<p class="contents">The State has a duty to fight crime committed within its borders. It bears responsibility for anti‐crime measures and supports the cost. This applies in the United States as well. Costs arising in connection with the interception of telecommunications are currently borne by the State, and should continue to be so. This is especially relevant at a time like now when telephony markets are being privatised. Increased costs would make life harder for small Internet providers, undermining Europe"s competitive edge. Internet providers can, after all, set up anywhere in the world; we do not want rising costs to drive them out of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Success on the advanced technology front is vital for Europe"s development. We cannot afford any deterioration in the growth potential of the IT industry. There is currently scope for expansion in the sector, particularly for small and medium‐sized companies. They are the ones that would suffer if they had to bear the costs of generalised data storage.</p>
<p class="contents">Personal integrity must be at the forefront of any debate on anti‐crime measures. Sophisticated data inspection requirements offer one solution. Equally, we will need a preventive strategy to stop the Internet from becoming a playground for criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">Across‐the‐board storage of information naturally puts us in mind of Orwell. If the State takes charge of the costs, however, we will have some degree of assurance that only such information as is absolutely necessary will be saved. There must be a decision from a court; the exact nature of the information required will need to be specified; this data must of course only be used if there is suspicion that a very serious crime has been committed; and no action should be taken on statements from informers. This whole area is rightly regulated in an extremely strict way in almost all countries. I can therefore see no reason why Parliament should seek to block this move. On the contrary, we in this House need to demonstrate that we can perform the balancing act required and contribute towards an unfettered information society, without allowing the Internet to become a vehicle for crime. Mr Schulz has warned us about that. So, in the interest of combating crime, I would commend this proposal.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McKenna </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – The EU FBI telecommunications surveillance system is developing rapidly through two separate but very linked initiatives. First, the Council has proposed a new draft Council resolution to extend the 1995 requirements resolution to cover new technologies, the Internet and satellite‐based telecommunications. And, second, the Council is on the verge of agreeing a formula to provide a legal base for remote access to a satellite ground station in Italy through a new clause in the draft convention on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters.</p>
<p class="contents">This draft convention will provide the legal framework for the interception of all forms of telecommunications in the EU which is required to put into effect the EU FBI surveillance system. Both measures are expected to be agreed at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 27 to 28 May.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are discussing here today, in the version discussed in the European Parliament, amends the 1995 requirements to include data on Internet users such as IP address, electronic address assigned to a party, account number and e‐mail address (ENFOPOL 10951/98 REV2).</p>
<p class="contents">That has actually been changed. What we are discussing now is not the actual wording, because what it says instead is: ‘IP address" and instead of ‘account number" it says ‘credit card number and e‐mail address".</p>
<p class="contents">It is very disturbing that an issue like this is being discussed on a Thursday evening when there are very few people here, the vote will be tomorrow morning, and there has been no proper debate within national parliaments on this issue. There has definitely been no debate within the Irish Parliament and I do not think there has been debate within many of the other parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is possible to monitor communications in such a manner you will be able to tell where a person is, when they are there, what sites they are consulting, what electronic messages they are sending, what electronic payments they are making, basically you will know everything about a person's private life.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greens believe that this is a serious attack on privacy and there are not sufficient safeguards regarding data protection and democratic control. This is something that was actually brought up by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which was very critical of this. It is unfortunate that the draftsperson of the opinion is not here because it is extremely important that this point is stressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Rules on telephone tapping are controlled, for example, at national level. That follows very proper procedures and authorisation. This proposal here basically ignores the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the provision on the protection of private life in Article 8. These are being overwritten here and interference by a public authority should be subject to extremely strict conditions. The view of the Committee on Legal Affairs should be taken on board.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point I wanted to make is that this whole issue was discussed in a procedure which was a written procedure, not in a meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers. This issue has not, as far as I am concerned, followed the proper democratic procedures. It has not been discussed in national parliaments. I also feel it is very sinister that this issue is put on the agenda on the Thursday night when everyone is going back to campaign for the election. There is absolutely nobody here to listen to what is going on. This is a grave step against people's right to privacy and right to freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">It has always been the case in Member States throughout the European Union and right around the world that oppressive legislation is brought in using the argument that we have to combat serious crime. For example one of the speakers mentioned paedophilia and things like that on the Internet. That does not mean that you overwrite people's basic right to privacy. That is what is going on here. There needs to be a lot more debate about this, not just here in the European Parliament but in national parliaments. I would like to know why these issues have been railroaded through in such a fashion without proper democratic control and proper public debate.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Nassauer </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, lades and gentlemen, the mere mention of the idea of telephone tapping is enough to get the relevant circles talking about a police state and ‘Big Brother", just like Pavlov"s dogs. What the Legal Affairs Committee has given us here is the sort of arrant nonsense that you might expect to hear from a first‐year student, but from the second year onwards you would have to call it out‐and‐out troublemaking. Mr Schulz pointed out quite rightly, and Mr Schmid wrote, that this Council recommendation makes absolutely no difference whatsoever to the legal situation in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal conditions for telephone tapping and for monitoring Internet access will still, even after this resolution, lie solely in the hands of the national legislator. The resolution simply aims to harmonise the technical standards, which we need to do in order to use telephone tapping to prevent organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you an example. Virtual bank accounts can be used to collect extortion money: a blackmailer sets up a virtual bank account and has the money paid into it, and if access cannot be monitored, he cannot be held responsible or brought to account. This is why it is absolutely vital that these measures are taken now. The Council has made a recommendation, and we have a resolution before us that is essential if we are to combat organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States will certainly introduce all the constitutional requirements that are needed to register something as sensitive as telephone tapping or Internet monitoring. But we need to make provision for ways of combating organised crime.</p>

Mr Schmid, for whom I am deputising, has not stayed away deliberately. His report was actually on the agenda for this morning, and this afternoon he had a private appointment, not a political one, that he could not put off. I apologise on his behalf, and I would assume that Mrs McKenna criticised his absence simply because she did not know the reasons for it.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is one that I simply have to reject. The committee responsible here in the House is called the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs. No other parliament in the world, I think, devotes as much care and attention as ours does to basic and human rights if there is any question of interference with civil liberties in the construction of a European legal area. You know, Mrs McKenna, that as well as being the spokesman on internal affairs for my group I am also the vice‐chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights. I categorically reject the claim that the careful work which we are doing – whether it is Mr Nassauer, myself or Mr Schmid – is designed to railroad something through that goes against the guarantees of basic rights enjoyed by individuals in the European Union. I have to say that I think these are rather harsh allegations, and because I value you as a colleague I would ask you to consider carefully in future whether you can substantiate them.</p>

I was not criticising Mr Schmid for not being here. I did not mention his name. I was talking about Mr Florio because he was the draftsman of the opinion in the Committee on Legal Affairs. The Committee on Legal Affairs has the opposite view to the Committee on Civil Liberties.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission shares Parliament"s opinion of the importance of this issue, particularly since in Europe the telecommunications world is constantly undergoing rapid and revolutionary changes.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, we must take into account the logical concerns of the police authorities. The development of Internet telecommunications must not affect the Member States" ability to fight crime and maintain national security. On the other hand, we are seeing a significant increase in telecommunications services and, in particular, Internet services. Information technology companies already account for more than 5 % of the European Union"s gross domestic product. They provide employment for more than four million people and they create more new jobs than any other sector of the European Union"s economy. As a result, the Union is obviously extremely keen to remain at the forefront in this age of information.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, if this sector is to continue to expand, it is essential that we are able to ensure that users trust the telecommunication services. The European Commission therefore believes that it is vital to maintain an appropriate balance between the interests at stake. In our opinion, this can only be achieved through open dialogue between the police authorities, the operators and the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">As highlighted in both Mr Schmid"s report and the opinion by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights, there is a series of aspects that must be addressed in more detail. We thus need to clarify issues such as operators" liability as well as privacy in telecommunications.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should like to begin a broad debate on the necessary requirements and on the way in which these can be met in as beneficial a way as possible. This debate could lead to the Commission making full use of the new opportunities provided by the Amsterdam Treaty and submitting proposals on this issue. Only in this way will we be able to protect the development of the information society.</p>
