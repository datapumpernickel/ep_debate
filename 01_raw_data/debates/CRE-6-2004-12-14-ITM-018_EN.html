I see Mr Jørgensen is here, and I want to pass some comments about the way this Parliament has worked. Mr Jørgensen came in very late on, because he is a new Member. My Liberal, Socialist and Green colleagues have worked very closely together on this report. I thank them, because it left me in a position of great strength when it came to negotiating with the Council, and that is a position all of us in this august House aim for in order to be able to put our points forward.</p>
<p class="contents">What is this report about? The idea was to put in place a central harmonised system for the control of certain types of chemicals and fix levels of MRLs – maximum residue levels – of chemicals in foodstuffs. The one thing that has not escaped me, but may well have escaped other Members, is that this is a forerunner of the REACH Directive, which will be one of the biggest reports to come through Parliament. If they can handle it in the way that we handled it – I say 'we' because all our colleagues, as I said earlier, worked together – then we shall be in an extremely strong position.</p>
<p class="contents">What does it mean to consumers, the people who will be affected by this legislation? It means safer food across Europe; it means that if you buy a tomato in Ireland that has come from Spain you can guarantee the quality and safety of that product. It provides a guarantee that British lamb sold – dare I say – to the French is safe. That is extremely important for the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">We have included a number of recommendations where, for instance, food is tested at the point of sale, which we have all agreed on. However, we also agreed that imports need to be of the same level of quality. This is important for people who import into the European Union. The levels of pesticides have to be of the same standard – not that they necessarily were or were not; but it is important that we get that message across for people who come into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall mention briefly some things we fought over and had great debates about. Good agricultural practices – GAP – was a difficult issue, but we got a definition with the help of the Commission, which I am delighted to see here today. Our colleagues worked closely with the Commission and, as I said, the Council. This is very important in setting a precedent for the future, so that we know exactly what good agricultural practices are.</p>
<p class="contents">It was somewhat difficult to get a position on synergistic effects, but we now have a situation where we know exactly where we are going to be with those effects. For those who do not know, synergistic effects are a mixture of chemicals possibly used on a crop, and there is no particular definition of how they are traceable. We have put in place legislation which will work in the future. It has left a position open for future Member States to be able to define exactly what the situation is on synergistic effects.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned about how governments will implement this – because it is a regulation and therefore has to be implemented. I read recently in a paper that governments tend to gold-plate things. It is important, when we are pushing this through, that governments do not gold-plate it: we want an equal footing.</p>
<p class="contents">It is interesting that the British Minister of Agriculture, Mrs Beckett, has said that she will decide when farmers can go into the field, or when it is too wet or has been raining. I wonder exactly how she is going to do that. Nevertheless, it is important that we do not place governments or countries at a disadvantage compared to other Member States. That is why this legislation has been put in place. It is workable, it is a good regulation. Just in case the joint resolutions we have agreed do not go through, the PPE-DE Group has covered itself; but I expect all the joint amendments to be adopted tomorrow. I look forward to seeing Member States implementing and working well with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The negotiations between Council presidency, the European Parliament rapporteurs and the Commission have recently gained momentum and last week the final obstacles were cleared.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to underline the significance of these regulations for food safety. It will enable us to set harmonised maximum residue levels in the EU for all pesticides and all agricultural products in one piece of legislation directly applicable to all EU citizens. All situations will be covered, including a list of pesticides for which no maximum residue levels are required and the low level that will apply systematically to all pesticides for which we have no information. There will be clarity about how and to whom an MRL application should be made, and on the procedure to be followed. The European Food Safety Authority will carry out the risk assessment for consumers with the best available methodology. Control and enforcement by the Member States will be reinforced and improved. Coordination of monitoring by the Commission will have a more obligatory nature.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislation will benefit all parties. Consumers will profit from better protection and more transparency about which pesticides could be present in food and their potential effects. Food producers will benefit because there will be more clarity as to what specifications the products have to comply with. Control and enforcement bodies will be able to refer to one single Community list of maximum residue levels. Member State legislators will no longer need to transpose the provisions into national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I finish, I would like to make a few comments on the finer points resolved in the negotiations. The European Parliament's insistence on taking cumulative and synergistic effects into account may lead to a breakthrough in the development and application of the necessary methodology. I am pleased that this is now explicitly mentioned in the draft legislation. I welcome Parliament's determination to make an explicit link between the setting of maximum residue levels and good agricultural practice, integrated pest management and the use of the lowest amounts of pesticides necessary. The clear requirement to take into account vulnerable groups of the population, including children and unborn children, is also a useful step forward. These issues make a positive contribution to this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The final phase of the negotiations saw an increasing mutual trust among the parties. I am happy to confirm that the Commission can agree to and accept the compromise package worked out between the three institutions. I trust that you will confirm Parliament's acceptance at the vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now approaching the conclusion of this project. It is time to acknowledge the efforts of all parties and in particular to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sturdy, for his handling of this dossier and for the time and effort he has put into his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not just about food safety and health, but also about equal opportunities in competing in the internal market and – let us not forget – on the global market. Producers and processors must operate under identical conditions, and all consumers are entitled to safe food.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Food Safety Authority has great responsibility where risk management is concerned. It is no use whatever to consumers to get, week in and week out, one new warning after another, sometimes petering out into such generalisations as the statement that, for example, apples from a particular Member State are exceeding the maximum permitted levels, when such announcements are helpful only if they include the name of the company whose products contain excessive residues of pesticides. We are setting very high standards right across the EU, particularly where health is concerned, and quite rightly too.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, though, we have to look more closely at imports into the European Union. There is no room for double standards here, and what that means – as I see it – is tighter controls on imported goods. We cannot intervene in their production processes in the way we can with the food produced here, and that makes it all the more important that the end market be checked and monitored. I am glad that the committee was able to come up with a compromise on the definition of ‘good agricultural practice’. Europe’s farmers produce in accordance with the most stringent legal requirements, as is best known in the case of the rules on cross-compliance. Those who farm in accordance with the law must also be certain that their products pose no health hazard.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to Mr Sturdy for the work he has done over many months, and for the good compromise that we have been able to reach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that our cooperation has been constructive and has proceeded in a pleasant and open atmosphere. I should like to thank the other ‘shadow rapporteurs’, and I should also like to thank the Commission and the Council for the sound guidance and advice we have received. I am pleased that I have been allowed to deliver my first speech here in plenary on a matter as important as this. In actual fact, I see this draft Act or legislation as an example of the EU at its best. We shall secure a number of things with this draft Act if it is adopted in the form in which we should like to have it adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, cross-border trade is of course ensured. A variety of foods is guaranteed, as is their presence on the shelves at lower prices. Other, still more important, things are, however, also ensured, namely consumers’ health, safety and security in connection with the foods they buy.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from a very cold country up in the north, so I am pleased to be able to buy fruit and vegetables in the winter too. I am only pleased, however, if I can be sure that the apple I eat is also healthy, and this is something that this legislation can help ensure. I shall mention a couple of the areas it has been especially important for us Social Democrats to see successfully dealt with and in which I think we have achieved compromises with which everyone can be satisfied.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I want to mention the consideration given to especially vulnerable groups. It is one thing to devise legislation with a view to robust, healthy and vigorous men such as Mr Sturdy and myself. That is fine, of course. There also needs, however, to be legislation with a view to more vulnerable groups such as children, born and as yet unborn. That too is something, I am pleased to say, that we have obtained.</p>
<p class="contents">Another thing I would emphasise – and I would now apologise to the interpreters for they are about to be confronted by difficult expressions again – is that we have incorporated cumulative effects that are the result of synergy. That is extremely important. It sounds a little technical, but in reality it is quite simple. The fact is, it is not enough only to take account of how poisonous or non-poisonous a pesticide is. We must also take account of how poisonous or non-poisonous two or three or four pesticides are when they interact, that is to say when they react to each other in a particular food. That is something it is incredibly important to take account of. It is an area about which we do not know much at present, but one about which we need to know more in the future and of which we must take more account. Otherwise, there may be major consequences in terms of health. I fear that that is already now the case.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that it is all well and good to have controls and legislation, but we also need to ensure that there are sanctions. I think that naming and shaming is a sensible idea. I think it is sensible of us now to oblige the Member States to publish their control results on the Internet. It also brings about openness, which in turn produces security. The consumer must have peace of mind, and that is something we are in this way guaranteeing.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and finally, I think it encouraging that we have obtained some clear and constructive definitions, including definitions of good agricultural practice and an actual definition of maximum limit values. These were not easy things to negotiate successfully but, especially through sound guidance from the Council and the Commission, we obtained a compromise with which everyone can be pleased and which will help secure our objectives. I would say that, all in all, this is a proposal that may make a positive difference to the everyday life of Europeans, and that is something I am pleased about and proud to be associated with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is incredibly important for all our voters in our various constituencies, but it is particularly important perhaps for parents with allergic children.</p>
<p class="contents">Our amendments are in line with what I and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe think is reasonable for bringing about a proposal that is effective from the points of view both of competition and of consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise a few things. The internal market is incredibly important. In this internal market, we wish to protect our citizens and, at the same time, set standards for testing and treating food at those links in the chain where the food concerned first comes into contact with the consumer and first enters the distribution chain. In this respect, this proposal is sound. It is also sound inasmuch as it protects important and vulnerable high-risk groups such as women, infants and unborn children.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also adopting a position on a standard for good agricultural practice. In this, we have taken account both of integrated pest control and of climate variations in order to bring about a fairer proposal. It is incredibly important that these options for taking account of local or regional variations should not reduce the proposal’s level of ambition. This is something that has to be considered in connection with the practical application of the proposal, once it has properly entered into force.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good that there have been improvements to the Food Safety Authority in terms of both time and resources. I also think that the rapporteur has done a very good job. I am pleased that we have been able to make it easier for civil society and the non-governmental organisations to participate in the discussion and handling of these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a pity that once again in this Parliament legislation is left until the end of the day.</p>
<p class="contents">In a recent opinion poll 77 per cent of British people said that they are concerned about pesticides in food so, as everyone has said, what we are doing here resonates with public opinion. I am very pleased that we have a compromise and that we agree on the main things.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two issues which particularly concern me and I am very pleased that we have secured a deal on them. The first is cumulative and synergistic effects: cocktail effects. We were told that there is no methodology at present to measure this effect but this is an effect which research suggests is at the root of our problems. I am very pleased to hear the Commissioner say that he is going to take this research forward and support Parliament in making sure that we get more research into the cumulative effects. That is why I tabled the amendment to recital 5. One problem is that a lot of experts say that these cumulative effects are unfounded, but we have nothing to prove or disprove this. We must get this research, it is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue mentioned by Mr Jørgensen is about the effects on children and the unborn. A lot of research suggests that children and the unborn have in some way been affected by either pesticides or chemicals in our environment. In a recent radio programme about chemicals they did a series of tests on a grandmother, a mother, and a granddaughter. These tests showed that the highest level of chemicals was found not in the grandmother – who had lived through the highest levels of pollution in our streets in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s – but in the granddaughter who was 15 years old. They found in her blood chemicals that had been taken off our shelves many years beforehand. We know that some of these substances come in through pesticides. It is extremely important that we start looking not just at testing on adults but at testing on children and looking at the effects on babies in the womb.</p>
<p class="contents">Public confidence in food safety and food standards is very low. In the survey that I referred to earlier, over 50 % of British people said they did not believe that government reassurances about pesticides were accurate. Consequently we need to get it right. Scientific research shows that imported products have more pesticides than products grown within the EU. This is extremely important legislation. I am very grateful to Mr Sturdy, Mr Jørgensen and all those within the Commission and the Council who worked very hard to achieve a compromise that we can all support tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
