<p class="contents">I would like to clarify why we have made this request. With the entry into force of the agreement and the signing of the quota system, many developing countries which have turned textile and clothing manufacturing into one of their major economic resources, will have to contend with a social and economic disaster, a drastic restructuring which will also affect economically dominant countries such as ours.</p>
<p class="contents">More than 60 countries may be cut out of the market to make room for the giant China, whose competitiveness is not only based on low wages – they are far lower in Vietnam and Cambodia – but also on more advanced factories and a steadily improving transport network. According to some estimates, China will secure 50% of the United States’ clothing market and 29% of that of Europe, followed by India in second place.</p>
<p class="contents">It could be argued that eliminating a complex quota system and preferential treatments would chiefly benefit the industries of developing countries. Market liberalisation, however, directly favours the largest manufacturers and not developing countries. Let me repeat that trade is one instrument, but it cannot and will not resolve the development problem, as is clear from the liberalisation of the sugar and banana sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent country reports on textile industry exports show a negative economic and social impact in these countries. It is a known fact that the producer countries are moving towards areas where labour costs are much lower, with the consequent severe exploitation of manpower and social dumping issues rather than guaranteed minimum standards.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to stay competitive, many countries, such as the Philippines or Bangladesh, make working conditions worse by doing away with worker’s rights. The contradictions which have emerged from this work represent a challenge as to how we can, on the one hand, play our part so as not to ruin these economies while ensuring, on the other, that our countries’ economies as well can be evaluated differently. We have also asked, therefore, which instruments should be put into effect in order to prevent such contradictions from being so hard-hitting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We wish to draw attention to a new situation that has arisen, bringing with it a dramatic change in the pattern of world trade. I refer to the end of the transitional period for the ATC Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. This was a period of ten years, after which quotas would cease to exist, which was what happened on 1 January 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">A new situation has therefore arisen. Mrs Morgantini referred to a Copernican change in at least 59 counties that had quotas with the European Union. This has resulted in a redistribution of world trade, with implications for employment and economic activity the world over, not only as regards the European Union or the United States, but also within the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The textile and clothing industry is constantly restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">There is at least one factory of this kind in every constituency represented by Members of this House. In total, there are over 100 000 small and medium-sized enterprises in this sector, employing more than two million people.</p>
<p class="contents">A major transitional policy must therefore be considered, and I am sorry Commissioner Mandelson is not in the House today. The Commissioner happens to be in Beijing, and I must emphasise that there are a number of reasons why serious discussions with our Chinese colleagues and partners are called for in the Doha Round. China cannot simply retain 50% of the world market. China is the lead country in terms of ownership of US Treasury Bonds, a major financial power, a technological power and a Member of the Security Council. Consequently, as far as trade is concerned, China is also bound to abide by the principles of respect for intellectual property, competitiveness and trade as laid down by the WTO. This is one of the issues that must be discussed with China.</p>
<p class="contents">The House needs to be informed of the measures the Commission intends to propose, following the meeting of the High Level Group on textiles and clothing, in order to ensure an ordered transition within this key sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmit,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mrs Morgantini, Mr Barón Crespo, I think that the question you have asked is actually not unrelated to the debate we have just had. If there is one sector that is in the avant-garde of globalisation, as it were, it is the textiles sector. For decades now we have been noticing the extent to which the international division of labour has changed in the textiles sector in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, you raise some important issues that affect not only Europe but also its partners, especially those on the southern shores of the Mediterranean, as demonstrated by this morning's debate on the constant development of production and the delocalisation of textiles manufacturing. I think this is a very important issue. In addition, the Council has in recent years continuously monitored the situation in the European textiles and clothing industry as it has changed in response to the phasing out of quotas on imports of textiles and clothing from WTO Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Two sets of Council conclusions, adopted in response to two communications from the Commission in 2003 and 2004, demonstrate this concern, amongst other things. With regard, in general, to the gradual move towards a quota-free system, it has to be said that this is not an unexpected event. In fact, as I am sure Parliament knows, the end of four decades of heavily regulated trade in textiles and clothing comes as no surprise at all.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation and expiry of the Agreement on Textile and Clothing form an integral part of the results of the Uruguay Round concluded in 1994. Since then, it has been clear that as from 1 January 2005 the textiles and clothing sector would be fully integrated into the framework of Article 9 of GATT 1994. All over the world, all those involved, including of course the European textiles and clothing industry, knew that this was coming.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, for its part, adopted a set of seven actions to deal with this new quota-free environment. As the Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry stated when this plan was adopted, whether at EU, national or regional level, we need to provide the sector with conditions that will enable it to improve its competitiveness and to remain a key industry for the EU, which is what you also called for, Mr Barón Crespo.</p>
<p class="contents">In its conclusions of 25 and 26 November 2004, the Council stated that it supported the Commission's strategy for the textiles and clothing sector, which focuses on competitiveness linked to research and innovation, training and better skills, protection of intellectual property rights, access to third country markets and encouraging the development of strategies for the textiles industry in the Euro-Mediterranean zone.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council considers the Commission's package of measures to be appropriate. It has also urged the Commission to allow the High Level Group for Textiles and Clothing to continue its work. In addition, it has invited the Commission to regularly inform the Council about developments in the EU textiles and clothing sector in the aftermath of the dismantling of import quotas as from 1 January 2005; and it has also invited the Commission to report on the outcome of the further discussions of the High Level Group.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the High Level Group's recommendations on the growth of imports from China, which is indeed a top-priority concern, the Council recognises that the Commission has stated that it is prepared to use the trade defence instruments available to it, if the legal conditions are met and if such an approach is actually necessary. I would like to add that our relations with China are indeed also important in this particular area. We are anxious to integrate China into international trade rules, which is why we have made every effort to bring them into the WTO. We now need to ensure that they respect these rules, and also other less formal rules regarding, for example, social protection and social standards. It is a subject that we will have to discuss with China.</p>
<p class="contents">These legal conditions have very recently been changed in order to transpose the lifting of quotas into Community law. The Council adopted a Regulation to this end on 13 December 2004. Council Regulation 2200/2004 thus marks the end of the Agreement on Textile and Clothing as far as the European Union is concerned, and it also provides for a surveillance system to be put in place as of 1 January 2005 to monitor imports of the most sensitive textiles and clothing. This system will provide customs-based surveillance of imports of liberalised products of all origins and will include a requirement to issue an import surveillance document for imports of certain products from China. This requirement will be lifted in 2005, once the customs-based surveillance system is fully operational. This information will be published at least once a month.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the use of safeguard clauses, Parliament considered, in its resolution of January 2004 on the future of the textile and clothing sector in the EU, that there was a need to set up a clear, rapid and transparent procedure concerning the WTO general safeguard clauses and the special clauses applying to China under the Protocol on China's accession to the WTO. The High Level Group also requested more detailed information in this regard from the Commission. At the moment, it appears that the Commission is prepared to meet expectations in this respect, since it is going to draft guidelines governing the procedures regarding safeguard measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with respect to the impact of the expiry of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing on developing countries and the measures that the European Union could take under Articles 177 and 178 of the Treaty, let me start by citing two of the three objectives of our development cooperation, as set out in the Treaty: the sustainable development of the developing countries, and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them; and the integration of the poorest countries into the world economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union's trade policy obviously takes account of these objectives, as required by Article 178 of the Treaty. The realisation of the Doha Development Round and the way in which the Doha Development Agenda is developing are just one more example of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also remind you, with regard more specifically to the expiry of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, that the end of quotas and the integration of trade in textiles and clothing into the GATT were one of the main demands of the developing countries during the Uruguay Round. It is true that, since it joined the WTO, China has seen a constant increase in its share in the international textile and clothing trade. China's continuing growth, which is already significant, may be achieved at the detriment of a number of weak and vulnerable developing countries, as Members have stressed.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the direction that the Council is taking is clear, and I would like to quote again from the conclusions I referred to earlier: 'the Council supports a GSP scheme that will be targeted at countries most in need, such as the least developed countries and the most vulnerable developing countries in order to help them play a greater role in international trade’. In this context, the situation resulting from the removal of textiles from the quota system will also be examined during the discussions on the new GSP scheme. Moreover, it is this new GSP scheme, known as 'GSP Plus', which should in principle be finalised by the end of March in order to enter into force <span class="italic">ex ante</span> at the beginning of April. This issue has also repeatedly been brought up during the EU-China Textiles Dialogue, initiated on 6 May 2004. During the last meeting held as part of this dialogue, in December 2004, we had the impression, for the first time, that the Chinese authorities had started to understand the problem and the European Union's message, because they announced measures favouring a number of developing countries. It remains to be seen how effective these measures will be. The Council will continue to monitor carefully all the changes facing this market.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to measures favouring the European Union's textiles and clothing industry, the Council has been insistent in calling on the Commission to take a greater interest in the strategic sectors, namely innovation, including non-technological innovation, and the development of industrial cooperation with the Euro-Mediterranean partners. We need to focus on higher value-added products, for one thing, and on industrial cooperation with complementary partners in developing countries, for another. I would add to this the opening up of markets, in particular the Chinese market, to this type of European product.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to supplement these general guidelines, we need to leave a certain amount of room for manoeuvre with regard to the rules of origin, which will make it possible to improve the situation of the developing countries that export textiles and clothing. At the beginning of January 2004, the Commission presented to the Council a Green Paper entitled 'The future of rules of origin in preferential trade arrangements'. The Council will be sure to examine any legislative proposal that the Commission may submit to it on this subject when the time comes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My colleague from the Council has already said everything the Commission would say. </p>
<p class="contents">– <span class="italic">(DE)</span> I would, nevertheless, like to say a few words. The WTO Agreement is of course a very important one, and it expired on 31 December. The task now is to see how we can cushion the predictable impacts. Mr Schmit has already responded to Mr Barón Crespo by outlining the measures presented by the Commission and adopted by the Council. Let me say again: it is extremely important to adopt measures to step up the fight against fakes and piracy, to enforce intellectual property rights, to establish an action plan in response to the existing trade barriers in third countries, to promote high-tech and ultra high-quality textiles and clothing, including via the EU's research and development programmes, and to guarantee lifelong learning and vocational training and development.</p>
<p class="contents">He also mentioned the monitoring procedure and the imports of textiles and clothing into China. I would just say that Commissioner Mandelson, who is actually responsible for this portfolio, is now on his way to China to discuss all these issues, and others.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection measures outlined by Mr Schmit are a last resort. Indeed, they can only be implemented if the legal conditions comply with WTO rules. We must also consider how trade developments in this area will impact on the highly vulnerable textile and clothing sector.</p>
<p class="contents">It has already been mentioned that the Commission and the WTO are carefully monitoring China's progress in implementing its WTO commitments and are utilising the opportunities available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">For those countries affected by the liberalisation of textile quotas, the best option would be to adopt measures to improve the range of goods they offer. We are prepared to assist these countries as they adopt these measures. For the ACP states, for example, a study is now being prepared which reviews the response strategy of those countries which are heavily dependent on exports of textiles and clothing. The European Investment Bank could also offer services here, such as an investment facility. That is one option which I throw open for discussion. I will then answer questions on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first figures of January this year compared to the same period last year demonstrate that a fivefold increase in imports of clothing from China is not a flash in the pan.</p>
<p class="contents">This does, of course, have major implications for European manufacturing industry. It has, of course, been known that the quotas would expire and perhaps the industry should have been better prepared for this. Since it now transpires that, according to some estimates, hundreds of thousands of jobs, or at least thousands of jobs, are on the line, I can imagine that thought is being given to protective measures or the temporary reintroduction of part of the quota system in order to give the industry a little more time to adjust. China’s protocol of accession to the WTO allows for this.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission considers measures in some way or another, then this will bring with it new problems, certainly if those measures involve quotas. After all, there are European importers of clothing from China who have now entered into major commitments for 2005. They should not be sacrificed to an operation to rescue manufacturing industry. I would therefore urge the Commission and the Council, in the event of any reintroduction of quotas or other protective measures, to ensure that an arrangement is put in place which stops entrepreneurs who have anticipated the new situation from being victimised.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I do believe that – as has already been said – we should do our level best to ensure that China complies with the WTO obligations with regard to opening up its own market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has already been pointed out, this sector currently employs over two and a half million workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The representatives of the sector do not wish to infringe the January 1995 Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. What they are calling for is recognition of the fact that when China became a full Member of the WTO in 2001 the situation of the sector changed dramatically, and this had not been foreseen.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore entirely justifiable for the textile sector to receive special support from the Union’s institutions and also from the Member States and regional authorities. The Commission and the Council must provide strong support for the European textile industry to allow it to enter new markets. It is important to insist that China abide strictly by the commitments it entered into with the WTO. In addition, other countries such as India, Brazil, the United States of America and Canada should lift the artificial technical and bureaucratic barriers they currently have in place.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said that the strategy proposed by the High Level Group on the textile sector provides for a most appropriate course of action. The sectors concerned are now calling for it to be developed and applied as a matter of urgency. Time is of the essence. The inclusion of an approach aimed especially at SMEs has been suggested, as the latter account for 90% of industries of this type. There has also been a call for a flexible reserve fund to be set up within the Structural Funds to help implement the changes required within the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">For many years, the textile industry has been making a tremendous effort to restructure in order to become competitive. The challenges now before it are so enormous that it cannot be left to face them alone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If nothing is done about this, the European market, now fully open, will be flooded with cheap textiles from China, but also from India and Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much doubt, Commissioner, that the Commission’s action plan of 13 October 2004 will be enough to help the European textile industry in its fight for survival. The plan provides for support measures, but does not contain any trade-related measures at all. It was envisaged that textile imports into Europe would be monitored from 1 January onwards, which would allow the Commission to take action swiftly if necessary, but Commissioner Mandelson acknowledged last week in the Committee on International Trade that this monitoring system is still not operational and criteria have not even been laid down.</p>
<p class="contents">When will this, at long last, be done? When it is too late to lock the stable door, and the horse has already bolted? Might I urge the Commission to use all possible means to combat unfair commercial practices in some countries? The Commission has the means at its disposal, including a horizontal safeguard clause, a textile-specific safeguard clause which, according to the Multi-Fibre Agreement, is permitted under certain circumstances, or in extreme circumstances, it can lodge a complaint to the WTO’s dispute settlement body.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, Commissioner, what we expect from the Commission is a more trade-minded and more pro-active approach. We must be bold enough to hold up our fist to major trading partners, certainly if they compete with us unfairly. It is unacceptable to leave 177 000 companies and 2.7 million workers in the European textile sector out in the cold. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In countries with weaker economies, where the textile and clothing industries are mostly located – as is the case in northern and central Portugal – there is already a worrying increase in the number of import licences issued for Chinese goods, especially in the most sensitive product categories for Portuguese industry, in addition to all the concern about household textiles imported from other places, such as India and Pakistan. Therefore, for the sake of protecting the jobs of thousands or even millions of workers and the industry itself, the safeguard clause must be applied urgently, since it will only have a positive effect if it is used soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is worth putting this into an historical perspective. In 1962, as a young economics student, I wrote an essay on the marked decline of the Swedish textile and clothing industry after the Second World War. At that time, the reason for this was the stiff competition from low-wage countries such as Germany and Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">I found that structural change in the sector had been successful. Labour had moved to better paid jobs in the engineering industry, and what remained of the textile and clothing industry had moved on to more advanced products. No unemployment had resulted, and the trade unions had played an active part in the structural change. The whole episode stood out as a tale with a happy ending from both an economic and a social point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">This process continued during the 1960s and 1970s. At that time, the surviving Swedish textile and clothing enterprises moved a large proportion of their production to low-wage countries such as Finland and, in time, Portugal, but kept their design and marketing operations in Sweden. Special products such as men’s suits and car upholstery continued to be made in Sweden, and were profitable. Nowadays, the thought of Finland – ‘Nokialand’ – now so advanced, still being considered a low-wage country in the late 1960s is laughable. Today, very little remains of Swedish textile and clothing production, but large Swedish clothing chains employ large numbers of people in designing and marketing clothing worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had ten years to adapt. For the EU to become a leading, dynamic, knowledge-based region, its socioeconomic system must succeed in compensating for a decline in the textile and clothing industry by means of a transition to more sophisticated textile and clothing products and strong growth in other sectors. If it does not, the Lisbon agenda will show itself to have been a soap bubble waiting to burst. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We only have to cast our minds back to the unwillingness to address the issue with specific programmes. We hope that there will now be other guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The High Level Group and the Commission have proposed seven actions to help the textile industry boost competitiveness in the sector: they are all important, but I would give particular emphasis to one of these. In Europe we have labour legislation with especially strong worker protection which vastly inflates the cost of goods. We cannot tolerate unfair competition from certain non-EU countries based precisely on extremely low labour costs and in particular, the exploitation of child labour. Along with the call to tighten corporate social responsibility, we will have to make the public more aware of ethical purchases, through special campaigns. To this end, labelling which allows consumers to easily identify goods manufactured in accordance with the fundamental labour rights specified by the International Labour Organisation is vital in order for buyers to take responsibility too.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with actions in the fight against counterfeiting, I would highlight the suggestion to take action to support traditional textiles with focused programmes, not least so that we can avoid further official approval of textile goods, which is certainly of little use in the context of celebrating regional identities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the end of the 1980s, French companies have been making workers redundant or closing down altogether, and more and more businesses are relocating to low-wage countries. Since the 1960s, the textile and clothing sector in France has lost two-thirds of its workforce, which is about 20 000 jobs per year, and today we are suffering 2 000 job losses a month. In my own region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais, historically an important textile-producing area, towns such as Elesmes, Roubaix and Tourcoing have witnessed the closure of their businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The social situation is already serious and yet it is going to get worse in future. Until now, quotas have made it possible to limit imports of textiles from third countries, but on 1 January 2005 the door was opened to imports on a massive scale from China.</p>
<p class="contents">France and Europe now need to define a strategy to defend their textile industry. We must as a matter of urgency request the WTO to provide safeguard clauses. Indeed, this option is available to Member States if a sudden increase in imports is observed, to the major detriment of a local industry, and this is indeed the case in France and Europe today. Since the quotas expired on 1 January, imports have soared, and the flood from China is destroying whole sections of what remains of our textile industry. Imports of trousers made in China between 1 January 2005 and 2 February 2005 increased by 792% compared to the same period in 2004. Imports of pullovers increased by 613%.</p>
<p class="contents">Before it is too late, and regardless of the opinion of Guillaume Sarkozy, President of the French textile industry union and a fierce advocate for the delocalisation of businesses, we must not wait to see our internal market flooded before we demand a return to customs barriers and safeguard clauses. The extremist advocates of liberalisation who drafted Article 314 of the Constitutional Treaty, announcing the opening of our borders to world trade and the lowering of customs barriers, are promising us major general industrial and social decline, of which the textiles issue is an unpleasant foretaste. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to declarations made by Chinese importers, imports of many categories of textile products into Europe have doubled, or even trebled, since quotas ended on 1 January 2005. It is vital for the EU to have trade policy instruments that enable it to respond to sudden variations in imports. In that regard, Commissioner, it has become a matter of urgency for the Commission to publish guidelines regarding the textiles-specific safeguard clause for China announced in October 2004, in the absence of which industries throughout the Member States will be unable to respond. The EU respects its commitments within the WTO. These commitments must now be respected by all members of that organisation. The textile and clothing market must remain open and competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union also needs to realise that many textile-producing countries regarded as vulnerable are also at risk of being seriously affected by the lifting of quotas. I am thinking of Bangladesh, Cambodia and our Mediterranean neighbours. It was almost ten years ago that the European Union decided to enter into a partnership promoting development in the Euro-Mediterranean region. The question of textiles therefore points more than ever to the need to establish a real free-trade area as soon as we can. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since January, as has been mentioned here already, international trade quotas for these products have disappeared. Even though the change was expected, it has had a severe impact on markets, particularly because of the dominance of China. Ignoring social or environmental concerns, China allows its companies to sell at exceedingly low prices. That results in two essential consequences: the more vulnerable exporting countries are harmed, as in some cases they depend almost entirely on this kind of industry for their economic survival; and countless factories in Europe may be ruined.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the commitments made by the Chinese authorities in recent months to impose their own limits on exports from their country, the fact is that the indicators that we have are giving us great cause for concern. It is now appropriate, therefore, to raise the following questions: first: how are the Commission and the Council taking account of the changes occurring in this area and what means are they using to constantly monitor the situation; and, secondly, under what conditions is the Commission prepared to implement the specific safeguard mechanisms, bearing in mind that there is at least a fear that the United States may do so very soon? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, do we not have a duty to protect the European textile and clothing industry? Pending implementation of the High Level Group's recommendations, on which Parliament will state its position, the European Union has defined a strategy for coping with changes resulting from the end of quotas, which translates, it would seem, into specific commitments: producing a draft protocol on the rules of origin, adopting guidelines regarding the textiles-specific safeguard clause for China, putting in place the Community preference system, the likely establishment of a 10% threshold with the aim of preserving the market share of traditional providers of the EU, negotiating at the WTO in order to obtain substantial concessions from emerging countries that maintain high tariffs, as well as erecting non-customs barriers in the textiles and clothing sector and, finally, adopting strategic plans at local level to improve the allocation of public funds.

It involves more than 2 600 companies that employ over 72 000 workers. This year all the quotas and duties for WTO countries must be completely phased out. Therefore, these countries will have unrestricted access to EU markets. This could lead to dumping situations that will harm our economies. This could encourage businesses to relocate to other latitudes. I understand that such a phenomenon can only be addressed by pouring more money into research investment budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two possible objectives. First, to manufacture products of finer quality with added value that can compete with those from other countries, mainly China. Second, to launch a unified European trade market, including a quality index. In addition to that, we need to develop a strategy that favours business concentration as a positive tool to make the sector more competitive and efficient. This would forestall the threat of business relocation. An active role by the EU is the best way to achieve social cohesion and the maintenance of the living standards we have come to expect in this part of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thus, companies and handicrafts either moved to countries with lower labour costs or closed. In both cases, those who lost most were the workers in the sector, who know the road to unemployment. In Greece, entire towns have literally died. WTO analysts estimate that, over coming years, China's share will exceed 50% internationally, while in the European Union approximately 325 000 jobs will be lost. This is a choice of the European Union which, although it appears contradictory, is in the interests of the European monopolies, so that they can penetrate China's huge market in profitable sectors and exploit cheaper labour costs. All that is maintained about controls, research and innovation, about a more competitive European textile industry, does not help and does not concern the small professionals who will be wiped out; it concerns the monopoly groups, which will increase their profits. Let the workers and the small professionals draw their own conclusions about the policy of the European Union, which destroys the many that are weak and strengthens the few that are rich.

<p class="contents">Well, ladies and gentlemen, today, one day after the removal of the quota measures imposed on textile imports from China, that Commissioner’s prophesy has come true. Market risk occurs not when people are guided by common sense but when there is woolly thinking.</p>
<p class="contents">The textile sector is on its knees, with all the consequences that has for developing the economy and for our fellow citizens’ well-being. Market reaction has been immediate in these first two months of 2005. Applications for import licences from China have risen. To a great extent, the small producers in the textile sector are closing and becoming importers. They close their factories and lay off their workers, thus becoming vendors of products that are placed on the market at high prices even though they are of terrible quality.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to understand, therefore, whether the Commission and the Council want to implement those measures that are possible, recognised and permitted within the framework of the WTO agreements, so as to cushion the adverse effects of removing the quotas. Even before that, however, we need to understand the Commission’s and the Member States’ philosophy. We believe that the mark of origin remains the most important of the possible measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Producers and consumers need to be protected by means of transparency – in other words, by identifying the quality and origin of products. The European quality mark, with the European nation of origin specifically mentioned on it, is thus in our view the primary objective to be achieved if we want to ensure, not protection of Europe as such, but rather respect for what Europe produces.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Council are aware that, in view of the current situation in the textile sector, the entire industry in Europe may disappear from world markets and from our own markets. How do they intend to act in the WTO when faced with the next demands for liberalisation in one or other manufacturing industry, in which the same consequences that we have seen in the textile industry may be repeated?</p>
<p class="contents">We look forward to a reassuring answer, Commissioner; otherwise, we shall be forced to think that, as Europe progresses, some manufacturing industries in Europe including Italy, – as it concerns me directly to a great extent – will be forced to shut up shop and wave goodbye to social cohesion and the European model. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The crisis is also concentrated in certain regions that are in themselves already disadvantaged and will now be much more vulnerable. With the shake-up in the sector, we have seen massive relocation of production in recent years as well as mass redundancies, the vast majority of which involves poorly-skilled women. The result is well known and leaves no room for doubt: a loss of 20 to 25% of factories and jobs over about ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent opening-up of the market to China is aggravating the situation. Now that we have reached this point, I suggest that the Commission should adopt three kinds of measures. First, it should stringently monitor all imports into the single market, and not hesitate to act through the safeguard clauses. For that to happen, it is essential that the monitoring system should work, and that it should work soon. I do not intend to call for any kind of protectionism, which would be to fly in the face of history. Europe has to accustom itself to competing with countries where labour is cheap, but it cannot accept competition from companies that do not pay for their energy, use child slave labour and do not respect intellectual property.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is important to look into the relocation of textile companies, as well as cases of fraud and of companies that had been given support before closing down.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, a recommendation for the Commission: the European textile sector should invest at the points in the value chain where Europe has a genuine competitive advantage. To that end, we need to develop a policy that takes account of the following aspects, amongst others: logistical infrastructure, geographical proximity to major markets, fast order turnaround, design, quality control, innovation, use of new materials and new technologies, relations with major distribution networks, permanent vocational training, and support for SMEs, which still make up the majority of companies in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission to accept that that is the path for the future of the textile industry in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This development has already created the first adverse consequences in Greece, with uncontrolled imports of Chinese products, which hit not only the textile and clothing sector, but also consumer safety, with poor quality, cheap products.</p>
<p class="contents">The experts at the WTO and the OECD may see advantages in the full liberalisation of the textile and clothing trade, but European and Greek businessmen and workers do not. The textile and clothing industry manufacturing base is shrinking. Industries and handicrafts close daily in Greece, while others relocate to neighbouring Balkan countries. At the same time, unemployment is constantly rising. One typical example is that, in December 2004 alone, 12 small and medium-sized businesses closed in Greece, leaving over 650 workers unemployed.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of this dramatic development and taking account of the data of the WTO, which forecasts that China will control 50% of the world textile market in the next two years, I fear that the European Commission is merely monitoring developments. While the United States, Turkey and Argentina recently decided to use safety measures and impose quotas on certain categories of Chinese products, at the moment we are still waiting for the European Commission to submit guidelines.

He recently said to the French newspaper <span class="italic">Le Figaro</span>, that ‘according to a study commissioned by the OECD, the omission of the textile quota will save each family EUR 270 annually’. Unfortunately, Mr Mandelson ignored the thousands of families who, as a result of the abolition of the quota and of the resulting Chinese ‘tidal wave’, will lose their jobs, if they have not already done so. Moreover, Mr Mandelson has drawn rather hasty conclusions, because he overlooks, whether consciously or not, the fact that the expected falls in price will affect only a very limited range of textile and clothing products, and will therefore have a very limited effect in general. I am surprised by, and very disappointed with, Mr Mandelson’s ultra-liberal discourse, but that is just by the by. I have a few concrete questions and suggestions.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, can you confirm that the Commission will respond and take action once it is proven that the Chinese products end up on the European market at dumping prices? That can be done on the basis of the price of raw materials on the international markets. The Commission only needs the will to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Commissioner, what safeguard measures – and this subject has already been expressly mentioned here – would you consider in order to prevent certain product categories in Europe from being wiped off the map as a result of unfair competition?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what concrete steps can you take, and indeed, are you prepared to take, to ensure that in China too, the basic social and ecological threshold standards are respected? You could, for example, make certain practices public in the context of a naming and shaming information campaign, to mention but an example. Finally, Commissioner, it is reported that last month’s textile imports from China increased considerably, not to say spectacularly. I hope that the Commissioner will not fob us off again with a bromide that our textile industry has had ten years to adjust, for that would be the height of oversimplification. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, of course, often pointed out that this industry has had ten years in which to adapt to the situation. That is all true. The fact is, though, that China now dominates 20% of the world market, and in three or four years' time, this share will have risen to 50%. China has the lowest wages and its energy costs are also a third lower – and what was that about its human rights record? Over the next three to four years, the number of jobs in Europe's textiles sector – currently standing at 2.7 million – will be cut by half.</p>
<p class="contents">This will have a particular impact on some old EU countries, notably Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece, but also on Romania and Bulgaria, not to mention Turkey. What I would like the Commissioner to tell us is which measures she will adopt to cushion the imminent and severe labour market problems. Which measures does she intend to deploy to persuade China to cooperate more fully?

For several items, import licences in the last two months have already exceeded the total imports of the same items for the whole of 2004. Prices for almost all products have dropped sharply, sometimes to less than half their previous levels.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the possibility that exists for the Commission to use the safeguard measures provided for in China’s protocol of accession, I would ask you, Commissioner, to clarify some matters: first, what are the consequences of the fact that the Commission has not yet begun to produce customs data on textile imports; secondly, what are the consequences of the fact that the guidelines that the Commission should have prepared and made available in 2004 are still to be drawn up; and lastly, how sure can European producers be that the Commission is technically and politically able to act before it is too late? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, in April, we will have a further debate on the issue of textiles, and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on International Trade will also hold a joint hearing on this topic. On behalf of my colleagues and the two committees, I look forward to continuing this debate and hope that we will, on those occasions, have more reliable data with which to work.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is now 2005, which means that at the end of the year, we will have the WTO negotiations in Hong Kong. I think this is a good opportunity to send out the signal to China to which many of my fellow-Members have referred, and to exert gentle pressure by diplomatic means. I believe that it is essential to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is also important that, in preparing the analysis to which the President-in-Office of the Council referred, there should be real consideration of the various factors involved. We must find out more about what is happening, for example, in Tunisia, Turkey or our traditional EU Member States, both in terms of what is going well and what is going wrong. We really do need a more carefully researched and clearer picture. If, in conjunction with the relevant Commissioners, you could provide us with this before the end of your Presidency, it would be more than helpful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The group also recommended that a system should be set up to monitor Chinese imports from 1 January 2005. Unfortunately, however, the same group was unable to issue guidelines on the mark of origin because of internal differences of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, in fact, there was an article in a major Italian daily by Commissioner Mandelson about the ‘Made in Italy’ mark, according to which the Union has a duty to inform consumers so that they can distinguish a shirt produced in China from one made in Italy. I agree, and I would add that strict labelling rules fulfil that duty. Therefore, with regard to the system to monitor Chinese imports, first of all I would like to know what the results of monitoring have been in the almost two months since the restrictions were removed. Secondly, regarding labelling of origin, I would ask the Commission and then the Council whether they intend to adopt measures soon that will make it compulsory to label goods with their origin, and I would point out that such a measure is strongly demanded by textile manufacturers in Italy and elsewhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the case for my region in France, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, which has already been affected, over recent years, by restructuring and delocalisation and where this sector is the second-largest industrial employer, still providing work for more than 30 000 employees.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2004, Parliament, in a resolution, and the High Level Group on textiles and clothing both called for a specific programme for this sector, in particular in regions in difficulty, which have a large number of SMEs and a high employment rate among women. In these regions, European aid has made it possible in recent years to mitigate the socio-economic impact of sectoral crises, to avoid job losses and to cushion the effects of economic restructuring thanks, in particular, to innovation, integration, training and the development of a modern industry.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the European Union is drafting its new financial perspectives, these regions are concerned about the future of the structural funds, which have contributed to economic development. I am sure that the Commission and the Council will be keen to reassure them and to prove to them that the economic and social cohesion to which these funds contribute is one of the European Union's priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are working on a very comprehensive strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, let me just mention a few points because this was a very complex and comprehensive debate. The Commission has proposed several actions to enhance the competitiveness of the European textile industry in its second communication on the textile industries. The actions proposed include measures such as strengthening the fight against counterfeiting and piracy; enforcing intellectual property rights; establishing an action plan to address existing trade barriers in third countries; fostering advance technology and textiles and clothing with high added value under the EU's Research and Development Programmes; and ensuring lifelong education and vocational training. Second, the Commission has established a system for monitoring imports of textiles and clothing products from China.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is too early to draw conclusions on monitoring. The Textile High Level Group was unable to reach a conclusion in its June 2004 report on the 'Made in the European Union' mark of origin. The Commission will come back to that and will draw up proposals at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">We will resort to safeguards only as a last resort. This includes the textiles-specific safeguard clause that was established in China's Protocol of Accession to the WTO. This is an important and clearly proactive strategy. Open international trade is also a key factor in the competitiveness of the economy as a whole. Access to third-country markets allows for the creation of jobs in Europe, which is also a key priority of the Commission. We are therefore determined to do all it takes to achieve the objective of equal market access so that EU firms in these sectors can exploit their hard-earned know-how and quality. The Commission will therefore draw up an action plan to address the barriers in third-country markets, and the Doha Development Round will provide the opportunity to carry out a comprehensive review of all the alleged non-tariff barriers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I shall say a few more words on China. Commissioner Mandelson is not here because he is currently visiting China, but I will tell him about today's comprehensive debate and maybe you can go into more detail with him, as the Commissioner responsible for trade, at another time.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise again that the Commission is monitoring closely China's compliance with the WTO accession commitments, most notably in the framework of the EU-China Textiles Trade Dialogue signed in May of last year by the Trade Commissioner and his Chinese counterpart.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, in the framework of other dialogues between the Commission and the Chinese authorities, the Commission has requested that the issue of the sustainable development of the textile sector, and in particular the question of corporate social responsibility, be put on the agenda. The Commission hopes that this will contribute to having the rather strict Chinese labour and environmental laws properly enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also conducting a study, which will be finalised shortly, on working and other manufacturing conditions in the textile and clothing sector in China. In line with the Council's Presidency Conclusions from 2003, the European Union is committed to promoting respect for core labour standards through trade relations with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I would like to make is about the proposed guidelines on the textile safeguard clause for China. This is still under preparation. The Commission wants to examine all sides of the issue thoroughly before taking a final decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is reluctant to do something that would more or less pave the way for the easy introduction of safeguards. The Commission does not want the guidelines to be a vehicle to facilitate or prompt safeguard action, but one that prevents recourse to safeguards. The Commission would like these guidelines to introduce transparency in the handling of the requests for safeguards that may be made, but it would also like them to introduce greater predictability in trade, for instance by providing some safe zones, generously established and providing for very large expansion possibilities below which we would not consider safeguard action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sustainable economic development, market liberalisation and the well-being of EU citizens are thus our objectives, and they must not therefore cause our own products to become less competitive on our own territory, in favour of goods that fall far short of our quality and safety standards. We must therefore ensure that, rather than being penalised, our values and our efforts – and along with them thousands of enterprises, especially small ones, which underpin our social fabric – are instead valued and protected both internally and at an international level. We call, then, for the highest degree of protection for our mark of origin and promotion of the quality mark, with careful monitoring and severe penalties for any counterfeiting and attempted fraud to the detriment of the consumer. We also demand a firmer stance in bilateral relations, so as to stop or limit the devaluation of the yuan, the ridiculous bank rates and the massive investment in new machinery that are helping the Chinese market to such a great extent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
