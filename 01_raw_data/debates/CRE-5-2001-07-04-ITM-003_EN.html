I entirely regret this result, but one must live as a democrat with due process. On behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group, I would like to the European Commission. It is clear that, in the form presented, the mergers and acquisitions (takeovers) directive, has now fallen. It is such a fundamental and important issue that I hope we do not abandon the attempt because of this difficulty. We must learn from the difficulty and I invite the Commission at the earliest date to redouble its efforts to submit a new proposal, so that we can drive the Lisbon reform forward. We cannot give a signal from this house that we are not concerned with fundamental economic dynamics in the European Union. The Council and the Commission can help us in that regard.</p>

In one respect, I am sorry because I would have preferred the directive to have been adopted. However, my prevailing sentiment is one of deep satisfaction, and that is because, with our votes and the votes of the other members of the Conciliation Committee delegation – 8 to 6 – we made it possible for the decision to be taken by this House. We knew that there was disagreement between and within the 15 governments, that the trade unions and economic organisations were divided and that practically all the Parliamentary groups were divided in their opinions. Therefore, why should the decision be 7 to 7 at 2 in the morning in Luxembourg? It was the right decision and I believe that even our friends who would have preferred to conclude the matter in Luxembourg should be grateful to us.

<p class="contents">Some believe that this directive did not go far enough in this direction and that there is no real genuine consultation of the workforce.

<p class="contents">As a senior British trade union general secretary said, it is a significant step forward and offers a chance to build a substantial foundation. It would be wrong to oppose the directive because it does not give sufficient rights of information and consultation.</p>

Preparations for this had been going on for a very long time – twelve years – and I hope that the work will not have all been in vain in the wake of this very close vote. In other words, I hope that the work to formulate harmonised rules on company takeovers in the European Community will carry on, and perhaps one day we will find a compromise in this matter that would achieve majority support in this House. I would just like to raise the question of how this will affect flows of capital in Europe. In my opinion, it is very worrying that at Lisbon last year we made some ambitious plans, which now seem to have turned out to be mere empty words.

As a result of this House’s decision to reject the directive, the European capital markets will continue to be fragmented in a key area, namely the trading of companies. Future-oriented opportunities to increase prosperity can only be achieved through open markets and free trade. Sadly, Parliament has deviated from this position. It would have been infinitely preferable, in my view, if we had called for management boards to be required to remain neutral, as the interests of owners do not always coincide with those of senior executives.</p>
<p class="contents">The implication that Germany, for example, requires greater protection from hostile takeovers because golden shares<span class="italic"> </span>and majority voting shares exist in other countries reflects protectionist attitudes. One cannot pursue a protectionist course simply because other countries are doing so.

Parliament’s decision reflects a number of profoundly different expectations. For example, it reflects the legitimate frustration of the supporters of genuine legislative harmonisation, who felt less and less at home with a text that became more and more minimalist, technically unsound and politically imbalanced, and who wanted to punish arrogant governments for refusing to make any concessions towards Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The rejection inflicted on the EP delegation in the conciliation committee can be explained, however, by the growing strength of a quite different sense of nervousness that led to a retreat into protectionism, which shattered the fragile agreement that had been reached in conciliation. The German MEPs found that many Netherlands, Spanish and Italian colleagues gradually came to support their strategy of rejection. As for France, its Socialist government taught rather paradoxical lessons in liberalism, while at the same time allowing a hyper-protected national company to launch a spectacular, all-out takeover bid and rouse the demons of protectionism from their hopelessly light sleep in many parts of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people still regarded the directive as too much of a threat even when it had been watered down and emasculated and even though it did not have to be implemented for another five years. No-one will mourn the final shipwreck of a text that went from concession to surrender, ending up as little more than the shadow of a common policy. At the same time, no-one can be unaware that this bad text was largely rejected for the wrong reasons. After the Irish referendum, the rejection of a directive concerning a vital economic issue is yet another sign that Europe is going through a very serious political and moral crisis today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not believe we should extend the rights of some workers at the expense of others, nor should we vote for fewer consultation rights than we wish to see in the forthcoming Directive. Our approach must be coherent. We now have to push our national governments to raise their standards to those of the best, and not hide behind an international compromise.</p>

The compromise approved by the Conciliation Committee is unacceptable to us.</p>
<p class="contents">As the proverb says, ‘Time brings everything to those who wait’, and after 12 years of discussion, we could have expected that a perfect directive would be produced. Yet the opposite is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the problems?</p>
<p class="contents">1. There are protected companies in the Member States, either through voting restrictions, ‘golden shares’, or multiple voting rights, etc. The directive entrenches a situation in which protected companies can take over unprotected ones, yet unprotected companies cannot take over protected ones. This means that there is no equal treatment (‘level playing field’).</p>
<p class="contents">2. The directive fails to include principles governing the definition of the ‘equitable price’ to be offered in the case of a mandatory bid; it also contains no provisions on ‘squeeze-out’ (the right of the majority shareholder in a company to acquire the shares of minority shareholders).</p>
<p class="contents">3. European companies would be exposed to pressure from the major financial corporations in Europe, with wealth creation henceforth giving way to the sole aim of maximising profits. This in turn increases the danger that this type of takeover will result in large-scale job shedding.</p>
<p class="contents">4. The co-determination rights of workforce representatives are not sufficiently articulated. The requirement that appropriate information should be given to the representatives of the company’s employees offers no guarantee that they will be able to exert any influence on the takeover process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission itself is quite aware of these problems as well, for it proposes that a group of company law experts be requested to examine the further harmonisation of company law and define a clear position on Article 9 of this directive by March 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">What kind of logic is that? I think it would have been more sensible to convene a group of experts to present its conclusions and then produce a directive, rather than first producing a directive and then asking a group of experts to discuss the unresolved problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in conjunction with the directive on company law concerning takeover bids, a directive on the requirement for neutrality is urgently required. This has been available in draft form since 1972 and has still not been adopted. It is time for Mr Bolkestein and the Council to do their homework. To give them the chance to do so, we have rejected the text before us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main purpose of the directive is to protect the interests of minority shareholders, and, by means of harmonisation, to protect these interests when the takeover bid is of a cross-border nature. By defining a principle for the equal treatment of all shareholders, the directive therefore seeks to establish minimum conditions for all shareholders to state their views and to study the terms of any bid made. At the same time, it seeks to ensure, by means of regulations on making the bid and time limits on the acceptance period, that the company remains operational during this period.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore give my full support to the agreement that has been reached and, consequently, to the joint project, adopted by the Conciliation Committee, for a European Parliament and Council directive on takeover bids, which thereby seeks to create a set of harmonised rules that will add rigour to the process and ensure equal protection for all shareholders.<span class="bold"> </span></p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their ownership was not anonymous and their staff worked there all their lives. For a long time, governments supported the efforts of companies to remain in regional or national hands, and the setting up of companies on a non-commercial basis, so that they could better serve the interests of employees and consumers. In a society where everything is subordinated to a free market and worldwide competition, companies have now become a commodity. If it suits the purchasers and the old shareholders, they are closed because their profit margin lags behind the rest of the group, because their brand name can be stuck on other products or their production can be transferred to a country with low wages and inadequate environmental regulation. The consequences for employment, social cohesion in an area around the company, consumers and the scope for a democratically determined government policy is extremely negative. That is why manageable, checkable and small-scale companies are far preferable to global giants, that are constantly surprising others and laying down the law to them. Mergers that provide no right of veto for trade unions and government lead to accidents. I reject this trade in companies and am voting against the proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s White Paper has set us an indicative target, namely that 12% of gross energy consumption should be covered from renewable sources by 2010. In order to achieve this goal, we must promote the generation of electricity from renewable sources by means of various incentives, as we are still a long way from achieving this target.</p>
<p class="contents">New technologies need unbureaucratic, simple and effective promotion mechanisms. I would like to take this opportunity to underline, above all, the importance of renewable energies for the rural regions. The production of energy and the cultivation of energy crops offer an alternative income-generation opportunity for our farmers in Europe, which must be exploited.

It was said that biomass shall mean the biodegradable fraction of products from agriculture, forestry and related industries. Although Parliament has unfortunately not reproduced the definition we agreed on last time, according to which peat should count among the renewables, inasmuch as it regenerates each year, I would like to state that peat should be implicitly included in the version now agreed. Every gardener knows that peat is a biodegradable product. It breaks down entirely – obviously, as it is generated biologically. Bacteria and microbes cause it to decompose if it is taken away from its oxygen-free state. It also decomposes on the surface of marshland. This is what the theory of peat growth is based upon: marshland grows where there is more peat growing than decomposing. As these are the facts, and they are not going to change, I hope that Parliament, the Commission and the Council will make the implicit explicit and make clear mention of peat in the future. This I hope for in the name of environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own amendment, adopted by Parliament in November, restrictions were imposed on the use of peat: the capital would not be touched, but just the interest would be used. Environmental organisations, which based their views on outdated knowledge regarding the carbon cycle of marshlands, paradoxically opposed my design to prevent the exploitation of marshes, and this is the result: greed leads to a sorry end, and so, probably, does environmental greed too. I hope the debate will continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The common position adopted in March differs considerably from the position Parliament adopted at first reading last November, even though the Council has accepted about one third of Parliament’s proposed amendments. The rapporteur went to great lengths to achieve a compromise before the second reading in the EP and explained to the committee that the Council had agreed to eight of the nine compromise amendments during the trialogue held on Tuesday, 19 June.</p>
<p class="contents">The only outstanding point was whether waste incineration should be regarded as a renewable energy source. The Council wants to include it. Members, however, have pointed out that the support given to renewable energy sources must be compatible with the other Community objectives, in particular the principle of "respect for the waste treatment hierarchy". That is why the incineration of non-separated household waste should not be promoted under this directive and under a future support system for renewable energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the two legislative bodies disagreed most profoundly was on the question whether the national targets for the use of renewable energy sources should be mandatory or merely indicative. In November, Parliament called emphatically for mandatory targets, but the Council was opposed. The compromise stipulates that if the Member States have not made progress towards achieving their national indicative objectives, the Commission shall present proposals that may contain mandatory targets. The national indicative targets must be consistent with the global indicative target of 12% of gross national energy consumption by 2010 from renewable energy sources. At the same time, these renewable energy sources must account for a 22.1% indicative share of total Community electricity consumption.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate, on this occasion, my satisfaction at the united effort that sets the important figure of 12% as the target for the share of the European electricity market produced from renewable sources which also benefit the environment to be reached by 2010: we know how topical these issues are, especially in relation to climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that the ‘white gold’, the water used in mountainous areas of Europe to generate hydroelectric power, will clearly acquire greater value as a fundamental resource for the mountain economy. I am pleased that, as recorded in the Minutes, some of the improvements I suggested figure decisively in the text.</p>
<p class="contents">This will make it possible – a substantial, tangible example, albeit on a small scale – for my Valle d’Aosta, an Alpine region par excellence, to focus on and invest in the hydroelectric sector, after being deprived for 40 years of a great asset in terms of the wealth of the local economy by the nationalisation and monopoly of the electricity sector in Italy, a situation which is only now being remedied thanks to the European impetus, which is opening the doors once again for regional competences granted, in the case of my Valle d’Aosta, by the Statute of autonomy.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, it is a good thing that the European Union is attaching due importance to that – by definition – renewable source, hydroelectric power, providing security and incentive mechanisms on the market which will certainly benefit the mountainous areas as well, particularly those where the electricity companies are directly managed by the local communities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Netherlands relatively clean power stations have been shut down to enable dirty electricity to be imported. The replacement as soon as possible of those dirty fuels by solar, wind and hydroelectric power is indispensable for the preservation of our environment. Instead of campaigning actively for new forms of electricity generation the individual consumer is first asked to buy cleaner energy at a different price from another supplier. Those suppliers can now supply less clean electricity than the consumer is asking for. This leads to attempts to include more forms of electricity generation with clean energy. The incineration of undivided organic domestic waste and wood waste has always taken place, and is now suddenly included in the clean category so that targets can be met. My support for the generation of clean energy does not apply to this addition. Large-scale investment that anticipates requests from consumers and is not dependent on waste collection are an alternative to the system at present required by the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Governments regard those funds as part of an integrated financial market designed to contribute to the competitive power of the European economy. In expectation of increased returns pension capital is passed on to companies whose sole object is to make profit. Soon the shareholders of banks and insurance companies start benefiting from profits, the retired bear the increased risk as a result of protective instruments being eliminated and the disadvantages of moving to a different employer or to another Member State are not resolved. The proposed European regulation does not do justice to the reasons why those pension reserves were created. Pensions are a means of redistributing and supplementing incomes, offering everyone lasting social security, even when, at the age of 70, 90 or 110, they are no longer productive. An equal state pension for all of a sufficient amount is the best guarantee that no one loses the right to an income. On the other hand company pensions are only favourable for those with permanent highly paid jobs. They offer no solution to people who have frequently had to change jobs or employers. That is even more true of supplementary private pensions, which are only affordable by those who are able and willing to invest surpluses in an insurance company in their productive years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission proposal is a response to the instructions of the Lisbon Council (23–24 March 2000). The Stockholm Council (23–24 March 2001) confirmed that "the Council will take the necessary measures, together with the Commission, to ensure that the .EU top-level domain is available to users as soon as possible."</p>
<p class="contents">This wording may sound a little far-fetched and need some explanation. The regulation is meant to be a general act laying down a framework for the creation of an ‘.EU’ registry. This registry should enter into contracts both with the Commission and with ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). Let me remind you that ICANN was created in October 1998 in order to stand up to American hegemony in Internet running. This private, non-profit-making company is concerned with four key Internet sectors, including DNS (domain name systems) and allocating Internet Protocol addresses.</p>
<p class="contents">ICANN has a Policy Advisory Board of 19 members. Its external directors and members are appointed on a geographically balanced basis. ICANN also has four advisory committees, including the GAC (Governmental Advisory Committee) to which the European Commission and the Member States belong.</p>
<p class="contents">To my great satisfaction, the European Union has decided to devote more attention to this body so as to play a decisive part in the international running of the Internet and to make ICANN more neutral.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same context, if the European Union wishes to exist in cyberspace, it will have to create a domain name like its Member States. Then the national territories will be able to recognise each other on the Internet by means of domain names such as ‘.uk’ or ‘.be’. That would certainly be a factor in speeding up the development of the e-economy and e-commerce in Europe.</p>

As you know, it was decided at the Council to tackle the issue of pensions in the 15 States of the European Union resolutely. In your opinion, how could I not take the floor to explain why I voted for the motion? Yesterday, at lunchtime, at a meeting of the Kangaroo group, here at the European Parliament, I listened with pleasure to the leader of a Japanese company, who said: ‘We Japanese industrialists are waiting anxiously for there to be a single European pension in Europe, governed by the same rules and laws throughout Europe’. Therefore, I am not the only one to call for a European pension! I rejoice at this and so I voted for this report because the Gothenburg Council has started out along this path. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we should not proceed in a didactic way, but on the basis of respect for the people and nations there. Macedonia has an all-party government in which all the nations are also represented. It has a pro-European prime minister and an outstanding pro-European president. If we continually talk about minority rights, we must acknowledge for once that the European standards on minority rights which we constantly refer to actually do not exist, unfortunately, in the EU itself. We really would be well-advised, therefore, to approach the matter with some measure of humility. We can offer our services, but we should be careful not to adopt a didactic approach all the time.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, we should strengthen the government by making it clear that countries such as Macedonia which work with the European Union will also receive massive political and financial support from us. This was why I thought it was regrettable that Commissioner Patten, who is unfortunately no longer present, said that if we were to provide funds, the money would simply be used for bombs. This was a most inappropriate statement towards this democratically elected all-party government. I hope that our Macedonian friends, represented by their President, will visit us here in Strasbourg soon, and that the visit by Boris Trajkovski can be rescheduled. We must tackle the signs of disintegration, but we can only do so by strengthening the country’s democratic authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is the only conclusion we can draw from the arrogant way the Gothenburg Council dismissed the Irish vote. Today the new President-in-Office of the Council, Guy Verhofstadt, has just confirmed this impression by giving us a preview of the conclusions of the debate that is supposed to be held in preparation for the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">The way this debate is being organised in France, following the communiqué of 11 April this year published jointly by the Prime Minister and the President of the Republic, makes it quite clear that it has been rigged from the start.</p>
<p class="contents">Various people pretend they want to initiate a discussion on the future of Europe, but our country deliberately evaded the issue of the ratification of the Nice Treaty, which is vital in this regard. The Constitutional Council was not consulted, there was no referendum, the debates in the French National Assembly and the Senate were extremely short, the speeches were mediocre, except for those of members of the pro-sovereignty group, including Philippe de Villiers, who seem to be the only ones to have retained their freedom of thought in this debacle that has hit the national political community. This means that the document that is most crucial to the future of the Union, the new supranational developments set out in the Nice Treaty, have been taken out of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, it is clear that everything has been organised in such a way that the discussion forums only produce conclusions acceptable to the federalists. Not only are the meetings prepared by the prefects – which says a lot about their independence vis à vis the government – their conclusions will actually be drafted by a group of ten experts freely chosen by the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister. I myself wrote to the two heads of the executive on 20 April this year to ask them to ensure that this group was made up of all the political elements elected at the European elections. The result is plain to see: among the appointments that have just been made it would be hard to find any opposition, however slight, to the line pursued by Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">To crown it all, this ridiculous procedure is to be closed in October, which means that the great national debate will have lasted four months, of which two were holiday months. But it is easy to understand why it will be concluded so speedily: at the end of the year we will be entering the dangerous period when we have to exchange our national coins and banknotes for euros. Clearly, our national leaders have no wish to be burdened with a debate about Europe at that particular moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The tens of thousands of demonstrators expressing their opposition to the anti-grass roots, autocratic, centralised structure of the ΕU were dealt with by the police with unprecedented violence, proving yet again that the leaders of the ΕU make their decisions without consulting the people. Not only does the European Parliament resolution fail to make any reference to the demands of thousands of demonstrators, let alone the victims of police violence, it also talks of special riot squads, thereby helping to pave the way for even harsher, anti-democratic measures to deal with "the enemy" at future summits of the ΕU and other imperialist organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with the Irish "no" to the Treaty of Nice, the European Parliament has aligned with the Council, which is determined, so it says, to help in any way it can in assisting the Irish government to find a solution, thereby pressurising the Irish government into ratifying the Treaty by the end of 2002 come what may and disregarding the opinion expressed by the Irish people.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the tragic developments in the FYROM, the resolution approves both of the interventionist policy and of NATO’s intention not to get drawn into taking on a full peacekeeping role. Of course, how the EU perceives the process of reaching agreement was clearly expressed by the special envoy Mr Leotard, who called on the government of the FYROM to institute a dialogue with the Albanian extremists.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution even approves of progress made in militarising the ΕU, developing the rapid reaction force and establishing permanent and constructive relations with ΝΑΤΟ and it calls on the Member States to restructure their defence budgets to take account of the sums required in order to achieve the ambitious objectives of the CFSP.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of enlargement, the internal imperialist contradictions which have arisen notwithstanding, its insistence on a policy of trapping new countries in the ΕU is clear, even if the timetable is becoming more and more obscure. At the same time, because they know that grass-roots opposition to the prospect of integration is increasing in the candidate countries, they are trying to lure them with the prospect of taking part in European elections in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, the Gothenburg summit confirmed the direction taken in Lisbon and Stockholm, which requires that the state of the economy be tackled with harsher, even more anti-grass roots measures which hit the workers, starting with the pension system and the national insurance systems in general.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Six months later, with the Gothenburg Council, we have to acknowledge failure.</p>
<p class="contents">In employment, this period was marked by a huge wave of redundancies in large transnational groups that are making millions of euros in profits, like Marks &amp; Spencer and Danone. The EU has once again proved unable to counterbalance the dictatorship of the markets and shareholders, for example by introducing a tax on speculation – such as the ‘Tobin tax’ – by strengthening employees’ and citizens’ rights of economic control or by introducing European-level legislation banning redundancies.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to enlargement, the only prospect opened to the candidate countries is quite simply for their economy to be absorbed into the single market. At no moment will the people concerned be consulted on either the contents or the implications of accession. Yet the Irish ‘no’ vote shows once again that Europe cannot be built without the people and without their support for a democratic, political and social project.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, at international level, the European Union has shown itself unable to make a positive contribution to resolving conflicts, notably by imposing a just and lasting peace in Palestine on Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">The Swedish presidency will be marked mainly by the provocative police actions that punctuated the Gothenburg summit. Instead of embarking as they should on a thorough review of the European projects, the governments, from their bunker, have for the first time turned to violence and fired on the demonstrators. We urgently need a different Europe: a Europe based on democracy and social progress. That is why we voted against the joint motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is like a jumble sale of words, concepts and issues ranging from the death penalty (paragraph 32) to the ‘tax package’ (paragraph 25), via bananas (paragraph 30), Mr Léotard’s diplomatic mission to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which has now become FYROM (paragraph 42), not forgetting residually the CAP, development aid, Kyoto, the US tax fraud via the Caribbean tax havens, enlargement and the need for a convention – in unsaid memory of Philadelphia in 1787 – to adopt a European constitution in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">But beneath all this apparent jumble of bric-a-brac lie the two key notes of the oligarchic sect that governs us, namely contempt for the people and the quest for an obscure world ‘governance’.</p>
<p class="contents">The contempt in which the euro-federal oligarchy in Brussels holds the people is reflected in both paragraph 3, with the refusal to respect the clear implications of the Irish referendum, which is analysed as a kind of deadlock from which ‘a way forward’ must be found, and in paragraph 9, where the spontaneous rejection by the people of the excesses of globalisation – from Seattle to Gothenburg, via Prague, Nice, Davos, Washington, Salzburg and perhaps Genoa next – is condemned as ‘provocation’, forgetting that the right to ‘resist’ the economic pressure the global market is exerting on the women and men of Marks &amp; Spencer and Danone, not to mention Moulinex, Michelin, Vilvorde, Alcatel, Ericsson and AOM, is one of the basic freedoms that was established two centuries before the European Charter, which proclaims for the rich alone formal rights that the unemployed, the excluded young and the old and poor do not, for their part, regard as fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the nine paragraphs devoted to sustained development – even going so far as a world summit in Johannesburg in 2002 – can scarcely conceal, in the dark recesses of this vague concept that has become a kind of catechism, the quest for a global approach that would miraculously resolve the problems, facing Africa in particular, of under-development, the AIDS epidemic and the economic slavery and poverty so skilfully maintained by the free traders who do not pay the real price for cotton, cocoa, coffee and all the raw materials, i.e. the price of the life of the people whose labour they exploit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That section is keen to buy weapons with EU subsidies. They continue to reject an arrangement whereby Albanian becomes the language of administration and education for that part of the country where the Albanian-speakers live.

This is another example of the extremely disturbing decline of democracy in the process of European integration. Alas, the resolution did not do so. Henceforth, however, whenever we consider the future of Europe, and in particular its enlargement, we will have to take this quite unambiguous vote into account.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we deplore the very largely anti-democratic nature of the European Union in its present form and pretend to want to remedy this if we do not begin by respecting the clearly expressed wish of the people, in this case of the only nation asked to pronounce on the new treaty by referendum, an eminently democratic procedure?</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from two referendums that had already shown the growing gap between Europe as it is and the Europe the people want to see, the Irish people’s decision should give us a salutary shock. The lesson to be drawn from the Irish referendum is that Europe can only endure in the long term if it is founded on respect for the national democracies. We urgently need to review completely the way Europe is being constructed, basing it on principles quite different from those of Nice, which should represent the final manifestation of a process that began with the Single Act and continued with Maastricht and Amsterdam, concluding with a Europe that is now rejected by its people.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly this is not the direction the Belgian presidency wishes to pursue. It in fact proposes to make up for the democratic deficit within the Union by introducing a European tax, although only the national parliaments are democratically entitled to levy taxes. It is in favour of having the future treaty drawn up by bodies whose democratic legitimacy is, if not doubtful, at least very indirect. It exalts the euro, which no nation wished to see introduced and which, on the contrary, is emblematic of a Europe imposed on the people against their wishes.</p>

These include, paragraph 3, which may be seen to suggest that the EU is not fully respecting the decision of the Irish people in their referendum to reject the Nice Treaty; paragraph 6 which recommends a controversial Convention model to take the negotiations forward to the next IGC; paragraph 25 which supports the tax package involving tax harmonisation and a withholding tax; paragraph 26 which recommends social-chapter-inspired works council measures; and paragraphs 33 and 34 which are supportive of an independent ESDP which could decouple us from NATO.

As soon as we scratch the surface, however, we discover contradictions, which have extremely serious implications because they go back to certain faults in the construction of the single currency that will be very difficult to put right.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us begin, for example, with the institutional issues. The first difference concerns the powers of the Council of Ministers. The European Parliament’s report advocates the strengthening of economic policy coordination and stability programmes (paragraph 5 of the resolution), which would mean strengthening the Eurogroup and its means of action. The ECB report, however, emphasises that "the first two years of the euro have also shown that the policy-making framework at European level is satisfactory" (page 3). This makes it clear that the Bank is fiercely protective of its independence, knowing full well that the growing political pressure on the management of the single currency, within a monetary zone that is not optimal, risks leading to difficult conflicts. But is management by technocrats any better? To tell the truth, both systems are unworkable.</p>
<p class="contents">The second difference concerns transparency. The European Parliament’s report calls once again (paragraph 14) for the minutes of the ECB Governing Council meetings to be published, together with a summary of the stance of both the approving and dissenting parties. The ECB finds this proposal repugnant, for a very good reason that the European Parliament obstinately refuses to accept: in the specific case of the eurozone, made up of separate nations, conflicts between governors could easily be assimilated with conflicts between nations, which would do further damage to the already weak credibility of the euro. Once again, this brings us back to the non-optimal nature of the monetary zone of the Twelve.</p>
<p class="contents">The third difference concerns voting in the Governing Council. The ECB report upholds the "one member, one vote" principle, because the governors of the national central banks deliberate with entire personal independence and not as representatives of their country (page 181). The European Parliament’s report, for its part, takes note of the reform introduced by the Nice Treaty to Article 10 of the Statute of the ECB, which could make it possible, in future, to weight the votes in accordance with size of country (paragraph 17 of the resolution). That reform would suit the large countries, especially Germany, which is complaining of the ECB’s failure to act, implicitly blaming this on the disproportionate influence of the small countries within the Governing Council. However, this would be very difficult to carry through because it seems contrary to the spirit of Maastricht, to the ECB’s position and to the interests of the small countries, which would have something to say about it. Once again, the idea of a single currency for several nations is beset by contradictions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a short-sighted aim, based on controlling inflation, which ignores the contribution of monetary policy to economic growth and employment. This is a concern which, if carried to the extreme, could cause deflation and unemployment. The ECB is using this aim as a justification, even in the midst of an economic slowdown, for not reducing interest rates to stimulate investment or reducing the costs of excessive debt for families and other economic agents, forgetting that the eurozone is not a homogeneous area and that the cohesion countries in particular, including Portugal, face specific structural difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the policy for monetary stability imposed by the Stability Pact, which the rapporteur is so pleased with, and with which we disagree, even though it does attempt to implement the ECB’s policies, by means of greater economic coordination and greater development of the quarterly dialogue with the European Parliament. The ECB, however, requires effective political supervision and not just economic coordination, which is increasingly linked to the objectives of the Stability Pact and to the EU’s neo-liberal guidelines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Maaten’s proposals attempt to make that process run faster and more efficiently. But the fundamental problem is more connected with the annual report of the European Central Bank. Unlike Mrs Randzio-Plath, the rapporteur, I see no reason for compliments. The value of the euro had to be kept up by means of a stability pact, which forces national governments to reduce the level of expenditure and refrain from taking out loans. That policy has failed completely, now that the euro has fallen considerably below the dollar, not temporarily, but for a considerable amount of time. In the meantime, in a number of Member States, including the Netherlands, annual inflation is already higher than the interest rate. Price stability will probably not survive the coming turn of the year. It no longer looks as if the euro will gain a position as an international currency, as the dollar has. As a result, it is not possible either to follow the American model and pass on a portion of the annual government deficit to the rest of the world, which continues to compete for possession of an exchange currency that is falling in value. In short, the ECB’s efforts have resulted in a flop that forces us to reject this annual report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is precisely why the European Parliament needs to be even stricter and more demanding in its criticism of the ECB’s annual report, because there are results which hit the workers and because it supports closer links between the general guidelines to economic policy and the stability and convergence programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">On the pretext of fighting inflation and adhering strictly to the Stability Pact, that ‘plague’ on the workers, the ECB has activated the sanctions mechanism in order to achieve that wonder of wonders, price stability, while ignoring the economic and social impact of its decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">It announces that wage policy is to be modernised, for which read flexible and insecure labour, and it is pushing for privatisation across the board in order to promote the competitiveness of and reward big business.</p>
<p class="contents">But it says nothing about speculation and "scams" on the money markets, given that its policy of cutting interest rates does everything it can to support them.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, the European Central Bank has raised or lowered its interest rates in line with US interest rates in a bid to fund speculation. Will Mr Duisenberg tell us if he subscribes to the views of his counterpart, Mr Greenspan, who feels that the new growth cycle should be based on greater returns from the huge amount of capital at the disposal of companies whose performance is what will shore up stock prices and trigger a new round of investments?</p>
<p class="contents">He probably agrees because he has told us that the executive board of the ECB is continuing to monitor wage developments and trends in domestic and foreign demand and that, despite the oil crisis, wage increases were moderate, which he described as highly positive, stressing that inflation will be kept to 2% in 2002 thanks to wage restraint, while the monopolies’ profits will, of course, keep on rising.</p>
<p class="contents">What else can we say? The report and the governor of the ECB say it all. They have told us about the acutely negative liberal policy which pushes economies into recession and what they have announced for the workers is greater unemployment, the abolition of everything they have fought for and a guaranteed level of poverty, given that prosperity is reserved for big business, which is getting bigger by the day.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore against the European Parliament’s supporting the policy of the ECB, because it is a policy which generates more poverty for the many, i.e. for the workers, and more profit for the few, i.e. for the European monopolies. It is a policy of inequality and increased exploitation of the workers.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report and we believe that the people will unite in their fight to overturn this anti-grass roots, barbaric and inhumane policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I regret, however, that the ECB does not follow the high standards of transparency, accountability and openness set by the Bank of England. The Bank of England was granted operational independence in May 1997 in one of the first acts of the incoming Labour Government. Minutes of meetings of its Monetary Policy Committee, including voting records and reasoning, are now published after about 6 weeks. This boosts market confidence in its decisions and is a great example of open government.</p>
<p class="contents">It can surely be no coincidence that, since the Labour Government’s brave decision in May 1997, Britain has enjoyed an unprecedented period of economic stability. It can also be no coincidence that the Labour Government’s decision was criticised at the time by the boom-and-bust Tories, who have an outstanding record on economic instability and incompetence.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECB will not have the full confidence of the market until it becomes more open.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Duisenberg will surely face a challenge second to none with the introduction of euro banknotes on 1 January 2002. I welcome the ECB’s decision to distribute euro coins to consumers and larger banknotes to business beforehand. However, I am concerned that shoppers and small and medium-sized enterprises will not have smaller notes in their hands until "e-day" itself. This may well give rise to endless chaos and confusion which should be avoided at all costs. The practical changeover to the euro on 1 January 2002 will clearly be a litmus test for the ECB and I very much hope that it will rise to the challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">I would very much like to see the ECB follow a policy of openness and transparency similar to the Bank of England. It would be perverse for Britain to go from a position of transparency to one of relative secrecy. Therefore, if Britain is ever going to embrace the euro, the ECB must be seen also to embrace greater openness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously, this entire operation was conceived from the outset with no regard whatsoever for the difficulties people come up against in their day-to-day life. And it is still going on.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed what is the point of frontloading the public with euro notes so that they can get used to them (a point which, in fact, has not even been accepted) when at the same time we find that retailers will have to make huge efforts but will receive no financial aid, that they will have no guarantee of counterfeit euros being refunded and that the proposal to allow the national currencies to be used alongside the euro to make life easier for our fellow-citizens was rejected out of hand?</p>
<p class="contents">Not surprisingly, it now turns out that the public is not very enthusiastic. Referring to the information campaigns, the Maaten report even notes that: "it is fair to assess how disappointing the results have been so far" (explanatory statement, page 15). Its reaction, however, is disturbing. The way to motivate small companies is to warn them that it would be illegal not to switch over to the euro after 1 January 2002:"as ‘soft’ campaigns have barely influenced small- and medium-sized companies, there is the need to be more explicit" (<span class="italic">ibidem</span>).</p>
<p class="contents">So Europe will be interfering hugely in the day-to-day life of our fellow-citizens from 1 January 2002. In fact, it will make things worse because the public will realise at once and in a very tangible way that the whole massive changeover operation could only have been conceived by a brain totally indifferent to or ignorant of even the slightest practical problems and that this operation could only prosper in an institutional system cut off from the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Our only hope is that one good thing will come out of it, namely that this experience will help change the course of Europe tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must create macro-economic mechanisms to minimise costs and, in terms of the transition period, the workers and the small and micro-enterprises must not be the ones who ultimately pay for the introduction of the euro, either through an artificial increase in prices or through the costs of the whole process and the attempts at abuse and fraud that could take place over that period.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly important to give effective support to the crucial role of traditional trade in enlightening the public, because these traders are closest to the people. They are a key factor in the entire process of replacing national currencies with the single currency, which requires an extra effort in addition to all of the enormous changes, specifically in terms of accounting, internal and external documentation, IT, etc. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am glad Parliament is finally stating its position on such an important issue, but, at the same time, I regret that it left it until 181 days before the introduction of the euro. It is high time we took a stance on an issue that is an economic priority and continues to give rise to some doubt and disquiet among the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">The Maaten report draws attention to the main problems and suggests practical solutions that could make the switchover to the euro easier. These suggestions should be taken on board at all levels of decision-making and in every sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that the people of Europe also have a key role to play, alongside the companies and financial circles, and that their reactions depend on the effectiveness of the information campaigns conducted so far. Once again, the disappointing results of these campaigns show how necessary it is to make practical proposals that have a direct effect on people’s daily lives.</p>
<p class="contents">If these proposals are put into practice, they should help turn understandable apprehension into legitimate expectation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I note with satisfaction that they have all been adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">During this debate, I very much want to emphasise once again that we must leave the door open to the three Member States that have chosen not to enter the eurozone immediately. Let me therefore point out that it is important to launch an information campaign addressed not only to the Member States that are participating in the single currency project but also to the others, giving them a special position with regard to third countries. Our report sends out a political signal in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Another amendment, which was largely incorporated in the final report, concerned the conversion free of charge into euros of the coins of another euro-zone country. All the citizens of the European Union have amassed foreign coins from their travels abroad on business or pleasure. Many of them will not have a chance to spend them before the new euro coins and notes are introduced on 1 January next year. That is why I put a written question on the subject to the Commission at the end of November last year. The Commission evaded the question by referring to the disproportionate handling charges. Yet I wonder whether it is right to expect the citizens once again to have to pay the price of not being able to exchange the coins they have acquired from other Member States. So I note with satisfaction that Parliament "believes therefore that recommendations should be made to banks to ensure that coins from the twelve eurozone Member States can be exchanged on the same terms as banknotes". I hope the government and banking authorities will not lend a deaf ear, like the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Six months before the entry into force of the single currency, it would be a good idea for Parliament to show an interest in the economic actors and their preparations for this final stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, during this final stage, the Member States have a crucial role to play.</p>
<p class="contents">For instance, some economic operators will be tempted to raise prices by unfairly rounding them off upwards.</p>
<p class="contents">As chairman of the Marseilles tourist office, I have heard tell of practices of this kind and of the anxiety of some of the professionals involved.</p>
<p class="contents">A period of adjustment will be needed for the establishment of the single currency, during which the consumers will have to be reassured rather than exploited.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic actors concerned must realise that it is wrong to give priority to immediate small profits over consumer confidence and the smooth changeover to the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also point to the importance of flanking measures for all small and medium-sized companies.</p>
<p class="contents">In the tourist sector, for instance, I find that many of them are not adequately prepared. I deplore this and I assume economic operators in other sectors are just as vague.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of introducing tax incentives put forward in Mr Maaten’s report is a good one.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on directly from that, the Member States must endeavour to find ways of encouraging the economic operators to start thinking in terms of the euro very soon, so that they will not have to pay the price of further delays.</p>

<p class="contents">When, for once and with considerable effort, the Liberal Democrat Group managed to vote as one and we find ourselves on the losing side of such a vote, it is all the more important to us to raise this issue.

If that is the case, it explains everything and I return to what I said at the beginning: what matters is the declaration of the results by the presidency; if not, we are led to a very dangerous interpretation which takes us nowhere.

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this morning a vote took place which the electronic system recorded as a draw of 273 votes to 273 votes. The electronic system accurately reflected the reality of the House at that moment.

This difference must naturally have an explanation, and a simple and logical explanation.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the explanation is that a recent replacement had not yet been incorporated into the list available to the services. This is, as I say, a simple explanation of a perfectly understandable circumstance which I would even go as far as to say was trivial.</p>
<p class="contents">You now know the explanation, which will be given in detail at the Conference of Presidents which has been called for the purpose for 4.15 p.m., although I am telling you in advance.

However, the Conference of Presidents – and this is why I have risen again – can only accept information from the President of Parliament again; it has no right to make any further amendments to any decisions announced this morning by the President.</p>

I was personally aware of the explanation, which you have now given publicly. It is an unfortunate technical slip-up, but I accept it was an honest mistake. I also accept the declaration, albeit reluctantly. But if it is merely a technical slip-up, it would be a political mistake to call a Conference of Presidents for the purpose of dealing in a political organ of the House with something for which there is a perfectly reasonable technical explanation. I shall not attend such a meeting because it seems to me you should make a ruling from the Chair and we should be done with the matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We accept the logical reason that you have given, but I have to ask you a further question. Was the Member who replaced Mr Casini indeed entitled to vote, as Mr Casini’s resignation was only announced on Monday evening. Under Rule 8 of the Rules of Procedure, there has to be an exchange of letters between the European Parliament and the Italian Government so that we can actually confirm his entitlement to vote and if that is the case, of course, it is a valid vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
