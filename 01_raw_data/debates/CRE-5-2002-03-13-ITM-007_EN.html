One might have thought that the tragedy of 11 September would prompt the countries of Europe to engage in some soul-searching on the reasons why the international Islamic terrorist network chose Europe as a location for the bases from which they struck at the United States. So what particular facilities do our countries offer, and how can these be rooted out? What consequences should be drawn from the exploitation of asylum procedures by terrorist networks, etc.?</p>
<p class="contents">Our police forces have certainly worked hard in close cooperation with the U.S. authorities. Their enquiries have revealed the extent to which terrorists have set up bases in our countries. When it comes to analysing the significance of 11 September, on the other hand, a considerable gulf is developing between the two sides of the Atlantic, with one side regarding it as an isolated operation and the other as a manifestation of the new global terrorist scene, dominated by hyperterrorism. The communication from the Council indicates this. The effective measures to deal with the nature and scale of the common threat is not its main concern and a very minimalist response seems to be envisaged. There is only a vague mandate to draw up, sometime or other, an agreement on mutual judicial assistance. This, Mr President, is a strange and dangerous divergence which may well seriously encumber transatlantic relations and our own security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is extremely disappointing because we assumed that President Bush would be one of the main champions of the market economy, and not that he would belong with the campaigners for protectionist measures. It would, of course, be understandable if he were to take such measures for electoral reasons, but based on his undertaking to act in favour of free trade, this is, naturally, an incomprehensible attitude which we must unreservedly condemn.</p>
<p class="contents">It is all the more disappointing since we have just started the fourth ministerial meeting in the framework of the Doha world trade talks, now being overshadowed by a measure of that kind. And that is not the last we have heard of it, for if I understand it correctly, the United States wants to adopt the same line for agricultural products too.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this is completely the wrong route to take. In the case of steel alone, I should like to point out that my country, the Netherlands, has made considerable efforts, together with your country, to restructure the steel industry. This has, both directly and indirectly, led to thousands of job losses in both our countries. This means, therefore, that we would have to pay the price for the lack of restructuring in the United States. In my opinion, the European Union has tabled sound proposals to consider whether a kind of fund could be set up to help restructure the steel industry in the United States. These proposals have, of course, been dismissed, which means, therefore, that we cannot make any more headway, and that the high costs of steel in America – certainly not simply due to the expensive dollar, but also, of course, due to the social security schemes and pensions in the steel industry – have, in fact, been passed on to us.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, Barcelona should be used to launch a diplomatic offensive, alongside the normal measures which you, Commissioner Lamy, have to take, obviously, by threatening the United States with countermeasures. However, what matters is that we should also use Barcelona to launch a diplomatic offensive in order to make it clear to the United States that protectionist measures of this kind only lead to major disruption in free trade and with it, to a huge upset in the creation of jobs. It is exactly the opposite signal from the one we need: we all want to create more jobs globally. Yet, what is happening now is the reverse. I would therefore call on the Commission and the Council – and I am pleased that the Council is here today – at least to ensure that initiatives are taken in Barcelona. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After the Cold War, they spoke out for multilateral agreements which were intended to reduce, both in terms of quantity and quality, weapons systems, particularly nuclear weapons, to a minimum. Europe has opted to use the peace dividend to bridge the poverty gap. Today, we are facing over one hundred regional conflicts in the multipolar world, which mainly claim civilian victims, and often too we are confronted with financed illegal trade in arms and in raw materials, such as oil and diamonds. Our strength was, and still is, conflict prevention. States are crumbling in Africa. Warlords very cunningly join forces with international terrorist networks, and intense cooperation between all Member States of international rule of law is the only answer. Europe must be an independent, critical, yet outspoken, partner of a multilaterally trading United States. In this light, unilateral US policy should be condemned – as Mr Patten and Mr Solana did, rightly so – while joint action should be supported. Of great importance and urgency to the Middle East is a joint project to be set up immediately between the EU and the UN, as was mentioned this morning. We should then like to grant priority to the fight against international terrorist networks and to the situation in Iraq. However, we should like to do this via the UN, and not unilaterally. We would underline that all these initiatives are not in the context of an old fashioned kind of anti-Americanism, but are based on the recognition that all good-willed people need each other. Nobody can regulate the world on their own. The rumours in the Los Angeles Times that the Pentagon is forging plans to use nuclear weapons against seven States, including Russia and China, are of great concern to us in particular. This contravenes international treaties which aim to commit all countries to a reduction in nuclear arms, in the knowledge that we now have the capacity to kill each other many times over. We would ask the Commission and Council to lodge an urgent and forceful protest against the build-up of a fresh and dangerous nuclear arms race. We still believe that the best way to achieve security is to bridge the chasm between rich and poor, by means of which we want to create a world which forms common ground for all people of goodwill, as opposed to international terrorists. We would like to see this initiative of Europe and the United States take shape, also specifically in Monterrey, when the 0.7% is activated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe and the United States are adopting increasingly threatening language with each other on a variety of topics. Only last week, President Bush unleashed a fresh trade war by restricting steel imports by means of import tariffs. The European Union was right to lodge a complaint with the World Trade Organisation about these Draconian measures. Although our trade disputes with the US only concern one to two per cent of our trade and investment flows, they can cause a great deal of damage to our mutual relations. Trade disputes are always catching the headlines and undermine the political relationship, which is already very fragile at this time. Each new trade dispute is one too many. Consequently, more efforts must be made to nip potential conflicts in the bud as a matter of urgency. Transatlantic relations desperately need new positive impulses in the interest of us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lucas (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, the Greens have spent more than a decade endeavouring to expose the myths at the heart of the free-trade theory. Now we know for sure, as we have always suspected, that the rhetoric of the US and its major corporations was a sham. Far from being at the centre of a development agenda to help poorer nations out of poverty, the US tariff barriers reveal how that country uses trade rules to gain access to other people's markets, while protecting its own industrial interests at home. The US view is clearly that free trade is a one-way street for a superpower: good for US exporters, but not so good for US domestic industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrast that with the unequivocal lectures given by the US to developing countries at the WTO meeting in Doha, to the effect that, by liberalising their markets, they will automatically reap the benefits of globalisation. Poverty eradication and sustainable development are somehow automatically meant to follow, yet poorer countries have known for a long time that this is often far from the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the one good thing that could come out of President Bush's unilateral introduction of tariffs on steel imports would be a much-needed serious debate about the flaws and weaknesses inherent in the free-trade model, because there is growing opposition to the global inequality inherent in its <span class="italic">diktat </span>that every country must put international competitiveness above all other domestic concerns. The reaction against this ranges from Indian farmers calling for an increase in tariffs to protect themselves from cheap food imports, through to steel workers, including fully restructured UK steel workers, who find that they will now still be unable to compete with Romanian steel exports.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are some retaliatory actions that the EU should consider, which will send the right signal to the US. I would like the Council and Commission's views on them. For example, since the US has refused to implement the Kyoto Protocol because of the perceived impact this would have on US business, the EU should levy an energy tax on all US-manufactured goods. Or we might consider the issue of a complete ban on all imports of US-produced GM foods, since US pressure exerted under free-trade rules has prevented EU ministers from reflecting popular opinion by banning such foods from markets here. The time is long overdue for the EU to call Mr Bush's bluff. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let us begin with the decision to tax steel imports at rates of up to 30% and to impose quotas. As the main exporter to the United States, the Union is the primary target of these measures. And yet European steel imports have fallen by 33% since 1998, and so they are not the cause of the problems in the U.S. steel industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming on top of the differences over hormone-treated beef and GMOs, these measures are likely to have serious economic and social repercussions for the European steel industry. The Commission would therefore be well advised to bring a complaint before the WTO, as Mr Lamy announced, as well as to apply retaliatory measures without delay against US exports.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, this latest decision by the Bush Administration testifies to a strengthened desire on the part of the US Government to adopt a unilateral approach in numerous domains: on the commercial and economic as well as the cultural and military fronts, and this last front is the focus of deep concern. The <span class="italic">New York</span> <span class="italic">Times </span>has just published a report indicating the existence of a secret Pentagon plan targeting Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria and North Korea and even Russia and China. The plan apparently envisages the possibility of using nuclear arms for offensive purposes, for example in the framework of an Arab-Israeli conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">To quote John Isaac, a leading figure in the voluntary sector in the United States, Doctor Strangelove is alive and well and working in the Pentagon. This lurch by the American superpower, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, towards a permanent war footing poses an intolerable threat to the entire planet.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States is redefining its role in the world around one single obsession, namely its own security. But in this world, right cannot be exclusively and invariably on the side of the Americans. It was impossible not to be concerned at the words of John Bolton, Under Secretary at the Department of State, who fired this broadside during the Conference on Disarmament, and I quote: ‘Our policy is, quite simply, pro-American’ and ‘The United States … will meet this threat with every method at our disposal’.</p>
<p class="contents">This policy, which entails a 15% increase in the military budget, equivalent in monetary terms to the entire state development aid provided by all OECD member countries, along with the planned anti-missile defence system, is liable to provoke a new arms race. The fight against terrorism, on the other hand, involves identifying its roots and seeking real solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">And again, the United States is obstructing progress towards a fairer world by refusing to ratify several international conventions, such as those on the rights of the child, disarmament, biological weapons, the International Criminal Court, climate change, the Kyoto process and a host of others, not to mention the failure of the United States to adopt a sufficiently impartial position on the Middle East conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">We can no longer be silent on the death penalty, a crime perpetrated by the state, where it is administered by a superpower that seeks to impose its order and its values on the world. We want nothing to do with that particular value. Numerous people, including US citizens, reject that vision of the world and aspire to globalisation based on solidarity. This was one of the messages that emerged from the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre. Europe must take heed of the ardent hopes of those who are exhorting us to play our part in the pursuit of that goal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been able to resolve many trade conflicts in a professional way that satisfied both sides, but only because we have accepted binding rules for free and fair world trade within the framework of the WTO, and also because the WTO is the only international organisation that has a dispute resolution system that also provides for sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">However, with the punitive tariffs the United States is now imposing on steel imports, they are abandoning the common ground that we have so far occupied under the WTO. It is extremely hard for us Europeans to understand these measures, as they primarily hit our steel products. Almost half of Europe's steel exports to the USA are affected by these punitive tariffs. What is more, we Europeans can expect to suffer twice over from the American measures, because of diverted trade flows. That is something we are not prepared to accept. We will not support the Americans' game of playing off their workers' interests against those of our own workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few years, the European steel industry has had great success in carrying out restructuring, but this has involved enormous job losses, making this a very painful process. It must be clear for the United States that it is not in their interest to undermine confidence in the WTO's system of multilateral rules and its impartial conflict resolution system at the beginning of the Doha Round. In the case of bilateral contacts with the USA, the European Union needs to firmly demonstrate to our American partner that this serious and unwarranted interference in free world trade will not be simply accepted, and that we will make use of the mechanisms currently at our disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is the Commission not considering using the mechanisms available to it in accordance with the decision of the WTO panel on US export promotion and taking countermeasures? I believe it is now necessary for us to make that clear to the Unites States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

President Bush's decision to impose steel tariffs is irrational. The tariffs are a flagrant breach of world trade rules. There has been no sudden calamitous increase in imports. US steel has been uncompetitive and in deep trouble over a long period; it has not become so suddenly. Tariffs will not solve the US steel problem, but they will badly harm America's allies. They will destroy American jobs in other sectors and they will damage world trade relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Knowing all this, why would President Bush take this irrational decision? We know why. He wants to buy votes in steel-producing areas come November and is so desperate to do so that he will gladly sacrifice his international credibility – and we in the EU and others elsewhere in the world are meant to pay the price! Talk about collateral damage! Of course, this cannot be tolerated. We do not subsidise steel, we do not dump steel. We went through terrible times to make our steel competitive. Our market is open. There is no possible justification for this deliberate attack on the livelihood of European steel workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Remember, this is the President who thinks he can provide world leadership. Global leader in military power he may be, but he is a global dunce in citizenship and respect for others. Commission: take him on. You have all of us behind you and you have the tools to ensure that you can act both legally and effectively. Go for it! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am appalled at the concomitant weakening of the all-important transatlantic alliance that this creates: an alliance that is the world's greatest force for peace today and one that gives unrivalled opportunities for prosperity to the world's 1 billion poorest people.</p>
<p class="contents">But since the European Union and the USA share essential values, I cannot believe that the US seriously intends to follow this destructive course of action. I therefore see this as a purely political manoeuvre – President Bush placating domestic and special-interest lobbies. We must be tough and then we will succeed. The cause is good. The arguments are correct. I firmly support the Commission and the Council of Ministers and I believe that with EU backing and pressure, the World Trade Organization will act correctly and throw out the US position, and that President Bush will welcome this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the contrary, it appears today that relations have been weakened. The North Atlantic Alliance, which took the decision to invoke Article 5 of its charter for the first time, is in crisis because the Americans did not see the need to enlist the aid of its organisational structure in the war in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">NATO is mulling over this manifestation of unilateralism, and no one within the organisation wishes to see it as proof of the Americans’ indifference towards their European allies. I too support this view and share the ensuing frustration, but I do not subscribe to the overall conclusions drawn from it.</p>
<p class="contents">I have always been a proponent of the idea that the prevention and management of crises by the international community should be regionalised. Our experience at the start of the Balkan crisis showed us that sending in troops from all corners of the earth, from Vancouver to Vladivostok and from Moscow to Buenos Aires, for all its huge symbolic value, was not an efficient way to proceed. Effective intervention in the maintenance and restoration of peace in specific parts of the world depends on familiarity with the culture and history of the country in crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what prompted the international community to support the establishment of a pan-African peacekeeping force, for example. It is also what prompted the Americans to base their operations in Kabul directly on the provision of support to the Afghan forces who were opposed to the barbaric dictatorship of the Taliban.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said in Brussels in 1993, the primary mission of NATO is to intervene in European territory and on the fringes of Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, in order to guarantee and develop peace and stability throughout these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the Alliance, I believe it is legitimate that the Americans, who are aware of our prosperity, require us to assume an increasing share of the burden of maintaining a European defence system that has hitherto fallen almost entirely on them. I believe that Europe must prepare itself to take over a leadership role which the Americans are willing to transfer to us gradually. To this end, the governments of the Union must possess the necessary will and must provide the necessary resources. Do you believe, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that Europe is finally ready to assume this role? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that transatlantic relations are regularly subjected to crucial tests. What we are experiencing now is nothing new; it is not a new conflict. Steel is an old chestnut. As many Members have already indicated, we need to proceed with sufficient toughness. But we should also be guided by reason, wisdom and far-sightedness.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office of the Council has pointed out that our relations are historical ones and that we have many values in common, but that we need to shift from a crisis situation to a process of dialogue. I would certainly support him in that. However, this also means that the Council needs to consider new initiatives. It was the Spanish Presidency that established the new transatlantic agenda. I believe that the Spanish Presidency should also undertake an analysis and a review and present new proposals at the next summit. I would like to ask what work you have done on this so far and what the nature of the Spanish Presidency's proposals will be.</p>
<p class="contents">We need an update, as James Elles said this morning. We need an EU strategy that goes beyond what we have at present. The Commission proposal is good, but it does not go far enough, and it does not cover all factors. In particular, it does not include a sufficiently clear EU strategy. Commissioner Lamy said today that he is investigating several areas, including intellectual property and the auditing of accounts. In my own report, which I shall be presenting on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy together with James Elles for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I shall be presenting some proposals on this.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, you will be interested to see that economic relations are very close and that in many sectors it is already fair to talk about a transatlantic market. That does not of course mean that trade conflicts can just be glossed over, quite the opposite. A small delegation of us will be in Toledo on Monday, and the topic of relations between the USA and the WTO will be on the agenda. I would be grateful if you could briefly say something more about our approach at that meeting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With a straight face, he has proclaimed unilateral measures, measures which a) are counter-productive to transatlantic relations, b) do not conform to WTO agreements and c) will lead to a wave of protectionism in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">A 30% import tariff on steel, mainly aimed at the European Union, is a great injustice. Has our European steel sector in recent years not been restructured very successfully? We do not have overcapacity now. Due to the import restriction in the United States, the price of steel will increase over there, upon which the urgent restructuring of the American steel sector can be funded. However, the outcome for Europe is an increase in imports through dumping on our market, which translates into falling steel prices, with all its implications, particularly for employment. A company such as Corus in the Netherlands and in England will be hit extremely hard, for this latter scenario will lead to a huge number of job losses.</p>

When it was privatised, it experienced a traumatic time with the loss of plants and jobs, and morale was at rock bottom. However, it had to be endured to secure any future at all. We do not want that to happen again because an outside agency such as the United States has seemingly broken WTO rules, especially since the US itself should restructure old plants, rationalise employment and pension practices so that its own industry is improved, but not at the expense of European industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it disturbing, to say the least, that Romania is one of the countries exempted by the United States of America. Romania is home to Sidex, closely connected to Ispat, the firm controlled by Lakshmi Mittal, which gave Tony Blair and the Labour Party GBP 125 000 for their general election campaign and then lobbied President Bush harder than anyone else to impose 30% tariffs that would protect his United States and Romanian steel interests at a potentially deadly cost to British plants and jobs. Just whose side is Tony's crony on? It does not appear to be British and European workers, since Mittal will make an estimated USD 1 billion from this deal. That GBP 125 000 gift was a real steal – a cheap and cynical investment that will literally pay dividends.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Labour Government is not our answer – the Commission is. We must support the Commissioner in his determined attempts to protest and, if necessary, retaliate – but carefully. We need the OECD talks to continue and to produce success.

<p class="contents">What is happening is that, like any relationship, there are two sides to it, and we are now seeing that the Bush Administration is strongly tempted to act on its own; that is, to practise the Frank Sinatra doctrine: ‘I’ll do it my way’, both in politics – I only have two minutes and I cannot expand on this – and in trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Trade never used to be an area that tested this relationship: we considered trade disputes to be an exception, while trade benefits were the rule. Now, however, they have gone too far, on both steel and another product that is less talked about: clementines. The cases are different: clementines affect just one country (the region, by the way, where Commissioner Solbes comes from) and steel affects us all. Both cases go against the WTO rules without any justification at all and, what is more, they imply self-punishment by the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to withstand both the indirect damage – I believe traffic diversion measures can be taken – and the direct damage. There are several possibilities: one is to take action within the WTO, but that will take time and, in the long run, we shall all be dead; there is also the possibility of <span class="italic">laissez-faire</span>, of doing nothing, because the derived industries that import steel inputs will become less competitive and therefore we will be able to take over from them; but what I believe we must to is act immediately.

<p class="contents">What worries me most in this love-hate relationship, however, is not so much what has happened but what the future holds, which is that the Republican administration is on the point of succumbing to the temptation of protectionism, as shown right now in two cases: steel, which has been explained enough – and on this I fully endorse what my colleague Mr Atkins has said – and clementines, which have also been mentioned by Mr Westendorp. In the latter case, as this House knows, the United States unilaterally closed its borders on 30 November.</p>

<p class="contents">What I am asking right now is that the same efficacy that people are trying to demonstrate on the matter of steel should also be demonstrated in the case of clementines. This is an even more flagrant case because, while in the first case it is a matter of imposing tariffs, which in my view are abusive and completely illegal, in the second it is about an even more drastic measure: the closing of borders. This matter really does need to be taken to the WTO, but they will only reach a solution to this conflict, in the case of clementines, once several harvests have passed, and I therefore call for immediate compensation and reparations.</p>
<p class="contents">What we must do is make the United States sit round a negotiating table and work out a solution to the steel and clementines issues, by setting in motion the forceful measures to which my good friend and compatriot Mr Westendorp has referred. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Désir (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, in the wake of 11 September the United States seemed to want to engage in a policy of broad partnership on an international scale. It paid off its arrears to the UN and held consultations with the Europeans and many others. However, since the State of the Union address, a hard unilateralist line has come to the fore. This change of course appears to create the risk of serious aberrations, judging by the Pentagon report on the revision of US policy on the use of nuclear weapons, which could include the possibility of a first strike against Russia, China and many other countries. This creates a difficult and disturbing atmosphere for transatlantic relations, which is compounded by the recent decisions on steel. At the present time, it is important that Europe should reaffirm its role as a major partner whose friendship and solidarity depend on reciprocity. This is essential if we want a balanced relationship between Europe and the United States, but it is even more essential for the stability of the world. Europe must emphasise the impossibility of dealing with the instability, the dangers, the imbalance of today’s world by merely wielding a big stick; it must emphasise that we also need to gain the upper hand in the struggle for peace, that we need to devote the same energy today to the fight against inequalities in the field of development and to defusing hotbeds of tension like the Middle East as has been applied to the struggle against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as steel is concerned, Europe must take a firm line. It is right and proper to issue a reminder, as Commissioner Lamy did this morning, of the need to submit to multilateral disciplines. It is also crucial that we do not hesitate to ensure that other governments comply with rulings that the WTO makes in favour of Europe. It will be obvious that I refer here to the Foreign Sales Corporation. And so I should like to ask the Commission if it has the intention of applying the retaliatory trade sanctions that the WTO has authorised us to impose, given the decisions that the United States has just taken on steel imports and the violations of trade agreements that the United States has already committed through its use of export subsidies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have strong bonds rooted in our respective pasts and we share many common values. The strengthening of our long-standing transatlantic relationship is to our mutual benefit. However, this has to be a relationship based on equality and mutual respect.</p>
<p class="contents">In America's hour of need, after the 11 September attacks, Europe responded with unstinting support and solidarity, and rightly so. Regrettably, though, the same sort of solidarity and cooperation has not been reciprocated in US foreign policy. Prior to 11 September, it was absent on the issue of Kyoto. It is non-existent with regard to a common approach on the Middle East, which is our most critical contemporary political problem, and on which the US unfortunately adopts a partisan role. It was cast aside by the recent decision on the part of the US to impose import tariffs on steel.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the return to US unilateralism – especially evident in its perceived intention to extend the war on terrorism to Iraq – displays contempt for our role in international affairs. It would seem that for the US, the transatlantic relationship is simply one of convenience, to be used when it suits, but ignored when US policy and interests take priority.</p>
<p class="contents">All these experiences, particularly those in recent days, underline how essential it is for the EU to strengthen its foreign policy role, including its defence and military capabilities, so that a proper equilibrium can be established in our transatlantic relationship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At that meeting, we will be pressing for more action to be taken in relation to deregulation, for more liberalisation, ensuring that we learn the lessons of employment flexibility. There are those of us who have felt ever since we have arrived in the European Parliament that there is a lot of rhetoric in this place about free trade, but that there is also a great deal of protectionism with Member States here in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The entire agenda in Europe of taking forward a uniform competition policy and bearing down on state aid is geared towards ensuring that we have free trade. In those circumstances, those of us who count ourselves as the best friends of the United States are hugely disappointed by the action that the US President has taken. It is not putting it too strongly to say that, in a sense, we feel betrayed by it.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not link this to our support for the United States following the events of 11 September. The events of 11 September were so horrific that they should not be linked with any sort of agreement in any other policy area. But for those of us who have been pointing to the United States as an example of a deregulated and liberalised economy, it has been a shattering blow to see the way in which President Bush, faced with the difficulties that his steel industry is encountering, has gone for protectionism. What is even worse is to read in the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> today a justification of this action from Robert Zoellick, the US Trade Representative. I feel sorry for Mr Zoellick, whom again we would regard as a friend of British Conservatives, because I must say that article destroys any credibility that he had in terms of discussion of trade issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States representatives watching this debate need to know that, while we may have heard from the usual suspects in terms of anti-Americanism, those of us who are friends of the United States feel very badly let down indeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The dingy of the European Union is struggling hard to cope with the waves of American power display. The steel crisis is mainly political. President Bush is backed internally by his electorate. Retribution or a political reaction were not likely from the outside world, which opened up the opportunity to pass on the problem of unemployment to the outside world. The European Union dingy is now wearily following a course of legal procedures. We must take full advantage of all the options and means available to us within the WTO. Our retaliation must be convincing. But even so, it does not give much hope of a positive outcome in the short term. Our boat should be big enough to weather the storms. But we also need good helmsmanship. A political crisis does require a political answer, and we must deliberate upon this.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, I should like to urge the Commission, and above all, Commissioner Liikanen, to take political action internally. We must build a solid ship. We hardly have a steel policy left, let alone a steel strategy. We are on an ocean without any rescue boats for the workers. If there is anything to learn from the steel crisis, it is that European steel policy should be restored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know that the tariffs have simply been put there for short-term political advantage and we regret it for that alone. But we must also stand united behind some clear, firm and serious action.

<p class="contents">The Commission must now act swiftly within the WTO to overturn these tariffs. We must see safeguarding measures brought in to prevent a flood of cheap imports from damaging our own industry.

<p class="contents">As the Foreign Minister has already stated in his introductory speech as President-in-Office of the Council, our commercial policy is a common one, and the European Commission has full autonomy and authority to make whatever decisions are appropriate. Accordingly, I believe the Commission has, on behalf of the European Union, taken a firm stand on the steel problem, a stand that was publicly expressed and unanimously adopted by the Council of Ministers last Monday.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe we must trust the Commission’s ability – as I have said – to deal with this matter, protest as appropriate, call for suitable compensation and use retaliatory measures, while fully complying with World Trade Organisation rules. The Presidency-in-Office of the Council believes that our most powerful option is to call on the United States to comply with the rules that all the founders of the World Trade Organisation have set for themselves. It is therefore very important that the European Union should set the example that we are the first to comply with not only the procedures but also the rules of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The clementine issue has also been mentioned – another trade issue with the United States that has yet to be resolved. In this respect, the Presidency-in-Office can only say that it is up to the Member State affected – in this case Spain – to submit its claim to the Article 133 Committee and the Commission will act in accordance with what the Committee decides. Everything seems to indicate that the measures adopted are disproportionate to the alleged threat from the so-called Mediterranean fly, which has been the argument used by the United States to ban the import of clementines. These points will be assessed by the Article 133 Committee, which deals with such matters, and the Commission will be given a mandate to act accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to other considerations that have been expressed here on the United States’ lamentable tendency to act unilaterally in many areas, not only in these matters of trade policy but also in other matters of general policy, the Presidency can only agree with many of the positions expressed here. I therefore believe that the forthcoming EU-US Summit to be held in Washington on 2 May will be a good opportunity for the Presidency of the Council and the Presidency of the Commission to remind the United States’ President that the spirit of the Transatlantic Declaration, which, as has been mentioned, was signed in 1995, binds the parties to maintain a spirit of cooperation, to seek common ground and not to seek ground that separates us and, in the fine tradition of the intense relationship between the United States and Europe, it is in the interests of both parties, the United States and Europe, to seek points of agreement and not of disagreement. Positions that separate the United States not only from the European Union but also from the general current of international opinion are, of course, not at all helpful in finding points of agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this debate has been highly fruitful; we shall incorporate many of the opinions we have heard here into the general corpus on which we shall reflect in order to prepare the forthcoming transatlantic summit, and so I should like to thank you, Mr President, and this Parliament for all the ideas that have been put forward in this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today’s debate has drifted towards the existing conflicts between the United States and the European Union, particularly the steel dispute, although other matters have also been mentioned. The major problem facing us is what we should do. According to some of you, the best formula is to establish a link between the steel dispute and other trading problems with the Union. Really, though, as our strong point is upholding multilateralism, it is reasonable that we should attack that contradiction by applying multilateral rules. We do not think it is a good solution and it is not the one that best serves the Union’s long-term interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Others amongst you have suggested linking this issue to other matters; the Foreign Sales Act has been mentioned, as has the matter of hormones. Again we wonder whether seeking a package solution dependent on a political debate is the formula we should be using.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the strength of our position with the United States lies in the need to comply with what has been agreed multilaterally. This must be the road we take; we therefore consider that the first decision, without any question, is to use all existing procedures within the World Trade Organisation, and by all procedures we mean not only those that will take a long time to implement but also the necessary retaliatory measures, but all this must be done through the World Trade Organisation. This may, of course, make it necessary for us to implement specific safeguard clauses which, I may say in advance, we intend will affect developing countries as little as possible, since our opinion on safeguard clauses is not to close off our markets but to maintain our traditional trade relations with our suppliers.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the possibility some of you have suggested of making restrictive voluntary agreements to reduce exports is not compatible with the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the clementines case – the President-in-Office of the Council has already referred to this matter – I shall only point out that we are negotiating with the United States in an attempt to find a solution to the problem before the next harvest. Clearly, in this case too, just as in the last one, we are prepared to use all the legal resources established in the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been pleased to see the broad consensus among the European institutions regarding the need to make multilateral institutions work and to tackle the challenges of globalisation by seeking the best of solutions with our American counterparts and seeking to ensure that the unilateral option is not the one chosen.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse Pascal Lamy’s comments here this morning that it would be fundamental to seek an agreement, as we have seen here, among all those supporting a new and positive boost to transatlantic relations. However, that must not mean failing to tackle existing problems with all the means or all the facts at our disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, right now we are studying and working on various options, and any new contribution this House might make would be welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to thank you for your unambiguous support for the firm line held by the Commission. We hope that the resolution you are to vote on will strengthen the European Union’s positions on this fundamental issue for us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
