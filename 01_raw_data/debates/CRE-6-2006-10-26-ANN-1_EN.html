<p>(FI) This answer, which has been drafted by the Presidency, which in itself is not binding on the Council or its members, was not presented orally in Council Question Time in the first part-session held by the European Parliament in Strasbourg in October 2006.</p>
<p>During the Finnish presidential term the Council has been actively monitoring events inside Serbia. Serbia is about to have a new constitution, which the country’s parliament adopted unanimously on 30 September 2006. Its citizens will be given the chance to vote on acceptance of the constitution in a referendum on 28 and 29 October. The Council will be following this closely. The European Union’s principle instrument for the western Balkans is the Stabilisation and Association Process. Its frame of reference is the Copenhagen criteria, for example, political criteria including the rights of minorities. The closer the countries in the region get to the European Union, the more stringently the conditions need to be complied with. The European Union Monitoring Mission (EUMM) is observing the situation on site, and other international players, such as the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe, are also monitoring the situation in Vojvodina and are exchanging information with the EU on it. The Council intends to follow what is happening there with reference to a regular progress report by the Commission. The report is due out on 8 November, and it will provide an assessment of the situation in Serbia regarding issues such as democracy, the rule of law, human rights and the protection of minorities. The Council will be continuing its close scrutiny of events in Serbia.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0813"></a>

<p>By signing Protocol No 4 on the Ignalina nuclear power plant in Lithuania, annexed to the Act of Accession to the European Union, Lithuania committed itself to closing unit 1 of the Ignalina nuclear power plant before 2005 and unit 2 by 2009.

<p>Last year’s energy crisis between Ukraine and Russia; the disruption of the oil supply from Russia to Lithuania in July, blamed on technical reasons affecting only Lithuania, without a resolution favourable to both sides being sought; the stalling of the project to build an electricity power line between Poland and Lithuania; the absence of a common EU energy policy and of common energy networks (electricity, gas) and the lack of solidarity on the part of EU Member States threaten Lithuania with isolation from energy suppliers. There is increasing dependence on Russia, which is threatening to export its energy supplies to other countries.</p>
<p>Given this uncertain state of affairs, could Lithuania apply Article 37 of the Act of Accession and prolong the operation of the Ignalina nuclear power plant, provided that safety standards allow, until Lithuania’s energy problems are solved?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FI) This answer, which has been drafted by the Presidency, which in itself is not binding on the Council or its members, was not presented orally in Council Question Time in the first part-session held by the European Parliament in Strasbourg in October 2006.</p>
<p>Article 4 of Protocol No 4 annexed to the Act of Accession, considered in conjunction with Article 37 of the Act of Accession, lay down conditions whereby Lithuania can, up to the year 2012, request permission to apply the general safeguard clause referred to in Article 37, if there are disruptions in the energy supply in Lithuania.</p>
<p>Article 37 of the Act of Accession makes it clear that, to avail itself of this opportunity, the Member State in question has first to request permission from the Commission to take safety precautions, with reference to relevant background data. The Commission then endorses the safety precautions that it deems necessary. The Commission thus has to assess whether to give permission for taking the action which the honourable Member refers to.</p>
<p>The Council would also ask the honourable Member to take note that the Council really does consider security of the supply of energy to be one of the cornerstones of Europe’s energy policy, as the conclusions from the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council meeting in March 2006 (‘A New Energy Policy for Europe’) and those of the March 2006 European Council (‘European Energy Policy’) will confirm.</p>
<p>The Union has stated in this connection that it is prepared to provide Lithuania with appropriate additional Community aid for the closure and decommissioning of the Ignalina nuclear power, as stated in Protocol No 4 of the Act of Accession. This aid was included in the financial frameworks for 2007-2013. Article 2(3) of the Protocol further states that the Ignalina programme shall, inter alia, cover measures in support of the decommissioning of the Ignalina nuclear power plant, measures for the environmental upgrading in line with the acquis and modernisation measures of conventional production capacity to replace the production capacity of the two Ignalina nuclear power plant reactors, and other measures which are consequential to the decision to close and decommission the plant and which contribute to the necessary restructuring, environmental upgrading and modernisation of the energy production, transmission and distribution sectors in Lithuania as well as to enhancing the security of energy supply and improving energy efficiency in Lithuania.</p>
<p>As another example, let me mention that in the recent decision confirming guidelines for trans-European energy networks, one of the projects of European interest was the Poland-Lithuania link, which includes the necessary endorsement of the Polish electricity network and the PL–DE profile, and the subterranean cable between Finland and Estonia (Estlink). Together, these projects should make possible participation in an internal market for energy and guarantee the reliability and security of the operation of energy networks.</p>
<p>The Council has already begun working closely with the European Parliament to develop a coordinated or common energy policy by gradually adopting a statute book on energy. These measures and documents will form a basis for a stable energy supply in the EU. This will serve as a basis too for current and future energy policy decisions. The security of supply of energy, alongside two other aims of energy policy, that is to say competitiveness and sustainability, will also serve as the basis for a strategic survey on energy, which the European Commission intends to present to the Council and the European Parliament in 2007.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0818"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer, which has been drafted by the Presidency, which in itself is not binding on the Council or its members, was not presented orally in Council Question Time in the first part-session held by the European Parliament in Strasbourg in October 2006.</p>
<p>Since the early stages of the development of cooperation on justice and home affairs it has been clear to the Union that it is important to take its policy on immigration into consideration in relations with developing world countries.</p>
<p>The European Council has continually highlighted the importance of external relations, as a result of which cooperation with developing world countries on immigration and related matters has been an element in the Union’s bilateral and multilateral relations. Immigration was also discussed at the working lunch at the informal meeting of EU Heads of State or Government on 20 October 2006.</p>
<p>The Union is now actively endeavouring to implement the comprehensive approach on immigration adopted by the European Council in December 2005. This proposes priority action for Africa and the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>Crucial to this strategy is the need to firm up cooperation and partnership among the countries of destination, origin and transit that apply to migrants, because systematic management of migration flows can benefit all the relevant countries as well as the migrants themselves. Such a comprehensive dialogue should extend to all aspects of immigration and, furthermore, promote the opportunities derived from immigration to contribute to development. In the dialogue, the EU will also focus special attention on effective cooperation to prevent and combat illegal immigration.</p>
<p>The EU had a central role in the organisation of the Euro-Africa Ministerial Conference on Migration and Development, held in Rabat on 10-11 July 2006. The Rabat conference agreed a Joint Action Plan and a Declaration, and there countries of origin, transit and destination met for the first time and, in a spirit of partnership, held a debate on immigration and questions that relate to all parties. Implementation of the Action Plan is expected to commence shortly. The Action Plan also contains measures to try and strengthen cooperation in the area of legal and illegal migration.</p>
<p>Initiatives at regional level are an attempt to step up dialogue and cooperation with international organisations in various parts of Africa. The EU and the African Union are presently preparing for a ministerial conference on migration and development which would cover the whole of Africa. The conference is to be held before the end of this year, and will be an opportunity for participants to pinpoint areas that concern them and which are in the interests of all parties, and where cooperation between them could be enhanced. Another ministerial conference on migration and development is also in preparation, this time with the countries in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, in harmony with the comprehensive line that is being taken.</p>
<p>At bilateral level the plan is to improve the dialogue on immigration referred to in Article 13 of the Cotonou Agreement with our African partners which are parties to the Cotonou ACP Agreement, and to continue talks on readmission agreements with certain developing world countries.</p>
<p>The Commission has been given a mandate to negotiate a readmission agreement with two African countries, namely Morocco and Algeria. Morocco is a crucial country of transit, and good progress has already been made in talks with it. Formal discussions with Algeria are to start as soon as possible. Readmission agreements are an expression of the commitment that the EU shares with African countries to fight illegal immigration.</p>
<p>At its session on 5 and 6 October 2006 the Council adopted its Conclusions on Reinforcing the Southern External Maritime Borders (13559/06).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0819"></a>

<p>Will the delay mean that fulfilment of the Schengen criteria which we have already met will need to be reassessed, and exactly what purpose will the previous assessments then serve?</p>

<p>(FI) This answer drafted by the Presidency, which is not binding as such on the Council or its members, was not presented orally at the part of Question Time set aside for questions to the Council at Parliament’s first October 2006 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>We would draw the questioner’s attention to the conclusions concerning SIS II and SIS I+ issued following the Council meeting of 5 and 6 October 2006.</p>
<p>In those conclusions the Council took the view that the implementation schedule set out in Commission working paper 12379/06 SIRIS 158 was feasible and realistic. According to the revised timetable, the latest date on which SIS II would enter into operation in those Member States currently taking part in SIS I+ would be June 2008; at that stage, Member States not yet involved in SIS I+ could likewise join the system.</p>
<p>The Council endorsed the revised timetable and urged its appropriate working parties and the Commission bodies concerned to do their utmost to make SIS II operational as early as possible.</p>
<p>It has to be ensured that the transition to SIS II in Member States participating in SIS I+ is carried out without disrupting the operation of the system. Only when the transition has been completed and the new system has been shown to be in proper working order will it be possible to incorporate Member States which have not previously taken part.</p>
<p>As a matter of principle, once Schengen criteria have already been met, their fulfilment should not be assessed again.</p>
<p>In December the Council will be discussing matters relating to the Schengen Information System and the abolition of internal border checks. The technical, economic, legal, and organisational aspects will be considered over the next few weeks.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0820"></a>

<p>The EU regards it as very important that there is compliance with international humanitarian law at all stages of any armed conflict. This is emphasised in the European Union Guidelines on promoting compliance with international humanitarian law adopted in December 2005. Article 3 of the Guidelines states: ‘The European Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. This includes the goal of promoting compliance with IHL’.</p>
<p>The EU values the dialogue with the United States of America on international law and the fight against terrorism, wherein general legal frameworks are being discussed. The Council has not addressed the question of conducting an independent investigation into abuses in Iraq.</p>
<p>The Council is closely monitoring developments in Iraq, including human rights in the country and the humanitarian situation there. Questions relating to arrests, in addition to other human rights matters, are also being discussed within the context of the International Compact, which the Iraqi Government is at present drafting. The European Union is taking an active role in its development, and, in this connection, has stressed that the Compact should also deal with political and security reforms, as well as the promotion and protection of human rights and reinforcement of the rule of law in Iraq.</p>
<p>The EU is applying an EU Integrated Rule of Law Mission for Iraq (EUJUST LEX), by means of which the EU will actively support Iraq in developing the prerequisites for the rule of law in the country. So far almost 800 Iraqi judges, prosecutors and senior officials from the police and the prison authorities have received training within the EUJUST LEX framework. The Mission has been extended until December 2007, and in its second phase there will be specialist training available in more and more fields.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0822"></a>

<p>According to the 2003 Act of Accession, a decision to abolish internal border checks could be taken after the necessary preconditions for applying the Schengen rules had been shown to be met. The Schengen Information System (SIS), which operates in all the Member States, is one such precondition.</p>
<p>The stakeholder groups are all expressly aiming to do their utmost to enable SIS II to be put into operation at the earliest possible date. The delegations, including those from the new Member States, have considered and rejected several alternative scenarios for introducing SIS II.</p>
<p>At a meeting in Luxembourg on 5 October 2006 given over to matters related to the final abolition of checks at borders with new Member States, the Council discussed a solution put forward by the Portuguese delegation whereby new Member States would be able to join the SIS in its existing form (SIS I+). The idea behind the proposal is that they could be incorporated into the system before the stage at which the SIS II project is likely to be finalised.</p>
<p>As indicated in the conclusions issued on 5 October, the Council intends to discuss the timetable for the abolition of internal border checks at its meeting in December, when it will also give its verdict on the Portuguese proposal, which will be considered further in the weeks ahead.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0825"></a>

These matters are dealt with under national law.</p>

<p>Trade is an important part of the Barcelona Process, which brings the EU and its Mediterranean partners closer together both under the EU’s bilateral association agreements and through the stimulus provided by the regular regional-level Euro-Mediterranean ministerial meetings given over to trade and industry. The aim has been to increase economic integration and establish a regional free trade area by 2010.</p>
<p>Liberalising trade in the Euro-Mediterranean area is in accordance with WTO rules, since bilateral free trade areas set up under association agreements constitute projects entitled to preferential treatment within the meaning of Article XXIV of the GATT. In addition, their establishment and the policies applying to them have been inspired by the regional and development dimension. Furthermore, at their recent fifth Euro-Mediterranean meeting in Marrakesh on trade-related matters, the Ministers agreed to improve cooperation in a way compatible with the EU’s preferential trading systems in order to achieve a balanced outcome from the point of view of the WTO Doha Development Agenda, among other things by opening up access to agricultural commodity markets and creating attractive markets for developing countries.</p>
<p>As far as its Mediterranean partners are concerned, the Union is working within the Barcelona process and under the Euro-Mediterranean association agreements to abolish industrial duties and remove the imbalances resulting from commitments regarding preferential agricultural trading arrangements, but is calling for reciprocity in relation to the WTO as a sine qua non for a common free trade area. The imbalances relate, for example, to the maximum 12-year transitional period for phasing out industrial duties on certain listed products, which applies even though duty-free imports of Mediterranean industrial products to the EU were already provided for in the cooperation agreements concluded in the late 1970s. The regional approach aiming to set up a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area also encompasses free trade agreements concluded within the Mediterranean region to encourage the promotion of south-south trade, such as the Agadir Agreement between Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, and Jordan, and more flexible application of rules of origin to facilitate trading and outsourcing opportunities (the agreement on the pan-Euromediterranean system of cumulation of origin, which is expected to help expand trade in the wider Euro-Mediterranean area).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0842"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drafted by the Presidency, which is not binding as such on the Council or its members, was not presented orally in the part of Question Time set aside for questions to the Council at Parliament’s first October 2006 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The EU responded immediately after North Korea announced its intention of carrying out a nuclear test by issuing clear warnings to Pyongyang. Its main partners did likewise.</p>
<p>On 17 October, in the wake of the Korean announcement concerning the nuclear test, the General Affairs and External Relations Council approved the following conclusions:</p>
<p>‘The Council strongly condemns the test of a nuclear explosive device proclaimed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on 9 October 2006. This test, carried out in disregard of appeals from the international community, poses a danger to regional stability and represents a clear threat to international peace and security. It is a further violation by the DPRK of its non-proliferation obligations. It reinforces the DPRK’s isolation and does nothing to help the miserable situation of the North Korean people.</p>
<p>The EU will fully implement the provisions of all relevant UNSC Resolutions and notably of Resolution 1718 adopted on 14 October 2006 and of Resolution 1695 adopted on 15 July 2006. The Council shall immediately take the necessary steps to that end.</p>
<p>The Council strongly urges the DPRK, in compliance with UNSC Resolutions 1718 and 1695, to return immediately to the Six-Party talks, to work towards expeditious implementation of the Joint Statement of September 2005, in particular to abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes, and to comply with its obligations under the NPT, which include submitting all its nuclear activities to IAEA verification. The EU further calls on the DPRK to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, to refrain from conducting any further nuclear test or missile launch, and to re-establish its commitments to a moratorium on missile launching.</p>
<p>DPRK’s actions add to the risks of proliferation worldwide. The Council calls for redoubling of efforts to strengthen all aspects of the international system against proliferation of WMD.’</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0848"></a>

Bulgaria has confirmed its commitment to close reactors 3 and 4 for decommissioning in 2006. This commitment is cited in Article 30(1) of the Protocol to the Treaty of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania<a href="#defann_22_1" name="refann_22_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Improving levels of nuclear safety in reactors 3 and 4 does not alter the commitments made by Bulgaria in the accession negotiations.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member will know, the European Union, throughout its accession negotiations with Bulgaria, stressed the importance of stringent requirements for nuclear safety and a high level of environmental protection. The same is true for the accession negotiations with other countries in the fifth enlargement round.</p>
<p>The European Union has stated that it is prepared to grant sufficient Community aid for Bulgaria to be able to take action to close and decommission reactors 1-4 at Kozloduy. The EU will have contributed EUR 550 million in all for the period 2000-2009. The aid granted for preparation for accession totalled EUR 340 million. Under Article 30(2) of the Protocol, another EUR 210 million is to be committed, and the same section also states that the assistance shall, inter alia, cover measures in support of the decommissioning of Units 1-4 of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant, measures for environmental upgrading in line with the acquis, measures for the modernisation of the conventional energy production, transmission and distribution sectors in Bulgaria, and measures to improve energy efficiency, to enhance the use of renewable energy sources and to improve security of energy supply.</p>
<p>Moreover, Bulgaria may ask for the general safeguard clause to be invoked, within the meaning of Article 36. The section in question states the following: ‘If, until the end of a period of up to three years after accession, difficulties arise which are serious and liable to persist in any sector of the economy or which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a given area, Bulgaria or Romania may apply for authorisation to take protective measures in order to rectify the situation and adjust the sector concerned to the economy of the internal market.’</p>
<p>Article 36 of the Protocol makes it clear that, in order to take advantage of this option, the Member State concerned must first ask the Commission for permission to take protective measures. The request must be accompanied by the relevant background information. On receipt of the request, the Commission will decide on the protective measures which it considers necessary. It is thus for the Commission to judge whether or not to grant authorisation for such measures as those referred to by the honourable Member.</p>
<p>The Council would also like to remind the honourable Member that it really does consider the security of the supply of energy, competitiveness and environmental sustainability to be the cornerstones of Europe’s energy policy, as the conclusions which the European Council adopted in March 2006 on a European Energy Policy confirmed.</p>
<p>The recent European Parliament and Council Decision laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks²<a href="#defann_22_2" name="refann_22_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and the Treaty establishing the Energy Community will help create a regionally integrated market for electricity and natural gas networks in South-Eastern Europe and link them to larger EU markets. This is an important step towards guaranteeing energy policy security, competitiveness and sustainability for the region. Furthermore, Bulgaria is a party to the Treaty establishing the Energy Community, which recently came into force. The tasks of the Energy Community include improving the situation with regard to the environment and increasing the use of renewable energy. Accordingly, we need to look into what approaches and methods might be applied within this operational framework. This will then provide Bulgaria, as a full Member State of the EU, with greater potential for seeking solutions to the question which the honourable Member has raised.</p>
<p>The security of the supply of energy, competitiveness and sustainability will also serve as the basis for a strategic survey on energy, which the European Commission intends to present to the Council and the European Parliament in 2007.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FI) This answer, which has been drafted by the Presidency, which in itself is not binding on the Council or its members, was not presented orally in Council Question Time in the first part-session held by the European Parliament in Strasbourg in October 2006.</p>
<p>With regard to preparations for Croatia’s accession to the European Union, the Commission has just completed what is known as an analytical screening of the acquis, to explain the acquis to the Croatian authorities and assess what stage preparations are at for the commencement of negotiations on certain areas. The acquis has been divided into 35 chapters for the assessment and future talks, each dealing with a certain area of policy.</p>
<p>At present the Council is examining the Commission’s evaluation reports and has made good progress in this. The Council has had 16 evaluation reports on negotiation chapters to examine. The Council has sent out letters on 13 negotiation chapters, some of which state conditions for the commencement of talks. The Council is at present examining three other chapters, conditions for the commencement of talks on which may, if necessary, be imposed.</p>
<p>Croatia has submitted its negotiation position for accession talks for the first seven chapters (which are science and research, education and culture, customs, right of establishment and freedom to provide services, intellectual property rights, economic and monetary policy, and business and industrial policy). A ministerial accession conference was held with Croatia on 12 June 2006 in Luxembourg, and it was clear that progress was being made in the commencement of talks when the debate on the chapter on science and research that had begun there was temporarily closed. Other chapters are to be screened in the months to come.</p>
<p>The Commission is expected to present its next progress report on Croatia on 8 November, one in which progress in the country’s preparations for accession will be assessed in terms of all the chapters of the acquis. The Council intends to examine the report thoroughly.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0860"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drafted by the Presidency, which is not binding as such on the Council or its members, was not presented orally in the part of Question Time set aside for questions to the Council at Parliament’s first October 2006 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council has no knowledge of the case to which the questioner refers. It is, however, clearly linked to the broader issues of freedom of expression and trade union rights. I should like to stress once again in this connection that the Union considers these to be important matters. The Council has repeated its assertion, in particular where freedom of expression is concerned, that ongoing efforts are still needed in order to bring the practice of freedom of expression in Turkey into line with the standard laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights and the related case law of the European Court of Human Rights. Regarding trade union rights, resolute action is needed in order to ensure that they are fully respected in accordance with EU standards and the relevant ILO conventions. This applies especially to the right of association, the right to strike, and the right of free collective bargaining. These points are included within the framework for negotiations with Turkey, as approved by the Council on 3 October 2005, and are among the short-term priority objectives of the revised accession partnership. The Union invariably raises them at every level, since they are part of the reform process under way in Turkey. That is what it did at the most recent meeting of the EU-Turkey Association Council, held in Luxembourg on 12 June 2006, and at the EU-Turkey Ministerial Troika meeting, also in Luxembourg, on 16 October 2006.</p>
<p>The questioner can therefore rest assured that, as we assess Turkey’s progress towards accession, we will continue to keep a close watch on developments in both the areas mentioned above. It is clear that developments in these areas will influence the progress of the negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0864"></a>

<p>(EN) On 4 October 2006, the Commission adopted a new "Global Europe strategy paper". The central message of this trade policy review is that the EU should seek to build on and complement its commitment to the multilateral World Trade Organisation (WTO) trading system with a new generation of bilateral Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with some key growing markets. Also, it will take new initiatives on the better protection of intellectual property rights, review and possible reform of the EU's trade defence instruments and a detailed reassessment of the EU’s strategy with China.</p>
<p>This policy is not an alternative to multilateral trade liberalisation as currently pursued through the WTO's Doha Development Agenda (DDA). The WTO must remain the fundamental platform on which to build global liberalisation, and the EU will continue to do all it can to restart the DDA negotiations, whose successful completion remains its key objective.</p>
<p>WTO first does not mean WTO alone. We should also go beyond the EU's existing bilateral FTAs, with new ones designed to deliver more open markets and fairer trading conditions in new areas of growth, particularly in Asia. Such FTAs can build on WTO multilateral liberalisation.</p>
<p>However, bilateral trade agreements will remain important in meeting Europe's responsibilities towards the developing world, as is, for instance, the case with the Economic Partnership Agreements. Development will remain a key element in our international trade policy, both multilaterally and bilaterally. The Commission is convinced that the provisions it is seeking to negotiate with developing countries will be conductive to their further development and growth.

<p>(EN) Trade Facilitation is an important factor to further trade and to help realise a positive impact on economic growth and development, not least at a regional level. The EU has therefore been in the forefront in negotiations on a new WTO Agreement on Trade Facilitation as part of the Doha Development Agenda. The promotion of regional Trade Facilitation is an integral part of these multilateral negotiations. This remains a priority for the EU and work on Trade Facilitation continues as part of both multilateral and bilateral strategies.</p>
<p>The EU generally supports regional initiatives such as the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), in particular the recently concluded South Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA). The European Commission supports SAFTA via its request for observer ship to SAARC and by its trade related assistance programmes. Moreover, regional SAARC cumulation under the Generalised System of Preference (GSP) scheme is an additional supportive measure.</p>
<p>As regards technical assistance, the European Commission has designed a programme of economic cooperation with the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation which covers trade facilitation (customs), standards and cooperation between businesses in the region. The objectives of this programme are to promote intra-regional trade through support for South Asia Free Trade Agreement implementation, which in turn should support improved political relations in the region. The programme has not yet been presented to EU Member States as we are awaiting approval from the SAARC side. We expect this to be discussed at a November SAARC meeting.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0817"></a>

Bringing the energy trade under the rules and procedures of the WTO would require the producers to provide free access to transit. Is this the Commission's position at present? What progress has been achieved concerning the Commission's proposal to put global trade in energy under the WTO rules?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In its Green Paper published in March on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy, the Commission sets out the new energy realities facing Europe, in a world of global trade and interdependence. As the Commissioner in charge of Energy has made clear, the European Union’s external energy policy is a key part of the debate under the Strategic EU Energy Review and rules for trade and investment in energy are an important element of this. In particular, there are four areas where we need to focus.</p>
<p>First, we need a clear and pro-active policy on securing and diversifying energy, and in particular gas supplies. Second, we need effective energy partnerships with EU's energy suppliers, including with Russia and Ukraine, based on the recognition of our inter-dependence, secure investment conditions and reciprocity in terms of access to markets and infrastructure. Third, we need to develop a truly pan-European Energy regulatory space around the EU and progressively develop common trade, transit and environmental rules as well as market harmonisation and integration. The South-East Europe Energy Community could serve as basis in this context. Fourth, if despite common rules, crises do arise, we need to be prepared to react quickly and effectively.</p>
<p>Naturally, these external policy objectives complement our internal energy policy objectives, namely completing the internal energy market, promoting energy efficiency and renewables, developing sustainable coal use and developing energy interconnections and infratrscture throughout the EU.</p>
<p>As part of our review on strengthening the EU’s external policy on energy with energy-producing and energy-transit countries, we need to examine the instruments that are at our disposal, including those in the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>
<p>Existing WTO rules on freedom of transit already contribute to ensuring the smooth and non-discriminatory flow of trade, including energy, across borders. However, transit can still be compromised in practice. The Doha negotiations on Trade Facilitation have provided an opportunity to address this. In June 2006, the European Communities, in association with other WTO members, and building on earlier submissions, presented proposals on Trade Facilitation to the WTO. These proposals, among others, make clear that WTO members should accord to goods in transit, including energy of course, treatment no less favourable than that accorded to domestic goods. Such a clarification would confirm the application of the key WTO principle of national treatment to transit.</p>
<p>Regrettably, the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations were suspended shortly after our June proposal on transit was circulated to WTO members. However, the Commission would like to underline that WTO rules already comprehensively cover transit, including in relation to energy. It hopes that we will be able to move forward with our Trade Facilitation proposals as a whole with a resumption of the Doha negotiations.</p>
<p>In parallel with the DDA, we are also exploring other trade tools that can be used to further our energy objectives. Although Russia has not ratified the Energy Charter Treaty, 46 other countries, including 21 non-EU countries, have ratified the treaty. Included in this agreement are several provisions on transit, covering those under WTO rules, although an additional Transit Protocol, giving further rules for the conclusion of transit agreements, has eluded successful conclusion.</p>
<p>The Commission has also been integrating energy objectives into the EU’s overarching framework for WTO accession negotiations. In this way, we are developing an integrated approach to energy issues through existing WTO rules, through the DDA negotiations, and through WTO accession negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0857"></a>

This requirement is set out in the European System of Accounts (ESA 95) and in Commission Decision 94/168 of 22 February 1994.</p>
<p>Greece transmitted to the Commission, on 22 September 2006, revised GDP data showing a revision of 25%. This is the first revision submitted by Greece since 1993.</p>
<p>Eurostat is reviewing the data transmitted by Greece in line with the foreseen procedures. The Commissioner in charge of Economic and Monetary Affairs has in fact asked Eurostat to deal with this issue as a matter of priority. In this respect the importance of a close co-operation by the Greek statistical authorities and in particular the delivery of a complete and fully revised inventory of the source data and methods used for the new Gross National Income (GNI) calculations should be underlined.</p>
<p>The initial verification work has already started and the GNI committee will examine the data for the first time at the end of October. Taking into account the opinion and comments of the GNI committee, Eurostat will then undertake a GNI mission to the country. During the mission, Eurostat will examine thoroughly the reliability and quality of the surveys, censuses and other data sources used; assess the statistical methods employed; evaluate the integration of sources data in national accounts; and check the compliance of the statistical treatments with ESA 95. As has been the case in other EU countries, experts from other Member States will be invited to participate in the mission in order to ensure full transparency. Further missions may be necessary before a complete verification can be made. As is the case for all such missions, the results will be discussed first with the Greek national statistical institute and their comments taken into account.</p>
<p>At the end of this process, Eurostat will provide an assessment whether the Greek revised figures are appropriate for the various uses by the Commission and the Council or whether corrections and further improvements are necessary.</p>

<p>(EN) The distribution of responsibilities between the EU and the Member State level is governed by the subsidiarity principle. Policies are transferred to the Community or euro-area level when there is a clear benefit in doing so, because this allows taking account of spillover effects or externalities. Similarly, policy competence is transferred to the European level in connection with the provision of public goods that are indivisible and cannot be provided for by Member States individually in an efficient way. Hence, there is a clear rationale behind the assignment of policies such as monetary policy, trade policy or competition policy to the European level.</p>
<p>The introduction of the euro and the elimination of competitive devaluations, genuine price stability and interest rate convergence to the lowest levels ever recorded for some euro area countries constitute evidence that Community policies are delivering tangible economic benefits to citizens of the euro area. On the other hand, with competence for most economic policies remaining firmly in the hands of Member States, the Commission does not believe that the possibilities for producing appropriate economic policies at national level are being unduly restricted. The coordination requirements at European level provide for added value in terms of making sure that national policies pay proper attention to the overall Community objectives. This coordination allows policy-learning via exchange of best practices and can benefit and inspire policy making at national level, although more can certainly be done in order to improve the economic performance of the euro area and the EU as a whole.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0830"></a>

This assessment will deal also with the impact of past rises in interest rates on the US economy, especially on the US housing market, which shows signs of a rapid cooling.</p>
<p>According to the Commission's interim forecast published on 6 September 2006, economic growth in the EU is projected to pick up to 2.7% in 2006. This represents an upward revision of 0.4 percentage points compared to the Commission's spring forecast. While the interim forecast does not update the projection for the year 2007, the upward revision for the EU economy in 2006 would also point to higher than previously expected growth in 2007 (which the spring forecast put at 2.2%). In combination with the fact that Asia is expected to continue growing strongly, 2007 will see a certain rebalancing of global growth away from the US towards Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>While the expected slowdown of the US economy is one factor behind the recent weakening of some of the survey indicators in Germany, other factors could have contributed to this as well. In particular, due to the rise in the Value Added Tax rate by 3 percentage points on 1 January 2007, many observers in Germany expect a slowing of household expenditure in the beginning of the year (partly reflecting a shift in consumption and construction expenditure being brought forward to 2006). Due to this possible effect on the German economy in the first quarter of 2007, forward looking survey indicators softened in recent months, while indicators on the current business situation strengthened further.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0858"></a>

<p>On 5 October 2006, the ECB raised interest rates for the fifth time in succession by 0.25%, bringing the euro base rate to 3.25%, justifying the increase with reference to the need for vigilance in the face of inflationary pressures and in order to maintain price stability. On the other hand, the Commission's latest quarterly report on the eurozone records a rate of economic growth of 3.4%, the highest in the last six years, describing the short-term economic outlook for the eurozone as optimistic.</p>
<p>To what extent is the Commission's report consistent with the ECB's estimations of significant inflationary risks and the likelihood of price destabilisation? Does the Commission consider that the ECB's decision to raise interest rates at this particular point in time could jeopardise the recent, still fragile recovery of the growth rate in the eurozone?</p>
<p>Is the wide divergence between Member States' interest rates consistent with the satisfactory operation of the internal market in the eurozone, particularly when there are Member States with the highest lending rates and lowest deposit rates, thereby squeezing borrowers and obstructing investment?

<p>(EN) All the main indicators of economic activity confirm that the economic recovery is broadly based and is mainly supported by domestic demand. Both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Commission see the economic outlook as favourable. For instance, in the September Commission's interim forecasts, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the euro area in 2006 was revised upwards from 2.1 to 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>Headline inflation rate is projected to remain above 2% on average in 2006 and is likely to remain so in 2007. In order to contain upside risks to price stability and preserve the firm anchoring of inflation expectations, the ECB has withdrawn monetary accommodation since December 2005. Even after the latest increase, interest rates remain historically low in nominal and real terms and liquidity is ample, as visible in the high rates of expansion of monetary aggregates and of credit. Preserving price stability and anchoring inflation expectations at low levels ensures low long term interest rates, benefiting investment and creating the conditions for higher growth.</p>
<p>With respect to the Honourable Member's question on interest rate differences, the single monetary policy ensures that the short term money market interest rates are the same across the euro area. Substantial convergence in retail rates has been observed over the last years. The remaining differences in lending/deposit rates can be explained by a range of factors, including statistical differences, regulatory and fiscal determinants, other structural and cyclical determinants<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Continued cross-border financial integration is likely to further reduce differences in bank lending/deposit rates among the euro-area Member States. In this context, it should be noted that the Commission has identified integration of retail banking as a priority for action in its White Paper on Financial Services Policy for 2005-2010. Among the initiatives proposed or under consideration are a White Paper on integrating the EU mortgage credit market, a proposal for a Directive on consumer credit and a proposal for a Payment Services Directive to facilitate the creation of the Single European Payments Area. In addition, the Commission (Directorate General Competition) is currently conducting an inquiry into the EU retail banking sector.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The implementation of the e-platform for discussion will gradually take place from the end of 2006 onwards, following the gradual setting up of the various groups related to the communication on the rights of the child.</p>
<p>The e-platform instrument will be the "Sinapse" system developed by the European Commission. This system is fully secured and gives access only to dully registered members. In addition, several layers of members can be organised in a way that private discussions can take place only between a small numbers of pre-defined people.</p>
<p>The draft Commission Decision “on reserving the national numbering range beginning with &lt;116&gt; for harmonised numbers for harmonised services of social value to European citizens” is currently in discussion with Member States in the Communications Committee. It is anticipated that the Commission services will request the opinion of the Communications Committee via a regulatory procedure in autumn 2006, and that the Commission would adopt the Decision early 2007.</p>
<p>With the Decision, the Commission will require Member States to reserve a range of national telephone numbers, all beginning with 116, for harmonised European services with social value, for the benefit of European citizens including travellers.</p>
<p>116 numbers will be reserved at EU level (via the Commission Decision) for a specific service (NOT for a service provider<a href="#defann_37_1" name="refann_37_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>) following a request from interested parties. Assigning the number to eligible service providers is a national responsibility. Member States will have to permit services listed in the Commission Decision to be offered, but there is no obligation for them to guarantee that these services are provided.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member pointed out in her oral question, two types of services are currently examined:</p>
<p>Hotline for missing children;</p>
<p>Helpline for children.</p>
<p>A hotline is an emergency line accessed at 80% by parents in case of missing children, a helpline provides listening and assistance to children and are accessed at 80% by children. It is therefore necessary to have two different telephone numbers for those very different services.</p>
<p>After the adoption of the Commission Decision, the Commission will invite expressions of interest in the reservation of specific 116 numbers for specific services. Organisations providing a hotline for missing children or a helpline for children will be able to request 116 numbers to be reserved for their respective services.</p>
<p>Once operational, this system will allow European citizens to be able to reach services of social value such as these by using the same number in each Member State.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In its proposal for a Directive on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which is currently being discussed under the procedure of co-decision by the Parliament and Council, the Commission has highlighted that in line with the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the “best interests of the child” should be a primary consideration of Member States when implementing this Directive.</p>
<p>This general principle is reflected in many provisions of the proposed Directive:</p>
<p>Article 5 of the proposal expressly obliges Member States to take account of the best interests of the child in accordance with the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child when implementing this Directive.</p>
<p>Article 6(4) foresees that where Member States are subject to obligations derived from fundamental rights as resulting, in particular, from the European Convention on Human Rights, such as the right to non-refoulment, the right to education and the right to family unity, no return decision shall be issued. Where a return decision has already been issued, it shall be withdrawn.</p>
<p>Article 8(2)(a) obliges Member States to postpone the execution of a removal order if there is lack of assurance that unaccompanied minors can be handed over at the point of departure or upon arrival to a family member, an equivalent representative, a guardian of the minor or a competent official of the country of return, following an assessment of the conditions to which the minor will be returned.</p>
<p>Article 13 proposes to make applicable Article 18 (on the treatment of minors) and Article 19 (on the treatment of unaccompanied minors) of Directive 2003/9/EC on reception conditions for asylum seekers to children for whom the enforcement of a return decision has been postponed or who cannot be removed.</p>
<p>Article 15 is dealing with detention conditions. It foresees that Member States shall ensure that minors are not kept in detention in common prison accommodation and that unaccompanied minors shall be separated from adults unless it is considered in the child's best interest not to do so.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Quota and other Community trade policy measures are applied by the national customs authorities in the Member States. They are based on the origin as declared in the import declaration, not on the label that happens to be affixed to the article.</p>
<p>EU quotas are managed according to the so-called "double-checking" system: the exporter in the third country (here China) has to ask for an export licence at the licences office in the third country. This export licence is handed over to the EU importer on one hand, and in parallel the Commission is informed by the third country through a secured Information Technology (IT) system ("SIGL" - Système Intégré de Gestion des Licences) about the release of this export licence. Once the goods arrive in the EU, the EU importer then must call for an import licence in the licences office in its Member State. This import licence is released after checking that the EU quota is not exhausted. If this is the case the import licence is released and the importer is allowed to clear the goods through customs. At this moment further control (validity of the licences, origin of the goods, etc) is carried out by the Member States customs authorities.</p>
<p>In the absence of any information on the declared origin and on the exact processing operations taking place in the different locations, no opinion can be given as to whether this is a case of "illegal traffic".</p>
<p>Customs authorities in the Member State of importation have ample legal means to request any proof of the declared origin of the goods, in order to correctly apply the quota and other measures (origin certificate, Article 26 of the Community Customs Code – Regulation (EEC) 2913/92<a href="#defann_39_1" name="refann_39_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, etc.).</p>
<p>Furthermore, some Member States have national legislation in place which allows them, according to their respective standards and procedures, to check the correctness of origin marking where producers or importers choose to display such geographical information on the goods.</p>
<p>While Member States are responsible in the first instance for ensuring that quotas on importation of goods into the EU are respected, they may, if they have evidence or sufficiently serious suspicions of irregularities, ask the Commission (OLAF) to provide assistance/coordination or to undertake investigative missions in accordance with the EC/China Agreement on Customs Cooperation and Mutual Administrative Assistance or under EC legislation. No such request has been made to date in this particular instance.</p>
<p>The fact that goods may be counterfeited whilst on board of ships does not impact on the Customs controls applied in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1383/2003 to prevent infringing of intellectual property rights. These controls apply when goods are entered for release for free circulation, export or re-export, regardless of their place of manufacture.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the view that the regular and active practice of sport is essential to the physical and psychological well-being of young people in Europe. These are however matters which fall primarily within the competence of the Member States.</p>
<p>Within the framework of its competences, the Commission has undertaken various initiatives. The importance of sport and physical activity for keeping fit is well-known and well-documented. A Commission-sponsored study conducted by a consortium led by the Universities of Paderborn and Duisburg-Essen, published on 3 January 2005, indicated that physical activity is urgently needed to avoid obesity, and that obesity presents an alarming health hazard to our children and young people, including a higher incidence of typical old-people’s diseases like type 2 diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases.</p>
<p>The results of the study have been received with great interest in many different fields and a voluntary Working Group on Sport and Health has been set up, including numerous Member States. The Working Group has a mandate to exchange best practice examples and to develop new models in the field. It has contributed to the public consultation concerning the Commission’s Green Paper: “Promoting Healthy Diets and Physical Activity”<a href="#defann_40_1" name="refann_40_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In 2005 the Commission launched a special initiative which aims to create links between all types of actions necessary to combat obesity, “Diet, Physical Activity and Health – a European Platform for Action”. This initiative is part of the public health policy which is currently moving from a traditional, curative approach, towards an inter-sectoral approach grounded in preventive health. While consumer and industry representatives are numerous within the Platform, along with academic nutrition experts, the Commission is keen to see other actors joining the Platform, including youth and sport organisations.</p>
<p>Around 15 projects funded under different Calls for proposals of the Youth Programme have been using sport as a tool for non-formal education. These projects use sport to reach other objectives such as integrating young people in society, raising their self-confidence, increasing their team spirit and creating interaction between different cultures. The projects focus on sports and outdoor education as a tool for social integration and non-formal education of young people.</p>
<p>Moreover, on 18 July 2006 the Commission published a call for tender for a study to identify the possibilities for improving the legal and political framework for protecting and improving the top-quality training of young sportspersons in Europe<a href="#defann_40_2" name="refann_40_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>

<p>(EN) The cornerstone of the EU’s drug policy is a balanced approach between drug demand and supply reduction, i.e. between prevention, education, harm reduction and access to treatment services including reintegration on the one hand, and the vigorous enforcement of laws against drugs production and trafficking on the other. This balance between public health and social aspects and law enforcement reflects our view that a balance must be struck in any civilised society between peoples’ rights and public safety and security.</p>
<p>Two main political documents were agreed by the Council. The EU Action Plan on Drugs 2005-2008<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> was adopted by the Council on the basis of a proposal from the Commission. This Plan translates the EU Drugs Strategy 2005-2012 into more than 80 specific actions, identifying the responsible parties and deadlines for their implementation. The Action Plan includes sections on policy co-ordination, demand reduction, supply reduction, international co-operation and information, research and evaluation.</p>
<p>To quote the Action Plan, its aim is “… to significantly reduce the prevalence of drug use among the population and to reduce the social harm and health damage caused by the use of and trade in illicit drugs.”</p>
<p>The Action Plan names specific actors for each action, sets deadlines and output indicators by which to measure the degree of implementation of each action. These will be used by the Commission, which is responsible for an annual evaluation of progress made. This evaluation will take the form of a report to the Council, with, if necessary, recommendations on how to improve or adjust implementation or indeed the Action Plan itself.</p>
<p>The foundation of our approach is the evidence base. Whatever we do should be based on an objective analysis of the situation, on the increasingly reliable data that are coming through from the Member States and from the European Monitoring centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.</p>
<p>The issue of drugs is one of the most important concerns affecting millions of Europeans.</p>
<p>Drug is a worldwide problem. It poses a threat to the entire international community. This means that the EU not only needs to deal with the problem at home, but that its policies and funding in the rest of the world must pay close attention to the drugs situation in any given country or region. Recognising this, the European Union is stepping up its international co-operation efforts on drugs and its fight against organised crime, both in Europe and elsewhere.</p>
<p>In the framework of the financial perspective 2007-2013, the Commission presented in 2005 a proposal for a specific programme on the fight against violence (Daphne) and drugs prevention and information. This proposal, reflecting the political recognition of the importance of the drugs issue, was modified in May 2006 with a view to separating the Daphne Programme and the Drugs Prevention and Information Programme. The objectives of the Drugs Programme are to prevent and reduce drugs use, dependence and drugs-related harm and to promote transnational and awareness-raising actions in the area of drugs. The adoption of the proposal by the end of 2006 would allow the programme to be launched in 2007. This new programme provides for the financing of a number of actions in the Action Plan on Drugs 2005-2008 and will be coordinating its actions with existing programmes such as the Community Programme on Public Health dealing with a health determinants’ strand including drug prevention.</p>
<p>As for external relations, Member States individually and the Commission have devoted considerable resources to drug-related projects in developing and transition countries and regions. Overall, the EU’s assistance has almost doubled in the last 3 years. The Commission has become one of the world’s major donors, providing over € 300 million in assistance to drug-related projects.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) 1. The TEN-T in Lithuania is based on the results of the so called TINA (Transport Infrastructure Needs Assessment) process. The report of this process (October 1999) was based on the principles and criteria of the Common Guidelines for the Development of the Trans-European Transport Network<a href="#defann_43_1" name="refann_43_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. One major aim of the exercise was to integrate the future TEN-T networks into the TEN-T of the EU15.</p>
<p>The new guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network, which have been adopted by the Parliament and the Council by 29<span class="sup">th</span> of April 2004, have identified 30 priority projects on which work is due to start before 2010.</p>
<p>One of these priority projects is Rail Baltica the North-south railway axis from the Baltic countries to Warsaw in Poland. The Commission has, after consultation of the Parliament, nominated a European Coordinator in order to advance/promote this project.</p>
<p>Another priority project, which is important for Lithuania is the project n° 21 Motorways of the Sea, which aims in stimulating short sea shipping in Europe and thus promotes the interconnection within the Union.</p>
<p>Lithuania has received € 411 millions support from ISPA<a href="#defann_43_2" name="refann_43_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and Cohesion fund for transport sector development.</p>
<p>In 2006, Lithuania has introduced two proposals to be co-financed through the TEN-T annual budget (Non-MIP 2006 budget). These requests were approved this month (for a total Community funding of € 4,3 millions) by the TEN Financial Assistance Committee.</p>
<p>2. Lithuania is eligible to Cohesion funds and structural funds. The foreseen contribution for the 2007-2013 period in Lithuania is € 2,034 million from the Cohesion fund and</p>
<p>€ 3, 965 million in the convergence objective, part of which should be allocated to transport projects.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the development of the Trans-European Networks Transport remains a priority for Lithuania as it was already put in their draft NSRF (National Strategic Reference Framework) of June 2006 that define the priorities on which cohesion instruments (Cohesion Funds, European Regional Development Funf and European Social Fund) should be spent during the 2007-13 programming period. The final NSRF is expected for beginning of November 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission understands that the Honourable Member's question refers to the implementation of Regulation (EC) 2320/2002 on common rules in the field of civil aviation security, which requires that all staff requiring access to security restricted areas in airports to be subjected to a background check.</p>
<p>Where the background checks involve the exchange of personal data, national rules adopted pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC apply. As regards access to criminal records, the Directive provides that processing of data relating to offences or criminal convictions may be carried out only under the control of official authority, subject to derogations which may be granted by Member State under national provisions providing suitable specific safeguards. Within this margin of manoeuvre, national legislators have in a number of cases adopted strict limits to the way criminal records may be accessed, for example by delivering certificates on criminal records only at the request of the person concerned, who may then decide to hand them to third parties, like prospective employers. United Kingdom civil aviation authorities need therefore to comply with their obligation to perform background checks within the existing legal framework on access and use of criminal records. This can be done, for example, by requiring applicants to submit recent certificates on their criminal records.</p>
<p>Exchange of information on criminal convictions is governed by the 1959 European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Council of Europe), according to which the State of nationality is kept informed of convictions handed down against its nationals in the other States. However, the existing exchange mechanisms under that Convention do not work well and information on criminal convictions does not circulate efficiently between the specific authorities designated to transmit and receive criminal record information.</p>
<p>Work is ongoing to improve this situation: a Council Decision on the exchange of information extracted from criminal records entered into force in May 2006. The Decision aims to speed up the exchange of information between competent authorities and provides for the use of a standard form for requests and answers. In addition, the Commission is working on a package of measures to further improve the exchange of criminal record information between Member States, in particular, on the development of an EU-wide standardised format for the exchange of information.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0802"></a>

The coordinator carried out a thorough analysis in the form of an annual report, which was published on 13 September. He notes in the report that there is no Intergovernmental Commission to coordinate the activities of the European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG) and that ‘the signing of an international Treaty accordingly appears to be a short to medium-term objective that should help to enshrine the undertaking of the two Member States to complete the entire section by 2020 at the latest’.

<p>Concerning the specific case raised by the Honourable Member, the Commission is in the process of analysing the facts and the legal situation following the complaint concerning an alleged discriminatory treatment against the Polish construction firm Westbud. On that basis, the Commission will assess whether the measures taken by the German customs authorities are in line with the Community acquis.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0805"></a>

<p>(EN) Operation HERA II covering illegal immigration by sea from Africa to the Canary Islands commenced off the African coastline on 11 August. This phase of operations is due to end by 15 November. It is therefore too early yet to say anything definitive about the efficiency of the operation. FRONTEX, however, which is responsible for coordinating the operation, shall carry out a thorough evaluation of the operation - not the Commission - in order to be able to assess the results and, if necessary, enhance the effectiveness of future operations of this kind.</p>
<p>However, the Commission would like to underline that the FRONTEX Agency is a coordinating body, which does not itself have border guard officers or operational assets at its disposal. It is up to Member States to contribute both personnel and assets for operations. In general Member States do deliver the support they pledge; however there is still room for improvement in terms of better internal planning for all Member States involved in operations.</p>
<p>The FRONTEX Agency launched operation NAUTILUS in the central Mediterranean on 5 October with a view to bringing the illegal immigration by sea from Northern Africa under control and significantly bringing down the loss of lives at sea due to immigrants using unsafe ways and means of transportation.</p>
<p>Italy, Greece, Malta, France and Germany contribute to this operation with personnel and assets, including vessels, surveillance planes and helicopters.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0814"></a>

<p>(EN) For the period 2000-2005, total EC co-operation in favour of the Palestinian people amounted to €1.5 billion, coming from a variety of budget lines and implemented through a number of channels.</p>
<p>About 55% of this assistance was implemented without any involvement of the Palestinian Government. The remaining 45% concerned direct financial support (35%), co-operation involving both a legal and a financial link with the Palestinian Government (5%) or a legal link only (5%).</p>
<p>In 2006, following the swearing in of the new Hamas-led government, the Council announced on 10 April that, due to non compliance with the Quartet conditions, all EU assistance to the Palestinians had to be reviewed. As a consequence, EC projects previously signed which included a legal and/or financial link with the Palestinian Government were suspended.</p>
<p>Therefore, since April 2006, no new financial commitments with legal or financial links to the Palestinian Government have been made. The total of €329 million committed up to now in 2006 in favour of the Palestinian population is being implemented to meet humanitarian and socio-economic needs, including food aid, which have increased as a result of the ongoing crisis. This assistance is either channelled through international organisations or is managed directly by the Commission, for instance through the Temporary International Mechanism (TIM).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0816"></a>

<p>(EN) As a preliminary observation, the Commission would like to point out that it cannot engage in infringement procedures, as foreseen by Art 226 of the EC Treaty, based on a simple expression of an intention in the form of draft legislative measures. Infringement procedures can only be pursued against state measures which are actually in force.</p>
<p>The Commission has repeatedly restated its determination to enforce EU law. In particular, the Commission is committed to keeping the Internal Market free of special rights incompatible with the Treaty which might be introduced by governments to control private enterprises, thereby raising obstacles to the free movement of capital.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it must be recalled that the Treaty provides for certain exceptions to the free movement of capital. The European Court of Justice has given its interpretation of the circumstances under which these exceptions can be applied legitimately to restrict Treaty freedoms. The Commission has had the opportunity to examine a draft French decree concerning Gaz de France. It follows very closely the provisions of a royal decree applicable to the Belgian companies Distrigaz and SNTC, which were reviewed by the European Court of Justice in 2002. Therefore, the Commission does not believe that, if approved in their original form, the French measures in question should be challenged under Article 56 of the Treaty.</p>
<p>However, the Commission preserves its right to intervene if the final mechanism adopted differs significantly from the draft measures transmitted to the Commission, if new case law provides new grounds for intervention, or if legislative developments related to the gas sector subsequent to the above ruling would render the provisions in question unnecessary, and therefore unjustified.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0829"></a>

<p>(EN) An ambitious outcome of the currently interrupted World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations on trade liberalisation will certainly bring opportunities in terms of opening of export markets, mainly for industrial goods and services, as well as challenges, in particular for EU agriculture. The EU WTO agricultural offer from 28 October 2005 includes an ambitious market access proposal, conditional phasing out of export refunds and significant cuts in trade-distorting domestic support.</p>
<p>The implementation of lower tariffs is going to be particularly challenging for the agricultural sectors that already today experience a rapid growth in imports entering the EU paying the full duty, like beef and poultry. Any tariff cut, even if these sectors are to be considered sensitive and face lower tariff reduction, will result in more imports.</p>
<p>The impact of a possible WTO agreement will also be felt for those sectors that rely more on export refunds for their exports, like the dairy, poultry and coarse grains sectors.</p>
<p>In the event of higher imports and lower exports a downward pressure on domestic prices is expected, with negative effect on producer revenues, speeding up the on-going restructuring of the agricultural sector, as less efficient farmers exit the sector, which in turn creates opportunities for the most efficient ones.</p>
<p>Analysis carried out within the Commission indicate that the lower revenues projected under the EU WTO offer may lead over the medium term to a scale down in production for some sectors, with decreases ranging between 10% for the beef sector and 4% for the cereals sector.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, a WTO deal is likely to open new market opportunities also for EU agricultural exports on third markets, especially for high value added and quality products.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0832"></a>

<p>In her answer to my written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2006-2320_EN.html">E-2320/06</a>, Commissioner Hübner referred me to the Greek authorities in connection with the failure to implement the Interreg IIIA Programme Greece-Turkey, which is not going ahead owing to the Turks casting doubt over its cross-border nature by refusing to recognise the international borders in the Aegean. The problem was also acknowledged by the former Foreign Minister of Greece, Mr Molyviatis, in his answer given to the Hellenic Parliament in December 2005 but, strangely enough, the Commission (which also funds the programme) simply confines itself to expressing the wish that implementation should start (answer to my question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2006-2320_EN.html">E-2320/06</a>).</p>
<p>I would, therefore, reiterate my specific question. Has there been an official Greek response to the attempt arising during the meeting of the Interreg IIIA (Greece - Turkey) monitoring committee of 23 November 2005 in Ankara, to cast doubt on Greek (and hence Community) borders, the Turkish side querying the cross-border nature of the relevant subprogramme?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is not aware of an official exchange of letters, between Greek and Turkish authorities, in relation to the programme mentioned by the Honourable Member. Furthermore, no record exists of the meeting under reference.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the INTERREG<a href="#defann_52_1" name="refann_52_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> IIIA programme Greece-Turkey is managed in a decentralised way. Therefore, the programme’s Managing Authority, which is responsible for the daily management and implementation of the programme, is the appropriate body to reply to questions relating to the implementation of the programme, including on the meetings of the Monitoring Committee. The Commission would recommend the Honourable Member to contact the Head of the Managing Authority in Thessaloniki by email (interreg@mou.gr), telephone ((+30)2310 469600) or fax ((+30)2310 469602). Further details are also available at www.interreg.gr</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to stress that the implementation problems do not concern the structure and content of the programme. In fact, the overall programme framework (programming document and programme complement) is satisfactory and fully coherent with the Structural Funds Regulations. The Commission would be pleased if the programme implementation could start so that genuine joint cooperation projects assisting the socio-economic development of the participating partners in Greece and Turkey could be financed.</p>
<p>Having said that, the Commission is aware of the different viewpoints, between the two countries participating to the programme, with respect to the terminology employed in the programme, and hopes that the current deadlock could be soon overcome.</p>

<p>(FR) When the taxable person applies goods forming part of his business assets to dispose thereof free of charge, that application shall be treated as supplies subject to VAT under Article 5(6) of the Sixth VAT Directive<a href="#defann_53_1" name="refann_53_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, where the value added tax on the goods in question or the component parts thereof was wholly or partly deductible.</p>
<p>This is a corrective mechanism guaranteeing compliance with the general principle governing VAT, namely that goods assigned to the realisation of an economic activity subject to VAT reach the final consumption stage subject to VAT, except where the Directive expressly provides for an exemption.</p>
<p>Accordingly, goods subject to a VAT deduction charged on purchase will in principle be subject to VAT either on account of the sale of the goods or their supply free of charge.</p>
<p>Once the goods have been sold, the taxable amount shall be based on the sale price of said goods (Article 11(A)(1a) of the Sixth VAT Directive).</p>
<p>Once the goods have been made for consideration under the abovementioned conditions laid down in Article 5(6) of the Sixth Directive, the VAT taxable amount shall be based on the sale price of the good or similar goods or, in the absence of a sale price, on the cost price determined at the time of supply (Article 11(A)(1b) of the Sixth VAT Directive).</p>
<p>The wording of the provision does not appear to run counter to the consideration of the condition of the goods at the time they are withdrawn.</p>
<p>Lastly, the honourable Member is reminded that the delivery of goods to accredited bodies exporting these goods outside the Community in the framework of their humanitarian, charitable or educational activities outside the Community is exempt from VAT under the conditions set by the Member States pursuant to Article 15(12) of the Sixth VAT Directive.</p>

<p>(EN) According to the latest information, the EU-15 Member States have reduced their greenhouse gas emissions by 0.9% compared to base year levels. The Commission is confident that the EU can achieve the 8% target under the Kyoto Protocol. However, this requires the swift implementation of measures that have already been agreed at EU and Member State level and the use of flexible mechanism as foreseen by the Member States. More details are given in the latest progress report<a href="#defann_55_1" name="refann_55_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> under Decision 280/2004/EC<a href="#defann_55_2" name="refann_55_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The majority of the policies and measures under the European Climate Change program (ECCP I) are now implemented at the European level. The Commission has launched the ECCP II in October 2005 in order to assess the actual emission reductions of the measures agreed and identify new initiatives to cut emission further. More information concerning this review has been published on this website: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/eccp_review.htm</p>
<p>As regards the European emission trading scheme, most Member States have already submitted their 2<span class="sup">nd</span> National Allocation Plans (NAPs) which will cover the period 2008-2012. A year ahead of the start of the Kyoto's 1<span class="sup">st</span> commitment period, it is of crucial importance that Member States use their NAPs in an ambitious way so as to ensure that they will meet their reduction obligations.</p>
<p>The Commission’s Communication “Winning the battle against global climate change”<a href="#defann_55_3" name="refann_55_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> outlines the general strategy for the negotiations under the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). At the 11<span class="sup">th</span> UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP) in December 2005 it was agreed to begin a dialogue with all Parties on post 2012 climate policy options. This forward-looking dialogue will be conducted in four workshops to be held over two years. The second workshop will take place during COP 12 in Nairobi (6-17 November 2006).</p>
<p>Parties to the UNFCCC also agreed at Montreal to discuss further emission reductions for developed countries under the Kyoto Protocol for the period after 2012. An UN ad-hoc working group under the Kyoto Protocol was set up and will also have its second meeting in Nairobi in November. It will complete its work as early as possible and in time to ensure that there is no gap between the first and the second Kyoto commitment period. Furthermore, next month, in Nairobi a review will start of the Kyoto Protocol, as foreseen in Article 9 of the protocol itself, improving the framework to attain the necessary emission reductions.</p>
<p>The discussions on further action should aim for strong and global action to curb climate change. The EU has put forward an objective of limiting global warming to 2°C and in order to do so global emissions will need to peak within the next two decades and decrease substantially afterwards, possibly up to -50% below 1990 levels by 2050. This will require strong action of all developed countries, including the United States. We need to look for strategies that ensure that developed countries reduce their emissions by 2020 with 15 to 30 % compared to 1990.</p>
<p>Given the strong projected growth of emissions in the rest of the world, we will also need to find a fair way to bring major developing countries with fast-growing emissions on board. We need to see how we can collaborate with them so that they choose a sustainable development pathway that enables us to reach the 2°C objective. Many actions, such as improved energy efficiency, are also for the benefit of developing countries, promoting their own sustainable development, decreasing impacts on the environment and increasing their energy security.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the Convention Dialogue will focus next month in Nairobi on actions that promote sustainable development and on the use of market based mechanisms. Two issues on which the EU has shown leadership. Also after Nairobi, Europe we will need continue this leadership to guarantee success in the international discussion on the future climate change framework.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Poland, however, with a population of 38 million, has a quota of only 8.6 m tonnes, just 0.23 tonnes per inhabitant.

<p>(EN) The Commission has paid great attention to the Polish milk situation during 2006.</p>

With regard to this national transfer, a Commission regulation will be published in the near future so that the Polish administration will be able to act in due time.</p>
<p>In fact, from the Accession in 2004 to the quota year 2006/2007, the Polish milk quota in deliveries has risen from 8.5 million tonnes to 9.142 millions tonnes corresponding to an increase of 7.55 %.</p>
<p>In relation to fixing the level of quota per Member State, all new Member States have been treated in the same way during the Copenhagen negotiation in 2002.

<p>The quota system is a production regulating system where the number of consumers should not be used as a deciding parameter. In the context of quotas, however, it shall be recalled that in accordance with the Luxembourg compromise, the Commission will present a market outlook report after the full implementation of the 2003 Reform, on the basis of which a discussion of future levels of quotas may take place in the various Community institutions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0847"></a>

<p>(FR) As to the first question, the Commission has no opinion to state on the ruling to which the Honourable Member refers. The Commission does not comment on rulings handed down by the Court of Justice as part of its responsibility for interpreting Community law.</p>
<p>On the general issue of the gender pay gap, the Commission has the following remarks to make.</p>
<p>Article 141 of the EC Treaty enshrines the principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value.</p>
<p>The principle of equal pay for men and women is also laid down by secondary law, in a number of directives. Directive 75/117/EC<a href="#defann_57_1" name="refann_57_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> establishes that the principle of equal pay for men and women means, for the same work or for work to which equal value is attributed, the elimination of all discrimination on grounds of sex with regard to all aspects and conditions of remuneration. Article 3 of Directive 2002/73/EC<a href="#defann_57_2" name="refann_57_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> provides that application of the principle of equal treatment means that there shall be no direct or indirect discrimination on the grounds of sex in the public or private sectors, in relation in particular to employment and working conditions, including pay.</p>
<p>Despite this substantial body of Community legislation, there is still a wide gender pay gap in the European Union. On average, women earn 15% less than men for every hour worked<a href="#defann_57_3" name="refann_57_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. Getting rid of this gap calls for a global approach, given that the gap stems from both direct discrimination against women and a number of structural inequalities.</p>
<p>In its roadmap for equality between women and men<a href="#defann_57_4" name="refann_57_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, the Commission identifies eliminating the gender pay gap as a priority area for action.</p>
<p>In 2007 the Commission will be submitting a communication on the gender pay gap, which will look at the various issues involved and put forward the measures required in order to eliminate the gap.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission believes that it is extremely important that the local authorities be involved in defining and meeting the objectives established in the operational programmes, but it would point out that the national and regional authorities must define the methods and the conditions that should govern such involvement and that guarantee that principles such as the good, sound financial management of actions cofinanced under the Structural Funds are upheld.</p>
<p>It should be noted that, in acknowledgement of the specific characteristics of the outermost regions, the EU has incorporated into its cohesion policy for 2007-2013 a number of measures geared towards helping these regions.

<p>(EN) Shortly after the events of 10 August 2006 in the United Kingdom, the Commission started working on a rulemaking addressing the new threat of liquid explosives whereby the air transport sector was consulted in full and regularly from the beginning.</p>
<p>Given the seriousness of the threat, the Commission, Member States and stakeholder organisations all agreed that a swift, though balanced, rulemaking was the most appropriate action to be taken. As it was also recognised that no cost-benefit study could be undertaken under given urgency to address this new threat, it was agreed to explicitly state in the Regulation that the measures introduced should be reviewed every 6 months in the light of technical developments, operational implications at airports and the impact on passengers.</p>
<p>As regards the implementation of this Regulation, Member States, airports and airlines will have time until early November to prepare for its introduction. Furthermore, the measures were developed with a view to keeping the operational effects of the restrictions to a minimum. Therefore, the Commission does not expect major problems for airports to adapt to the new requirements and conditions laid down in the Regulation.</p>

<p>(EN) The EU legislation on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) foresees that GM food and feed can be placed on the market only if authorised and appropriately labelled. Member States have the primary responsibility for enforcing these requirements and verifying that they are fulfilled by business operators.</p>
<p>Within its field of competences, the Commission is strongly determined to assist Member States in this respect. This determination has been proved in the case of the recent contamination of United States (US) long grain rice by the unauthorised GMO LLRICE601.</p>
<p>Despite the unfortunate delay in the communication of the incident by the US authorities, the Commission has immediately required Member States to adopt measures to prevent the unauthorised GM rice from entering the EU and to ensure the immediate withdrawal from its market of those rice products found positive for the presence of the LLRICE601.</p>
<p>Within five days an emergency decision was adopted only allowing shipments of long grain rice certified as free from the unauthorised rice event to enter the EU market.</p>
<p>When the Commission became aware of diverging results between the test performed in the US and the counter-testing of certified rice import at the harbour of arrival in the EU the original measure has been further strengthened.</p>
<p>Shortly the EU has shown to have both the tools and the willingness to impose the respect of its legislation.</p>
<p>It is however undeniable that in a situation where an increasing number of GMOs are cultivated or tested around the world the possibility of similar accidents can not be excluded. This is even more relevant for the EU, which is one of the biggest food importers in the world. For this reason the Commission is currently analysing how the existing mechanisms, and particularly those related to preventive controls, can be further enhanced in the respect of the competences of Member States which – it is worth reminding - are directly responsible for controls.</p>
<p>In this context one of the possibilities the Commission is currently exploring is to improve the existing control tools by further developing the detection methods for authorised and unauthorised GMOs and to impose an increased and uniform level of control for products of non-animal origin for the presence of GMOs.</p>
<p>Our legislative approach to GMO is already among the strictest in the world and the Commission will take any possible step to ensure its respect and full implementation. It will never compromise on the protection and trust of our citizens and consumers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0863"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission’s competition policy aims at promoting and maintaining competitive markets and behaviour which brings the greatest benefits to consumers in terms of the quality and price of products and services.</p>
<p>Competition policy therefore acts against illegal practices such as cartels or agreements in which competitors agree to fix prices, to limit production or to share markets or customers between them because such practices tend to lead to consumers having to pay more for less quality. Furthermore, the merger control exercised by the Commission ensures that businesses and consumers are protected from higher prices or a more limited choice of goods or services.</p>
<p>The Commission has also promoted opening up certain markets (such as for instance the air transport and telecommunications sectors) to competition allowing consumers to benefit from lower prices and new services.</p>
<p>In the field of consumer legislation, the Commission works in various ways to strengthen the position of consumers and make it easier for businesses to market and sell products in other Member States. For example Directive 2005/29/EC on Unfair Commercial Practices<a href="#defann_64_1" name="refann_64_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> will give consumers the same protection against aggressive or misleading marketing whether they buy locally or from other Member States’.</p>
<p>Later in 2006, the Commission will present a Green Paper organising a wide consultation with a view to identifying and avoiding possible gaps or inconsistencies in existing Community consumer legislation or the Member States’ application of it.</p>
<p>As a final point, the Commission would like to draw the attention of the Honourable Member to the European Consumer Centre Network which has been set up by the Commission and the Member States to give advice and to help European consumers facing problems with cross-border purchases. Where such problems relate to competition, consumers may contact the Consumer Liaison Officer which the Commission has appointed within its Directorate General for Competition.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
