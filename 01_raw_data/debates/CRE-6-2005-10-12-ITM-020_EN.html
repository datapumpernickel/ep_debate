<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doris Pack (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, we are about to discuss something wonderful – the circus. I hope we can enjoy it a bit, too; I certainly got a lot of fun out of the time I spent dealing with this issue, gaining many friends in the circus world, and I can only say that grappling with the circus as a subject was worthwhile. I did not, however, do this because I found it enjoyable, but because I was challenged by the problems that circuses face in the European Union and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">One object of this report is that the circus should be recognised, as a matter of course, as part of European culture. In only very few countries in the European Union is it seen as a cultural asset, and the nation states need to address this problem and recognise it as an important part of culture. This will make it possible to remedy the problems that circuses still face.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect I want to address is that of schooling and vocational training. The Commission should introduce mechanisms for the cooperation of the Member States in order to guarantee and promote an adequate education for the children of travelling communities – and by that I mean not just circus children, but all travelling communities – regardless of the Member State in which they happen to be. It would be very much to be desired that the Council should prepare a new resolution guaranteeing high-quality school education and vocational training for children, young people and adults in travelling communities and recognising and supporting the vocational training offered by circus schools.</p>
<p class="contents">The third problem has to do with what are termed temporary structures. The Commission could, following consultations with the European circus association, which is based here in Brussels, mandate the European Committee for Standardisation to prepare a comprehensive set of standards relevant to mobile circus facilities. For example, in the various countries of the European Union, different standards apply as regards such things as safety and the materials from which tents are made. That is not a joke; it is an unfortunate fact set in stone, and this is where changes need to be made. Fire safety, the rules on which even differ from one locality to another, is one of those simple things that present every travelling circus with real problems, and we really do need to get a grip on them without putting the safety of the public at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to consider circus workers, mobility, and the employment of third country nationals. The Commission needs to carry out an analysis of the current visa and work permit issuing systems, and use that as the basis for drawing up a European regulation in this area, which would take into account the difficulties currently involved in getting visas or work permits issued.</p>
<p class="contents">The existing requirements for performers with short-term work contracts are difficult to comply with and must also be done away with – I am thinking here of the requirement that there must be evidence of a lack of equally qualified persons within the EU. Can you explain to me how I am meant to demonstrate that when I want to bring in a star performer from Ukraine or China to perform in a circus in Europe? I would have to demonstrate that there are no performers in Europe with equivalent qualifications, but that really is nonsensical. No opera house would put up with that sort of nonsense; La Scala can employ singers from the European Union and from third countries too, but that option is not open to a circus, and that is what makes it important that the circus be recognised as something of cultural value. That will make things easier for the performers.</p>
<p class="contents">In drafting the report, we compromised and agreed not to say anything about the keeping of animals, because the keeping of animals by circuses is seen by some countries as a really major issue that they are keen to regulate at the national level. Nevertheless, we do take the view that animals are a part of the traditional circus and that it must be possible to adopt directives that enable circuses to keep them. Legislation of this sort exists in Germany and in England, for example; all we have to do is allow ourselves to be guided by it.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows that what we have set down in this report is perfectly reasonable. We would ask the Commission not only to take note of it, but also to actually do what we have demanded of it, by getting the Committee for Standardisation on the case and making it clear to the members of the national governments that the circus is a vital cultural asset, and one that we are still keen to pass on to our children and grandchildren.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ján Figeľ, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur Mrs Pack for her excellent work and the own-initiative report. The report covers all dimensions of the circus. The Commission will of course carefully study the recommendations of the report. However, already at this stage I would like to make some comments on some of the main elements.</p>
<p class="contents">The Parliament would like the circus to be recognised as forming part of European culture. Of course, it is not for the Commission to decide what belongs or does not belong to European culture. This seems to be a natural process and the circus seems naturally to be recognised as part of our culture. A good illustration of this at Community level is that many cooperation projects in the circus sector are co-financed under the EU culture programmes, for example, the <span class="italic">Cirque nouveau </span>project, a network of circus schools and music schools co-financed under the Culture 2000 Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also underlines the importance of taking special measures to help the children of travelling families such as the circus community. The education of pupils with educational disadvantage due to special circumstances is a very important matter. These children should be provided as much as possible with flexible learning settings. The Commission proposes to launch a study in 2006 in order to update the 1996 report on the steps taken by Member States to follow up the resolution of Council from 1989 – 16 years ago – on school provisions for children of occupational travellers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been invited to look at the development of responses to the special needs of this target public. We propose that the European Agency for Special Needs Education should examine this in its work programme for 2006-2007 period. The current Socrates and Leonardo programmes already provide support to projects dealing with travelling children and families. This will be continued in the future integrated lifelong learning programme. Therefore I invite the organisations representing the circus community to make full use of the possibilities offered by Community programmes. I know that Mrs Pack, who is also rapporteur for the very important new lifelong learning programme, is fully aware of the possibilities offered by these programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also requests that we establish European standards for mobile circus facilities. I am pleased to inform you that the Commission has already mandated the European Committee for Standardisation to establish a European standard for the safety of temporary structures, in particular tents. This European standard should be published by our standardisation organisation in the coming months. The Commission is ready to look at possible further European standards with the circus community.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the report, the Commission should facilitate the mobility and employment of circus workers from third countries. Current EU legislation does not provide for the possibility of issuing visas or residence permits which accommodate the needs of artists. We are very much aware of the difficulties encountered by the artists in obtaining visas which are longer than six months. The Commission will duly take this into consideration when reflecting the future of immigration policy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to borrow words from the French acting and singing teacher Francois Delsarte: ‘the artist is a traveller on this earth’. This is particularly true of circus professionals. Mrs Pack has put them on the map. Her report will undoubtedly contribute to better recognition of the circus as part of Europe’s culture and to more account being taken of its specific needs in the formulation of our policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that where there is a clear role for the Commission, I will do my utmost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to thank Commissioner Figel’ for the excellent way in which he responded to the questions that are included in Mrs Pack’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">Charlie Chaplin once said ‘I remain just one thing, and one thing only, and that's a clown. It places me on a far higher plane than any politician’. We politicians have to settle for that. There is, though, another quote from William Shakespeare, who said: ‘It is meat and drink to me to see a clown’.</p>
<p class="contents">Both statements indicate how highly a circus artist like the clown is rated. Indeed, we all treasure splendid memories of clowns, acrobats, jugglers, as well as animal trainers.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the circus has evolved with time, it is deeply rooted in our European culture. It has, in its current form, been around since the 18th century, but acrobats and jugglers also frequented markets and fairs many centuries before that. They moved from place to place to show off their skills. Not much has changed on that front.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else has, though, and that is the recognition – also the subject of Mrs Pack’s report – of this cultural heritage, of which it in fact gets very little. The circus offers not only entertainment, but also education, and also reaches a wide audience. Those are all reasons why this European circus culture concerns us all.</p>
<p class="contents">In this framework, the rapporteur is right in pointing out the significance of good schooling for children in travelling communities. Their access to good schools, vocational training, equivalent to education of other children, must be guaranteed. The rapporteur claims that ‘the circus is there for young and old, for children of all ages’ and I would like to follow that up with something with which Pipo the Clown, who was a famous Dutch clown, always used to end his television shows: ‘Goodbye birds, goodbye flowers, goodbye children’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have been approached by members of the public who worry about the use of animals in circuses and the possibility of cruel or harmful treatment. I share their concern. I urge Member State governments to ensure that circus animals are subject to appropriate regulation and inspection. However, I believe that the idea of banning animals from circuses goes too far. It is one thing to support animal welfare; it is quite another to ban a much-loved and traditional feature of the circus, which, as Mrs Pack’s report rightly says, is a recognised and ancient part of European culture.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a close parallel here with the issue of hunting, another target of the animal rights movement. The same criteria apply: hunting should be, and normally is, conducted with due attention to animal welfare issues. However, English fox hunting – like the circus – is a vital part of English cultural heritage and especially so in the East Midlands, which I represent.</p>
<p class="contents">I would oppose any move to ban animals from circuses and I oppose the unjust and counterproductive ban on fox hunting recently introduced in my own country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The circus is a special entertainment for adults. The circus is art and provides jobs for the people who work in it. The circus is also a zoo for those people who live far away from real, official zoos of the big cities. The circus is a home for many families and a school for their children. The circus is both outside and inside our societies; outside with its magic and fairy tales, and inside with its everyday needs and realities. Mrs Pack’s excellent report respects the magic and she well knows that magic should not be regulated. So she is trying to help the circus people solve their everyday problems. It is a good approach.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to provide adequate education for the children of travelling communities. Distance learning and e-learning can be part of the solution, but circus children should also meet other children coming from the so-called real life. A proper visa and work permit regime is also important for circus workers, as the circus really is without borders or frontiers.</p>
<p class="contents">As a former member of the Hungarian Parliament I tabled an amendment to incorporate into our penal code a punishment for the torture of animals. So I respect the wording about animals, but nevertheless, I do not support a total ban on animal attractions in our circus and I think Mrs Pack has a wise approach to this issue. Animals should be respected, but without them the circus would lose its ancient magic and we cannot kill magic. Lions, elephants, monkeys and other exotic animals in the circus made my childhood more colourful and it should remain so for new generations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a last remark which does not exactly concern the circus problem. I totally agree with Mrs Pack that work permits should be provided for circus workers, but I also think, as Mr Figel’ rightly pointed out, that work permits should also be provided for all working people in this European Union, even those coming from new member countries and even countries like in Germany. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank Mrs Pack for this initiative, for I do believe that it is very important to recognise that the circus is something of cultural value rather than a run-of-the-mill business activity.</p>
<p class="contents">When all countries eventually grasp that and their practices actually reflect it, the circus may well have a better chance of survival, for we have now reached the point at which that is something we need to campaign for. We need to be aware of this tradition and of its status as a European speciality. The maintenance of a cultural heritage is at stake, and that has to be said loud and clear.</p>
<p class="contents">In doing this, very simple things often become relevant – things that nevertheless appear to be very difficult, such as common standards for safety measures. It is not acceptable that a circus should, as it moves from one place to another or from one country to another, have to, again and again, get to grips with different administrative regulations and cope with the expense associated with them, which puts even more strain on a budget that is already overstretched.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we also have to have a new debate on the granting of visas. A longer visa should be available for performers such as these, although we will have to be careful to ensure that there is no possibility of its being abused for the purposes of people-trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to think through the issues around the education and training of children and come to common solutions. The even bigger problem that we will certainly not be able to resolve on our own is that of the keeping of animals by circuses, on which the presence of different national rules and regulations will make it difficult to find common ground. I do hope, though, that we will be able to do something that brings benefit to animals and pleasure to people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is interesting how many topics converge on the concept of the circus and European culture, or work together around the same topic. Naturally, the temptation to confuse professions or arenas is frequent, but a really good, high-quality circus deserves recognition, and that is mainly what this report is about. It is also about a specific responsibility for addressing topics that include not only culture, but also education, mobility and economics, since we are dealing with the entertainment industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I would again like to express my appreciation for the work, report and approach of rapporteur Doris Pack, as well as the contributions to the discussion, and I look forward to cooperating in this field on the development of the European cultural agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
