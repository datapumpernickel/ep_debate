<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mann, Thomas (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, 13 December 2001 was a black day, not only for relations between India and Pakistan. The attack on the Indian parliament by radical Islamic terrorists was an assault on the nerve centre of the world's largest democracy, on a freely-elected representative institution and on a multi-ethnic society. The aftermath has seen troops mobilised on a massive scale and weapons systems massed in a threatening manner.</p>
<p class="contents">There is great danger that raids by terrorists will gain them access to these weapons. The situation has been made more acute by the attack on the American cultural centre in Calcutta, which is suspected to have been the work of militant Muslim fundamentalists. Pakistan has for some years been suspected of affording Islamic extremists a safe haven and giving them logistical and material support. This time, though, President Musharraf ordered action to be taken. Around 1 500 suspects were interned and some 400 offices belonging to Islamic extremist organisations were closed. This is something that gives cause for hope.</p>
<p class="contents">The involvement of President Musharraf, a military leader, in the international anti-terrorist alliance has without a doubt helped bring his country out of isolation. His words on television to the effect that he wanted to be consistent in fighting terrorism, must, though, be matched by actions. It is much to be desired that those Taliban fighters who have gone to ground in Pakistan should be unmasked and arrested. The radical Islamic religious schools, which are an intellectual breeding ground for the Taliban, must undergo organisational restructuring and the reform of the content of their curricula. What is most important, though, is to investigate the causes of the sympathy for the Taliban and of the continuing adulation of them as freedom fighters over wide areas of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for intensive intellectual engagement here, which requires that state education be made a priority. People whose good education at school has gained them self-confidence and the capacity for critical judgement will also be in a position to resist all kinds of dictatorship and all forms of manipulation. Pakistan must come to accept the idea of religious freedom for minorities. This has been brought to our minds by, among other things, the most recent massacre during a service in a Christian church. The Islamic terrorists responsible for it have still not yet been caught.</p>
<p class="contents">Anti-Christian discrimination – including at the hands of the public authorities – must become a thing of the past, as must the persecution of other religions. India has demanded that Pakistan expose and extradite the ringleaders behind the attack on the Indian parliament, and it is quite right to do so. Actually doing this, though, will require a great deal of patience. The Indian rocket tests are ineffectual as a means of exerting pressure and constitute a provocation with counter-productive effects.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats calls on both parties in the conflict to bring all diplomatic means to bear on this crisis situation. We must see to it that military force is renounced. It is a matter of concern for me as vice-chairman of the delegation to the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation that Pakistan should finally ratify and implement the SAARC Convention on Suppression of Terrorism. Overall, the path mapped out by the Lahore and Simla Agreements must be followed. The European Union is very well able to play the role of a respected mediator, which surely all the parties want. Our balanced policy has earned us a great deal of trust over the years. Both these States and the security needs of South-East Asia as a whole are deserving of our commitment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Luckily, this exchange was avoided thanks to the sense of responsibility demonstrated by both sides. In other words, following the heated clash and the circumstances in which it took place, and rightly so, with the terrorists in Afghanistan, there was a risk of yet more unfortunate developments between two large countries with nuclear capabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this does not mean that the problem has been resolved. In this sense, the purpose of our debate here today is to remind both countries, both India and Pakistan, of their responsibilities towards their people and the neighbouring region. At the same time, however, we too need to assume our responsibility, as the European Union, to help find a peaceful solution to all the differences in the area, to respect for international law and human rights and to anything and everything relating to the Rule of Law and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this endeavour should not lead us to overlook the fact that Pakistan does indeed have a serious human rights problem, serious problems with democratic issues and serious problems with religious minorities. These problems are not being raised here in order to accuse Pakistan or in a gesture of friendship towards India. On the contrary. They are being raised as urgent priorities which both countries need to address, for their own good, for the good of the area and for the sake of peace in the area. Both countries are responsible for the stability of the area. And both countries are responsible for future developments, so that these areas can stop being areas of poverty, misery and conflict. In this sense, I believe that today's resolution and unanimous support for it from all sides of the House will make both a symbolic and a substantial contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I condemn in particular the attacks on the Indian Parliament and the US cultural centre. There is no justification for terrorism, whatever the perceived provocation.</p>
<p class="contents">But we have to look at the root causes of terrorism. That is why I am delighted that we have widened this resolution, even though we were unable to change the title; I would not like us to think that we are linking any country or organisation with these attacks. We still have no real knowledge of who perpetrated them so I am very pleased that the Indian government is investigating it and that Pakistan is helping with that investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">It gives me the opportunity to address the wider problem: the threat of war again between India and Pakistan. I welcome President Musharraf's announcement that he is clamping down on terrorism, but it is also important to look at the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir, which has been going on for over 50 years. I repeat the call for the EU to offer its services as a facilitator to both sides and to take account of the relevant UN resolutions. What I am proposing is something similar to what Senator Mitchell did in Northern Ireland. The people who continue to suffer are the ordinary people and civilians of India, Pakistan and Kashmir. People who say a facilitator provided by the EU, the Commonwealth or the UN is no way forward are not offering any alternative. We have to find an alternative to the bloodshed and to the continuation of this dispute. I hope we will vote for the resolution, to demonstrate not only our horror of terrorism but also the desire to find a solution to the tension within this region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us not underestimate the danger this posed as, had it succeeded in killing the assembled government ministers and opposition leaders, it could have heralded a war between India and Pakistan, both nuclear powers with massive conventional land forces as well – although India has at least declared a policy of no first use of its nuclear arsenal, unlike Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">The responsibility was soon traced to militant Islamic terrorist groups based in Pakistan, with full support and training from the Pakistani government, and also responsible for the earlier attacks in Srinagar against the Kashmiri State Assembly. This is in clear violation of Security Council Resolution 1373 forbidding states from sponsoring terrorism against other states. Nevertheless, I welcome President Musharraf's change of heart in backing the United States in their war on terrorism which toppled the Taliban regime and destroyed the al-Qa'ida network in Afghanistan, even though this regime was largely a creation of Pakistan's interservice intelligence agency; in particular, his speech of 13 January promising reforms of the madrassas, or religious schools, which fomented so much hatred of the west and bred an atmosphere conducive to the massacre of Christians peacefully at worship last year.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a promising start, but Pakistan has yet to accede to the request to extradite the 20 ringleaders of the plot. There are deep concerns that the kidnapping of Wall Street journalist Daniel Pearl may have involved renegade pro-Taliban members of the Pakistani security forces. There is now also some evidence from e-mails that the controller of the shoe-bomber Richard Reid, from my country alas, may have been based in Pakistan. I call, therefore, on Pakistan to ratify the SAARC and all UN conventions on terrorism and I congratulate India on its restraint in the face of provocation and on its joint declaration with the EU in November last year against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">During the Afghan war in the 1980s we in the west supported Islamic militant ideology in order to oppose the spread of communism. America, alas, paid the price on 11 September. Will the west again repeat this mistake? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I express our concern about the threat this poses to democratic societies and reaffirm that acts of terrorism anywhere in the world threaten peace and stability, but no more so than in India and Pakistan at the moment.

But we urge both sides to do all they can to avoid slipping into the prospect of war. That will require willingness and leadership on behalf of both India and Pakistan, and President Musharraf in particular. The only way forward is through negotiations. We hope that India and Pakistan, with the support of the European Parliament, can take that road rather than the much more dangerous road for themselves and the rest of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dupuis (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we have had a close shave, particularly because a first text was distributed, signed by both Mrs Lynne and Mr Elles, which was truly unacceptable. The work – particularly work that has been done through the night over the last few days – has significantly enhanced the text and has resulted in a document which, although still not perfect, is acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">We must bear in mind the title of and the reason for this resolution, namely the terrorist attacks in India. Therefore, the resolution is, first and foremost, an expression of solidarity with the victims of these attacks. Dr Tannock outlined to us the disastrous effects that this attack could have had on the whole of the ruling class in India.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the resolution underestimates them, just as we, I believe, are to a certain extent overestimating the effect of what are still, at this stage, only statements made by President Musharraf. As Dr Tannock quite rightly pointed out, not all the madrassas, or religious schools, have as yet been closed down, and it is therefore vital that we maintain a firm approach towards Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would also say to Mr Souladakis that, in this case, balance is no real guarantee of democracy. We are forgetting that India is a democracy and has been one for over 50 years. Democracy is and must continue to be a reference point for Parliament. India is a developing country, which for more than 50 years has continued to strengthen its democracy with the population as it stands. There is almost no other situation like this in the world. There is China – India’s great neighbour, a great market, an Eldorado for many of our fellow Members. And then, there is this great country that we all too often forget, where the Commission has made a fair amount of progress over the last two to three years. The first EU-India summit has been held, and has been followed by a second one, but this is really not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">By virtue of its system of government and of its will to forge ahead with its development whilst respecting democratic values, India should serve as a point of reference for our cooperation policy with all the countries of the world. India’s difficulties are infinitely greater than those of many other countries, in which we continue to tolerate a dictatorial regime, fundamentalism and other similar scourges.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to thank the Members who worked late into the night to transform the basic text and to make this into a document that supports India. I think that we could have gone further in our support and that we must continue to exercise extreme caution where Pakistan is concerned, because Pakistan has, on many occasions, indicated its good intentions, but it is still not going far enough.</p>

I want to say how delighted I am at her election.</p>
<p class="contents">What happened on 13 December of last year in the Indian Parliament was unprecedented. The Parliament of a democratic, pluralistic country was attacked by militant Islamicist groups. Parliament – the very heart of democracy – was exposed to a brutal assault. People were murdered. Democracy as a whole was called into question by these militant Islamicists.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we ourselves should try to understand emotionally what happened in New Delhi on that day. Imagine if our own Parliament here in Strasbourg or our national parliaments – in my case, the <span class="italic">riksdag</span> in Stockholm – were to be exposed to a terrorist attack. We should react in the most vigorous way. It is perhaps difficult for us, as Europeans, properly to understand the real seriousness of what happened.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to address Commissioner Diamantopoulou and mention something about the Islamic religious schools, or <span class="italic">madrassas </span>as they are called, in Pakistan. I believe that the Commissioner and the European Union have an incredibly important task when it comes to promoting a form of education in these schools that is based upon the ideas of love and of love of one’s neighbour and does not see other religions or other political outlooks with the eyes of hatred, for it is in these <span class="italic">madrassas</span> and other Islamicist contexts that hatred is disseminated.</p>
<p class="contents">Dear friends, the Taliban regime in Afghanistan <span class="italic">has </span>fallen, but the Taliban regime’s mentality of hatred and violence, of calling other people ‘infidels’ and seeing them as inferiors, is a frame of mind that still exists. I would call upon Mrs Diamantopoulou to do everything she can to ensure that it is tolerance and the ideas of love and love of one’s neighbour that come to characterise education in Pakistan and, of course, in schools in the Middle East too.</p>
<p class="contents">Religion should be all about ennobling the soul, promoting lofty ethics and morality and giving people spiritual values – not about serving the causes of violence and hatred. Pakistan operated as a training ground for the Al-Qa’ida terrorists. It was one of three countries in the world that recognised the Taliban regime. Afghanistan’s Taliban ambassador to Pakistan was allowed to remain there following the attack on the United States on 11 September. Pakistan has a very great deal to put in order. What President Musharraf has said is important. We are now waiting for him to take vigorous action.</p>

<p class="contents">This resolution by Parliament is to be welcomed with satisfaction. The Members of the House have stressed that what happened was an exceptionally serious terrorist attack against the supreme institution of greater global democracy. The European Union has unanimously expressed its outrage at this event. The Council has made a number of statements condemning these incidents and expressing the solidarity of the European Union with the Republic of India. The Council and the Commission have also stressed repeatedly that Pakistan must continue and expand its anti-terrorist policy. India is asking for Pakistan to take specific action to demonstrate that it is determined to stamp out all forms of terrorism, a perfectly legitimate request.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the attack on 13 December, we have witnessed an unprecedented influx of troops along the border between the two countries and the increased tension and military clashes are causing concern. We therefore welcome the announcement by the President of Pakistan, General Musharraf, on 12 January, announcing drastic measures to combat terrorism and religious fanaticism. It is a step in the right direction and will help to defuse the tension between India and Pakistan. The Commission will continue to draw both sides' attention to the need to cooperate rather than take the military option. Next week, when the European Union and India meet at ministerial level on 14 February, the troika's message will be twofold. First it will assure India that it has its full support in combating terrorism, as agreed in the declaration against terrorism at the second summit, and secondly, it will encourage both sides to return to the negotiating table as quickly as possible and to start withdrawing their troops. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
