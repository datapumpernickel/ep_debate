<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lulling </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur. – (FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, following the Kalanke ruling – concerning the gentleman from Bremen whom the European Court of Justice ruled on 17 October 1995 to have fallen victim to discrimination because his female colleague had been promoted rather than himself, based on the state law on equality in the Land Bremen – the Commission submitted on 17 March 1996 a proposal to amend the 1976 directive. In so doing, it most certainly believed it had done the right thing.</p>
<p class="contents">I was then appointed rapporteur on 2 July 1996. I considered that this proposal – which was admittedly well‐intentioned – still jeopardised the positive action which we, at least in the Committee on Women"s Rights, still consider to be necessary in order to achieve equal treatment and opportunities for women and men, should we want to see this equality before the year 3000. In agreement with Parliament"s Committee on Women"s Rights, I decided to await the Court"s ruling on another case, that of the Marschall case: again a man, this time from North Rhine‐Westphalia, who claimed to have fallen victim to discrimination because his female colleague had been chosen for promotion over him.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, the Court of Justice did not find in favour of Mr Marschall in its ruling of 11 November 1997. Why not? Did it want to correct what many experts we consulted had referred to as the serious mistake committed in the Kalanke case? Does the Amsterdam Treaty, which will soon be ratified, have anything to do with it? In fact, the Treaty makes equal opportunity policies a Community task, and expressly stipulates in Article 119 that measures providing for specific advantages with a view to ensuring full equality in practice between men and women are compatible with the principle of equality, and do not therefore constitute discrimination. In other words, positive discrimination does not discriminate.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the Marschall ruling, we considered in consultation with another expert hearing whether the positive action can be preserved without amending the 1976 directive. Since we know that on the open sea and before judges we are all in God"s hands, we took the view on the one hand that in a future case we would not be able to trust the Court because it might completely change direction on this. On the other hand, we considered that the proposed amendment still jeopardises positive action. Why?</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, both judgments can be interpreted as meaning that only rigid, inflexible and automatic positive discrimination granting the absolute and unconditional right to appoint or promote women – or men – where they are under‐represented would be incompatible with Community law, but even a quota system which does not preclude the assessment of the particular circumstances of an individual case would be compatible with the directive. This means that, in practice, a woman can be given priority for promotion in the event of equal suitability, competence and professional performance, unless reasons specific to an individual candidate tilt the balance in his favour.</p>
<p class="contents">Precisely because the Commission proposed a text to us which stipulates that measures giving preference to a member of the under‐represented sex are possible, ‘provided that such measures do not preclude the assessment of the particular circumstances of an individual case", we consider that with such a formulation comes the danger that the aim of positive action will be circumvented where reasons specific to an individual candidate are put forward which risk not being interpreted objectively, thus watering down the positive action which, for that matter, increasingly concerns under‐represented men. In my country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the number of women primary school teachers and magistrates has already been increased too much, in my humble opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Giving the current situation regarding the Amsterdam Treaty, we take the view that the amendment of the directive proposed in 1996 is inappropriate. We call on the Commission to withdraw it, but we also urge it to submit a new proposal based on the Amsterdam Treaty. At the same time, we stress the fact that it is no longer necessary to regard positive action as a derogation – which is permitted and can therefore be revoked at any time – from the principle of equal treatment, in order to recognise an individual right only and not a right which has a place in a society seeking to achieve such equality through democratic means.</p>
<p class="contents">We no longer dare to question the right to equal treatment and opportunities between men and women as a fundamental right of a democratic society, which demands equal treatment and opportunities that are achieved through a series of active measures, including positive action.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a directive which we are hoping for should contain mandatory legal instructions with a view to taking positive action wherever necessary in order to achieve equal treatment and opportunities for men and women and to remedy the under‐representation of women in decision making.</p>
<p class="contents">Our message is clear, Commissioner: withdraw the proposal to amend the existing directive and draft a new one, taking account of the conclusions of my report which we will be voting on before the draft legislative resolution. Moreover, before voting on this legislative resolution, we want to see here and now, <span class="italic">hic et nunc</span> , the Commission"s clear and firm commitment to agree to both these paragraphs in the draft legislative resolution.</p>

Women have come a long way this century. In the 19th century in English law women had no capacity to enter into contracts and were classified along with minors and lunatics. It was only this century that they were granted equality in divorce law. In my profession women were forbidden to become solicitors until 1919, and I recently celebrated 75 years of the first woman solicitor in England. But there is no room for complacency: women still have not achieved equal pay in reality or equal status in very hierarchical job structures.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lulling's report looks at the Commission's proposal on positive discrimination following the decision in the European Court of Justice, namely the Kalanke decision, which decreed that positive discrimination was not normally lawful. Subsequent to the Commission proposal, the Marschall decision was given by the European Court of Justice which qualified the Kalanke decision and said that in certain circumstances positive discrimination could be lawful.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we need to note the Amsterdam Treaty, which will strengthen equal opportunity rights for women when it has completed its ratification process and comes into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I agree with Mrs Lulling's conclusion that the Commission's proposal is not timely and needs to be withdrawn and a new, better proposal needs to be reintroduced when the Amsterdam Treaty comes into effect.</p>

<p class="contents">I would say to the Commission: you really will be offering flowers to the women workers of the European Union if you withdraw the proposed amendment to the equal treatment directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Women have waged a hard struggle here in the European Parliament, but also in my country, Germany, especially the Social Democrats, to achieve progress in equal treatment legislation. In Bremen and in North Rhine‐Westphalia we had a very progressive ruling, which then suffered a bitter defeat with the European Court of Justice ruling in the Kalanke case. We had an equal treatment law that emphasised that given applicants with the same qualifications, preference should be given to the under‐represented sex, something we have finally also achieved in the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">A man felt this law discriminated against him. So he took legal action and won his case at the European Court of Justice. Fortunately the Marschall ruling mitigated this a little, by specifically stressing the hardship clause in North Rhine‐Westphalian law, which allows positive measures to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kalanke ruling had disastrous outside effects. The fact that the Commission proposed an amended directive following that ruling reflects the same trend.</p>
<p class="contents">I was approached by the Korean president of a women"s organisation who had examined the effects of the proposed directive in Korea. The Kalanke ruling was also discussed at many international meetings. But worst and most frightful of all was the discussion in our Member States, among the regulars in the pubs and bars, where the men all started to feel discriminated against and thought they could invoke the law.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that this proposal for an amended directive is withdrawn. I cordially request you to announce this today.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Mann, Thomas </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, the struggle for equality between men and women has seen some significant successes but has also suffered some bitter setbacks. The 1995 Kalanke ruling, which found in favour of a man who believed he had been discriminated against because an equally qualified female colleague was given preference over him, belongs in the second category. The ruling stated that, given identical qualifications, it was an infringement of Community law for female candidates automatically to be given preference. The Commission amended its directive and argued that a rigid quota system that did not take account of individual circumstances was unlawful, while positive action – for instance flexible quotas – was lawful. Our Committee on Women"s Rights regarded the proposal as a whole as not very useful and warned against any watering down of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">While the Kalanke ruling was a setback, the European Court of Justice"s decision in the 1997 Marschall judgment was encouraging. Laws that give priority to women but also allow individual cases to be assessed and do not exclude men from the outset are absolutely consistent with Community law. Accordingly, positive action measures must be taken to remove the still considerable inequalities on the labour market and in regard to promotion. At the time the Commission was waiting for the Court of Justice"s judgment and for the negotiations in the run‐up to the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">So it would be consistent for you, Commissioner, to take a similar approach today. Articles 2 and 3 of the Amsterdam Treaty stipulate that equality between men and women is a task and an aim. All active policies will pursue that aim in future. So I would ask you to accept the plea by Astrid Lulling, our as ever pugnacious rapporteur, which the European People"s Party will of course approve again. Withdraw your proposal to amend the directive; it dates from the time after the Kalanke and before the Marschall ruling, so it is certainly old enough!. A new proposal must respect the evaluation of equal opportunities as a Community task, as it must the specific advantages allowed in Article 119 for the under‐represented sex in the Member States of the European Union.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ribeiro </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Mrs Lulling's report recommends that Parliament should reject the Commission's proposed amendment to the directive implementing the principle of equal treatment of men and women in the field of access to jobs, vocational training and promotion and working conditions. It argues for it to be rejected since both the hearing which took place and the text of the Treaty on European Union show that the Commission proposal is already outdated. This further drives home the fact that if this directive, which is getting on for a quarter of a century old, is to continue to be justified it will have to be updated so that it can make an effective contribution towards positive measures to combat social discrimination on the grounds of sex.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur believes that it is not enough to combat discrimination by means of civil law and insists that the right to equal opportunities must be guaranteed by having social structures designed to achieve that equality in society. We cannot make do with formal and, to some extent, inconsequential statements.</p>
<p class="contents">Equal opportunities have, after all, a lot to do with access to the labour market and, regardless of whether or not we agree with the position taken by the rapporteur and the Committee on Women's Rights which has been put before Parliament, it seems highly appropriate to recall – yet again and at the risk of repeating what has already been said about the subject – what day it is today.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, 8 March is extremely significant and this report makes it all the more appropriate to mention it. 8 March was not plucked out of the air but was selected as Women's Day because, in 1857, the seamstresses of New York held a major demonstration to protest against the exaggerated excess (pardon the tautology) of their working hours.</p>
<p class="contents">Nearly half a century later it should be pointed out that one of the main demands is a reduction in working hours in keeping with modern living and working conditions while, on the other hand, employment is becoming more precarious. As a result of what is known as atypical work, the working day has virtually become limitless especially for women, who are taking on all kinds of tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">Home‐working, piecework and contracting out are all, in some way, turning today's textile workers into latter day New York seamstresses. They are now experiencing at very close hand the worsening discrimination in the labour market. It is therefore with some surprise that we realise that in 1999 we are not so far from 1857. We could and should have come a very long way from those times.</p>

We have two rulings by the European Court of Justice before us, in addition to the proposal to amend the Council"s directive. The Committee on Women"s Rights finds that the proposed amendment would water down the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as it cannot be right to rectify one injustice by committing another, so it cannot be right to rectify the discrimination against women by discriminating against men. The very concept of positive discrimination should make us think again. Positive and discrimination: how can you combine the two? For the word positive must mean removing practical occupational hindrances, obstacles or disadvantages affecting women, such as the shortage of child care facilities or the non‐payment of pensions for the years spent in child care. The strategy of women"s policy should not simply be to achieve a numerically fair distribution. Reverse discrimination in the form of a mechanical preference in fact conflicts with another basic value, namely the equal treatment of every individual.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Van Lancker </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, on this International Women"s Day, I would ask Mrs Gradin, who has already been so helpful on women"s issues, to give Europe"s women a special little present by withdrawing this proposal for a Commission directive, as other Members too have urged her to do. I fully appreciate that the Commission was trying with this proposal to resolve the uncertainty which has existed since the Kalanke judgment and which in my view the Marschall judgment did nothing to dispel. We are quite convinced that the proposal now before us will just make things more chaotic still. The fact is that the individual power of assessment in recruitment and promotion envisaged in the text will in our view trigger huge numbers of lawsuits in which men invoke individual exemptions to the positive actions rule. We are convinced that escalating numbers of lawsuits like this will weaken the action taken by Member States which have strong legislation on positive action and which apply quotas – not positive discrimination but positive action – in favour of equally well qualified women. This legislation may be undermined.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a basic problem in Europe, namely that European law has always regarded positive action as the absolute exception to the individual"s right to equal treatment. All of us in this Chamber know that the position of men and women is very different in employment, in education, in the family, in society, not because one sex is worth less than the other, but because society remains fundamentally male‐oriented and thus inherently discriminates against women. My conclusion from that is that equal treatment alone cannot get rid of inequality. On the contrary, equal treatment reinforces inequality. So our view is that this Commission proposal does not provide the answer.</p>
<p class="contents">As other speakers have already said, the Amsterdam Treaty will help the Union a great deal, because it commits the Union to taking active measures against discrimination and at the same time to taking active measures to promote equality. So that means not just the mainstreaming we were looking at just now in Marianne Eriksson"s report, but positive action too. So once again I join other Members in asking the Commission to withdraw this proposal and come up with a new and stronger one.</p>
<p class="contents">This really would be the best present the Commissioner could give Europe"s women on this International Women"s Day, but you could do something else as well. I had a phone call from Bosnia‐Herzegovina recently. Elections are due there very soon. There used to be quotas for women on the list in Bosnia‐Herzegovina, although it was not a statutory requirement. It now looks as if these quotas may be scrapped, and Bosnia"s women are looking expectantly to Europe for help. It really would be terrible to see a retrograde step being taken here.</p>

In regard to equal opportunities for women the Amsterdam Treaty may be one step forward, but the European Court of Justice ruling in the Kalanke case and the Commission proposal to amend Directive 76/207/EEC represent two steps back.</p>
<p class="contents">Women today are better educated and more mobile than ever and the number of women in employment is rising. But there is a definite shortage of women in the higher echelons of politics, industry and science. That is not because women are less qualified or less intelligent but because of the glass ceiling, an unseen barrier set up consciously or unconsciously by a traditionally male‐dominated ruling class.</p>
<p class="contents">So why the Commission has replaced the term ‘women"s opportunities" with the term ‘under‐represented sex" is beyond me. We should not adopt a directive that falls short of the Amsterdam Treaty and thereby undermines women"s opportunities to occupy a position in society consistent with their qualifications, especially now that the European Parliament and the Vienna Council have taken up the equal opportunities cause. The Amsterdam Treaty represents progress along the road to equal opportunities. It must be implemented and not watered down. So the Lulling report and the request to the Commission to withdraw its amended proposal for a directive make sense.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McKenna </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – Mr President, in an ideal world positive discrimination should not be necessary but, unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal world. While some people may say that it is not the right approach, it is the only way we are going to get any sort of progress for women. As you can see, even in the electoral process in Member States positive discrimination is the only way to get women elected to national parliaments and to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It means that men and the policy‐makers are going to have to look at the way society is structured. As society stands in the vast majority of Member States, it does not favour the participation of women in the workforce. It is important for women who have not been in the workforce before to get access to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the way the programmes have been set up in Member States does not take account of the fact that these women were in the unofficial workforce and were contributing to society in their role as carers etc. They are now being prevented from joining the workforce because they do not have a track record. Even in training programmes this is not taken into account. The only way we are going to move forward is if we put in place measures which some people may feel discriminate against men. Unfortunately, society has discriminated against women for centuries and the only way we are going to move forward is if we put in place some sort of structure that ensures that women actually get into decision‐making and into the workforce. When we eventually have true equality there will be no need for positive discrimination.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gradin, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. ‐</span> The report by Mrs Lulling already has a long history. After  judgment in 1995, the Commission proposed to amend Directive 207/EEC of 1976. This proposal was submitted to the Council at the end of March 1996. Since then the Committee on Women's Rights has worked long and hard on that proposal. In Mrs Lulling's report the Commission is now asked to withdraw its proposal. That is also what all of you have been talking about. As you know, my colleague Commissioner Flynn appeared before the Women's Rights Committee on 16 February and clearly stated his position. His intention is to propose to withdraw the proposal as requested by Parliament. On the same occasion Commissioner Flynn announced his intention concerning use of the new legislative powers given to the Community. The aim is to adopt measures in order to ensure full equality or treatment between women and men in the field of employment, and these two issues are linked.</p>
<p class="contents">The ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty will hopefully be complete within a few months. We will then have a Treaty which confers a new legal base, Article 141(3), for legislating equal treatment between women and men in the field of employment. I can confirm to you that we are looking very actively and positively at the question of legislating under Article 141. We are doing so with a very open mind. There are legal questions on several aspects of the Article, particularly as regards its scope. The Commission is therefore taking legal advice. In the light of this advice we will then decide the content of a proposal for a directive based on Article 141.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this statement should answer Parliament's question and indicate the Commission's willingness to make use of Article 141 in a general positive action.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me once again thank the Women's Rights Committee and Mrs Lulling for their work on this important issue.</p>
