<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hernández Mollar (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, on 27 May 2002, the Council adopted Regulation (EEC) 881/2002 in the aim of transposing a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions. In practical terms this dealt with two resolutions establishing actions, principally the freezing of funds and other economic resources, applicable to the persons and bodies included on the list created by the United Nations Sanctions Committee specifically for this purpose. The European Parliament delivered its opinion on 11 April 2002, under an emergency procedure, and adopted the Resolution with 14 amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Last December, the United Nations Security Council adopted another Resolution, No 1454 of 2002, recognising certain exceptions to the obligation to freeze funds and economic assets. On this basis, the European Commission submitted the proposal before us today, which echoes, almost word for word, the United Nations text.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal, therefore, concerns authorising the release of funds for the individuals included on the list, in order to cover basic human needs, such as expenses related to food, medical treatment, legal fees, rent, etc. as the Parliament European itself called for in the Resolution of 11 April 2002, to which I have already referred.</p>
<p class="contents">On that occasion, however, the plenary of the European Parliament also tabled other amendments that were not included by the Council in Regulation (EEC) 881/2002, or by the Commission in its current proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs voted for a range of amendments that are adopted in the report before us today, which I propose we endorse in its entirety. There are five amendments, which seek the express inclusion in the Community Regulation of the procedure for deleting the names of individuals from the list of terrorists currently in force in the United Nations, to ensure that the European Parliament is fully involved and informed, and to deal with the need for the lifespan of this Regulation to be in line with the period of validity of the United Nations resolutions it is transposing.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, having touched briefly on a specific issue, that we today have the task of debating, I wish to take the last few minutes of the speaking time I have left to make a more general observation on the reasons that have led to our having to adopt this type of international and European law. The reason is nothing less than the persistence of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, over the last year and a half in particular, bloody terrorist brutality has shaken the entire world. Focusing on the fight against terrorism in the European Union, I wish to highlight one aspect that I believe is relevant. If we do indeed all agree that we wish to create an area of freedom, security and justice, we must work to ensure that its three components work fully and with equal intensity throughout the territory of the European Union. Nevertheless, there is no point in talking about a European area of this nature if, in practice, not all of the European territory is fair, safe and free. The main cause of this is the persistence of terrorism in the European Union. This is not something alien to our borders but something that persists within these very borders.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the competent European authorities have started working on adopting an entire legislative arsenal to combat the terrorist scourge. Although all actions to achieve this end can be questioned and, of course, evaluated; I also wish to condemn those voices that have been raised, which are much more concerned about safeguarding the rights and freedoms of terrorists than with remembering the harm, the suffering and the despair that these people inflict on their victims, not to mention the sense of injustice and impotence engendered by such acts.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I fervently hope in future to see practical approaches to the rights and freedoms of the victims of terrorism and their families. In this context, and taking advantage of the Commission’s presence amongst us today – I see that the Council is not present – I shall take the opportunity to suggest the idea that is already beginning to be talked of in the corridors and to which I hope we will soon have an answer; I am referring to studying the possibilities of creating a mechanism for solidarity at European level that provides formulas for compensating European citizens who have been the victims of terrorist attacks on EU territory.</p>

These restrictions were introduced under the common foreign and security policy and in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the terrorist attacks on the USA on 11 September 2001 and the subsequent collapse of the Taliban regime, these measures were reviewed in early 2002. This review led to the lifting of certain restrictions against Afghanistan, such as the flight ban. However, measures against individual members of the former Taliban regime were maintained. At the same time, a great many countries adopted new measures relating to various persons and entities associated with Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network.</p>
<p class="contents">These measures were taken by the European Union and other members of the international community in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1390(2002). The list of persons and entities whose funds and economic resources are to be frozen was determined by a committee of the UN Security Council on the basis of Chapter VII of the UN Charter on measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. These measures are binding on all UN members.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council of the European Union transposed this list into Community law by means of Regulation (EC) 881/2002 and authorised the Commission to publish amendments to this list. As you yourself mentioned, Mr Hernández Mollar, it was in April that Parliament adopted its opinion on this regulation. The Council and the Commission very much welcome Parliament's cooperation in this matter, not only as regards the fight against terrorism and the financing of that fight, but also in terms of strengthening the reputation of Member States as loyal members of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">In its opinion of April last year, Parliament quite rightly pointed out that there can be no exceptions in any circumstances to certain rights, the right to life being one of them. The Council considered this and other demands made in Parliament's opinion, taking into account the Member States' obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. On the basis of this consideration the Council reached the conclusion that under the relevant Security Council resolution it was not permissible for the Member States of the European Union to adopt unilateral exemptions to the provisions for freezing funds.</p>
<p class="contents">It was therefore necessary to raise this point in the Security Council. Consultations took place with the members of the UN Security Council on the exemptions, which were largely based on humanitarian considerations. During these consultations, some members expressed their concern that exemptions could make the basic arrangements unworkable in practice. This is the background against which the proposal for possible exemptions needs to be viewed. The proposal is in line with Resolution 1452(2002) of the UN Security Council, in accordance with which exemptions are permissible upon application by Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the report prepared by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and wishes to thank the rapporteur very sincerely for his very hard work. The report shows that the exemptions proposed here sufficiently reflect concerns about the possible impact of measures on the right to life of natural persons affected by sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the proposal contained in the report to stipulate exactly what procedures persons and entities on the list should follow if they wish to apply to be deleted from the list of those persons and entities whose funds and economic resources are frozen.</p>
<p class="contents">Resolution 1452 and the proposal on which Parliament has given its opinion are important means for promoting respect for fundamental rights. The Commission is conscious that the right balance needs to be struck between the basic rights guaranteed in democratic societies and the need to fight terrorism, a need which has a very high priority on the agenda of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">As the international community believes that terrorism threatens international peace and security, it is vital that the powers of the UN Security Council to react to such threats should be preserved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The tragic events of 11 September 2001 and the terrorist attack of 12 October 2002 in Bali are recent, shocking and violent illustrations of this. We have absolutely no doubt that this scourge must be combated, in the aim of protecting our citizens from any threat to their security.</p>
<p class="contents">I must praise the swift and effective action that the European Union has undertaken to provide an effective response to this scourge, defining a global anti-terrorist strategy by adopting the European plan of action to combat terrorism on 21 September 2001, with later updates in Ghent, Laeken and more recently in Seville. I am also pleased to note the significant progress made on exchanges of information, on police and judicial coordination in the fight against terrorism, and on the legislative framework. Nevertheless, whatever responses we come up with to combat this type of threat, we must always bear in mind that any measure that is taken cannot and must not call into question full respect for, assurances of and the promotion of the fundamental and human rights that have always underpinned European construction.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said earlier with regard to the issue of the transmission of personal data by airlines on flights to and from the United States, combating crime must be done in full compliance with the rule of law and not call citizens’ rights into question. Furthermore, our fight for security cannot and must not undermine freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, therefore, ensure a degree of balance without calling into question the fundamental values accepted by our societies. We cannot allow the principles of law and civic rights to become victims of this combat. The proposal that we are debating today clearly demonstrates that, if a set of repressive measures is adopted as part of the fight against terrorism, including the freezing of funds and financial assets, we must also provide for exceptions to these actions, which could be granted for humanitarian reasons – for example, the payment of rents or mortgages, the purchase of food, health expenses, amongst others, so as to avoid potential breaches of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore congratulate Mr Hernández Mollar on his report. This is a timely initiative, which clearly alerts us to a fact that some people appear not to want to understand: the fact that any fight that forgets these priorities will ultimately constitute an unjustified acceptance of barbarity and a step backwards in terms of civilisation, which we find unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The anti-terrorist legislation to which we have had to devote ourselves following 11 September is designed to strike a balance in which we, on the one hand, respond to terrorist crimes but, on the other hand, also promote and defend legal certainty in the process. The legal certainty of the individual must be guaranteed in connection with the fight against terrorism. When three Swedish citizens were listed among those whose funds and economic resources were to be frozen following 11 September, it was very clear what difficulties arise when people, first of all, are put onto such a list; secondly, they do not know what action to take in order to appeal against a decision; and, thirdly, they do not know how they are to keep body and soul together when they have no access to what is needed to meet the exigencies of daily life.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore pleased that the European Parliament can now contribute to a procedure more in keeping with legal certainty: a humanitarian exemption from the freezing of funds and economic resources, of which the rapporteur has given an account. That is something for which the Member States, including Sweden, and the European Parliament have been working over a long period.</p>
<p class="contents">Putting people onto terrorism lists in order to prevent terrorist crimes is an administrative procedure. It is a question of implementing international law under the UN Charter. As always in the case of action taken by the authorities, legal certainty at both national and international levels is important to the individual. Moreover, improvements to the UN resolutions are now slowly taking place. One example is that the UN Sanctions Committee must, from this year, justify its decisions, something that is absolutely crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">In the future too, the European Parliament must, at every opportunity, require that the fundamental human rights accorded by our international community be respected, even in difficult situations such as that following 11 September. Legal uncertainty still exists and, in this area, the committee’s new amendments can play a major role. We propose that the EU introduce provisions concerning processes for deleting persons from lists of those whose funds and economic resources are to be frozen. That is something we propose on the grounds that the process must become still more legally certain.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments that the committee is proposing and on which we have to adopt a position tomorrow are constructive, because they require a procedure for de-listing. These amendments must then be carefully considered by the international community, the Commission and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the basis, however, of the current arrangements, it has to be said that the rules surrounding the regulation on the freezing of funds and economic resources, involving the entry of names on terrorism lists, is without any form of legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that this is legislation that defines specific persons and organisations in advance as terrorists, and the content of the report is a type of humanisation of these rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation, roughly speaking, is that the EU’s rules have come about on the basis of the UN’s resolutions, but the UN Sanctions Committee acts, in general, on the dictates of the United States, where the principle applies that that it is better to risk having ten innocent victims than to see one guilty person go free. That is in actual fact the principle that generally applies. What is happening now is an improvement in the legal position in certain respects, but there is a fundamental lack of elementary legal certainty in as much as someone suspected of terrorism should also be entitled to a defence and to be informed of the basis of the accusation. That is what the amendment by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is, in the first place, designed to remedy and improve. It is a question of our moving from a position of absolutely no legal certainty towards something resembling legal certainty, and our proposal is aimed at extending such legal certainty by, firstly, entitling people to contest accusations and to be given access to a basic defence and by, principally, resisting a situation in which specific designated groups are branded as terrorists, without having recourse to the due processes of law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
