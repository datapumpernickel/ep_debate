There is still no room for either democracy or a free press to thrive. One touchstone for the rule of law in Russia is the case of Grigory Pasko, in which, as in so many other cases, the judgment is founded on secret military legislation, dating back to the Soviet Union and not even recorded in the country's own Ministry of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">What did Grigory Pasko do? He did nothing more than was his duty as a journalist and a citizen. He demonstrated his public-spiritedness by photographing the illegal dumping of atomic waste. For that, Russia has condemned him, sentencing him to many years' forced labour. I consider it a scandal that Europe stands by watching such a thing happen.</p>
<p class="contents">A petition will be drawn up requesting that the court's judgment be reconsidered, but I do not get the impression that efforts within Russia will be enough to get this flagrantly unjust sentence revised. I therefore see it as a matter of urgent necessity that President Putin, who has expressed his willingness to let independent media into his country, should be taken at his word. I would like Mrs Diamantopoulou to tell the cabinet that I see it as one of the Commission's important responsibilities, in any planning involving Russia, to put human rights and fundamental democratic rights at the top of the agenda and, as a matter of prime importance, to demand an answer on this from the Russian government before moving on to intergovernmental discussions about energy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is what is stated in Articles 41 and 42, brilliant as they are, of the Russian Constitution. That, however, is something he did not do. On the contrary, he has continuously reported on the way in which the Russian Pacific fleet dumps nuclear waste and redundant weapons in the Pacific and so gives rise to an environmental disaster in the making. For having done so, he has been found guilty of high treason by a Russian military court and sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. Everything took place behind closed doors, and seventy journalists were expelled from the courtroom. Last month, his sentence was confirmed by the Military Collegium of the Russian Supreme Court in Moscow.</p>
<p class="contents">It is deeply tragic for Grigory Pasko, and it is deeply tragic in terms of the situation in Russia where democracy and human rights are concerned. It shows that, in Russia, these are very hard times when it comes to freedom of expression and the principles upon which our European Union is based. This Parliament must clearly express our repudiation of laws and sentences which restrict the freedom of the press, and we must, here in Parliament, call upon the Council to give expression to our serious concern in the forthcoming meetings between the EU and Russia. The EU supports Russia economically and, in that connection, the Commission must be very careful that the projects we support comply with our demands for press freedom and the independence of the media and the courts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I often get the impression that our policy on Russia is a successful combination of deceit and self-deception, in which one is not quite sure where the deceit ends and self-deception begins. We saw this at the NATO summit in Rome. We see it in the OSCE. We see it in the Council of Europe here in Strasbourg, and we see it also in relations between Russia and the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">There is constant talk about how Russia is well on the way to democracy, or even about how it is a functioning democracy. This has nothing to do with reality. We can see that in Chechnya, but we also see it very clearly in the fate of Mr Pasko, who has done the thing that the institutions I have mentioned are always talking about. He took a stand for freedom, democracy, health and public safety. He protested at the commission of a crime. He brought to light a crime that put people in danger and through which they would have been in even greater danger if the crime had not be brought to light, and, as Mrs Schroedter so rightly said, in doing that he did his duty.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now high time for us, too, at last to do our duty and say clearly that we stand behind Grigory Pasko, journalist and defender of citizens' rights. He has done us all a service, and we must stand by him in this situation in which his health and freedom are in the gravest danger, not only for humanitarian reasons, but also for the sake of the credibility of the European Union, for whose ideals of freedom he too has taken a stand, and for the sake of relations between the European Community and Russia, for no real partnership with Russia can succeed if, far from the rule of law in that country being strengthened, Russia is suffering further setbacks on the road to it. There have been major setbacks in recent years, and we must fear that what is left of democracy and the rule of law in Russia will be endangered if victory goes to those who want to make use of the Pasko case in a struggle for power within Russia, by which they want to demonstrate that the armed forces and the secret services are still in charge. That is incompatible with European principles, and so our credibility is also at stake.</p>

We hope that a speedy solution will be found by the appropriate Russian instances to remedy Mr Pasko’s unfortunate personal situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Pasko case sends a very worrying message of self-censorship to other journalists and media in general, the impact of which one cannot underestimate. In this respect, the second paragraph of the Joint Statement of the recent EU-Russia Summit in Moscow of 29 May states that it is a common goal to strengthen a society based on respect for democratic principles and human rights, of which the defence of freedom of expression is a fundamental element.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has raised the case of Mr Pasko in the past in the framework of its intensive political dialogue with Russia. The Commission agrees that further diplomatic action is needed in view of the recent developments.</p>

My group, and I assume also the other groups in this House, are therefore shocked to hear that Egyptian law enforcement agencies are now once again bringing 50 of these men before the court for something in respect of which sentence has previously been passed on them.

Europeans and women were spared from the charges. It is alleged that they were tortured by whippings, electrocutions and threats from dogs into signing confessions of being homosexual. Allegedly many were not homosexual but just enjoying the western culture of drinking alcohol and dancing. Motivation for the arrest was in part to appease anti-western sentiment and distract the people from the government's economic problems at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">In the initial trial in November 2001, 25 were sentenced to jail terms, but the government has decided on a second retrial of its so-called perverts. A number of irregularities were apparent in the first trial. The Egyptian press law prohibits the publication of details in on-going investigations which might prejudice the trial outcome, which was blatantly disregarded with the publications of stories of alleged homosexual orgies, gay weddings and the identity and pictures of all the defendants. The law does not prohibit homosexual acts, only "habitual debauchery", of which there was scant evidence. The men were tried by a state security court rather than a regular court and forced medical examinations were carried out, clearly against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear to me that a retrial is a breach of the double jeopardy interdiction of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and also the spirit of Article 2 of the EU-Egypt Euro-Mediterranean Agreement on respect for human rights.</p>

It reminds us that individuals throughout the world, because they are different, because of where they were born, to whom they were born, are not given those universal freedoms that we so often take for granted.</p>
<p class="contents">The heavy heart is also because I am a friend of Egypt. I recognise the importance of Egypt and hold the Egyptian Government, President Mubarak and the Ambassador to the European Union in the highest regard. But when it comes to human rights abuses, if we are selective in the application of principle, then we lay this House open to the charge of hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we ask? We ask for simple human rights: the right to a fair trial, the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, the right to freedom from torture and cruel or inhuman treatment, the right to privacy, the right to equality before the law and we reaffirm also Article 14.7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which has been mentioned today.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say personally – I am not speaking on behalf of my group – that, as a gay man, if I had been born in Egypt or somewhere else, because I was different, because of the people with whom I associated, or because I declared myself publicly, I could have every single one of the human rights I have mentioned taken away from me. Look at me. I am human. I bleed. I laugh. I cry. We are each of us exactly the same, but strangely others find a difference to deprive us of our human rights. Therefore to do nothing is to condone human rights abuses wherever they occur. To look the other way is to throw away our own rights and our claim to call ourselves civilised.</p>

On this occasion, however, the contents of this list are very important. The first document cited is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, which we should always use as a guide; Article 2 of the EU-Egypt Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement, which is still to be ratified, is also cited. When this document is ratified, we will probably have to maintain some influence over the handling of the case in question. The same applies to section 6 of last year’s resolution, which clearly expresses our feelings on the matter and demands that the Egyptian authorities free those persons who were then imprisoned. There is also the analysis of Egyptian legislation, which shows that homosexuality is not a crime there.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with all these considerations, we agree with what the resolution says, in other words, account must be taken of these rights: the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion, sexual inclination, the right to privacy and equality before the Law.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in Europe, over the past few days, large, so-called “gay pride” demonstrations have been held. In my country, specifically in Madrid, 250 000 people demonstrated peacefully in an enthusiastic, tolerant demonstration that is worthy of praise.

If the Islamic community really does want dialogue between cultures, then the first thing it has to do is to start a dialogue on the understanding of sexuality, so that people can stop being pilloried for allegedly offending public morals.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent report by Amnesty International describes the misery of thousands of people being persecuted and tortured because their real or supposed sexuality is perceived as a threat to the established order. In over 70 countries, homosexual relations qualify as a crime, sometimes even attracting the death penalty. But even in the European Union, Commissioner, we need to widen the legal basis of anti-racism legislation to include sexual orientation, as required under Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, we should welcome the decision by the Greek Minister of Justice to abolish Article 347 of the Criminal Code discriminating against homosexuals.

Now, finally, we have the adoption of the anti-discrimination legislation at European level. It was the first time that we agreed at European level that there should be no kind of discrimination in employment on the grounds of sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">This case is not a matter of discrimination; it is a matter of fundamental human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission closely followed the case of the 52 men arrested in the so-called Queen Boat affair and the conduct and the outcome of the case raised several issues of concern. The Commission was especially troubled by the use of National Security legislation, with no right of appeal for the 23 imprisoned men, and by the inflammatory language used at the trial and in the media, which undermined official Egyptian claims that the men were charged primarily for debauchery rather than sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">Egyptian President Mubarak has recently ruled that all but two of the 52 men arrested in the Queen Boat case should not have been tried in the Security Court and their case will now be reheard in a misdemeanour court. A decision on the referral is expected to be given on 16 July. This is an important and potentially positive development, although its impact is mitigated by the possibility that even those acquitted in the first trial will be retried.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission will continue to follow the Queen Boat case and other similar prosecutions. The European Union's concerns have already been communicated to the Egyptian authorities through the normal channels and will be reiterated if appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is committed to the defence of human rights and condemns the prosecution of individuals or groups for their sexual orientation. This commitment is integrated into the European Union's external policy as a matter of principle and in the form of concrete measures and actions.</p>
<p class="contents">At a global level the European Union supports the protection of human rights by grants to civil society groups and non-governmental organisations through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights. At a bilateral level, the Association Agreements increasingly govern the European Union’s relations with third countries and require that such relations "shall be based on respect of democratic principles and fundamental human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights".</p>
<p class="contents">The recently signed European Union-Egypt Association Agreement contains such a clause and respect of human rights is explicitly identified in the text as an "essential element" of this agreement. The Association Agreement with Egypt provides an important additional forum for both parties to discuss issues of human rights and democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That really is exceptional, as this item on the agenda is otherwise much more diverse. It is quite incredible how the autocratic Mr Lukashenko keeps on believing that he can get away with things in Belarus that would be permitted nowhere else in Europe and allowed nowhere else in the area covered by the OSCE. It is quite clear to my mind that he has lost his grip on reality. The tragedy of the situation in this country, and of the developments occurring in it, is exemplified, in the area of freedom of opinion, by the fact that opinion surveys now have to be cleared by the government, with checks having to be carried out on who is commissioning them, how they are funded and how they are run, and a government commission demanding corrections to their results.</p>
<p class="contents">To take another example, our delegation in this Parliament received a letter from the Ambassador of Belarus dictating to us what we are to do with our agenda. Perhaps he can do that with his own parliament, but we are freely elected deputies and still decide on our agenda ourselves. That only goes to show in what sort of situation Belarus' parliamentarians find themselves. We are submitting this resolution at a time when the question is being raised within the OSCE as to whether or not Belarus' Parliamentary Assembly is to be recognised.

As the Commissioner said earlier, these retrograde steps are in danger of having a harmful effect upon developments in the rest of the region. It is deeply worrying that, in recent years, an average of ten journalists per year have been murdered in the two countries. They have typically been journalists in the process of investigating events which those in power did not want to be discovered. The authorities rarely have much desire to throw light on such matters. Parliament should support the recommendations by the International Federation of Journalists, or IFJ, which rightly points out that there is a need for the international community to be much more vigilant in monitoring and protesting against the infringements of press freedom that take place. That applies when. through legislation, governments attempt to prevent the operation of independent media that are critical of them, as happened, for example, with what was termed an ‘information law’ in Belarus. It also applies when, in specific cases, governments restrict the freedom of the press, as happened, for example, in the case of the journalists Nikolai Markevich and Pavel Maozheiko who took the liberty of criticising President Lukashenko during the presidential election campaign in Belarus and were given severe sentences as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">We have clearly expressed our rejection of laws which restrict the freedom of the press, and we must protest against specific infringements of press freedom wherever in the world they may occur, including Russia and Belarus. We must step up our monitoring of what is happening in those two countries when it comes to pluralism and freedom of the press. Over and above that, the international community should also do a very great deal more to support projects aimed at promoting the professionalisation of the media through the training of those who work in the industry and through giving the industry’s organisations a more significant role in democratic development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share Mrs Schroedter’s view that it is actually regrettable in itself that, within the space of one month, we are having to talk about Belarus twice in the plenary session. This is a bad advertisement for that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Last time, we discussed the problems surrounding the OSCE mission in Minsk and its closure by stealth. This problem has still not been solved. Up in the gallery, we have Mr Carpenter, one of the diplomats who has left Belarus and with whom we had a talk this morning, and Mr Stakewitz, one of the opposition leaders in Belarus, and I think we ought to give them a warm welcome here.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Again, there is talk of a number of incidents relating to freedom of press. Old times persist in Belarus. This is on top of our own experiences. Everything we do there and try to do in tandem with the OSCE and the Council of Europe is often misrepresented in the state media, which always ends up with me, the chairman of your delegation, being alleged to be a NATO spy. This is indicative of the climate in that country. My invariable response is that I am a spy for democracy rather than for NATO, even though I form part of the NATO delegation.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to say too much about freedom of the press; our resolution is crystal-clear. As far as solutions are concerned, I should like to call on the Council and the Commission to try to engage in more dialogue with Russia about Belarus. The Russian Federation has an enormous impact on that country and has, so far, refused to help us bring pressure to bear on the Lukashenko regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations between the EU and Russia, and between Russia and NATO have improved considerably, but we ought to use these to galvanise Russians into bringing about greater democratic involvement in Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">The criticism is sometimes levelled at us that, with our policy and our resolutions, we are trying to isolate Belarus, and that this is only playing into Lukashenko's hands. Although I am sensitive to this criticism, I think one could claim that Lukashenko is mainly isolating himself and that we are actually waiting with bated breath for a sign on his part, an essential concession to democracy, so that we can respond by opening up a gateway for his country. After all, we are keen to do something together for Belarus; there are plenty of problems to solve together, but this should be made possible by the regime in Belarus itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The sentencing of two editors of the independent weekly <span class="italic">Pagonya</span> once again provides unfortunate proof of this. Their punishment – a number of years in a labour camp –is intended to silence all the critical voices in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">The take-over of various Belarussian literature magazines, masterminded by the Ministry of Information, serves the same purpose. Nearly all their editors-in-chief were dismissed at the same time. A number of those who replaced them immediately announced slavishly that they would no longer publish any work by journalistic critics of the apparently untouchable Belarussian Head of State.</p>
<p class="contents">Parallel to this, the authorities in Minsk are working towards ever tighter government control on people’s basic constitutional rights. Two recent examples illustrate this recent development. A special control committee for ‘political-social’ surveys has been set up, which is most certainly behind the publication of President Lukashenko’s painful popularity figures (just 30% in April 2002).</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, a revised “Law on faith and religious organisations” is threatening to drastically limit freedom of religion. This led this week to an urgent appeal by the Protestant church leaders to Lukashenko to intervene and to enter into a dialogue with them.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I urge the Council, the Commission and all Member States, on the basis of paragraph 6 of the present joint motion for a resolution, to give our unqualified support to this church initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Another personal comment on the motion for a resolution concerns the provision of specific support to the independent press in Belarus, which, although very much in the official firing line, could be afforded solid backup by cooperation agreements with western newspapers. I would gladly commend the plan and funding of this option to the Council, the Commission and EU Member States in order to protect the fundamental rights of the people of Belarus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that its top official Andrew Carpenter, who has been deeply involved in democracy and human rights in this European state, failed to received an extension to his visa in practice meant the closure of the office.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we are once again lamenting the infringement of human rights in Belarus, injustices against journalists, dissidents, people who are subjected not only to trial and serious prison terms but who are also violated, degraded and sidelined from official society. People have actually lost their lives in the fight for democracy in Belarus. This is a further expression of the lack of faith in the political and popular legitimacy of the country’s own regime.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, represented here by Commissioner Diamantopoulou, must now seriously review the European Union’s strategy with regard to Belarus. The country is, and has long been, isolated. We must not give an inch in our demands regarding human rights, but we must, at least at a lower technical level, open a dialogue with Belarus. Despite everything, it is a European state. It is a neighbour of Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, of the enlarged EU. A new strategy is required.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to mention a few points which may serve as suggestions for such a strategy. Firstly, no one person, namely President Lukashenko, can stand in the way of a whole country of ten million inhabitants. These people must be given a European vision, must be given hope of a different future. Secondly, civil society must be strengthened and local elections in Belarus prioritised as an expression of strong grassroots involvement in democracy in this country. Thirdly, election rules in the country must be more open and create greater confidence that elections actually are reliable and fair, which has not previously been the case. Fourthly, we in the EU must act in such a way as to avoid strengthening polarisation in Belarus. We must support democracy but without splitting the country. Fifthly, we must continue in our single-minded fight for human rights. Belarus may once again crop up under topical and urgent matters in the European Parliament in September. Sixthly, we must remind Belarus and President Putin that they have a responsibility within the framework of the union with Belarus to stand up for human rights in this country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First there was the imperialism of Greater Russia, then Stalinism had a particularly cruel effect on it and on the Ukraine, then came Nazi occupation with its crimes – for the war affected White Russia particularly badly – then renewed Soviet colonialism, Chernobyl, the effects of which were particularly felt there, and now, at length, Mr Lukashenko. Mr Lukashenko is a scourge on this country, and has become – thank God, one has to say – a figure unique in modern-day Europe. Since Milosevic fell from power, Mr Lukashenko has in fact come across as a relic of an age which has – thank God – come to an end. It is precisely for that reason that we must do everything possible to support Belarus' democracy movement, which has been suppressed, to act to bring about the release of persecuted journalists, and intervene in defence of the rule of law, democracy and freedom of opinion. We are dealing with one of the last tyrannical regimes in Europe, which must be overcome by peaceful, democratic and lawful means.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore consider it right that we turn our attention to this country a second time within a very short period, and we will not cease from doing so until this country is in actual possession of the things we enjoy, namely democracy and the rule of law in accordance with European standards, until this country has also returned to the community of free European peoples. In real terms, this involves us supporting civil rights campaigners, supporting – as Mr Belder pointed out – the independent media, and making it our concern that the spirit of freedom should not be smothered by tyranny, but that that same spirit of freedom should prevail in Belarus as elsewhere.</p>

These rights are not as obvious in every country in our world.</p>
<p class="contents">In Belarus, for example, those who put forward a view different to that of the governing powers are persecuted. People who follow a political line different to that of the government are subject to reprisals. Nor is there any freedom of the press in Belarus. Journalists and the media are prevented from critically scrutinising and reporting on both domestic politics and the outside world.</p>
<p class="contents">There are powerful reasons for strongly condemning the way the Belarus regime handles freedom of expression and freedom of the press. It is important that all democratic institutions are assisted in work to strengthen the independent press in Belarus.

In principle, Belarus should be among our most important partners: it will be a direct neighbour after enlargement, and is a main line of communication between the EU and Russia. However, the systematic suppression of opposition elements, including a number of “disappearances”, the lack of democratic checks and balances and the treatment of the media have led us to freeze relations. We have indeed, as recommended in some of the motions which have been put down today, warned the Belarussian authorities that they cannot expect any change in that situation unless they take clear steps towards respect for human rights and democracy and introduction of the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The treatment of journalists and authors in Belarus is scandalous. The practice of preparing lists of writers which should not be published reminds one of times we all believed were over. They are in total violation of OSCE and European standards. We are also deeply concerned about the closure of the newspaper <span class="italic">Pagonya, </span>already mentioned by two Members of Parliament, and the sentencing of its editor and one of his collaborators, as well as the charges against the editor of <span class="italic">Rabochy</span>. These men had all been accused of slandering the president during the electoral campaign last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Belarus refuses to cooperate with the OSCE, which it has accused of meddling in its internal affairs. We strongly believe that the OSCE should continue to maintain a presence in Belarus and should actively assist the country to implement the obligations it took on in acceding to the OSCE.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to stress that Member States should not make concessions to, or deal with, the Belarussian Government unless and until there is a fundamental shift in its attitude. At the same time we should be ready to respond if and when that shift takes place, while continuing to use our instruments to support civil society and people-to-people contacts. Both Tacis and the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) are active in these fields.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have no doubt that the EU will continue to raise the cases of individuals, including these journalists, opposition politicians, and academics like Professor Bandazhevsky. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
