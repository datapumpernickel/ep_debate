Violence is a social problem of regrettable topical importance which involves the violation of human rights and a physical, mental and social crime as well as a crime against people’s quality of life. The Daphne Programme 2000-2003 will be an instrument of vital importance in the fight against violence and will provide added value to local, regional and national actions in this field through the creation of networks, the exchange of information, better practices and cooperation and greater awareness in society in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position expressly mentions the victims of exploitation and sexual abuse which would be covered by the programme, as well as the common establishment of priorities, promoting innovation and the exchange of experiences regarding actions taken by Member States, including the exchange of information on different legislation and the results obtained. Non-governmental organisations should be promoted, in particular those which are concerned with the well-being and quality of life of children, young people and women.</p>
<p class="contents">The present programme will last four years, and an evaluation of its progress is planned for two years after its implementation. The actions will also have the aim of improving public and media awareness with regard to this grave problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget for implementation will be EUR 20 million and the Community contribution to the funding of the programmes will vary, up to a maximum of 80% of the cost of the action.</p>
<p class="contents">In the implementation of this action, the Commission will be assisted by a committee consisting of representatives of the Member States and chaired by the representative of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme will be open to the countries of the European Free Trade Area, the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe, in accordance with the conditions laid down in the European agreements, and to Cyprus, Malta and Turkey by means of supplementary credits.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the Daphne programme is to support and recognise the work carried out by the non-governmental organisations, as well as other organisations – including the public authorities which are concerned with violence – and to ensure that they cooperate with each other, in the exchange of good practices – including pilot projects on a Community scale on the prevention of violence – and the support and protection of children, young people and women.</p>
<p class="contents">The networks will form a common front against violence by analysing it, in its different forms, its causes and consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">The real impact of the different types of violence on victims must be measured, in order to determine suitable responses, evaluate the types and the efficiency of the measures and practices in order to prevent and detect violence, support victims and prevent their future exposure to it.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme, as I have said, will be an important weapon in the fight against violence towards women, young people and children in terms of improving social and media awareness of the need to help and protect the victims of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Six amendments to the common position have been presented, which have been approved by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities and are in the annex to the text. I would like to point out that amendments 3 and 5 will be replaced by new amendments which modify point 18 of the preamble and articles 5, 6 and 7 in order to adapt the text we are presenting to the wording drawn up by the Socrates Conciliation Committee and which will lead to a parallel solution for the committees in the majority of programmes. It is therefore the wording which has to be adapted and we hope that Parliament will do so suitably.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you to vote unanimously for this programme, since it is of enormous importance. And we hope that by approving this second reading with the amendments presented, if the Commission and the Council accepts them, the programme may be approved, avoiding conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to end my intervention without mentioning the first rapporteur of this report, Mrs Benassar. When she left Parliament, with the beginning of the new mandate on 15 June, I was appointed rapporteur and I continued with the work which she had carried out. I continued with her efforts and have tried to work on this essential action which the Commission must take – the defence of women, young people and children – in order to prevent the violence which, unfortunately, is regularly directed at them.</p>

A decision is urgently needed on this programme, in order to ensure continuity when the present period of support comes to an end. This is an important programme which complies with our commitment to achieve a high level of health protection in the European Union. I say this because we unfortunately still come across the effects of violence in our society all too often, and they represent a serious health risk.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not just a question – and let me stress that I would like to see that little word “just” in quotation marks – of physical and sexual forms of violence. Protection against psychological violence, which occurs in many more different shapes and forms, and against which victims are even less well equipped to defend themselves, belongs in the Daphne programme. You cannot define health solely in terms of physical well-being. Every form of violence leaves a legacy of psychological damage which can only be repaired in rare cases or with difficulty. We need to set up new networks here and to support existing ones.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is equally important to support appropriate information campaigns, and in this case exchanges of experience play a big part. These exchanges need to extend to criminal prosecution, where discrimination against the victim must be avoided when charges are brought. It is important to give victims adequate information about their rights, and society must be made more sensitive in dealing with crimes of violence against women, children and young people.</p>
<p class="contents">Children and young people need our special protection, and unfortunately this still applies to women too. Only when well-being has been attained in all social structures in our society will we be able to solve the problems of the future. Finally, I would like to thank Mrs Avilés Perea very much for her swift and competent work, which she did so quickly despite the changeover, so that this urgently needed report is before us now.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I would have liked to see more men involved in this work. Violence against women and children is after all a men’s problem, not a women’s problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that with this programme we have taken a big step forward in combating physical, sexual and psychological violence against children, young persons and women. However, we all need to be aware that it is only one step, and that there is still a lot to be done to effectively combat this phenomenon of violence. In 1999 this House succeeded, in the face of persistent opposition, in initiating a campaign to counter violence against women. The Eurobarometer poll published this May made the extent of violence clear and identified the gaps where we need to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">Europol and the STOP programme are instruments for combating trade in women. The Member States have committed themselves to do a great deal, which has, for instance, emerged from the campaigns. The complex interrelationships in the fight against violence have only really become clear because of the Austrian, German and Finnish Presidencies’ Conferences. My own country, for example, has as a result set up a national action plan against violence, and other countries are following suit. I think that we have given an important impetus to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Avilés’ report on the common position was adopted after a great battle about changing the legal basis from Article 235 to Article 152, with the codecision procedure. But my own group only voted for it with great reservations and only because the World Heath Organisation definition, according to which health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, is now evidently recognised and taken as a basis by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">My group would have liked to see certain other changes of emphasis in the Daphne programme, for example links with other Community programmes such as PHARE, TACIS and MEDA,<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>because that is where the big money is, in order to initiate preventive measures and campaigns in the applicant countries. However, as regards reaching agreement quickly and avoiding the conciliation procedure, we agree with Mrs Avilés here, and are only recommending six amendments to the common position. In any case we recommend that the media should be involved in order to get the programme up and running. I would like to thank you very sincerely for your work and hope that the Council will accept our amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has resubmitted a number of amendments that will receive our Group’s full backing, especially the definition of health. This is an enormous improvement to my mind. Many people, men but also women, still think that violence against women has become a rare occurrence within the European Union. Nothing could be further from the truth. One in five women within the European Union has been a victim of such violence at some time, including in our immediate surroundings. One does not have to look far. There are probably more victims but they never reported the crimes to the police or relief centres. In fact, most incidents of violence occur in the home, which means the phenomenon is less visible. Many women still want to keep their dirty laundry inside. They feel ashamed. </p>
<p class="contents">The link between violence within the family and child protection is often overlooked. For example, if the court allows contact between the violent partner or ex-partners and their children, then the woman will remain exposed to violence via the children. I would once again draw attention to this fact. The specific aim of the Daphne programme is to encourage and support non-governmental organisations and other institutions to combat all kinds of violence against children and women. I welcome the fact that national measures are to be lent added value. Great! Liberals do not wish to harmonise Member State legislation on violence against women and children. My group, however, is of the opinion that the Member States that are behind in this respect should be encouraged to bring their legislation up-to-date.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that the perspective should be shifted. Instead of trying to change the behaviour of women, the behaviour and attitude of men should be examined. This is not about short skirts, Mr President. Awareness and information campaigns on violence against women are desperately needed. This issue should, as far as I am concerned, feature high on the political agenda.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Daphne programme, we should remember, was an initiative of this Parliament in 1997 which recognised the need for action to combat violence against women, young people and children. In the first year of the programme alone 428 projects were submitted by various organisations in Europe and this level of response reflected the need for programmes such as this.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own constituency I have seen the work of organisations like Welsh Women’s Aid which provides support, advice and practical refuge for women and children victims of violence. It receives over 15,000 calls a year and the number is rising all the time. Last year it housed over 2,000 women and over 3,000 children in refuges and they had to turn many others away because of the lack of accommodation.</p>
<p class="contents">This workload reflects the scale of the problem we have throughout Europe. It also shows how important the role of NGOs and voluntary organisations is in this area. There are specific examples of the way in which Daphne-funded projects have helped. In just a few weeks’ time an international seminar will take place in Leeds to look at issues of violence against women in conflict situations. Speakers from many countries will be attending that seminar. There have been many other projects linked to the important fight against child sex tourism which have been funded by Daphne.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of the legal base – this is a health issue of course, but it is also far more than that. However, we can accept the World Health Organisation’s definition of health as not just being the absence of disease but a state of physical, mental and social well-being. Any lesser definition would leave much of the problem unexposed and we hope that this will be agreed as the European definition for the purpose of this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Daphne programme, as others have said, has made a great deal of difference but there is a lot more to be done and it is vital that it is followed up. I trust that the Council will decide on this before 1 January so that existing projects can continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

MEPs’ determination, from 1996, along with the report by Marianne Eriksson through to today’s report by Maria Antonia Avilés Perea have all enabled violence towards children, young persons and women to become the object of political action. </p>
<p class="contents">In speaking of politics, I choose my words carefully, because this violence is quite unacceptable in the view of countries that have taken the principle of human rights as their basis for fifty years. Please allow me then to emphasise the dignity of the victims of violence and the need to ensure that the health of these victims is understood to be both their mental and physical wellbeing. I think that prevention is the appropriate word. If we look at the issue in its totality, which is a question of taking action on the causes as well as the consequences, then it is obviously a political one in the sense that we would like the causes of violence, most often inflicted by men – and like Mrs Gröner, I deplore the fact that there are so few men present here in the Chamber this evening – to be studied and combated in the framework of the forthcoming programme. In the same way, we hope that by taking into account the consequences of violence and the effectiveness of a remedy and more besides, the aim will be to end this violence. </p>
<p class="contents">This is why we must give full scope to this programme, both in terms of children on the one hand and of women on the other. These are two categories of victims that it is important to be able to distinguish between. Europe must establish a Children’s Rights day, following the example of France, and which the European Parliament has been requesting for some time. Are we not celebrating the tenth anniversary of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child today? </p>
<p class="contents">This is also why the dignity of women must not be subject to any ambiguity. If the term “sexual exploitation” indeed describes the trade involving another person’s body, then there is no good trade, neither trafficking in human beings nor prostitution. The States cannot, as States, accept, let alone organise or even encourage the trade in women. The awareness of rape for example is quite recent, as it was so recently still considered to be at worst a misdemeanour, whereas today, we know that it is in fact a crime. Awareness has come recently but I am delighted that violence towards children and women is no longer taboo. While this programme has an experimental value, we should understand it to be something powerful, to be a model, and not only as an ad hoc experiment for Europe’s forthcoming enlargement, but as the responsibility of a democratic Europe towards the whole world. To my mind, we are committed to our responsibility as Europeans. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see the new Daphne programme applied as quickly as possible and if possible, with greater resources of time and finances. But I also hope that, beyond a health-based approach, we see that it is a question of people’s fundamental rights; I hope that this programme is guided by the objective of fighting all violence directed at women and children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Underlying the texts of the recitals, there are the broken personal destinies of children and women who suffer physical violence, but also, and more insidiously, mental harassment. This issue concerns Europeans’ physical and mental health.</p>
<p class="contents">Direct or indirect violence towards anyone considered weak must be unequivocally condemned. </p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I have the impression that violence is on show between couples, in families, at work, on television or even in political and social life. Perversion, aggression, and predatory behaviour hold more fascination for us and we pay too little attention to the victims of the law of the jungle that prevails in today’s world. </p>
<p class="contents">Our age has refused to establish standards. It tolerates perversion because setting a limit today means an attempt to censure. We have lost our moral or religious boundaries and we are not able to become indignant unless the facts are visible, such as bruises on a face, or unless they come into the public domain, relayed by the media. Therefore we need information campaigns, and the Daphne programme will support these. </p>
<p class="contents">Violence takes place in a world without borders and is not something from distant, barbaric times. We are in 1999, in this Chamber in Strasbourg and we are discussing violence perpetrated against women and children in Europe. We are not in some mythical, cruel and obscurantist Middle Ages but on the threshold of the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly support the establishment of the Daphne programme; indeed we must support any initiative that aims to make this dark side of our society visible, as borders disappear in the face of all sorts of evil networks: prostitution, paedophilia and others, on the Internet for example. </p>
<p class="contents">Our States must therefore collaborate and exchange information. The European Union can provide added value to the action of its Members. But it is also incumbent on our States to protect these women and children and anyone harmed by society. The State knows its citizens because it knows their mentality, the culture that they have in their mind and in their society that it has, to some extent, moulded. It is up to the national States themselves to promote the family as a support structure and to create men liberated from these patterns of violence that they pass down from generation to generation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has already been mentioned in other interventions that, a few years ago, the European Parliament promoted pilot projects supporting non-governmental organisations and local authorities that, for some time, have been endeavouring to use actions to fight violence against women and children. This phenomenon of violence against women and children is, unfortunately, not only very widespread but is increasing, and is gradually taking on new, even more sophisticated forms, which are therefore more difficult to combat. </p>
<p class="contents">The programme we are debating today is the result of this previous work. A very thorough discussion took place with the Executive Commission, especially with regard to amending the legal basis and therefore making the adjustments implied in the proposal to the original proposal. </p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to return to this topic, but I would like, however, to express a certain amount of satisfaction, despite the change to the legal basis, that the Commission and the Council have in any case adopted some elements which are extremely important to us. I am referring to the fact that the common position contains references to health in terms of physical, mental and social well-being, to quality of life and to violence as a violation of human rights, and, in particular, to the fact that this programme also covers victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation. I also find it especially significant that there is recognition of the important role played by the NGOs and multidisciplinary networks as well as public bodies who are already carrying out valuable work, in particular with regard to the prevention of violence and the support and protection of victims. To give this programme real added value, we must launch a major awareness campaign involving Parliament and the Commission, but, above all, the Member States, which must take complete responsibility for fighting violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I think that the amount proposed is laughable and the Council’s desire to reduce it even further, shocking. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament and the Council are easing their conscience on the cheap because, besides domestic violence and violence connected to sexual exploitation, we should also acknowledge the growth of social violence which results from the increase in poverty and from the growing destitution amongst the working classes. The greatest act of violence is the serious effect of unemployment, but also the deterioration in the working conditions of those who still have a job. </p>
<p class="contents">Is it not an act of violence for example, to force women, mothers, to work on production lines at night in order to make the machines more profitable and to provide greater profits for shareholders? Now, not only do the European institutions tolerate such violence, but they have even made it worse by removing measures in the social legislation of some countries which gave some protection to women. And the mollifying speeches of the Daphne programme do not compensate for the rest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Parliament, and, particularly, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, have played a vitally important role in placing the issue of violence against women and children firmly on the European agenda. As the legal basis has now changed, we now face a codecision procedure on public health, because violence is really a physical and mental act that affects all social classes. Parliament firmly supports the definition of “health” made by the World Health Organisation and so, for us, health can be defined as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not just the absence of disease.</p>
<p class="contents">The actions of the Daphne programme must still be supported by NGOs, and, as we ourselves have proposed in our amendments, by social communication, as women, who are some of Europe’s most sceptical citizens where the European Union is concerned, must be made aware and understand that programmes such as Daphne exist and that they are of direct concern to women. </p>
<p class="contents">In Portugal, for example, violence against women is statistically higher in areas which have a higher standard of living or higher levels of education, which does not necessarily mean that that is where more violence against women and children occurs. What it means – to my mind – is that there are more women in those areas who are financially independent, better educated and braver about making a complaint to the police. One of the practical measures taken in Portugal, at least in urban areas, was to have women police officers deal with women making complaints, and that immediately made a huge difference. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to take advantage of the fact that Commissioner António Vitorino, who attended the Tampere Summit, is here, to ask him to tell us how the Council’s final decision, which we applaud, to criminalise violence against human beings, particularly against women and children, will be put into practice. What it is going to change, Commissioner, and how? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The term violence is defined more precisely here, as violence can mean any type of exercise or abuse of power, injury or duress. All forms of violence should be rejected, but all too often there is a very high level of tolerance amongst families regarding violence. Violence against women should therefore be identified more actively, so that help can be provided.</p>
<p class="contents">We also know that acts of violence increase if no sanctions are taken. It is difficult for victims to escape from violent relationships without outside help. The women and children affected need active support, and above all protection. It is society’s job – everybody’s job – to make available the best possible support measures<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>and protection instruments. Daphne is a support measure that makes it possible for us to combat this. However, legal measures will also be needed in individual countries. Let me take Austria as an example. Austria has been in the vanguard with a law providing protection against violence in force since 1997. This is known as the expulsion law, and under it violent men can be expelled and women can no longer be forced to flee with their children to women’s refuges and other similar establishments. The expulsion law initially applies for seven days and can if necessary be extended up to the divorce date. I would now like to invite other countries also to adopt a law of this kind, as it would help to ensure that women and their dignity are protected.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The programme rests firmly upon the recognition of the need to uphold human rights whether those of children under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989 or those of women as expressed in the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action in 1995.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s first proposal was made in May 1998 and during the last 18 months the procedure has survived not merely a change of legal base but also a change of Treaty, a change of commitology, a change of Parliament and a change of Commission. It is, clearly, therefore, a hardy plant designed to thrive and grow as a potent weapon in the Community’s armoury against the evil of violence inflicted upon those most at risk in our society.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pay particular tribute to the parliamentary rapporteurs, Madame Bennasar Tous and Madame Avilés Perea for the work during the adoption procedure. They have led the parliamentary side in often difficult negotiations. I would also pay tribute to the work of the German and Finnish Presidencies without whose help we could not have achieved the second reading today in time for the programme to be adopted by 1 January next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to pay tribute to my predecessor, Mrs Gradin, who throughout handled the Daphne dossier with great skill and expertise. The Daphne Programme builds on the Daphne initiative, but with two important changes. First, it is open for the applicant and EFTA countries to take part in the programme. These will significantly help the victims of cross-border trafficking of women and children. Secondly, the programme is now open to applications from other organisations than the NGOs. In the light of the different traditions within the Member States these changes will I hope greatly increase its effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission accepts all the six amendments which are before the House today.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore hope that the Daphne programme will be adopted as speedily as possible. Once it has been adopted, the Commission will work with Parliament and the Member States to ensure that it achieves its goal. The Commission will specifically ensure that this programme is a relevant tool to channel the synergies of public authorities and NGOs in order to preserve the physical and psychological integrity and the social well-being of children, young persons and women in all areas of activity. I consider that coupling this initiative with the perspective opened by Tampere will lead in the near future to common definitions, common penal procedures and common sanctions that will be applied by Member States to the crimes of trafficking in human beings and to crimes against children.</p>
<p class="contents">The goals are therefore to establish networks throughout the European Union and within the applicant countries between organisations active in the fight against violence against women and children that know the field and to raise awareness among the European public as a whole of the nature of this evil and of the need and the means to eradicate it.</p>
<p class="contents">On the eve of the new millennium I may say, Mr President, that strong support in the European Parliament for this programme will be the best and clearest sign that the Union attaches the utmost political priority to effectively combating violence against children, young persons and women.<span class="bold"> </span></p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
