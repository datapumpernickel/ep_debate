A short while ago, you called for a minute’s silence to be observed in memory of the entire United Nations team murdered in Baghdad and there are other indications of this difficult and sometimes tragic summer that we have just been through.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Thursday, I visited Portugal in order to spend several hours flying over the devastated regions of Santarém, Portalegre and Castelo Branco. What confronted me was a desolate sight, the scale of which my colleagues Mrs Diamantopoulou and Mr Vitorino had already seen a few days earlier: the desolation with which I was confronted also reminded me of the sight that met me almost a year ago to the day, in Germany, the consequence of different events. Indeed, the summer of 2002 was also a tragic one for a great deal of Central Europe, for the <span class="italic">Länder</span> of eastern Germany, for the Czech Republic, Austria and even for France.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with such environmental disasters, which do not all have natural causes, as we well know, in the face of their human consequences – in Portugal, eighteen people lost their lives in these fires – faced with their economic consequences – hundreds of thousands of hectares have been destroyed and, as a result, thousands of farmers are out of work in central Portugal, the country’s poorest region – faced with these thousands of people who can no longer work unless we find jobs for them straightaway and who will be tempted to migrate towards the towns or to the coast, we must take action on all fronts and at all levels. Given the circumstances, it goes without saying that the level we represent here, and by that I mean you, Parliament, we, the Commission, and the Council, is the appropriate level at which to act. I therefore thank you once again, Mr President and I thank the European Parliament and all the political groups for giving the Commission this opportunity to bring you up to date on what it is doing, on what it intends to do and on what it has still to do at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The first tool or instrument with which we can provide assistance is the European Union Solidarity Fund. I recall, ladies and gentlemen, what was more or less my first speech here to you. As many of you know, I have long been interested in the environment and in ecology and, in October 1999, just after being appointed Commissioner, I had to go to Greece in order, Mr President, to assess the damage caused by an earthquake. I said at the time that there was no exceptional instrument available that would enable us to react to exceptional situations, to tragedies, to exceptional natural disasters. The only responses we could provide were the usual, run-of-the-mill ones. It took last year’s disaster, the floods in Central Europe, for the Solidarity Fund to be created. The initiative adopted by the Commission on this matter was supported immediately and, I must say, extremely efficiently by this House: I well recall the work undertaken by your rapporteurs, Mr Rolf Berend and Mr Ralf Walter, who gave us their support.</p>
<p class="contents">This Fund was set up in three months. It has a fund reserve of EUR one billion per year and is now our main form of assistance for remedying – a little later I shall say a few words about prevention – the damage caused by fires such as those seen in Portugal or those still raging in France. Not only was the Fund itself set up extremely rapidly, the response that we provide is also extremely rapid. Portugal’s request reached the Commission on 14 August and last week, in other words, two weeks later, we provided an emergency sum of EUR 31.6 million for aid, temporary accommodation, energy supply, repairs to basic infrastructures and for animal feed, because everything has been devastated.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, the Solidarity Fund has received five requests and my staff have accepted four of them (the eruption of Etna in Italy, the earthquake in the Molise region, the shipwreck of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> and, of course, Portugal) totalling EUR 88 million. In 2002, having been in existence for only three or four months, the Fund gave Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria aid totalling EUR 728 million. Where Germany is concerned, I can inform Parliament that this Thursday I will be travelling to Dresden, in Saxony, an area I visited a year ago. I will see, observe and assess the way in which European funds intended to remedy the flood damage have been used.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in addition to this Solidarity Fund, which is earmarked for emergency measures that receive no European funding, we do have other forms of support, in particular for rebuilding devastated economies; this is the purpose of the Structural Funds and of the Cohesion Funds, which can be redeployed or reallocated, according to the requests made by governments. Consequently, Portugal informed us that it was going to request the redeployment or reallocation of Community structural funds to the value of EUR 182 million in order to address the reconstruction of the forestry and farming sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the Structural Funds, Mr President, please allow me to digress a little: a short while ago, President Cox referred to the departure from this House of Luciano Caveri, who has been extremely important to you and to me, in his capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to him and to thank him for the quality and the openness that have characterised our relations with that committee for several years.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I now come to an idea that some of you will perhaps wish to raise: this is the idea that the Solidarity Fund criteria that we adopted jointly at the proposal of the Commission and which have been adjusted or modified by the Council need to be evaluated. I do not claim that these criteria, which we have been applying for a year and a half in a consistent, objective and impartial way to all disasters, are absolutely perfect. I shall, therefore, keep the option of assessing this Fund’s operation open – we will have to do so before 31 December 2006 – and, if necessary, to propose that its intervention criteria be modified.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the heatwave, which contributes to or accelerates fires, many regions, in southern Europe in particular, have experienced other types of economic and human tragedy. I am thinking in particular of the drought, which some of you will probably mention. This phenomenon has also caused considerable damage. By way of example, in northern Italy alone, the damage to milk production is estimated at EUR 70 million and the damaged to crops and fodder at EUR 380 million. In the specific case of drought, of course, Europe’s response cannot be based on the Solidarity Fund, which was not designed for that purpose. Just to remind you, this fund is intended to address disasters that do not receive any form of aid. Where the drought is concerned, and particularly in the context of the common agricultural policy, we had and we still have means with which to provide assistance. On this subject, I wish to recall that at the initiative of my colleague Franz Fischler, the Commission adopted, at the beginning of July, a number of measures to help producers in all of the affected regions. In particular, these measures involve the use of vegetative cover as set-aside land, using some intervention stocks of cereals and rice to feed livestock, the possibility of increasing advance payments to 80% in the beef sector and anticipating some payments in the beef, sheep or principal crop sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is, of course, willing to examine as rapidly as possible any eligible requests for State aid or modifications to the rural development programme that Member State governments affected by the drought might submit.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns civil protection. I had the opportunity, the other day, in Castelo Branco, to meet some voluntary firefighters who have done a fantastic job and wherever such disasters take place, we see a surge of solidarity, cohesion and generosity. The many emergencies that we have experienced and are still experiencing, however, raise the issue of coordinating resources for civil protection at European level. We do have, in the field of civil protection, a Community response centre established by a Council decision in October 2001 and which has the task of implementing European cooperation in the event of an emergency. This is principally a centre for coordination and specialist knowledge which has been very active where fires are concerned – as it was in the case of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> shipwrecks – and which has made use of all the means available to it under its mandate. Experience has shown, however, particularly this summer in Portugal, that this centre’s current mandate does not, unfortunately, allow it to provide all the assistance that is needed when a major disaster occurs. This is why the Commission, at the behest of my colleague Mrs Margot Wallström, will, by the end of September, present the fruit of its discussions on how best to address this situation and will submit proposals. This, I believe, is an area in which we must be more ambitious, by discussing the financial and operational means needed to facilitate more effective intervention, on the part of this centre in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever proposal or measure we submit, I would remind you that civil protection generally remains a national and often even a regional competence and consequently nothing can be done unless the Council of Ministers asks the Commission to submit a project. I must also say that your House will also have to tell us, as some of its Members have already done, what it wants and how far it wishes us to go in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I have talked about the Solidarity Fund, the drought and the state of our forthcoming proposals in the field of civil protection. I would like to conclude my talk by referring to what is, for me, a very long-held conviction. I have always believed that in any discussion about natural disasters – knowing, once again, that they do not all have natural causes, and there was nothing natural about the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> and the <span class="italic">Erika</span> – whatever the truth of the matter, I have always believed that, in all of these cases, prevention is less costly than repair. I therefore wish to highlight the efforts at prevention at all levels: at global level – I shall refer to this again in my summing-up, in the context of Kyoto – and at local level, on the ground at regional or national level. This is why when in a few months we conduct the mid-term review of the regional policy programmes, I shall pay very close attention to the requests made by States or regions for assistance under the Structural Funds 2000-2006 programming, for all aspects of prevention. I wish to go further, however; beyond what we have done and beyond what we are currently doing in order, once we have concluded our discussions, in the proposals that the Commission will be making on future regional and cohesion policies, to make disaster prevention measures more or less compulsory in all regional programmes. I also hope that together we can find a way of stepping up the budget effort for renewable energies or for clean forms of transport in regional or national programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, since I am talking about preventive action, we are all aware that to be able to prevent, we need to understand, to be aware and to be well informed. On this subject, geographical information is a major element of risk prevention and management. The Commission has developed a European information system on forest fires. This system enables a map of fire risks that covers all of Europe’s territory to be plotted on a daily basis. This now forms an integral part of the Community support mechanism for the civil protection forest services in the Member States. Lastly, I wish to emphasise that this system also enables a rapid and reliable assessment to be made of the damage caused by forest fires. This is how we were able, last week, to estimate the surface area of Portugal destroyed by fires to be 400 000 hectares.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I shall refer to the most important, the most difficult, and the most necessary form of prevention, which is global prevention, in other words, the action taken by our Member States and by the Union on climate change. If, as all climate experts predict, it is increasingly likely that the current process of global warming will lead to major changes in rainfall distribution and in drought conditions, it is crucial for the Community and for each of its Members to remain at the forefront of the fight against climate change and for their actions in this field to set an example. No country and no bloc of developed countries such as the Union is in a position to solve a problem of this magnitude on its own or within its own borders. This is why the Union would like the Kyoto protocol, which has already been ratified by 113 countries representing more than two-thirds of the world’s population to enter into force as quickly as possible. The Union has already adopted several measures in order to achieve the targets set out in this protocol. It has also incorporated environmental principles into its strategy and its decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, ladies and gentlemen, as you well know, the commitment or the involvement of each Member State is not equal, despite being crucial. The most recent data on emissions show that ten out of the fifteen current Member States are still a long way from achieving their targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. On 22 July, the Commission started court proceedings to ensure compliance with European Union legislation designed to improve air quality in Europe. As you know, we have also adopted a proposal for a regulation intended to reduce certain fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions. This proposal represents a new phase for action undertaken by the European Union to fulfil the obligations imposed on us by the Kyoto Protocol. Lastly – and Mr Franz Fischler can tell you more about this matter than I – the new environmental and ecological requirements are now being taken into account in the guidelines for the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in any discussion of natural disasters, of all the things that have happened this summer, we will inevitably touch on the economy, on the hundreds of thousands of hectares of forests destroyed, on a farm economy that has suffered a massive blow, the consequences of which will be felt for a long time, but also and perhaps most importantly, we are bound to talk about the men and women whose property and lives have been affected. I could not end my statement without referring to the memory of several thousand of my fellow countrymen and women who have died as a result of the exceptional heat that we have experienced in the last few weeks. Perhaps for this reason too we should attempt to understand the particular situation of each of our Member States, consider how we can further coordinate our actions, our assessment instruments and probably also make more substantial progress in the field of public health in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, together with Klaus Hänsch and Íñigo Méndez de Vigo, I have long been involved, on your behalf, in the work of the Convention, in the Praesidium and in the Convention itself. Together with many other representatives of Parliament, we have tried to improve the texts in the field of European action on public health. The text of the Constitution might denote some progress, but I am not convinced that this text goes as far as it should when we see the genuinely European dimension of some disasters. Consequently, even if this subject appears to be somewhat removed from the fires in Portugal, I should like to mention, in terms of the heatwave and other major scourges affecting the health of Europe’s citizens, the need to go further in our common and even Community action, in the field of public health.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Coelho (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your speech and for the visit you paid to Portugal, for the gesture of solidarity you made on behalf of the Commission, after two of your fellow Commissioners had visited my country, and for the comments you made in Portugal. I want you to know that the people of Portugal were particularly moved by Commissioner Barnier’s statement that he had never seen such a tragedy in the whole of his political career, and by his acknowledgement that the EUR 31 million of aid from the Solidarity Fund was not enough, or, to use his exact words, that it did not come up to expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">It was indeed a very great tragedy that struck Portugal, as you said. A tragedy whose cost is reckoned to be more than EUR one billion in damages and more than 400 000 hectares laid waste, according to the Commission’s own figures. That latter statistic is equivalent to 5% of the total land area of Portugal and almost 11% of its woodland. It was, as you said in your speech, a tragedy with repercussions in terms of human lives lost and with enormous long-term social, economic and environmental repercussions.</p>
<p class="contents">The much-needed emergency aid, which is crucial for those people who have nothing, who have lost everything, is now being distributed, thanks to decisive action on the part of the Portuguese Government, local authorities and those non-governmental organisations which pledged their solidarity. As you well know, Commissioner, and as you have argued in the past, European solidarity is needed. That solidarity must be reflected in the amount of aid and in the speed with which that aid arrives. I would like to underline these two elements: not only must the aid be appropriate in financial terms, but it must also arrive promptly, so that Europe can make an impact straight away.</p>
<p class="contents">To use your own words, then, Commissioner, the aid does not come up to expectations: the EUR 31 million is, of course, only for emergency aid, but the expenses which may be claimed as emergency aid have already risen to EUR 90 million, three times as much as the Community aid package. As I said, moreover, it is estimated that the cost of the tragedy will exceed EUR one billion. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats was therefore right to emphasise the need for a Parliamentary resolution. Following this debate, Parliament must approve a resolution stating its position on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned many themes, Commissioner, notably the need for preventive action. We are with you on this point: prevention is indeed needed, because this is also an area in which prevention is better than cure. With that in mind, it may also be worth rethinking provisions such as those laid down as part of ‘Forest Focus’, in order to ensure that we have the financial wherewithal to prevent forest fires. The importance of Mediterranean woodland for regional and local economies, for creating employment, for protecting the land, for biodiversity and for quality of life renders this necessary indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by thanking all the Member States who showed such solidarity in providing prompt assistance to Portugal. I would also like to thank those countries that are not Members of the European Union and that also gave aid. The President of the Swiss Confederation is in Portugal this very day, bringing with him almost EUR one million in aid for one of the worst-affected municipalities, Mação. I wish to say a final word to emphasise a point that Commissioner Barnier has already mentioned: the dedication of the fire-fighters and of the civilian population, whose acts of courage, generosity and heroism are ample proof of the well-known fact that during tragedies such as this one, when the worst aspects of humanity occasionally become manifest, there are also many people who show us the best that humanity has to offer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Roth-Behrendt (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, you have described the situation in very clear terms, and I was glad that you, as a former environment minister, also pointed out that disasters do not happen on their own. I respect the calls for solidarity that Members from the countries particularly affected are quite naturally making. They are right to do so. Members from countries such as France, Portugal, and other countries in south-eastern Europe, are right to call for solidarity, but – and let me make this quite clear – I would not want us to limit our present discussion to whether it is 31 million, 90 million or 120 million that we need in order to repair the damage, for it is equally apparent – and you, Mr Barnier, have also made it very clear – that we are patching things up. If we do not want to carry on patching things up year after year, we have to give some thought to the causes. Another reason why we have to think about the causes is that we will, at some point, exhaust our capacity for making good the damage.</p>
<p class="contents">As of next year, we will have twenty-five Member States. This will not double the Budget, and disasters will keep on happening – floods, storms, heatwaves and fires, in varying sequences, and, as you have observed, Mr Barnier, this has something to do with climate change. Nobody is now left unaware of that. Are we, though, prepared to act consistently with what we know? Let me say bluntly that no, we are not. We, all of us, are unprepared, and we are in fact unwilling to listen to something so uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in the European Union, we are far from creating the conditions in which the Kyoto criteria can be fulfilled. At present, only three Member States – Germany, Great Britain and Sweden – are getting anywhere near it. At the moment, we are at most complying with half the Kyoto criteria, by cutting back on gases that have a detrimental effect upon the climate, causing, for example, global warming, due to greenhouse gases, which occur in agriculture and in waste disposal but especially, in the areas of energy and transport. We are not prepared to take action and to be consistent when it comes to changing the underlying causes. Road traffic is constantly increasing, and we know that it is one of the principal sources of greenhouse gases, and is so to an increasing extent. At the moment, road traffic accounts for some 20% of total emissions, and in 2010, the deadline for getting in line with the Kyoto Protocol, the figure will be 28%. So you see that we may well be talking about disasters, but we are unwilling to do anything to prevent them.</p>
<p class="contents">What I am putting before you is utterly sober fact. You will not be surprised when I say that we never, of course, set our sights high in matters of environmental policy. I have now been an MEP for more or less fourteen years, in which time I have been involved in environmental policy, but I also know perfectly well where we all stand when it comes to passing real legislation. What happens when we talk in terms of taxing kerosene, the fuel used in aircraft? What will happen if we tell Mr Barnier to strictly limit structural funding to such things as rail transport or action that benefits the environment? I’d like to hear what our counterparts in the stricken countries have to say about this!</p>
<p class="contents">Once and for all, we have to create incentives to do such things as getting traffic off the roads and onto rails, using preferential treatment, rewards, and also sanctions, although it is the sanctions that this House never wants. It also means, for example, that we reduce emissions from industry, that we take action to improve controls, that we tax activities that do harm. What did we do at the beginning of this year when there was talk of taxing the generation of energy? We funked it. The Council funked it, and again, we all chickened out. Although the Commission has, to some degree, gone on ahead, we all, again and again, find ourselves influenced by what we term the needs of our electoral districts, where there is industry that does not want influence exerted on it, that produces chemicals – which do matter! – that produces pesticides, and we have to use them. None of us, then, really wants to do anything, but every year, once summer or autumn is over, we stand up in this House and talk about disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me mention, in addition to that, the report I have read in the press to the effect that the chairman of the French old people’s homes association has said that there are four times as many staff in German old people’s homes. That appals me; it is quite shocking, for German old people’s homes are generally in a disastrous state. It follows that we in the European Union must also, at long last, put solidarity into practice in social services. We have to lay down once and for all what standards apply to people who live in the European Union. How then are they to live with dignity in old people’s homes, and what is the situation with health insurance? As you are aware, I wanted the constitution to give the European Union clear competences in health policy. We did not manage to do that. They did not manage to do that. It looks as if we did not want it; that is something I regret. If, though, we are talking about disasters, that means, on the one hand, carrying out repairs and helping our counterparts in the countries concerned, but it also, above all, means preventing these things from happening again, and that I also ask you to do in future.</p>

The summer of 2003 has indeed been a real scorcher throughout Europe, from Rovaniemi to the Algarve, and the tragic consequences of this heatwave have been unprecedented. This has been a cruelly unfair summer in Europe: as we have seen, it is the weakest in society who have been the main victims. Almost 20 000 elderly people, living alone and in some cases suffering from respiratory disorders, have succumbed to this deadly heat. On behalf of the Liberal Group, I would like first of all to offer my sincere condolences to the victims’ families.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel with this human tragedy, with this public health disaster which continues to shake France to its core, the forests in the Mediterranean countries have suffered almost irreversible damage. This summer, particularly fierce fires have devastated more than 400 000 hectares of forest. This is a human, economic and ecological balance-sheet that might have been even more serious had it not been for the bravery and the efficiency of the fire-fighters, many of whom are volunteers, for the assistance given by the Red Cross to the communities affected, for the solidarity that European States have shown one another, not forgetting the substantial cooperation of third countries. Europe has acted effectively: the Commissioner referred to the EUR 31 million spent in the context of demonstrating solidarity with Portugal – a solidarity which is to be found at the very heart of our Treaties – and the Structural Funds. There is another observation I must make: the EUR 23-odd million, which is the cost, to date, of the centralised Community forest fire management and research programme, have not been spent in vain. The pilot projects for fire prevention, for identifying at-risk areas and for replanting affected areas have demonstrated their usefulness, not least in Portugal, but also their limitations. It is true that Europe must do more. These enormous fires in Portugal and in the South of France have proved one thing: the fleet of fire-fighting aircraft in most Member States is ageing. Without the assistance of the neighbouring countries that I have just mentioned and in particular without the assistance of the Russian jumbos and their 12-tonne tanks, considerably more than 400 000 hectares would have gone up in smoke. This is why the Liberals are in favour – and this should answer one of your questions – of creating a European civil protection force that would be responsible for combating forest fires, floods and also for addressing risks posed by industrial disasters in particular. Increasing human resources in this way must go hand in hand with stepping up material resources. Europe cannot lag behind Canada, Australia, the United States or Russia; it must consider in particular acquiring its own powerful European water bombers, appropriate to our various specific geographical characteristics. I look forward, therefore, to hearing Commissioner Wallström present the proposals referred to by her colleague, Commissioner Barnier.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can Europe ignore the fact, and no one has yet referred to this, that 95% of these fires are started by man. It is crucial that we step up awareness-raising campaigns. A single cigarette thrown out of a car window can lead to the destruction of an entire forest. Holding those who are negligent responsible is, therefore, another of our articles of faith for prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, and I could have started with this point, how can we fail to make the link between these endless natural disasters and global warming? The Liberal Group supports the Commission in all its efforts to reduce greenhouse gases. This summer, the records for ozone pollution have been broken in all Member States. Despite the battering that the Kyoto Protocol takes on a regular basis, and despite its limitations, it must remain a tool, a minimum target for some, but also a commitment. The European Union must, now more than ever, make this protocol its warhorse in its international negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They caused the deaths of eighteen people, stripped families of their homes and possessions, killed game and livestock, and deprived about 45 000 people of their wages and income. This was an enormous disaster, one which has worsened Portugal’s already difficult socio-economic situation. That is why we asked the European Union for aid and support from the outset. According to recent estimates, more than 400 000 hectares have been consumed by the flames, the equivalent of 5% of our total land area and 11% of our woodland, with more than 80% of woodland areas destroyed in some municipalities, and damage estimated at more than EUR one billion.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation calls for special aid measures, since the amount proposed by the Commission is clearly insufficient, as Commissioner Barnier rightly pointed out during his visit to Portugal. Over and above expressions of sympathy and solidarity with the victims’ families and everyone else affected by this catastrophe, over and above paying tribute to the courage of fire-fighters and the civilian population for their determined efforts to fight the fires despite the scant resources at their disposal, it is imperative that the sum provided by the European Union Solidarity Fund should at the very least equal the amount requested by the Portuguese Government, that is to say, more than EUR 52 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The seriousness of the situation, however, calls for further extraordinary measures, through both reprogramming Structural Funds and through the various Community programmes currently in place, making the rigid fund allocation procedures more flexible and simpler. This is necessary not only in order to provide compensation for the social costs incurred but also to help restore productivity in the affected areas and to encourage reforestation. While it is true that forest fires constitute a yearly blight consuming hundreds of thousands of hectares in the European Union, especially in the south, it must be borne in mind that this year the atmospheric conditions which plagued Europe served to make matters worse, producing the right conditions for fires on a huge scale which were difficult to fight. This also means that more effective preventive measures must be encouraged at Community, national and local levels, and that more attention must be paid to public health in Europe. The common agricultural policy (CAP) itself has led to the disappearance of thousands of farms and farmers in recent years, especially in my country, and has thus contributed to the complete unravelling of the traditional reciprocal relationship between woodland and agricultural areas in regions where small-scale farming predominates, accelerating the process of desertification in the rural world. The CAP has thereby helped to produce the right conditions for large-scale fires to start.</p>
<p class="contents">The changes to the CAP will tend to worsen this situation; this requires us to rethink the measures set in place. We call on the Commission to continue working with national authorities, both to minimise the environmental impact and to support the communities affected, but also to aid reforestation by supporting all the government aid initiatives and revising the Forest Focus programme to make its scope broader. We also urge the Commission to introduce an integrated Community fire-fighting strategy; furthermore, we would like to emphasise that this calamity testifies to the unreasonableness of the requirements of the Stability Pact given Portugal’s socio-economic circumstances, since, although the situation demands a high level of public investment, the Stability Pact imposes restrictions on such investment. We therefore appeal to the Commission and the Council to rethink the Stability Pact, and in particular to eliminate all public costs and investment stemming from this calamity forthwith when calculating the budget deficit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We talk a lot – obviously, and that is only right – of the thousands of victims in France and Portugal, but we forget that, this summer, floods in China have claimed four million victims, developing countries being more affected than ourselves. Faced with this fact, we must put a more resolute policy into effect. We can no longer be satisfied with our usual routine. As Greens, we have therefore taken the initiative and written an open letter to Mr Prodi, the most important features of which I shall explain. What are we requesting?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must set up a stability pact in relation to climate change. We cannot tolerate governments in Spain, Portugal and Ireland being indifferent to climate change and the European Union being ridiculed at international level because these governments are not assuming their responsibilities. European Environment Agency statistics clearly show the extent to which these governments are lagging behind.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, what emerges from the analysis of the initiative on European infrastructure that has just been lodged by the Italian Presidency? Motorways and more motorways, regional airports and more regional airports! It is madness! We cannot now use the billions from the European Investment Bank or the billions from the European budget to pursue a transport policy that has completely lost its way. As Greens, we are in favour of a policy of economic stimulation, but it must take the form of investment in the railways. We do not at present have the rail network needed for implementing a different policy on the transport of goods in Europe. We must make huge investments in these policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the heatwave has shown that electricity-producing stations, extremely centralised as they are, were in danger of no longer being able to produce electricity if the rivers no longer had enough water or were too hot. A coal-fired power station and a nuclear reactor have a yield of less than 35%. This means that they heat the atmosphere more, with the risk of producing fish soup, and do not produce electricity in a way that respects the environment. We need to invest much more in decentralised forms of energy and, as Greens, we would thank you, Mr Barnier, for pronouncing yourself ready to review the criteria relating to the structural and regional funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I was taken aback by the fires in the Mediterranean. One of the problems is the clearing of scrub. In Austria, there is a policy of improving the status of wood. We are world leaders in wood heating. Electricity is now to be generated at the same time as wood is to be produced and, if Europe finances projects, the link will have to be made between necessary scrub clearance and improving the status of wood.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Europe lags well behind when it comes to energy control. We have been waiting a year for two directives on energy control. Instead of wasting her time preventing the decline of the nuclear industry, Mrs de Palacio would do better finally to present the directives required if Europe is to catch up in this area. We have written to Mr Prodi to ask him to change up a gear and to coordinate his team better in the race against the clock to prevent climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also grateful for the fact that, within the Groups and in the Conference of Presidents, this debate has been marked, as we requested, by a declaration by the Commission and a vote on a resolution at the end.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank Commissioner Barnier for making himself available for this debate, for the words he spoke at the start of the debate, for his amicable and thoughtful visit to our country, for the statements he made there and also, of course, for the concern shown by the Commission even before that, through Commissioners Diamantopoulou and Vitorino.</p>
<p class="contents">Having expressed my gratitude, I must now tell you the facts and appeal for help. To tell you a little about the tragedy my country has been through: three weeks of profound anguish, the savage destruction suffered by our country and which was caused above all – though there are, of course, always several factors involved in such phenomena – by truly terrible weather conditions. They were not only terrible because they were abnormal in terms of temperature, humidity, and continental winds, abnormal in nature: they were also abnormal in their duration. In fact, the really distressing thing, which was a terrible tragedy for those who were directly affected and most involved in fighting the fires, was that we were at the centre of the action and perfectly aware of our powerlessness while the weather remained the same. Indeed, it was only when the weather finally relented, on 14 August, about three weeks after the crisis had been unleashed with such great intensity, that we saw it abate.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore dealing with a natural disaster whose devastating human, social and economic consequences have already been mentioned here. Various figures have been quoted: 5% of the total land area, 11% of woodland. These statistics are misleading, however, because, as we have already heard, in several of the worst-affected municipalities those percentages rose to 80% of woodland, more than 50% of the land area, 70% in some cases. Furthermore, these figures are no more than that: figures. One needs to see with one’s own eyes, as Commissioner Barnier has seen and as he has testified.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent days, I myself have revisited various areas such as Vila do Rei, Mação and Gavião. To give you an idea of the situation: in Gavião, a town in the north of the District of Portalegre, on a hill, from a tower behind the church, looking inland towards the horizon — we are talking about an area many kilometres across — everything, over the mountains, to the left, to the right, and straight ahead, is scorched. That is the true enormity of what has befallen my country, and the reason why my country is asking for assistance and support from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner quite rightly mentioned the speed with which the government acted, especially in setting the wheels of the Community machinery in motion, and also the speed with which the Commission acted. I align myself, however, with those of my fellow Members who are asking Parliament for greater means with which to respond in a more caring and generous way to my government’s request. Portugal applied for around EUR 50 million from the Solidarity Fund, and I believe it is right to grant that sum. I understand the Commission’s rules, but I think the Portuguese application is reasonable. EUR 50 million is the sum advanced by the Council of Ministers at the height of the Portuguese crisis, and this sum equals the value of national contributions to the restructuring of various Community programmes already mentioned by the Commissioner. I believe, though, that my government did its sums well and applied to Parliament for aid on that basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as my fellow Members have said, this is not only a question of harnessing the Solidarity Fund. Other programmes must also be restructured as appropriate, especially as the date fixed for the second reading of the Forest Focus regulation for 2003-2008 is fast approaching.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this crisis, which struck my country particularly hard, proves that Parliament was right to adopt the positions we voted for here at first reading and that the representatives of the Italian, Spanish and Portuguese governments were right to abstain from the common position when it was discussed months ago, drawing attention as they did to the need to increase forest fire prevention means under this programme. I therefore trust that when that regulation returns for second reading in a few weeks’ time, we will all unanimously restate the positions adopted by Parliament at first reading and that, as a result, both the Council and the Commission will come to share those Parliamentary positions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (NI).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, this summer, we have observed the disastrous effects of the heatwave: drought, fires, and water and air pollution. Above all, however, we are dismayed by the deaths of elderly people, and in particularly high numbers, in a country like France.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not normally, however, call upon the EU for help. Our European neighbours too have been hit, and a large country, properly governed, should be able to deal with this type of situation by itself. France is now in an extremely vulnerable position, however, since the budgetary margins for manoeuvre were not restored when this was possible, that is to say at the time when tax revenue was plentiful.</p>
<p class="contents">France is also characterised by two very negative factors: the greater difficulty of operating the health care system, particularly in summer, when there is a lack of practitioners and when the working week has been reduced to 35 hours; and the fact that families are apparently more spread out than in neighbouring countries, so that it has been less easy for loyalties of blood to come into play. </p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would point out, in passing, that the need for geographic mobility on the part of workers, often defended by the European Union, should be strongly qualified in order better to preserve, wherever possible, the social and family link. Above all, a great task for the EU in the future will be to step up its internal and external actions to combat the greenhouse effect and, therefore, global warming. Maintaining the current level of CO2 emissions would, for example, have irreversible effects upon the climate, and we are asking the EU to pursue implementation of the Kyoto Protocol carefully with a view to better integrating policies on energy and the environment. On this point, it will be necessary to give priority to renewable energy sources, certainly, but, above all, to nuclear energy, which is very thrifty in terms of CO2 emissions. If nuclear energy is to be more widely accepted, however, the issue of managing and eliminating radioactive waste definitely needs to be resolved. With this goal in mind, we wish to see joint research on a large scale put in place, something that is an absolute priority, because on this everything else depends.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a third avenue of reflection has to do with the fact that a reduction in greenhouse gases will come about partly through getting a better grip upon road transport. We think that the proposal for a directive on road infrastructure charging should accept the incorporation into the price of tolls not only of the costs of maintaining the networks but also of the cost of the damage, not at present broken down, inflicted by such transport upon the environment and, therefore, upon the community as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the forests and forest fires, we would first of all express our heartfelt condolences to the victims of these fires, above all in Portugal but also in the other countries that have suffered the same disasters, for we are concerned here with genuine environmental disasters in Southern Europe. The forests destroyed by fire will have to be built up again, with due respect for climatic and ecological features. Certainly, these forests have burned down, but other forests too will suffer the consequences of the drought. One has only to travel through our mountainous regions in order to see such trees already burned to a cinder before the arrival of autumn. It is going to be necessary to rebuild these forests, and we can ask ourselves if, with our agricultural policy, we have been able to adopt a genuine rural planning and development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Agricultural policy has caused us to lose some farmers. Unfortunately, we can now say that, if our countries had had a few more farmers, the areas would have been better maintained and the forests better laid out, not as the only alternative to desertification but in such a way as to have been productive. Just now, one of our colleagues spoke about wood as a source of energy. I am entirely in favour of this, and I develop wood myself in an area for which I am responsible. We must no doubt review our agricultural policy and, primarily, support our farmers who will suffer the terrible consequences of this drought, since they all say that it will cost them a year’s income in order to take account of the consequences of this drought. Livestock farmers now no longer know how to feed their cattle, and they are waiting for help to be provided quickly. This has been promised, but, most of the time, it is too late arriving. We must show, at European level, that we are perfectly capable of putting a community-based policy in place.</p>
<p class="contents">The meadows will also have to be restored, including in the semi-mountainous regions with which you are very familiar, Commissioner, and to which you are very attached. They will have to be restored when there is no irrigation and when there are no mechanical means available to farmers on land that is very difficult to farm.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should also like to talk about water problems, because we have not perhaps been able to put in place a water policy likely to ease the difficulties encountered.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also talked about the ageing of our populations. During the work on the Convention in preparation for the future European Constitution, I had asked for public health to be an important feature of this Constitution. Unfortunately, public health has not so far been taken into account, which is something I regret.</p>
<p class="contents">If, then, I have one more point to make, I should simply like this connection between the disasters and climate change to encourage us finally to respect and implement the Kyoto Protocol. I do not think that taxation is a good response. Europe must be innovative. It must convince governments and populations that a different agricultural policy needs to be supported, and that it is necessary to rebuild forests that are productive. It is also necessary to have decentralised, community-based policies, and, above all, to redefine energy policy and transport policy. Finally, quite simply what must be done is to pursue a genuine European policy of sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He was the very image of distress and understanding, saying the words the Portuguese people wanted to hear and appreciated, and which other officials were not always able to put as well as he did.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner said, the end of our summer holidays has left a bitter taste, after a tragic summer, with its tragic tally of deaths and devastating forest fires. Thousands of elderly people have died as a result of the heat in various European countries and ozone peaks may have claimed many more victims. Was this an inevitable climatic event or could we be suffering the consequences of climate change caused by human behaviour? Was this the result of humanity’s own thoughtlessness? The answer must be both of those factors.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, the area of woodland destroyed in Portugal, as we have already heard here today, is as much as 400 000 hectares, which is more than all the woodland destroyed by fire in the rest of southern Europe put together. This gives us food for thought. How can Portugal, a relatively small country, have forest fires on this scale? Are the Portuguese fire-worshippers, perhaps? Some have written that we are, because of our love of bonfires on Saint John’s Eve, and of firework parties. I doubt it, however. The explanation for the incredible events which unfolded in Portugal this summer can be found to a large extent in the serious mistakes and omissions of the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The fires brought to light the weaknesses of a disorganised and irrational forestry system such as we have in Portugal. Over the last few decades, Portuguese woodland has been chaotically managed, as the Commissioner has already said here. One third of Portugal’s land area of 90 000 square kilometres is given over to woodland. Most of that woodland — two thirds — is made up of pines, used only in construction. The rest is eucalyptus for producing wood pulp for paper, and also that extraordinary tree, the cork oak. Each tree, each vegetable species in the Mediterranean has, over many millennia, evolved strategies to protect itself and recover from fire. The problem is that the woodland is becoming more impoverished by the year, either turning into scrub or becoming dominated by conifers, more flammable than slower-growing hardwood forest made up of trees such as oaks and cork oaks. Soil erosion does the rest, and desertification continues.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Solidarity Fund was born of water but applied to fire. It brings to mind the two original Greek elements of Thales and Heraclitus. Born of water, applied to fire, but applied sparingly, as we have heard. The funds at our disposal are very slender, Commissioner. I feel the amount should be reconsidered because, being a palliative measure, it must increase, given the huge budgetary difficulties currently faced by the Portuguese state.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the reallocation of the Structural Funds suggested by the Commissioner is a good solution to the problem of financing the reforestation and reordering of Portugal’s plant cover. We therefore agree that funds should indeed be reallocated. Swift action is needed in Portugal before this shock is forgotten, and this applies to the rest of Europe too. Prevention is the keyword and the golden rule in protecting woodland, as several people have already said here today. So, however, is the surveillance and policing of our woodlands, as well as heavy penalties for the criminal acts of those who deliberately and intentionally set fire to them. The State must take on a new role in reordering and reorganising Portuguese woodlands, as well as in addressing today’s climate-related problems throughout Europe. Climate change is a grave threat indeed, and steps must be taken immediately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This heat wave has furthermore led to a series of disasters, some of which are now recurrent, such as forest fires.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask that we separate, on the one hand, the effects of this year’s heat wave from, on the other, a problem which is endemic in the south of Europe, in the Mediterranean countries: the problem of forest fires.</p>
<p class="contents">These forest fires may have become more frequent as a result of climate change, but also as a result of change in the circumstances of the forests and the rural environment. The depopulation of rural areas is a reality. The non-use of wood produced in the Mediterranean forest, which is no longer economically viable, is a reality. Therefore, the forest ceases to have an economic function and takes on an environmental role, which is also very important.</p>
<p class="contents">But the circumstances are different: depopulation takes away farmers, who – let us not forget – are the main protectors of the forest and of nature. The farmer is the first person to confront a forest fire.</p>
<p class="contents">Since we are talking about an endemic affliction it is important to adopt emergency measures: they would serve as antibiotics. But what we really need for this type of affliction is ‘vaccines’. In this case, the vaccines would take the form of preventative measures and any resources which can act quickly in the event of forest fires.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, this year we have seen the devastating effects of forest fires. You have spoken of updating the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Funds, in part, in order to deal with these effects. I would ask you also to think of the Community Initiative for Rural Development (Leader), and how this initiative – which is applied in certain regions in particular – could also be applied to areas which have been devastated by forest fires.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the measures adopted in this regard within the framework of the common agricultural policy have been positive, in relation to the areas which have had the greatest drought problems. I would also like to acknowledge the work of the fire-fighters, forest guards and volunteers, who have contributed to tackling the problem of forest fires.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as we ask that in any project there be an environmental impact study, this environmental impact should be extended to the possible impact of forest fires which – I repeat – are an endemic evil in the countries of the south of Europe, the Mediterranean countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ainardi (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, quite a few European countries have indeed suffered throughout this summer from exceptional temperatures. That is the subject of this evening’s debate and, indeed, time is now of the essence. The consequences of this heatwave for our countries and their populations have been appalling. In Portugal, as our fellow MEPs have pointed out, fires have destroyed 5% of the country. It is a national disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding France, I wish first of all to express my feelings, including my indignation, at the extent of the human drama we have experienced. The French Government announced on Friday that more than 11 000 additional deaths in connection with the heatwave were recorded between 1 August and 15 August. These figures are terrifying. Certainly, they must encourage us to ask ourselves questions about each person’s duty of solidarity towards those who are most vulnerable. National governments, and particularly the French Government, ought however, just like the European Union, also to ask themselves questions about the importance of public health policies, the requirement for high-quality emergency hospital services, accessible to everyone and in sufficient numbers, as well as about the requirement for retirement homes staffed by trained personnel and with the resources to ensure high-quality services. In short, they must consider adopting an ambitious policy regarding the elderly and those who are most vulnerable. All this requires budgets and, therefore, political choices that direct public expenditure towards the satisfaction of everyone’s needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the fires, which have particularly affected the Var region of France and, even more so, other European countries, we are faced with a certain number of questions. What aid should there now be for these affected regions? How should such crises be dealt with more effectively in the future? Above all, how might they be avoided and through what policy of prevention? These questions also apply to the terrible consequences of the drought for agriculture. Commissioner, you propose a certain number of answers to these questions, as well as guidelines for reflection, but, in both cases – those of fires and drought – emergency aid does indeed need to be organised – in the forms both of the European Solidarity Fund and of national aid – in support of the regions damaged by the fires.</p>
<p class="contents">For farmers, many of whom are faced by drastic situations, the European Union ought, as a minimum, to authorise the national governments to accord them exceptional short- and medium-term aid. In France, the consequences for the affected areas are overwhelming: a loss of 50% to 100% of production is anticipated for non-irrigated cereals in the department of Lot-et-Garonne. There is a lack of fodder, directly threatening livestock. Everywhere, farmers are faced with a very large decline in revenue. Alongside this aid, thought must be given to the mechanisms to be put in place, as well as to the efficient management of the crises linked to exceptional natural events. This also requires public funds, which have no place in a competitive rationale.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would turn to prevention and causes. In line with other fellow MEPs, I really wish to emphasise the need to re-think current models of rural planning and of agricultural and also transport development. Clearly, the tendency to make more and more profit out of available land, not to invest in fire prevention on the pretext of making savings, to accord priority to large farms and yield and to favour road transport, always to the detriment of rail – I could go on – is full of dangers. Another model is in actual fact to be devised, based on genuinely taking account of the environment, of the public interest and of solidarity. Indeed, we must show very much greater determination to apply the Kyoto Protocol. In conclusion, however, I want all these dramas experienced by our fellow citizens over the last few weeks to enable us at least to become more aware. …</p>

Last year, it was floods which plunged Europe into mourning. This year, it has been a heatwave, bringing a health crisis in France and an environmental disaster in Portugal and on our Mediterranean coasts. These worrying freak weather conditions may be the result of global warming, which, it is a well-known fact, is itself exacerbated by the greenhouse effect caused by CO2 emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, everyone is now aware that we need to be more careful in our dealings with nature. We must also be more compassionate in our dealings with each other. In Paris, it is said – and the figure is frightening – that over 800 people died whom nobody grieved for and whose bodies nobody came to claim.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft resolution tabled by our group, the Verts/ALE Group, contains a number of extremely positive recommendations, and I want to mention just a few of them here. As regards health, in particular, the Commission must help the Member States to guarantee to all people the rights proclaimed by Article 35 of the Charter, namely the right to have access to preventive health<span class="bold"> </span>care,<span class="bold"> </span>even under exceptional climatic conditions. Where Portugal is concerned, we ask, Commissioner, that the Solidarity Fund be applied above the emergency level to genuinely help the country to bandage all its wounds. In order to reduce the greenhouse effect, we must encourage the Commission to ensure respect for the Kyoto commitments. Transport policy has a substantial part to play in this field. We must promote the most energy-efficient means of transport more.</p>
<p class="contents">As our fellow Member, Mr Dhaene, explained earlier, some of us came from Brussels to Strasbourg by bicycle, arriving towards the end of the morning. The aim was, of course, to promote the use of bicycles. Cycling must be provided for in the trans-European transport networks. That would make it possible to help the authorities concerned to create or improve cycle paths which link the Member States of mainland Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the trip, during the final section of the route, we rode along the canal between the Marne and the Rhine. The scenery is magnificent, but we noticed that the canal is underused for goods transport. We must encourage this kind of transport more, for it causes less pollution than road transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to mention one last proposal made in our draft resolution. It is to create a European civil protection body: the ‘casques verts’.<span class="bold"> </span>Their intervention in environmental disasters would encourage the Member States to shoulder their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, we must stop beating about the bush where sustainable development is concerned and take practical action. That is what our draft resolution is trying to say. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is three times as many as died in the Twin Towers. A thousand people died per day, alone, abandoned. The corpses were stored in refrigerated lorries, in army caissons, in a fruit and vegetable market in Rungis in Paris. Not since Neanderthal man, long before Antigone, has the law of burial been violated.</p>
<p class="contents">Where is this Timisoara taking place? Under Milosevic? In Baghdad, under Saddam Hussein? In Haider’s Austria? In the camps under the guards mentioned by Berlusconi? In Somalia, in the Rwanda of 1000 hills? It is in France. The France of the World Athletics Championships, the France of human rights, the France of gold medals, the France of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, the father of the Constitution, the first article of which recognizes the right to dignity, including dignity for the elderly.</p>
<p class="contents">Where did all these deaths occur? Sixty-six percent of the deaths occurred in old people’s homes, hospitals and specialised centres. They were not given enough to drink. They died of dehydration. Why is that? Because there were no nurses, no staff, no doctors. Why? Because the budgetary Stability Pact demands savings and cuts have to be made. As a result, cuts have been made to the detriment of the weakest, who cannot protest, to the detriment of the elderly.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of those who died were women. They did not die from domestic violence, as the women’s rights committee believes. They did not die from discrimination or unequal treatment, they died from dehydration. That brings us to the causes, namely the cumulative effect of collective errors made over the past 20 years. The collective error of ultraliberalism, economism – in the nineteenth century ultraliberalism produced Zola, Victor Hugo, the proletariat and millions of deaths, and ultraliberalism is starting to claim deaths once again. The collective error of ‘human rightsism’, which leaves no place for Lenin among official rights and genuine rights, not to mention the hypocrisy which proclaims rights only to the extent that they are violated.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, is to be done? Of course, Mr Barnier, we can announce funding, plans, a new economy and a new hierarchy. The truth, confirmed by statistics, is that not one of those who died came from the middle classes or the great <span class="italic">bourgeoisie</span>. It was those at the bottom of the heap who died. It is just as well that we have banned meatmeal, for otherwise they would have ended up minced in battery pig farms, although it is true that pigs are not abandoned, unlike the elderly people of France. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is just one point which leaves me somewhat perplexed: I find it difficult to make a distinction between the drought and the fires, particularly when it comes to the environmental and economic consequences. If there is a distinction, it is at the level of the causes, for I am afraid that many of the fires were caused by man’s folly, by a pyromaniac, while it would be extremely difficult to blame anyone for the drought.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would now, if I may, like to look at what has been an absolutely dreadful summer for Europe from a farming perspective because, in my view, the scale of the problem is truly huge. The drought of recent months is yet another indication of how the indisputable change in the earth’s climate is having irreparable effects on the environment and on our farming in particular. I am afraid that extremes have become the norm: drought, rain, cyclones and floods are the effects of a process of desertification which I am sad to say is affecting Europe, in particular southern and eastern Europe, and, ultimately, taking a very heavy toll on farming, for these disasters are generating an economic crisis, opening up a bottomless pit of production costs and sharply reducing the market margins for farm produce, in such a way as to jeopardise, in a summer such as this, even the pursuit of entrepreneurial activity in large areas of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not trying to paint a picture which is all black: I am merely describing a situation and I would like to identify ways of assisting and supporting farming. In this case, it is important that, generally speaking, the Commission carries out a careful assessment and adopts practical instruments to analyse and address the quantity and quality of European water resources for the coming decades, with particular focus on ways of conserving them.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are the immediate requirements. I feel that, although the scale of the damage caused by the drought, which will become clear when the growing and harvesting operations are over, could or will lead to the activation of the European Solidarity Fund, at the same time, it would be essential to be able to take advantage, as at other times of declared crisis, of the option of bringing forward the payment of Community premiums to farmers. In this sense, it might be useful to set up a European summit coordinating all the parties affected by disasters, which is necessary to support measures to improve the situation, particularly the state of the farming economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Not immediately but soon, a damage estimate, which may be difficult to carry out but should certainly be close to the threshold for benefiting from the solidarity instruments I mentioned just now, could call for careful reflection from the Commission and a Commission proposal to achieve a multi-risk reform tailored to respond to the new climatic conditions of our continent. This would certainly be a very useful, wholly innovative instrument to support our farming. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe our first duty is to express our condolences to the families. But, while this is correct and essential, we cannot restrict ourselves to this expression of immediate human solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">People have been lost – in fact, in my country we still do not know how many – and this is unquestionably the most important thing; but we have also lost homes, landscapes, flora and fauna. Fire weakens the soil, and sooner or later the usual traditional storms, which we always expect on the Mediterranean coasts in September and October, will arrive, taking advantage of this weakened soil to erode these areas even further. Let us keep this in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the heat wave and the drought have contributed to this disaster, but heat is not a new phenomenon in the Mediterranean. As has already been said, we have had heat for centuries. What is exceptional here are these temperatures which exceed anything we have known and, therefore, those people who were sceptical about climate change should perhaps give this some thought and governments, companies and individuals should take the appropriate measures.</p>
<p class="contents">People are wondering what the European Union is doing in this respect. The Commissioner proposes mobilising the Solidarity Fund, and I agree – I am rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets, and there is therefore no doubt that I will be sympathetic to this proposal – but the Solidarity Fund, Commissioner, relates to natural disasters, and these are not just natural. There are arsonists and huge numbers of criminal cases, and we should also be asking ourselves what we are doing with the directive and with other legislation on environmental responsibility, how we apply them, how we transpose them and how they are implemented, and how we demand those responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I began in this Parliament in 1986. I believe my first action was a motion for a resolution calling for programmes for the prevention of forest fires in the Mediterranean. We went ahead with such schemes five years later, in 1992, and we had a ten-year programme running from 1992 to 2002. Why have appropriations always been left over, Commissioner? You have given us several good examples, but I, as rapporteur for budgets, would say to you that every year on the <span class="italic">ramassage</span> transfer there are appropriations which originate from that fund. Why? Because the governments have not used them? I believe this is very serious, because if they are not used, next year we will once again be in the same position.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take action at Community level. The Member States have their responsibilities, but I believe the European Union has a duty here to take the lead and to impose measures; otherwise we will have to trust, as we do every year, that the winters put out the fires of the summer.</p>

In view of this, it would be a very serious mistake to reduce the environmental disaster of this summer to the economic losses it involved. It is, first and foremost, a huge humanitarian disaster, equivalent for the whole of Europe to 10 times the scale of the attacks of 11 September. In effect, it is the first major disaster which is both economic and humanitarian caused by the climate shift in the temperate zone. This climate shift has coincided with another equally disastrous trend: the increasing isolation of a section of the population which is also increasingly dependent because it is elderly.</p>
<p class="contents">I will leave my colleagues from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance the task of expounding on the absolute priorities resulting from this shameful experience, from this condemnation of our development model: the need to speed up Kyoto, the rejection of an endeavour to boost the economy based on a motorway programme, the discrediting of the nuclear sector as an alternative for fossil energies, the obligation to adapt our flora and our habitat to the changes which have already occurred. However, it is just as important to adapt our health system and our social security networks to protect our elderly people against climate shocks. The loosening of family ties, including the links of geographic proximity, due to the individualisation of our societies and growing mobility, is a largely irreversible phenomenon which is not wholly negative. Our elderly people, we, ourselves, in the future, will be able to cope with the situation provided that services of general interest are developed to offset it, both in the public sector and in the third sector, the associative and cooperative sector. Is the fact that France has been particularly affected not due first and foremost to the fact that, for two years, grants to the associations managing old people’s homes have been halved, in the same way as care allowance has been cut?</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are calling upon the Commission to draw up a Green Paper on the protection of elderly people and combating climate and, more generally, health risks, on the basis of European best practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As well as the loss of human lives, which we have to mourn, as well as the Dante-esque images left behind by the fires and the economic losses they have caused, the magnitude of the disaster which year after year hangs over the forests of the south of Europe and the consequences it has for the European Union as a whole demonstrate the need for a Community policy for protecting the forests against fires, with its own funding, which takes account of the specific nature of Mediterranean forests and which provides for prevention measures as an integral element in the management of forests, as this Parliament had requested at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that the Mediterranean forests and the forests of the north develop in completely different ways, and are therefore governed by completely different laws. As well as soil, the growth-restricting factors are water in the Mediterranean forests and light in the northern areas. In the Mediterranean forests, where there is no shortage of light, the higher trees, shrubs and grasses have to compete for water on the ground and, being a restricting factor, there comes a time when every drop of water which falls must be distributed at ground level. The water table is therefore reduced, the roots do not reach that level and they die, and then the above-ground part becomes denser and finally – unfortunately – fire returns repeatedly and we are sent right back to the beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">This differing development also requires differing forest management and requires that, in the Mediterranean forests, management and prevention form part of an inseparable whole, which is the only way to prevent these waves of fires every summer, the seriousness of which depends on the weather conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mediterranean forests are part of the common heritage of all Europeans. It is for this reason that forest fires are not just the responsibility of the Member States or regional governments with competence in this field, although there is no question that the correct application of the principle of subsidiarity is essential in order to increase the effectiveness of the measures to be taken. Community competences in the environmental field as well as the commitment made by the European Union in Kyoto require greater budgetary contributions and greater involvement by the European Union in the fight against fires.</p>

I believe that they have to be our prime concern.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall, however, be speaking mainly about the problems of forest fires. Every year, unfortunately, we are accustomed to expressing our sympathies: this was the case last year with the floods in central Europe and this year it is the same with the fires. We usually find the appropriate words and our sincerity is not in doubt, but very often we feel powerless to come up with an adequate response at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, for a long time words were all we had until, following debates that crossed all political divides and on your initiative, Commissioner – and I congratulate you on this – we are setting up this Solidarity Fund, which today meets a widely felt commitment, that is to ensure that the European Union is as close as possible to its people, in particular when they are in great distress. You have reported on how this new instrument is being used. I believe that it is doing a great deal of good. It is alleviating the effects of serious crises, but strangely, by a bizarre twist of history, we are in the process of reliving the same situation with forest fires.</p>
<p class="contents">We used to have a specific policy, a specific instrument and a specific budget. This was mentioned by Mrs Ferrer and it is not old; it dates from 1992. It was a European regulation, directly accessible to all foresters or public authorities that owned forests, enabling them to invest as a preventive measure – because as you said, Commissioner, prevention is better than cure – in specialised fire-fighting equipment: firebreaks, water supply points, access tracks and so on. In fact we saw fit to abolish this regulation at the beginning of the year. The regulation had a budget of EUR 52 million from 1992 to 1997 and EUR 77 million from 1997 to 2002. Today another regulation is being proposed to us which serves an entirely different purpose and which does not mention or budget for protecting forests against fire, and that is 'Forest Focus', with a budget of EUR 41 million. If we were to continue down this road, the conclusion people would draw would be that in 2003, a catastrophic year in terms of fire, the European Union took the decision to abandon its policy of forest-fire protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we should spare ourselves the public ridicule and the public rejection. Commissioner, there are quite a number of us here, on all of the benches, who consider that EUR 60 million is a high price to pay to damage Europe's image if, on the day when a disaster of this magnitude were unfolding, we were to abandon a tool which is a preventative tool, which works, which people are happy with, and which foresters the length and breadth of Europe are calling for.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask you to repeat the strange acrobatics that we performed on the Solidarity Fund in the face of very strong opposition. It took the floods in Germany for people finally to recognise the need for a Solidarity Fund. It will perhaps have taken the tragic fires in Portugal for us to return, as I hope we will, to this regulation on protecting forests against fire, which has done us good service and which to abandon would, it seems to me today, send out a very bad signal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Desolation, helplessness and anger: that is how you feel when you cross these areas that have been burnt to a cinder. I know that you proposed the Solidarity Fund on behalf of the Commission, but what can the Fund do faced with the extent of these disasters and the consequent costs? It is whole swathes of the economy that are wiped out.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, nature, which is already weakened, never stops paying the cost of our inconsistent policies. Who will pay to restore nature, to rehabilitate the Natura 2000 areas that we have so much difficulty in designating, as they are too greatly coveted by frenzied tourist development? And have we not only narrowly avoided further catastrophes, when you think of the water in our rivers that was no longer cooling nuclear power stations; the waters in those rivers into which the French Government, for example, authorised even warmer water to be discharged?</p>
<p class="contents">It really is high time that this stopped, Mr President, Commissioner. You yourself reminded us of our Kyoto commitments in terms of global warming. What is the Union doing, though, to impose an alternative transport policy or an alternative energy policy? Because this heatwave, as we all know and we have stated this again and again, is a foretaste of the problems we will have to face in the future. Meteorologists are unanimous: we can expect more heatwaves.</p>
<p class="contents">After these disasters, now is the time for action, Commissioner. Furthermore, as we all know, that is when it comes to the crunch. Even here we do not use the same terms to mean the same thing. Sustainable development, sustainable transport, the sustainable economy: all European policies today are sustainable. In fact, to confront the ecological crisis we need a change of policy, and our policies need to be ecologically sustainable. We need to put in place an environment policy that is not forever seen as an optional extra, as it is today.</p>
<p class="contents">The environment has to be a priority in the political choices that we make. This is still not the case, as we know. Moreover, we also have the technical means in the Commission – it is not worth describing them here; you know full well – to meet the challenge, but it is the political choices that are cruelly lacking, and this is true no matter what our governments say. Consequently, Commissioner, we really are counting on you to convince the politicians to make different choices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although President Cox is not here, I hope that the President of the Bureau will pass on my thanks to him for his speedy responses to the letters written to him by my Portuguese fellow Members from all parties, including my own. Our letter was drafted by my colleague Mr Coelho and signed by several of us. I thank Mr Cox for his swift response to our appeals, and also the chairmen of the political groups for their quick decision to hold this emergency debate on the heatwave, in particular on its most visible effect, the fires, but also on its other harmful consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a brief appeal to the Commissioner and also to the goodwill of this House concerning what is at stake in Portugal. Everyone knows that there is short-term damage here — visible, immediate damage — and also long-term damage, which is nevertheless just as important. We have an objective assessment of the short-term damage, which runs to about EUR one billion. On the basis of that assessment, which was drawn up and presented to the Commission, Portugal is eligible to claim almost EUR 100 million (around EUR 95 million) from the European Union Solidarity Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese Government submitted an application for around half of the amount for which it was eligible, and the Commission proposed an aid package of EUR 32 million. We are not denying that this aid is useful and very important, but it is much less than is needed. The first and principal reason for this is the scale of the disaster: almost 1% of our gross national product is at stake and this year’s fires were as serious as those of the last ten years put together. Dealing with this is beyond our capabilities, bearing in mind, on top of everything else, that we are having to conform to a rigid financial mechanism, namely the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect to consider is that of the long-term effects, which will be key in the future, since the affected areas are poor regions in the interior of the country where forestry was the main source of employment. We now have to think about setting in motion economic support mechanisms, both as part of this Community support, restructuring and reworking framework and, in future, within the next Community support framework, the common agricultural policy, regional development policy and rural development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">A key point, with which I will conclude, Mr President: it is clear here that something more than a forestry strategy for the European Union is needed. It is also clear that Mediterranean woodland is at much greater risk than northern European woodland. We must go much further, and the Commission has to reconsider its Forest Focus proposal, which is completely inadequate for preventing damage to woodland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those of us who cast our minds back somewhat further, Commissioner, know that very dry summers have been a frequent occurrence, and so I am not one of those who regard this summer of the century as a quite unique phenomenon, but, farms being as financially stretched as they are, we can hardly dismiss this summer of the century as nothing more than an occupational hazard.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the harvest report that has been presented, the Ministry’s official figures also confirm that the drought has brought on extreme losses to the harvest in Germany, but also in its European neighbours, and you have already pointed out that the European Commission has taken initial steps to enable the direct payments that are in any case due to farmers to be made more speedily and at an earlier date. Although I see that as an encouragement, this does not add up to extra money. It strengthens farms’ liquidity, enabling them to buy in feedingstuffs and sow new crops. Let me ask you, though, something that has been briefly discussed in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, that is, whether there are indeed no uncontracted funds available in the EU’s agricultural budget. I would have thought that resources were available. Is it not conceivable that this is an area where help could be given more speedily – with co-financing at national level, which is what some of the German federal states are considering?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say by way of conclusion something that has already been mentioned very often – that the eventual consequence for forestry, including in our country, will be that many farmers’ own financial resources will be insufficient to permit reforestation. If we are to talk in terms of rural development, this is where we should be giving really serious thought to how we deal with this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say that with the benefit of my experience as a rapporteur in this field, during which I have often detected a certain scepticism towards climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us, then, learn the lessons. First, by moving towards sustainable forestry management, laying greater emphasis on indigenous species and less on foreign ones; laying emphasis on multiple uses of woodland, because the presence of people, through activities such as hunting, tourism, beekeeping, forestry, grazing and agriculture, is the best deterrent and surveillance tool. Let us also learn lessons, however, about climate change: fires, which make an instantaneous contribution to climate change by producing large amounts of carbon dioxide and reducing our carbon sink capacity, are increasingly a consequence of climate change. We are locked on a collision course with climate change. The 1990s was the hottest decade for two hundred years. Last summer, record high temperatures were reached in various parts of southern Europe. Scientists suggest that temperatures will rise by 5.8 degrees over the next 100 years. On the domestic agenda, first of all, we must therefore follow up the positive efforts we have already begun in the field of transport, through the trade in emissions and through reduction measures in the industrial and energy sectors. On the world stage, however, we must also pressure the United States to adopt the Kyoto Protocol. Kyoto is hardly a giant stride forward: a reduction of just 5%, when the scientists are telling us to reduce worldwide emissions by 70%. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a true human, environmental and economic tragedy. As you said, Commissioner, repairing the damage is more expensive than preventing it: we therefore need to give prevention the consideration and funding that it deserves.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I can report that creating networks in the forests of Aquitaine by building tracks, firebreaks and ditches, by increasing the number of water supply points and by appointing fire spotters has made it possible to limit the spread of nascent fires very considerably. These preventive measures were funded in particular by a European regulation dedicated to protecting forests against fire, Regulation 2158/92/EEC, which unfortunately expired at the end of 2002. In spite of the indisputable beneficial effects of this regulation, the Commission – as many of us have pointed out – has transferred only the fire surveillance aspect to its 'Forest Focus' proposal. As for the prevention part, it has been incorporated into rural development, where funding is a great deal more uncertain.</p>
<p class="contents">This shows the Commission's intention to abandon wholesale a European policy of defending forests against fire and to renationalise this policy. To do so is, I believe, a political, economic and environmental mistake. Well before the terrible fires of this summer – note, well before – and more specifically on 29 April, I wrote to the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, to tell him how astonished I was by the Commission's position. At first reading, the Commission had in fact spoken in favour of rejecting Parliament's amendments integrating fire prevention in 'Forest Focus'.</p>
<p class="contents">In response, all I received was a reassertion of this position, which I regard at the very least as surprising. At a time when the European Parliament is preparing to reopen discussions on the 'Forest Focus' proposal at its second reading, we need to do all we can to include fire-prevention measures in 'Forest Focus'. When it comes to the Community budget, this funding is a drop in the ocean, but, Commissioner, it is a drop of water that will enable many fires to be extinguished. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is preaching to the converted. Prevention is precisely what we are talking about here.</p>
<p class="contents">On presenting <span class="italic">Forest Focus</span>, the Commission is reducing its economic contribution from EUR 18 million to EUR 13 million, saying that the missing 5 million has been transferred to the Regulation on Rural Development; but in the end it has had to tell us that this transfer has not taken place, which leads us to think that the money has been lost along the way.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Martin and many of my colleagues have said, and I am not going to repeat it, from a political point of view it is not acceptable that the budget set for the only regulation dedicated exclusively to the protection of forests, to pollution and to fires is being reduced by EUR 5 million, and to say that we are now going to combat fires, leaving out prevention, we are going to study pollution, increase biodiversity and also study carbon. We cannot do many more things with much less money, because 5 million out of EUR 18 million is a very significant percentage.</p>
<p class="contents">I would prefer it if we did not have to talk about or lament or express solidarity with the families of the people lost in these fires, nor the landscapes, homes and everything else that has disappeared, but I believe it is a miserly policy on the part of the Commissioner responsible for the environment to try to reduce the only funds we have had and to say that they have been transferred to rural development when, firstly, the countries have not had any opportunity to introduce these funds into their programmes and, secondly, the funds are not even in rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, Commissioner. I would ask you to communicate what I have said to Commissioner Wallström, so that at second reading we can approve the amendments which Parliament has already approved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The south of Europe – France, Spain and Italy – was, regrettably, plagued by fire this summer, but my country, Portugal, was hit particularly hard. The fires, which affected 15 of our 18 districts, wiped out 5% of our national woodland. The effects of this tragedy are economic and environmental, but also human. I can only pay tribute, therefore, to the 18 people who lost their lives, and express my condolences to their families. I would also, however, like to express my sympathy with all those of my fellow-countrymen whose lives were affected by the fires and who are going through a time of anxiety about the future. I am thinking in particular of those families for whom woodlands constitute the main – or, in some cases, the only – means of subsistence.</p>
<p class="contents">The scale of this tragedy calls for European Union support, which should be immediate and sufficient. Consequently, I would underline what my fellow Members have already said here about the effective and immediate action of the Portuguese Government, which took measures and steps to minimise the social and human impact. I would also highlight Commissioner Barnier’s words of support and his announcement of a financial package from the European Union Social Fund, made during his visit to Portugal last week.</p>
<p class="contents">You found the right tone for the occasion, Commissioner, and for that I thank you. Furthermore, that tone managed to ease our burden. As the Commissioner said, though, we also feel that the aid on offer does not meet our expectations. This is a tragic state of affairs, particularly tragic in its broad sweep. Allow me to insist: this is a completely unprecedented disaster, and such unprecedented cases must be granted a commensurate level of aid. We hope, Commissioner, that the highly persuasive effects of the ash-blackened landscape which you saw with your own eyes in Portugal after the fires will provide the motivation that is lacking for an affirmative response to be given to the reasonable and adequate request made by the authorities in my country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also pleased that the Commission has done so too, but it clearly demonstrates that the disaster that has struck there calls for European solidarity. Europe should therefore show what it can do on the social front. </p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to highlight another issue in this debate. It is unacceptable that the Commission should derive financial gain from the drought which is hitting European agriculture so hard. This is a likely scenario, particularly in the area of potato growing for processing, to mention one example. It is expected that the yield in the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and Austria will be a few dozen percentage points down on the annual average. In contrast to other products, such as ware potatoes, this scarcity will not lead to high prices. The CDA delegation in this House would like to invite the Commission, in the short term, to take stock of the amount by which production is lagging behind the preset quota and of the financial gain this produces. For example, a loss in production of 25% translates into a saving for the Commission to the tune of EUR 30 million, because for this crop, as for a number of other crops, the premium is directly linked to the yield. It is useful to bring this to your attention for these reasons alone, particularly since a 40% decoupling is envisaged in 2004 for those crops. This means that the premiums will then no longer be determined by the yield. It is likely that precisely this system will to some extent be used as early as in 2003. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the CDA delegation in this House is of the opinion that the Commission should initiate a European strategy discussion about quantitative water management. Qualitatively speaking, European water policy has been a success, but given that floods and water shortages have followed each other in such quick succession for a number of years now, it is necessary for us to do what is needed in the area of effective water management with a view to a future strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have discussed CO2 emissions and the way in which the climate depends upon the energy situation, and we have talked about the need for rather more sustainable energy.</p>
<p class="contents">On the hot days in Denmark, where I live, I looked at our many windmills and saw that they were motionless. There was no wind, and we must therefore conclude that wind alone does not solve the problem. What, however, there was enough of was sunshine, and we must therefore arrange for solar and photovoltaic cells to be developed so that we can really make use of the sun which sends so much energy to the Earth. The fact that we had problems with some power stations, which were unable to operate when it was very hot, is something for which we must compensate by creating a proper and powerful high voltage system so that we can have a genuine exchange of energy between the various regions of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The forest fires we have had will have no long-term environmental effect, since the trees in any case would have ended up similarly emitting CO2. The disaster has, however, been pretty huge in its extent, as we have all heard and as we all agree. I find it incredible that such large areas can catch fire without it being possible to put out the blaze. That leads me to concur with Mr Martin in saying that we must arrange for very large fire breaks to be established in the form of broad lanes or, better still, very broad corridors running through the land so that fires cannot spread to the extent that we have seen and so that we might, in this way, protect our countryside and rural areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you all of you for your attention and for being here today and, to those who took the floor, for their questions and observations. I should like to say in particular to Mr Lage and his fellow Portuguese Members that I was very touched by their words of thanks. Nevertheless, I feel that I was only doing my job, as were Mrs Diamantopoulou and Mr Vitorino when they also visited Portugal to express European solidarity by offering words and compassion, but also through tangible action, even though I understand that this can sometimes seem insufficient. In any case, I should like to thank you for your comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Coelho mentioned the speed of payment. Last Wednesday, at the same time as I proposed these 31.6 million, Mrs Schreyer proposed the procedure necessary for the two arms of the budgetary authority, the European Parliament and the Council, to be able to make a decision very quickly, no doubt before the end of this month, so that the money is actually paid, in full, to Portugal in October. It will therefore be usable from October.</p>
<p class="contents">On Thursday I met the Portuguese Finance Minister, who is making preparations to distribute this money to support or reimburse emergency expenditure. Once again, I too was very struck by the solidarity, generosity and proactive response of the people of Portugal, but also of the inhabitants of other regions, other countries and, as Mr Coelho said, not only countries in the European Union. Switzerland was mentioned. Morocco has also contributed to the relief effort. I think this is excellent and it needed to be pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">Like many of you, Mr Figueiredo and Mrs Ferrer mentioned the restoration of the forests, which will take time. It will take more time where cork oaks are concerned – 40 years – than for fir trees. It is very striking when you fly over the scorched bare earth to see the number of forest roads. You can clearly see that this was a site of genuine economic activity with people who lived from forestry development. During the time that reforestation takes, these people need to live and must not be forced to leave. Jobs will therefore have to be created, no doubt in other sectors, so that the people are not tempted to leave. In any case, I can confirm that it will be possible to use the Structural Funds and redeploy them to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">Several of you, including Mrs Redondo Jiménez, Mr Martin, Mrs Ferrer, Mr Savary and Mr Vallvé, made rather forcible comments about prevention and protection measures and expressed regret for the amendments proposed by the Commission in 'Forest Focus'. I should like to avoid controversy and especially misunderstandings and remind you or tell you very strongly that the necessary protection and prevention measures are still and will continue to be funded under the rural development programmes. The new 'Forest Focus' Regulation is to be seen as complementing and supplementing these. What the Commission has sought to do, even though there has clearly been a misunderstanding, is to avoid overlaps or redundancies between the regulations. Mrs Wallström, I might add, will be meeting the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy very soon and will explain this to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to say – Messrs Rovsing and Hugues Martin mentioned this issue – that when we talk about reforestation, we may be referring to regions that have been ravaged by fires or to those that have been devastated by storms. I remember seeing parts of our region, Aquitaine, with thousands of hectares of trees blown down by the storms. Different reforestation methods therefore need to be adopted taking into account what has happened. I am thinking in particular, as you said, Mr Rovsing, of firebreak areas. Let me give you the following statistic: 10% of expenditure under rural development for the period 2000 to 2006 is going to forest-related measures and a large proportion of this money is devoted to afforestation. The money is, therefore, there. It is not the money that is lacking. We have the capacity to pay for all of these initiatives and I would repeat that where the structural funds are concerned, for which I have direct responsibility, or training under Mrs Diamantopoulou or rural development under Mr Fischler, we will be able to show a great deal of flexibility and accept all proposals to redeploy or reprogramme funds, as Portugal has by the way already proposed doing to the tune of EUR 182 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ribeiro e Castro, Mrs Bastos just a moment ago and Mr Cunha expressed regret that the figure was no higher than 31.6 million. I myself said the other day that this amount was undoubtedly not enough to meet existing needs. I would repeat that it is earmarked entirely for emergency measures, which would never have been supported were it not for the Solidarity Fund. If this catastrophe had happened in Portugal two years ago, the amount would not have been 31.6 million but zero. As Mr Savary reminded us just now, it was because the floods were so serious that we resurrected this Solidarity Fund, which had been abolished in the past. The old Fund consisted of just a few dozen million euro; we have recreated it with a billion euro, which does constitute real progress. Having said that, all I can do is apply the criteria that were approved by Parliament and the Council, while observing, I might add, that the criteria that I initially proposed were substantially different. We apply these criteria with the utmost impartiality and objectivity and it is the same criteria that are used for floods in Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic as for Portugal. I would say to Mrs Bastos that I do not consider these criteria to be definitively good or ideal. On the contrary, I see the Commission's role as being to carry out an evaluation, once the Fund has been up and running for two years, and probably to propose changes or modifications.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mrs Ries for her comments on the issue of civil protection and I will pass on her group's support for this idea of a European civil protection force to Mrs Wallström.</p>
<p class="contents">I will say to Mr Mayol i Raynal, who is no longer present, that I was very interested in his idea, if I understood correctly, of a European cycle route. As it happens, I have a longstanding and keen interest in the provision of cycle tracks and I will tell Mrs de Palacio that the European Parliament is determined to see progress made here.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of prevention, a number of you obviously mentioned the best prevention method, which is of course to keep men and women in the areas concerned to live and work there. Mrs Grossetête spoke about desertification, as did Mr Vallvé, Mr Fiori, Mr Maat and Mr Figueiredo. Now is not the time to mention the different aspects of the common agricultural policy, but whatever its imperfections and shortcomings and leaving aside the new course set by the CAP – and I have said myself that it would be better for doing what Mr Fischler in any case proposes and taking environmental requirements into account – it has to be said quite frankly that if the common agricultural policy had not existed, it would have spelt the end for many regions where there are still farmers today. I would add that if we wish to maintain these activities, not only agriculture or forestry, but activities in rural areas where desertification is a real risk, we also need a regional support policy. And this mitigates in favour of the idea, even if it needs to evolve further, of a new regional policy which is of interest to all the regions of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mr Moreira Da Silva mentioned, as many of you did, the great international issue of Kyoto, the greenhouse effect and global warming. I myself have said what I think on this subject. Chance has nothing to do with it. If we experience increasingly violent storms, if temperatures continue to rise, if global warming causes the increase in temperatures and if, all of a sudden, there are fires, floods and – as we will probably see over the next few weeks – further disasters due to rain, storms and erosion, it is no coincidence. I therefore believe that the European Union has a joint, Community-wide responsibility to apply the Kyoto Protocol to the letter, as I said earlier, and to persuade as many countries as possible, including Russia, to ratify this protocol, which seeks to organise prevention at global level. Over and above the efforts that we need to make to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there are clearly all of our other policies which, as I see it – I am saying this to Mr Turmes because I agree with him – need to be implemented with this in mind. This applies too to the policies that we support through the Structural Funds or the funds for transport. Personally I am anxious for us to tip the balance of European transport policy more towards rail. Moreover, I would remind you that under the Cohesion Fund, for which I am responsible, half of the appropriations are allocated to the environment and the other half to transport.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context I am going to pay close attention to the new countries that are entering the Union, Mr Turmes, because we have to avoid these countries, where reconstruction is in full swing, making the same mistakes that we have made on transport since the war: erecting high-voltage power lines in any old place, constructing roads in the middle of cities, building mainly roads and motorways, with more and more concrete, rather than developing rail transport. I promise you that in the new Cohesion Fund we are going to ensure that we strike a better balance. You forgot one subject, Mr Turmes, that is also a particular concern of mine, and that is urban public transport. Through the Cohesion Fund we are going to help cities, Warsaw and others, to provide this public transport. I would like these cities to make more space for urban public transport and to give it better support. I would repeat that in the future regional policy, which I am reflecting on at the moment, my intention is to make this kind of risk prevention compulsory in all of the European regions that are in receipt of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ainardi and Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert mentioned the common agricultural policy in connection with the drought and I would also repeat that, as Mr Fischler has demonstrated, we will show a great deal of flexibility under the CAP so as to help farmers that are very seriously affected at the present time, working alongside and in addition to national governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ries mentioned education. Time does not allow me to go into detail now, but I think that where the environment is concerned one form of prevention is to explain properly what is at stake and to educate people, so as to limit as far as possible not only deliberate or criminal acts but also acts of carelessness.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to support Mr Berthu, who mentioned the need to develop the research programme. My colleague, Mr Busquin, also intends to increase the research effort in this field, as it is insufficient in Europe. As Mr Colom i Naval said, the research effort is all the more necessary where this heatwave and global warming are concerned in the light of the fact that the last decade, from 1990 to 2000, has seen the hottest years for a thousand years. It is therefore necessary to increase our understanding of these phenomena so as to combat them as effectively as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I have responded to Mr Fiori's comments on drought. He invited the Commission to consider the issue of coordinating water resources. That is fine by me. The problem is that responsibility for planning and water resources does not lie entirely at Community level, but is shared with national and regional bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Lipietz suggested a Green Paper on protecting the older generation from climate-related accidents. I think this is an interesting idea, at least to see what has happened in all of the countries and perhaps gain a kind of overview of this crisis, of the way in which different countries responded to it, and so as to exchange good practice. I will pass on this suggestion to my colleague David Byrne. I would say to Mr Turmes that the letter that he mentioned, which was sent to Mr Prodi, will be scrutinised very carefully, not only by the President of the Commission but also by all of the commissioners who are interested in this subject and in particular by the one who has just addressed you.</p>
