It must be respected and protected’.</p>
<p class="contents">I bring in this quotation from the Charter of Fundamental Rights because some situations described in this magnificent report – I congratulate the rapporteur on it – are probably incompatible with this declaration that has just been willingly adopted by this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Compared with these statements, reality is stubborn. Eurostat data tells us that 18% of the population of the European Union live on less than 60% of average national income or, in other words, 65 million Europeans are living in poverty. Naturally the national poverty rates are varied and different, as are the types of poverty: urban, in industrial slums, in isolated rural areas, etc., or the poverty linked to sex or age discrimination – I am referring, of course, to poverty among women and child poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s worlds, the society of globalisation and the world economy, the society of information and technological development, may also have a not very positive influence and create, or help to create, new forms of poverty, on account of the intrinsic difficulties in this kind of society in opening up access to employment – to me this is the fundamental route to social integration and inclusion – and because of the need to improve employment and obtain higher-quality jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has created a lot of employment. In my country, Spain, José María Aznar’s government has made an effort and adopted a commitment: it has succeeded in bringing down a high unemployment rate, and it is still upholding this objective, which is being met, and this commitment. But I do not think we should be satisfied just with what has been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve a Europe that encourages integration, in the words of the Lisbon European Council, requires joint effort and joint action. This comes through knowing the characteristics and the means that can get everyone involved, in society as a whole and in the various governments, on account of the need to quantify objectives and eradicate child poverty, because child poverty must generate other kinds of poverty and perhaps establish formulae of social exclusion that perpetuate poverty and perhaps even destitution. Therefore, Commissioner, I ask for a special effort to be made to eradicate this child poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Following the mass unemployment of the 1980s, social exclusion risks becoming the new evil which will gnaw away at Europe over the coming decade. When growth returns, it will be a challenge we need to take up if we want it to actually benefit everybody. This is not self-evident as this new growth is very unfair and, as we have seen in the United States for some ten years now, may be accompanied by persistent insecure employment, exclusion, poverty and urban ghettoisation. Growth will take place under conditions inherited from the crisis: a lot of jobs are being created, but there have never been so many insecure jobs, temporary jobs and imposed part-time work. I believe that we must ensure that the phenomenon of the working poor does not become widespread over here as well. For many people, economic exclusion is accompanied by exclusion from decent housing and the lack of access to healthcare, training and culture, with certain groups being more exposed than others.</p>
<p class="contents">This Community programme does not aim to take it entirely upon itself to combat exclusion in the European Union, but it must make it possible for Europe to take action in a more determined, effective and coordinated way. To achieve this, it must be closely linked to the commitment that the Heads of State and Government made in Lisbon in March 2000 to give a decisive boost to eliminating poverty by setting proper objectives which must be approved by the Council by the end of the year, in other words, before the Nice European Council, which will take place in a few weeks’ time. I believe that the programme will not be fully meaningful unless it is linked to achieving this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">How can this be done?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, by improving our understanding of exclusion by establishing an indicator and evaluation criteria directed at target groups in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, by making it possible to take better account of the experience of operators in the field, NGOs, local authorities, social organisations and of people who are themselves being excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, by helping to assess the impact of government policies that are being pursued in the different Member States in order to draw lessons, establish good practices and reflect on good strategies and, in particular, their consistency with other economic and social policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, by helping to define guidelines and national action plans along the same lines as the Luxembourg procedure on employment, based, therefore, on indicators and objectives which are not minimal but of a high level of requirement corresponding to the idea we have of the European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments proposed by the rapporteur – which we support – aim to reinforce the programme along these lines. I believe that they converge on a number of points with the proposals made by the high-level social protection group in the Employment Council in the run-up to the Nice Summit. These proposals relate, in particular, to the idea of promoting access to lasting, high-quality employment, to social protection and healthcare. Added to this is access for all to decent and salubrious housing and to essential services; the high-level group mentioned in this connection electricity, water, heating and also real access to education, justice and public services.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I believe that we will only be able to combat exclusion effectively if we guarantee access to fundamental rights to everybody, because dignity and real involvement as a citizen are conditional upon these rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What must the EU’s role be? It is the answers to such questions that we shall find in this programme, designed to promote cooperation on the part of the Member States in combating social exclusion. The idea is that all interested and concerned parties should be involved in a type of work in which the individual countries describe the extent of social exclusion and their efforts to combat it. This will form the background against which we shall acquire a more common framework of understanding, for the concept of social exclusion is not so simple to define. When we think of the long-term unemployed – young as well as old – do we not think of physically or mentally handicapped people, of the mentally ill and of the poor and people with limited means? No doubt we each of us have our own particular ideas about what the concept should cover. What we lack is a common definition.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission experimented with a definition in its consultation document for the Lisbon Summit, proceeding on the basis that the excluded are those who have an income of less than 60% of average earnings in the country concerned. The governments of the Member States did not accept this definition, which is also rather simplistic and unduly bland. We need a more detailed description of the problem areas. The very open approach adopted by the Council to the issue is, in my view, quite correct. There is a need to gather statistics, prepare analyses and, by means of conferences and other devices, create greater common appreciation of what we understand to mean by social exclusion. With regard to the actual report, Mrs Figueiredo wants to see the word ‘poverty’ introduced into the legislative text. This is something to which my group is generally opposed for technical reasons, namely the issue of what the basis would be in terms of the Treaties. We recognise, of course, that poverty is a source of social exclusion, as is also stated in the text. I believe we are all agreed about that. Parts of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party also have reservations about increasing the appropriation and inserting a reference to the focus group into the legislative text, but we are otherwise able to support Mrs Figueiredo’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lambert (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for her great commitment in dealing with this report on a programme of Community action for combating social exclusion in which, as many have said, poverty can be an important factor. We are told that finding paid work is the best way of preventing social exclusion but I would agree with those who have said that we would have to take account of the fact that gainful employment alone is no guarantee of social participation. There are many elderly people who would agree with that, as would those who had worked for hours for low wages which do not provide a decent living – farm labourers, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pity that poverty is proving such a controversial addition to the title of this programme, for the reason that it is not mentioned in the Treaties. It would be interesting to hear from the Council, at some point, whether they are proposing to rectify this omission at the Nice Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Combating poverty proves controversial because it raises the issue of social protection as a productive factor and the issue of redistribution – deeply unfashionable concepts with some Member States. It would be useful to use some of the increased sum which is requested in this report to fund comparative studies to demonstrate how such developments might be managed. I am sure that many of the NGOs and local and regional authorities – which Mrs Figueiredo proposes to include in the programme and its evaluation – would be happy to share their considerable expertise.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are going to avoid social exclusion we have to ensure that our macroeconomic policies do not act in a way which increases social exclusion. It would be totally counterproductive to have policies which undermine local economic development, make employment less secure but more demanding and then have to mop up the casualties through programmes which try to combat poverty and social exclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In economic policy, we in fact do all we can to increase efficiency, dynamism and response rates. In the harsh climate which then arises, there are more and more people who cannot keep up and who are marginalised and excluded. So the more the economy flourishes, the more people seem to be consigned to poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">It is easy to become pessimistic. In spite of the fact that there is money around and in spite of the fact that Europe has never been richer, it appears to be more and more difficult to protect the weak and give the marginalised a proper chance. That is why Mrs Figueiredo’s report is very important and welcome. I want to congratulate her warmly on the report. It is about how the Member States are to be encouraged to do something to combat poverty and social exclusion. What is particularly good is that she emphasises so strongly that fine words are not enough and that solidarity costs money.</p>
<p class="contents">The ideal, of course, is to be able to offer good work to as many people as possible, but in a tough competition-based economy there are many who do not cope. According to the report, this may be true of women with two jobs who therefore work both outside and inside the home. It may be true of older people whose knowledge is no longer needed. It may be true of people with mental difficulties and of large groups of people who do not have a good enough knowledge of the language in order to get jobs. Above all, it is no doubt true of the many people who work but who have wages too low to live on. All these groups are threatened by social exclusion if very extensive measures of support are not provided. The Member States must therefore allocate much more money than at present to social initiatives aimed at combating exclusion, poverty and social destitution.</p>
<p class="contents">I mentioned what is paradoxical in society. According to the current ideology, people must take responsibility for their own lives. I believe, however, that social exclusion and poverty are caused by social conditions and that responsibility is therefore shared. In a good society, there must be room for everyone, and that means shared responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the figures on poverty in Europe, upon which our report is based and which have been mentioned today – the 18% poverty line – are evidence of a situation which is anything but exciting. The main problem is still understanding what it is that is not working in the economies and societies of the European countries and which reforms should be carried out in order to reduce substantially the zones of poverty and social exclusion burdening many areas of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">What proposals does the decision under consideration make? To guarantee rights, to establish coordination, to create committees to study the situation and draw up action plans to combat social exclusion, to promote dialogue between the parties concerned and to create NGO networks at European level, and for this we will appropriate EUR 70 million or maybe EUR 100 million. Now, I am not questioning the good intentions behind this decision, but I am concerned at the results to be expected from this five-year plan. At the end of the day, we will in all probability, be more familiar with the statistics of social exclusion and poverty – which is a good thing – and we will have guaranteed operations to assist some tens of thousands of people in Europe – which is also no bad thing – but we will not have made any progress towards structural reforms which could have convincingly reduced poverty and exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The report stresses two points: unemployment and the extremely low pension levels for certain categories. It is certainly true that these are two factors which lead to exclusion and poverty, but we must treat the disease rather than the symptoms. If we want there to be more jobs, we must have the courage to liberalise the labour market. Where this has been achieved, even in Europe, unemployment has fallen convincingly. In the United States, a more flexible labour market means that periods of poverty and unemployment are only very short. If we want to find the resources to give to the pensioners with the most paltry pensions, we must have the courage to admit that we need to stop people retiring at 50 years old and, in all probability, create a completely new social security system.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not reform the labour and welfare markets, re-establishing them on the basis of individual freedom and responsibility rather than on State and trade union paternalism, then I am afraid that our committees and our efforts at coordination will do very little for the poor of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These 65 million people are often overlooked. They do not fit into the image of a prosperous Europe with enormous growth potential. The cause of this poverty is a lack of jobs, inadequate wages – the phrase "the working poor" comes to mind – and insecure jobs. If we are to achieve the economic and social cohesion to which we aspire we need not just a high level of employment, but also a high level of social protection.

<p class="contents">I am being sabotaged, Mr President!</p>
<p class="contents">This should help to recognise the symptoms of exclusion and provide for an exchange of experience based on precise qualitative and quantitative data. A dialogue is needed between interest groups and the relevant NGOs. National monitoring centres and regional and local authorities need to be involved. The benefits of synergy are felt when Member States' measures are linked with Community policies, actions and instruments and with the European Structural Funds. This can lead to successful practices which act as a model. Another result is building and extending networks. And another still is the promotion of innovative projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard it as essential to set up a reflection group at European level with representatives of the NGOs, the social partners, the Council and the European Parliament taking part in an annual round table. The concept of open coordination in employment policy since Luxembourg needs to incorporate exclusion and to be reflected in the Member States' National Action Plans. In 1992, the Council called on the Member States to combat social exclusion. In 1999, it agreed to promote social integration. We should reinforce this active role as from 2001, in order to give those afflicted by poverty and social exclusion access to economic, social and cultural activities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe has managed to avoid the economic crises that have hit many parts of the world over recent years. Growth is picking up, inflation has been brought down to its lowest levels for a generation, yet we still have persistent poverty and exclusion. Europe's unemployment rate is still far too high at 8.3%. Well over half of the 14 million unemployed, according to Eurostat's latest figures, have been out of work for over a year.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, according to the EU's statistical service, 18% of European citizens live below the poverty line, while one-third of those living in poverty are working. In my own country something like 75% of those who are working and living below the poverty line are women.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation seems to be getting worse. Between 1980 and 1995 overall inequality rose in Member States. Globalisation, technological innovation and the emergence of a knowledge-based economy are coinciding with changing family structures, shifting gender roles and increasingly diverse societies. The simple fact is that social exclusion is a brake on economic growth, while an inclusive society enhances growth and the well-being of everyone. The Commission estimates that the under-use of available human resources and the wider cost of ill-health, crime etc. could be between EUR 1 billion and EUR 2 billion annually. This is an enormous figure.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely imperative that Europe address the divisions that already exist and prevents new ones arising. The existence of a single currency and an increasingly coordinated economic and fiscal policy mean that social policies cannot be the sole responsibilities of national jurisdictions. It is imperative, however, that Member States engage fully with this programme and consult widely with civil society to establish ambitious targets for eliminating poverty and exclusion. The first test of the Member States' seriousness will be their approval of Parliament's decision that the funding should be increased from EUR 70 billion to EUR 100 billion. This in itself is a paltry sum given the extent of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for a report that identifies the true extent of poverty and social exclusion and questions the notion of a Europe committed to defending social justice and solidarity unless all European institutions and civil society engage seriously with the issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have all spoken of the extremely beneficial economic development we are seeing, with good growth, declining unemployment and a greater number of jobs. At the same time, I believe that, in all EU countries, we are seeing increasing and persistent social divisions due to the recession we experienced. This indicates that labour market policy and traditional employment policy are not enough. Instead, we must include more policy areas if we are to be able to combat social exclusion and poverty. It is a multidimensional problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, labour market policy is part and parcel of this issue. It is important for unemployment to decline and for there to be more jobs. That is not enough, however, since education policy too must be included, especially in view of the fact that, when knowledge is as important as it is in the new society, everyone must have access to it. Social security policy is also an important area. People in different life situations, for example those who are parents of small children or who are unemployed, ill or old, must not inevitably become poor or socially excluded but must be able to participate in society. Housing policy, too, is an important area. For example, it is important for people to have the right to housing if they are to be included in society.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, all political levels must be involved. We are used to the local level and we are used to the regional and national levels. We also know however that, in view of the present economic situation with its cross-border economy, it is necessary for us to act at a European level in order to create added value and not in order to take over anything else. The process involved in this programme is therefore important, just as it is important to combine different policy areas. This was discussed in Lisbon and will continue to be discussed at the Stockholm meeting. It involves our combining social security policy, labour market policy and education policy with economic policy. A programme like this, designed to combat social exclusion and poverty, is most excellently suited for this purpose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This represents around 75 million European citizens. In general terms, over the last ten years, the national poverty rate has ranged from 10 to 11% for Denmark and the Netherlands to a very worrying 24% for Portugal. To this we must add the fact that more than 10 million people depend on assistance from social welfare systems, in a situation which is growing worse in most Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is extremely important because it aims to improve the circumstances of the most underprivileged, thereby representing one more step towards strengthening social cohesion. For this I wish to congratulate the rapporteur. This is an ambitious programme of Community action which, in line with the Commission’s proposal, will be given budgetary appropriations of EUR 70 million and should remain in force for a period of five years. This budget should be increased, bearing in mind the processes and the realism that are necessary in this field. There must be further dialogue with non-governmental organisations and with other social partners, aimed at vigorously detecting the most concentrated areas of poverty and social exclusion and at defining the most efficient and effective ways of combating them. We must nevertheless issue a warning about the inadequacy of the NGOs' financial control mechanisms, and demand a better system of financial management equal to the task of ensuring that public funds are spent in a sensible and rigorous way.</p>
<p class="contents">The beneficiaries of this programme should be the victims of poverty and social exclusion, and we must prevent this from becoming in practice merely a means of financing bodies which investigate the problems of poverty and social exclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore support the rapporteur in stressing that the programme, or rather the programme's role, will facilitate greater social cohesion where the poor and the marginalised are concerned. As is stated in the amendments which I tabled in committee and which were subsequently adopted, I am convinced that an effective, practical fight against poverty must take place according to a timetable of events and targets. In fact, a programme with in-built deadlines and checks is easier to assess in terms of quantity and quality.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be taken into consideration that over 65 million people in the European Union – 7.5 million of which live in my country, Italy – live on a low income, and a low income in Italy, Commissioner, means a family living on an income of EUR 750. These figures suggest that the budget made available for the programme will be totally insufficient. I therefore call for it to be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will end by stressing once again that mutual support between States must be the reference point upon which we base a fresh fight against poverty and social exclusion, but we must take into account the fact that the economic progress of the Member States, and therefore an improvement in their welfare due to the implementation of a social economy of scale, will certainly facilitate the achievement of a greater, better system of social justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a very important and constructive contribution and it supports the Commission proposal for a joint decision of the Council and Parliament which will establish a community action programme to combat social exclusion. After the Treaty of Amsterdam and some months after the Lisbon council, we all know that a new context has been created for Community action in the area of social policies and social exclusion and social protection. There is a shift in the political debate at the European level and we can see that there is a strong will to combine social cohesion and competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed action programme has a legal basis, Article 137 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, and we had a new mandate after the Lisbon Council. This programme has been designed to support implementation of the open coordination method which means that it will be possible to improve knowledge, to develop exchange of information and best practice and to evaluate experience to better combat social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a very interesting debate on the role of employment in combating social exclusion and the role of the social reforms and of the structural reforms. There was a discussion about the definition of "poverty" and "social income". The gap is clearly increasing between rich and poor, but unfortunately it is impossible to participate in these discussions since I am obliged to focus on the proposed programme and on the way in which we will cooperate to implement this programme at the European level.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to inform Members of Parliament that, on 4 December, there will be a discussion in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the new social agenda and on what we have achieved during the last year. There will be a very interesting political debate, and social exclusion will be at the centre of this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the proposed programme is concerned and the report of Parliament, I am particularly happy at your strong overall support for this proposal. I can accept a majority of your proposals either in their entirety or in spirit. I agree on your proposal to strengthen the reference to the conclusion of the Lisbon European Council. I also agree on the importance of improving understanding of social exclusion and poverty and of promoting comparable indicators and assessment criteria. I also agree to highlight the importance of NGOs as well as of regional and local actors as you suggest, and of better reflecting their experience on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a reference to the use of the word "poverty". You know there is a political and theoretical discussion on the word "poverty". Of course, social exclusion is the wider notion and social exclusion has three main dimensions: poverty, discrimination and lack of opportunities. But I agree that "poverty" is politically a very strong word and I agree that we can add poverty to social exclusion where possible in the text of the proposal. Unfortunately, we cannot use it in the title of the programme. This is a legalistic problem because, according to the Treaty's wording, the reference concerns only social exclusion and not poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the amendment which stresses the importance of coherence between all relevant policies. I welcome the amendments which refer to the Social Protection Committee. Something which is very important is that the Commission has accepted an exceptional increase of up to 90% in the rate of Community co-funding of European networks of NGOs active in poverty and social exclusion. However, I am not able to accept an increase in the budget from EUR 70 million to EUR 100 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget that we propose is adapted to the aim of the programme and this aim is to encourage cross-national cooperation and mutual learning and not to fund actions on the ground. Through the Social Fund and through the EQUAL initiative Member States' NGOs can be funded for particular projects for particular actions on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">I am unable to accept the remaining amendments for a variety of reasons: some because they are not in conformity with legal requirements; some because they raise issues which fall outside the scope of the decision establishing the programme; and some because they would confuse the message.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to come to your proposal that the Commission sets up, in addition to the programme committee, a reflection group. We cannot accept this proposal because it is against the comitology rules. But I would like to make the following pragmatic suggestion in response to your concerns because I entirely agree that we must find a way to have close and continuous cooperation. We have already agreed that the Social Protection Committee would meet on a regular basis with the contact group of Members of Parliament. The Social Protection Committee plays a key role in the development of policies of the European Council. Close cooperation between the contact group and the Social Protection Committee will ensure the exchange of views between the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand there could be a link between the contact group and the Commission's officials on a regular basis. They could exchange views, they could cooperate on a permanent basis, and we have already established a similar liaison between Parliament and the Commission for the Unemployment Fund and for the European Social Fund. We had very successful and satisfactory results.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to respond to your concerns about the involvement of different actors and institutions in the implementation of this programme. I suggest that the annual Round Table we have proposed should be prepared in consultation with representatives of all the institutions which work at European level: the European Parliament, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, the social partners and the European networks of NGOs. I believe that these proposals constitute a pragmatic response to your request. For procedural and institutional reasons it is not possible to incorporate them in the text of the decision.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, out of the 75 amendments you have proposed, I can accept either as drafted or in spirit 48 of them, namely: Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 31, 37, 42, 46, 48, 51, 58, 59, 60, 61, 65, 66, 68 and 74. I can also accept parts of Amendments Nos 14, 36, 40, 45, 53, 63, 64, 70, 71, 72 and 73.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to highlight the importance of simplification of the procedures. You have focused on that during the discussion. It is true that there is a complexity in the whole procedure but all three institutions wish to reach an agreement as soon as possible. This is what we will try to do on the part of the Commission. We will try to shorten the procedures as much as we can. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
