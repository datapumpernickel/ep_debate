<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span> <span class="italic"> Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the contrast could hardly be more glaring. While you, ladies and gentlemen, are discussing how the Member States of the European Union can live together more unitedly under a common European roof, a few hundred kilometres away, in Rambouillet, the issue being discussed is whether they can live together under any kind of common roof. That shows the strategic challenge Kosovo represents for the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we have the single market and the dismantling of borders, there a policy that still regards national borders as a means of fencing oneself off, as a shield. In line with good diplomatic practice, it was agreed that the Rambouillet negotiations would be confidential. They are to be held between the parties concerned and not publicly. So I know no more about them than you, who are well‐informed politicians. That is why at this point I have to confine myself to informing you that as expected the negotiations are proving difficult, that so far both sides are giving no ground at all and that the mediators are currently concentrating on identifying any common areas over and above the differences.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, progress reports on this kind of negotiations can be very misleading, for the truth is that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. The European Union has a key role to play in the search for peace. With his preliminary work in Pristina and Belgrade, the EU special envoy, Mr Petritsch, made a crucial contribution to enabling these negotiations to take place at all. He is now conducting the negotiations in Rambouillet together with his American colleague Mr Hill and his Russian colleague Mr Mayorski. That is a great challenge and one in which Mr Petritsch deserves our full support.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, the fact that the negotiations are being conducted jointly by an American, a Russian and a European shows that the European Union has now acquired a certain ability to act in the field of foreign policy too. We have certainly not reached our goal, but at least we are on the right road.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union reacted to the conflict in Kosovo at an early stage. Since spring last year it has gradually established a differentiated system of sanctions in response to the brutal use of force by the Serbian security forces. At the same time it has allocated a substantial volume of humanitarian aid, amounting of over ECU 45 million in 1998 alone. The EU has supported the independent media to counter the propaganda from both sides. It has also provided aid for democratisation and the development of a civil society in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">Our political objective was always the same: far‐reaching self‐government for Kosovo together with maintenance of the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and effective protection of all minority rights. At its last meeting on 25 January 1999 the General Affairs Council again confirmed the European Union"s position. Let me briefly repeat the key points.</p>
<p class="contents">One: the European Union is seeking a political solution. The use of force, by whichever side, only exacerbates the conflict and inflicts even greater suffering and misery on the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Two: in this context the European Union supports the political solution proposed by the Contact Group, which forms the basis of the negotiations in Rambouillet.</p>
<p class="contents">Three: the European Union is calling on Belgrade to fulfil in full the undertakings it gave to the OSCE and NATO and to comply with the demands of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Four: the perpetrators of the Racak massacre cannot go unpunished. Their names must be transmitted to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">Five: the European Union calls on the Kosovo Albanians to fulfil their commitments vis‐ŕ‐vis the UN Security Council in full. It condemns KLA provocations that give added impetus to the spiral of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Six: the European Union supports the OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission, which has developed into an important stabilising factor, regardless of all the difficulties it faces, and emphasises that President Milosevic has assumed responsibility for the safety of the mission personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">Seven: the European Union is prepared to make its contribution to implementing a negotiated settlement. That applies also and in particular to reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">Eight: the people of Kosovo must know that the European Union is prepared to help them along the road to peace.</p>
<p class="contents">On 25 January 1999 the General Affairs Council extended the mandate of the former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe González as EU Special Representative for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia until January 2000. I want to thank Mr González for his willingness to continue with this difficult job. At the same time I call on the Belgrade leadership to cooperate with Mr González and to make full use of the opportunities this offers it in relation to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace and stability in Europe not only demand a successful negotiated settlement in Rambouillet, although that is of course the <span class="italic">conditio sine qua non</span> ; peace and stability in Europe also mean that we must regard the conflicts and problems in the former Yugoslavia as a challenge to which we have to find the right, which means the European, answer.</p>
<p class="contents">We must strengthen the democratic, pluralist elements in the societies concerned. We must promote and develop regional cooperation. We must establish cooperation and pre‐accession structures that match up to these countries" European vocation. Above all, of course, we must establish peace in this region and show how the people of this region can coexist. The European Union offers its support to that end. However, the responsibility for this lies with the warring parties. They must realise that nothing is to be gained through force whereas much is to be lost and that there is no realistic alternative to finding a compromise solution at the negotiating table in Rambouillet.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van den Broek, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (NL)</span> Mr President, naturally the European Commission is also pleased that the parties have acted in response to the urgent call to begin peace negotiations in Rambouillet. Many more efforts will be made to reach an agreement, the presence of the Serbs and Kosovo Albanians in Rambouillet being seen as a sign that they are ready in principle to find a solution. Pressure must however remain at a maximum if an acceptable and workable result is to be achieved. As you will know, Foreign Ministers Robin Cook and Hubert Védrine regularly attend in order to help keep the momentum of the negotiations going.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission is also represented in Rambouillet and is contributing to negotiations on the economic and reconstruction aspects of the draft agreement. Next weekend there will probably be a further meeting of the Contact Group at ministerial level. The aim will be to appraise the results to date and to discuss what points require extra effort or attention.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the European Commission is making the necessary preparations for its contribution to the process of reconstruction following a possible agreement. In December and January a so‐called ‘damage assessment" was carried out on the Commission"s initiative, looking at the damage to houses and the basic infrastructure, although it was not possible to visit all the areas because of the fighting. Rough estimates currently put the number of homes damaged to some extent at about 30 000. Initial calculations estimate that it will take EUR 330 million to repair them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is planning to hold an international donors conference shortly after a peace agreement is reached. But of course neither this nor reconstruction are possible until there is an agreement and a clear will by the parties involved to live together in peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this necessary conditionality, the actual reconstruction work can of course only begin when the security situation in the field permits. It is encouraging to see the growing consensus among the Member States and other countries to support a possible agreement with an international force on the spot. That will help further guarantee the reconstruction work.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important objective of the reconstruction work is of course to allow the thousands of displaced persons and refugees to return to their original homes. The financial resources made available by the Union for this year are limited. It will certainly be possible to make a start on reconstruction, but the budget lines available for this, which is in fact the budget line for the reconstruction of the former Yugoslavia, is also needed to pay for the reconstruction of Bosnia‐Herzegovina.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will return to these matters as soon as we know what the international contribution to the reconstruction work is to be and the time‐frame involved. Humanitarian aid through ECHO, to which the President‐in‐Office of the Council has already referred, will be granted in the meantime. We also want the European Union"s activities to be very visible, which is only possible by coordinating and presenting all our activities as effectively as possible. To this end, the Commission"s presence in Belgrade and soon also in Pristina must be increased and assured.</p>

I believe I may say without any arrogance but with a certain pride that it was my group that kept pointing out that we need both: the offer of talks and the threat of force. Some people, here in this House too, wanted us to use force sooner; but that would have been wrong. As is becoming clear, there is still a possibility of achieving what is – I hope – our common aim through talks and mediation. I do not exclude the possibility of failure, as at any conference, which would then make it all the more necessary to use force. But the opportunity that now exists really must be used to the full.</p>
<p class="contents">The President‐in‐Office of the Council named names. I am glad that a European representative is playing a prominent role. And I take a personal pride here, for before becoming ambassador in Belgrade Wolfgang Petritsch was a colleague of mine and he really is doing a splendid job here, which is much appreciated. But I am concerned not with personalities but with the matter itself. And that is the importance of having a European Union representative playing the most prominent part here.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I consider it just as important that not only the Americans but the Russians too are involved. People often disregard the fact that we also need to remind Russia and the Russian Government of their responsibility for this continent. Given that it does have that responsibility, Russia must play its part in finding the solution, to ensure that it is a lasting solution.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group let me also repeat that we are against borders being forcibly redrawn in today"s Europe. If any changes are to be made, they can only be made on the basis of a final consensus, not by force, not unilaterally. If necessary, troops will have to be deployed, as the Commissioner said, to ensure longer‐term security. I have no illusions about a solution being found overnight and I would ask everyone in this House to remember that it is not just Kosovo that is under threat now, but that the entire region will be under threat unless we find a sensible solution: FYROM, and Albania too. It is most important for the European Union to urge Albania in particular to listen to the voice of reason and the voice of consensus. It is important to have Albania as a whole on our side, not a divided and divisive Albania, if we are to achieve a common solution here. In that sense I fully endorse the statements by the President‐in‐Office and the Commissioner.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pack </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my dear Mr Verheugen, we did nothing about Kosovo in the early days. We have known what is happening in Kosovo since 1989. We took no notice; we only took notice when we ourselves triggered the KLA movement. Those are the facts and anyone who denies them has not been watching the story unfold.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we applaud ourselves and pat ourselves on the back for providing so much funding, which we would never have had to provide had everything not been destroyed, had the West intervened sooner. Our group also supports the Rambouillet negotiations. And I am glad the Europeans are playing a more important role, but as always, of course, they are too late. I hope they are not entirely too late, but I believe we should realise that we could have made an earlier start, for instance last October. Many people would not have died in Racak and elsewhere if we had done in October what we are doing now.</p>
<p class="contents">NATO"s threat of air strikes must be credibly maintained. Here I am addressing some Members of this House who are against this. With the unconstitutional destruction of the autonomous status of Kosovo in 1989 Milosevic set in motion the disintegration of Yugoslavia as a whole, after which he stirred up nationalist resentment with his Kosovo propaganda. He is now facing the end of his pointless policy of violence against the Kosovo Albanians and will try to extend the 15‐day deadline by any means possible. He does not and cannot want a solution to the Kosovo conflict forced upon him by the West. For then he would lose all international significance and would finally have to govern his people. And then his political mediocrity and incompetence would very soon become apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">The long‐overdue prosecution in The Hague would then also become inevitable and our countries would have to produce the evidence in their possession. So the NATO threat is indispensable. Should an interim solution be found in Rambouillet, as we hope it will, it would have to be safeguarded by ground forces to protect the Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo. But even if no solution is found, air strikes alone cannot secure our objectives. We will need ground forces then too. We are all hoping to see results, but at the same time we expect the West and NATO to show their steadfast resolve, otherwise we will bear responsibility for throwing away this last chance!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cars </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, one thing we can learn from a century of European history is that democracies and dictatorships cannot live side by side for ever, and that the notion of peaceful coexistence under such circumstances has a built‐in time‐limit. The two systems are incompatible and, in the end, one will vanquish the other. It can come about by military means, as in the case of the defeat of Hitler's Germany, or peacefully, as happened when the Soviet Union fell apart.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has a duty to take a clear stand in support of democracy and democrats. The suffering which the dictator Slobodan Milosevic has inflicted on the people of Yugoslavia, particularly the Serbian population, must be stopped immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU's mission in the Balkans should be to put an end to the fighting, killing and acts of cruelty. That in itself is a very important mission, but it should not end there. Europe also has a responsibility to ensure that all the countries and self‐governing areas in the Balkans have democratic systems, and that the people understand both the obligations and duties inherent in democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">All the dictators, war criminals and tyrants who have dominated the situation in the Balkans must be driven out of their palaces and government buildings. This will then make room for the leaders of democratic states and legitimate communities in the Balkans to reach a negotiated settlement on borders and other mutually contentious issues, while fully respecting the wishes of all minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone would be delighted if the talks in Rambouillet made progress in this direction. The Serbs and Albanians, Muslims and members of the Orthodox Church should be made to feel that the European Union, without preconceptions or discrimination, is seeking a balanced solution. However, the Liberals, myself included, find it hard to see how even a solution within an imposed time‐limit can be achieved without the efforts of a peacekeeping force large enough to command respect. I regret the fact that in Parliament's joint motion for a resolution, other groups have stopped short of pointing to the need for such a force. Certainly I am pleased to see that my Social Democrat colleagues are gradually shifting their position, but this is only because the Council of Ministers has clarified its stance. The Social Democrats are always a pace or two behind the Council. Notwithstanding the importance which the Liberals attach to securing a settlement of the Kosovo problem, I am proud to belong to a group that wishes to be in the front line of future developments, instead of just an escort.</p>

<p class="contents">Parliament has often called for effective international action on Kosovo. Unfortunately, it has come too late for those who have already died, those who have lost their homes and their belongings, and those who have become refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we must support the efforts made and the substance of the plan proposed by the Contact Group. If we do not want these problems to spill over into other countries, the solution to the conflict must undoubtedly allow Kosovo to enjoy broad autonomy within internationally recognised frontiers. This is the first thing that must be done.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that three very clear points must be taken into consideration. The first is that we must continue to exert pressure on the parties involved to persuade them to reject the use of violence as a means of achieving their objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if NATO is going to carry out military operations, the international High Representative should clearly be European, as is the case in Bosnia where excellent results have been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as Felipe González has pointed out on many occasions, we must not forget that President Milosevic and the absence of democracy in Serbia are the main causes of these conflicts. If we do not get rid of them, further conflicts are bound to arise in the future.</p>

But the difficulty is and remains that if the Council is divided no unanimous action is possible. Parliament was also divided in its opinions. So let us not condemn others when we are facing the same difficulties ourselves. I believe it is a good start that work is now being done towards a political solution. The whole question is whether or not the present offer of extensive autonomy – comparable to that of Montenegro – will be sufficiently convincing for the Albanians after all that has happened and after the radicalisation which has taken place within the various movements there.</p>
<p class="contents">My question remains: what about the big stick? There is always agreement that pressure must be kept up, and I share that view, but how can we apply pressure on the KLA to honour its commitments? It is not only the Serbs who fail to keep their promises. The KLA is also guilty of this, as we have seen. We therefore believe that a solution must be sought in a common approach to the whole of the southern region of eastern Europe.</p>

I would be grateful if you could tell me whether or not Rambouillet was a European Union initiative or a Franco‐British initiative, as I did not quite understand this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I will now follow on with what our colleague Mr Carnero was saying. The Serbs, that is, the Serbian people, are the ones that have been forgotten in Rambouillet. Once again, Europe, and the Council in particular, is counting on Mr Milosevic. I believe that Milosevic is part of the solution, as he clearly represents the problem, and I do not have bleak doubts like Mrs Aelvoet, who wonders whether or not the KLA is going to respect its promises. We are dealing with a man, Mr Milosevic, who has shown himself to be an expert in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that these are fundamental issues. The Council tells us that it will apply pressure to put an end to this situation and to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice. We therefore also need to know if it will analyse the statements in the press, which are communications between the operational units in Kosovo and the leaders in Belgrade, in order to show that the chain of command does not stop in the working‐class areas of Kosovo, but that it goes directly to Belgrade. I hope that we will thus go straight to Milosevic, and that Europe will adopt a clear policy on this issue, because it is obvious that the criminals – those who committed these acts – received very clear orders from Belgrade.</p>
<p class="contents">The deputy attorney general of the court in The Hague was saying nothing less than this when he said that it was time for the member countries, including some of the Member States of the European Union, to pass on the evidence in their possession that proves that the chain of command goes from the villages of Kosovo right to Belgrade, right to the heart of power in Belgrade, right to Milosevic. It is time that this was done and I would ask the Council to respond to this point.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Parigi </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, history teaches us that it is hard to tell who is good or bad or cruel or kind in the Balkans. Likewise, historical accuracy requires us to recognise that, for the Serbs, Kosovo is their original homeland, just as Israel is for the Israelis. If anyone wonders why intervention in the Kosovan tragedy has come so late, I would cynically suggest that it probably suits some people to destroy and then rebuild.</p>
<p class="contents">All the same, we welcome the attempt to resolve the conflict through diplomatic negotiation guaranteed by the international institutions. Yet we cannot deny that the European Union"s role is too weak and it hardly amounts to a common foreign policy when some Member States take a view of the Balkan question which is the complete opposite of the position of other Member States, including their view of history.</p>
<p class="contents">The complex Balkan question has its roots deep in time, in the history of these people, and in their traditions and cultures. There is one incontrovertible fact which must never be forgotten in trying to find a way out of the present tragic situation. The integration of the two civilisations – Muslim and Orthodox – is becoming impossible because the nature of each is so strong and the two cultures so diverse. So the aim must be coexistence. That is becoming vital unless we want to see the current conflict perpetuated – and where there is conflict there is also violence, ethnic cleansing, genocide, abuses and violations of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe can no longer tolerate such an explosive situation, rooted more in ethnic than geopolitical considerations, continuing to develop on its doorstep. That is why we believe that coexistence, respecting the different values and cultures, must be the goal. This kind of conflict cannot be resolved by war, nor can the Belgrade Government restore peace to the region by arming the police. But the Kosovans cannot be allowed to use the profits from drug‐dealing to buy arms to perpetuate the war.</p>
<p class="contents">Uprooting people from their land and the land of their fathers, where their identity is rooted, will always be a source of new tragedies and future conflict. The best way to ensure peace is to find means of making coexistence possible, with guarantees for both parties. So we think the most appropriate political and institutional solution would be the widest possible autonomy for Kosovo within a constitutional framework which guarantees it, backed by the international institutions and the European Union. In turn, Europe can and must contribute to economic development in the region and become, both for the Serbian people and for the people of Kosovo, a reference point for a peaceful and balanced Federation.</p>

The OSCE observer mission is not having the desired effect. The dreadful massacre in Racak on 15 January marked a new low point in the conflict between the Kosovo Albanians and the Serbs, and it ended the uneasy cease‐fire which was imposed in November. It is not only the Serbian forces but also the KLA, which is proving increasingly effective in its guerrilla tactics, which are responsible for this daily violence. As a result, several thousand people have again been forced to flee their homes. There is and was good cause for the international community to be more active in its intervention. Brutal violence, the ethnic cleansing of the civilian population and the destabilisation of Yugoslavia must be stopped. Those who commit all these crimes must also be brought to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">My group strongly supports the Contact Group and the proposed draft peace plan, with a transition period in order to establish substantial autonomy for the Kosovo region. This is a precondition which my group has always supported. The talks in Rambouillet are a final attempt to arrive at a workable solution without military action by NATO. Parliament also therefore supports NATO"s preparations for intervention as a way of applying pressure in order to ensure a successful outcome to the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that it is also important for us to prepare to send troops as part of the implementation of any agreement. During the talks pressure is being applied to the Serbs and to the Kosovo Albanians to agree on a solution to the conflict. In order to prevent the Rambouillet talks from playing into the hands of the KLA, it has quite rightly been made clear to the Kosovo Albanians that the only way of having a NATO peacekeeping force in the area is for them to make genuine efforts to reach complete agreement with the Serbs on interim autonomy for Kosovo within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">It was in March last year that the conflict broke out in full force. That is nearly a year ago. It is time all the parties to the conflict reached agreement. We therefore also call on the European Union and its Member States to play a clear and active role in ending this conflict. We should like to express our support for the action of the British and French Governments and also express our appreciation for the efforts of the German Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">As the European Union we are taking the lead. Let us continue to do so. I say again: this is not about Kosovo"s past but its future, and the future of the people who live there. It is not a question of being right but of being put in the right.</p>

But perhaps you could tell us a bit more because, having heard that a start has been made but it is an uphill task and there are difficult issues, we do still need to know that, if Rambouillet fails, there is a fall‐back plan for resolving the problem and dealing with the aftermath. As has been said, we cannot rely solely on the parties involved acting responsibly; that would mean Europe"s policy had failed again.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner mentioned the idea of a peace‐keeping force possibly being stationed in the area. But the broader and more important question the German Presidency needs to confront is the creation, at last, of a general framework for the whole of the former Yugoslavia. Fires are being lit even now in Macedonia. The newspapers say nationalist tension is breaking out again in Brisco between Muslims and Serbs, and the situation is heating up. The European Union as a whole needs to succeed in implementing a policy across the whole area.</p>
<p class="contents">What guidelines are there, beyond mere emergency intervention, beyond mere stopgap solutions to a difficult situation? What general guidelines does the European Union intend to pursue to establish a genuine peace process for the whole area? That is the question, and we hope that Germany will be in a position to launch the debate on this issue.</p>

<p class="contents">Naturally, everyone in this Chamber hopes Rambouillet will succeed in defusing the Kosovo time‐bomb, but plenty of people in this same Chamber can see in the political‐military approach some alarmingly counter‐productive factors liable to make that bomb explode, with an inevitable chain reaction of associated flare‐ups.</p>
<p class="contents">The threat of military intervention – assuming it can make either party to the conflict less intransigent, which is not necessarily true – would prove counter‐productive once it ceased to be a threat. NATO aircraft would be KLA aircraft to all intents and purposes and would also involve the prospect of an intervention force. Such a force could only be commanded by the OSCE, with a NATO component and a UN mandate, and it should obviously include men and resources from the Russian Federation. And then there is the problem of Albania, which continues to provide a means of transit for massive arms supplies to the rebels.</p>
<p class="contents">But the stress should be on diplomatic, political and economic pressure, and the imminent deadlines that were rashly imposed on the Rambouillet negotiations should be extended to leave no alternative unexplored which might eventually be acceptable to the two parties involved.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Titley </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I have to say by way of prologue how refreshing it is to hear a government minister admit he does not know any more about a situation than we do. I welcome the statement by the President‐in‐Office. We have to recognise that, although frequently in these debates about Kosovo it is all doom and gloom for Parliament, tremendous progress has been made, and two points in particular should be reinforced. The fact we have negotiations now is largely due to European Union leadership. At long last we are taking effective action and I congratulate the German presidency on the progress made, and indeed the British Foreign Secretary and French Foreign Minister also.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as the Socialist Group has always demanded, we have managed to keep the Contact Group together and, indeed, have now got Russia actively engaged in pursuing peace. This is very important and we must not do anything to undermine the cohesion of the Contact Group. Of course the background of the NATO military threat has been absolutely essential, as we in the Socialist Group have always insisted.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly our next great challenge will be if these negotiations drag on. We have set a timetable. Inevitably negotiations go on beyond a timetable but we clearly must not be sucked into the kind of manoeuvring we have seen in the past with one side or the other deliberating dragging on negotiations for much too long. We must be clear that we are ready at literally 24 hours' notice to carry out the threats that NATO has made to bomb Yugoslavia if it is not prepared to reach appropriate conclusions in the negotiations. We must be clear that we are not going to commit ground troops until there is a political settlement. We should not send one soldier from the European Union or from NATO to risk his life unless we, as politicians, have delivered a political settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">In doing this, we must put particular pressure on the KLA. It has been very easy for the KLA to provoke the Serbian forces into inappropriate responses in order to win international sympathy. We must make it clear to the KLA that they can gain only if there is a political agreement which will give them a large degree of autonomy. Only then will we as a European Parliament sanction the sort of reconstruction effort that Commissioner van den Broek has indicated. We have to ensure that, in condemning the Serbian side, we are equally tough on the Albanian side and do not, out of sympathy for one side or the other, provoke a worse situation than exists at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must, I think, as Mr Wiersma has said, avoid the trap of constantly reciting history in this dispute. We have to look forward to a system of government that would allow the Balkans finally to be at peace, enabling economic reconstruction to go ahead and prosperity to be built for the future.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Imbeni </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, Commissioner, we thought of having this debate after the Racak massacre, but I do not really think we can make a major contribution today, with the Rambouillet Conference still going on. All the speeches we have heard have been interesting, but it is difficult for us to speak at a stage which is quite properly secret, as you said, Mr President. But not everything needs to be kept secret. Of course secrecy is right at diplomatic conferences but, for instance, the Council and the Commission could help the European public understand who is helping the combatants when fighting breaks out. Why do we always have to wait two, three, four, or even five years? Why do we only find out who is supplying the weapons by reading about it in the newspapers? Why do we not improve prevention, given that informing the public is a means of prevention? Having said that, I support the work the presidency has done. I think it is important for the European Union to take the initiative and demonstrate to the public that it has a greater political role than it had in the past, even though our humanitarian role, our aid for democratic development and our support for the growth of civil society remain the priorities. These are all extremely important, but they do not add up to actual political weight.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to condemn the European Union entirely, of course, because I think its role is on an upward curve. But the point I want to make is the same one as I made last time we debated the situation in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not dealing with a great area of peace, serenity, tranquillity, progress and economic development which just has one rather serious recurring problem of inter‐ethnic conflict. No, Mr President‐in‐Office, Commissioner, we are looking at a part of a larger problem. The strategic limitation of our operations – and I mean the operations of the European Union, the United States, Russia and all the other countries involved – is that we persist in looking at one piece of the mosaic, and forget that even if we were to succeed in finding a solution to the Kosovo problem, there would still be the Balkan question. That is the point. We need a Rambouillet which lasts for years, involving far more players. We need a standing conference with Albania, Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia and Bulgaria participating. I know that is very difficult, but we should be looking at the whole Balkan scenario, because the situation will not be resolved even if – and we hope it happens as soon as possible – a solution can be found for Kosovo.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span> <span class="italic"> Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want briefly to address three aspects that were brought up during this important debate. First: what can the European Union actually do? We should realise that we have neither the political nor the material capacity to resolve the Kosovo conflict by ourselves. It was necessary for various institutions, namely the Contact Group, the European Union, the OSCE, NATO and the United Nations, to work together in close coordination, which they managed to do, by using their great political prestige and all their energy, and that is a special achievement. Five different international levels had to be coordinated. That was the only way to create the necessary political, legal and military conditions for this initiative. And in fact all this was achieved in less than ten days. Mrs Pack rightly asked why nothing was done earlier. The question should really be handed back to her, because the government I represent here was not in office at the time. But I would have liked to see an earlier German Government ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling by Mrs Pack) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Yes, it was a German Government! I would have liked to see it put forward this initiative. So I do not know why it did not, but we are now in the present time. It has happened now because, as it turned out, the agreement the American special envoy Mr Holbrooke reached with Milosevic last autumn did not hold up because Milosevic did not keep to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make it quite clear again: the European Union was not in a position by itself even to provide the necessary military backup, to build up a credible military threat. It does not have a single soldier it could have used as a threat. So we should not just keep saying that the European Union has simply gone on making mistakes in Kosovo. You must realise that it is not exactly an easy task to get these institutions to work together, to keep the Russians and Americans in the same boat, to make the Contact Group effective. I could also make a few comments on the difficulties in the Security Council, on the need to gain Russia"s support; but most of that has already been addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I wanted to make is this: once an interim agreement has been reached, which is of course what Rambouillet is all about, it needs military backup. What I am talking about is the military backup for an agreed settlement. I am not talking about military intervention against the will of the warring parties. That is an entirely different matter. What we are seeking is an agreement now in Rambouillet, which would initially be a three‐year interim agreement. During that period it will certainly need the military backup of a SFOR‐type operation. A number of European states have already declared themselves willing to make ground forces available to that end, including the UK and Germany, but others too; so it is highly probable that we can set up a sufficiently large and also robust operation.</p>
<p class="contents">We must use the time between the Rambouillet agreement that we hope to reach and the expiry of the interim period to prepare a Balkan conference that will do what several speakers have called for, namely look at the overall picture and finally move away from a policy that focuses only on one issue and forgets that all these individual issues are interrelated.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the presidency"s intention – and this forms part of the EU initiative that the UK, France and Germany jointly put forward – that we work towards that conference with the aim of establishing stability, security and cooperation throughout the Balkan region. That is a very, very ambitious project.</p>
<p class="contents">We will only achieve it – and this is my third point – if we can define a clear and convincing strategic perspective for that part of Europe. I said this morning during the discussions I held with the Council of Europe on behalf of the presidency and I repeat it again: the situation we are facing is a confrontation between two different concepts of Europe. This Chamber here represents the Europe of the 21st century, the Europe of integration, of peace, of democracy, of human rights and therefore also, in the final analysis, of man"s prosperity and personal welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europe we see before us in Kosovo, in Bosnia and sadly also in other parts of Europe remains imprisoned in the atavistic attitudes of the 19th century. We must make it clear to those people that they have the choice of joining the modern, forward‐looking Europe of integration, or remain imprisoned in the conflicts, the blinkered attitudes, the nationalism of the 19th century, which can only result in misery, oppression and the loss of human lives. But we must at least make it clear to them that they have this choice. That means we must also be willing to offer the prospect of integration into Europe, and do so with all the institutions and instruments available to us. It is certainly a very long‐term prospect. I am speaking not of years but quite certainly of decades. But even the longest journey requires a first step. The time has come for us to take this step.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in fact confident; and as for all the business about secrecy in Rambouillet, well, those happen to be the rules. You know that and it would be naive to believe that we could have genuine negotiating results, interim results so early on, or that, if there were any, we could present them here. But let me put it this way: the fact that the delegations are still talking, that they have come in the first place, that there was no game‐playing at the outset – for example, we won"t sit in the same room, or so‐and‐so cannot participate, or we will only talk under such‐and‐such conditions – the fact that the negotiations have been going on since Sunday does suggest that the participants are looking to achieve results. In a few days" time the Contact Group will present its evaluation of the results so far; then it will be time to decide the further procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I would definitely contradict the speaker who protested because the negotiations were being put under such time pressure. A major component of the chosen strategy is to put the warring parties under the strongest possible pressure, which includes the pressure of time. I firmly believe that a negotiating approach that allowed the warring parties to play for time would fail. So there is a certain element of pressure, and it is very strong. You must remember that they were not prepared to come to the negotiating table in the first place; they only did so in response to a very strong and severe threat and ultimatum issued by the international community. Part of it was that the negotiations must produce results within a given time frame, which was deliberately made very short.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary I want to say that we Europeans may now have shown an improved ability to act in foreign and security policy. Mr Swoboda was right to say that it is an initiative in which the European Union has played a prominent role, which shows what we can achieve if we are creative and use our imagination.</p>

I have always spoken my mind to the gentlemen of the Council – and apart from once they have always been gentlemen – of whatever political persuasion they happen to be, without regard for party politics. If I have a complaint to make against the Council, I will do so, and you are now representing the Council for six months. Next time it will be a Finn, and I will not treat him with kid gloves any more than I do you. You are here not as a German minister, but as President‐in‐Office of the Council, so please do not be so touchy and do tell your people back home that we are not attacking the Germans here, but the presidency!</p>
