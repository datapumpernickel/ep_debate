Chea Vichea, a founder member of the party and president of the free trade unions, was shot on 22 January. He is the latest victim in a long series of killings. The absence of retribution for political assassinations is tantamount to an invitation to commit further atrocities. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats utterly condemns these assassinations but also condemns the slowness of criminal investigations. Cambodia needs vigorous political leadership. Its leaders must enact reforms that put an end to the continual violations of human rights. I also refer in this context to the country’s record on child prostitution and forced labour. For some time now there has been an agreement between the Cambodian Government and the United Nations on the establishment of a war-crimes tribunal. All that stands in the way of its creation is the ratification of the agreement by the Cambodian Parliament, and that must be done without delay. We therefore call for a UN delegation to be sent to Cambodia. We must help, and we want to help, so that a sustainable process of normalisation can take place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the elections the Cambodian population showed greater political and democratic maturity than was demonstrated by the country’s leading political forces. And incidentally, Mr Mann, not only politicians from the Sam-Rainsy party are being shot dead in the streets; my research has revealed that three members of the governing Funcinpec party have met with the same fate. In other words, rather rough customs prevail, and the normal rules of etiquette for dealings between Government and Opposition are not observed, which means that anyone who has made himself unpopular for whatever reason is in grave danger.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, in fact, the case that impunity continues to act as an incentive to eliminate unpopular politicians, whatever their origins, because the assassins do not have to face the consequence of their actions. Public trust in politics has been seriously damaged. Even on the odd occasion when a person is charged, nobody normally believes that he is the real murderer. As well as having a huge impact on morale in the country, this situation also severely restricts the flow of international aid. The Asian Development Bank does not intend to resume its payments unless the new Parliament, which was, of course, elected some time ago, is convened soon and a new government is formed.</p>
<p class="contents">This is actually the crux of the problem, and influence must be exerted to change the situation. At the time of the peace process, the UN specified that a two-thirds majority was required for a party or coalition of parties to form a government. Parties are now unwilling to assemble the broad coalitions that would fulfil this requirement. In practice, it has become a barrier to normal political life in Cambodia. This is where influence must be exerted to create political conditions that are truly conducive to improvement. This is the spirit in which the planned delegation should conduct its talks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Chea Vichea, trade unionist and member of the Cambodian opposition, was shot and killed on January 22, beside the road in Phnom Penh, in the middle of the day. So brazen was his killer, that passers-by mistook the bullets for firecrackers. Mr Vichea is the fifth member of the opposition Alliance of Democrats to have been murdered in 2004, and the latest victim of a year of violence. His funeral brought into the streets a crowd estimated at 30 000 strong. I know why, having met Mr Vichea last April and been deeply impressed by his commitment to democracy and good government and improving the lives of his fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Vichea was a founding member of the Sam Rainsy Party. He was a committed advocate of the rights of Cambodia's 200 000 garment workers. His killing, along with that of activists from the Funcinpec party, adds to a temper of political intimidation in Cambodia that is worsened by the failure of the caretaker government to respond to these murders. Whether the Cambodian People's Party is responsible for these killings or not, its persistent failure to apprehend and punish the killers leaves it accountable for the rising tide of fear in Cambodian politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Hun Sen's government continues to rule Cambodia without full legal and constitutional authority. It is imperative that a negotiated settlement be reached to enable legitimate government, yet negotiations cannot take place in the shadow of political murder, which sours attempts to construct a viable coalition and threatens to provoke retaliatory violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must condemn not only this killing, but also the climate of intimidation and impunity that Cambodian authorities allow to persist. Our resolution calls for the suspension of all non-humanitarian aid to Cambodia and for the European Commission to refuse to deal with Hun Sen's government. The EU should not do business with a government that fails to safeguard the lives of democratic leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we call on the Council to issue strong words of condemnation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is now the case with regard to Chea Vichea, the President of Cambodia’s Free Trade Union of Workers and a founding member of the Sam Rangsi party, for whom the main contribution of the European Union will be to salute his memory after his death. However, this trade union leader strove to defend the rights of more than 38 000 of those modern slaves of globalisation working in the textile industries of South-East Asia. The fact that the police or the Cambodian Government did not take action when threats were made against him is understandable, in the light of the collapse of the rule of law and of democracy in Cambodia. The fact that the integrity of such leaders of civil, trade-union or political society is not safeguarded by anything more than the dialogue between the European Union and that region of Asia which is going through severe political crisis is something that we should regard as a challenge. Is it really necessary to point out here that the assassination of Chea Vichea is merely the latest in a series of violent crimes against opposition figures and that 2003 was the most violent year since 1998? Is it necessary to add that none of these crimes has been the subject of any court judgment and that the perpetrators have consequently never been convicted. Against such a background, how can we celebrate the 25th anniversary of the fall of the despotic rule of the Khmer Rouge, when the martyred people of Cambodia are still experiencing such violence and terror?</p>
<p class="contents">The credibility of our European Union at international level and the emphasis it places on international law and democracy versus the use of force and <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span> makes it imperative that we should bring together the Cambodian political leaders and make them aware of the urgent need for political and economic reform and ensure that they face up to their responsibilities with regard to the fundamental rights of their citizens. The Cambodian Parliament must take up its duties again, and a serious agreement must be ratified, not a compromise which looks more like a masquerade between the UN and the Government, with a view to creating a special tribunal with responsibility for judging the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge. This is a project, incidentally, which has already been in preparation for five long years.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out, Mr President, that it is essential to put an end to the unacceptable, intolerable forced labour involving children, whether it is the children working on the Phnom Penh garbage dump, of whom we are all well aware, or those who are sold into prostitution, or those who are the victims of trafficking in human beings, thereby feeding one of the most vile of all networks. Although it is a matter of urgency, Mr President, that an ad hoc European delegation be sent to Cambodia as an initial measure, we must not forget that the fundamental duty of the European Union is to continue to provide permanent and voluntary assistance to Phnom Penh, side by side with all the people involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is balanced between the King and the political parties, there is a degree of balance between the parties – sometimes more, sometimes less – and the country is also trying to maintain a balance between various outside influences. A constant balancing act is, however, no recipe for long-term stability, which cannot be achieved unless the rule of law is firmly established. This is why paragraphs 4 and 6 of the resolution are of paramount importance. Straightforward prosecution, by due process, of the murderers and assassins who are threatening the very existence of democracy, and above all the long-overdue creation, together with the United Nations, of a special criminal court with a view to enabling Cambodian and international lawyers to work together in order to ensure that those who have committed crimes against humanity can finally be brought to justice and duly punished: in this way, after a bloody and turbulent past, the country can at long last find stability, underpinned by the rule of law, which will enable it to become an important partner of our European Union.</p>

I believe that since the elections in Cambodia the European Union, via the Commission in particular, has shown itself capable of taking a stand.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I believe that the situation is now extremely delicate and I agree with Mr Watson’s analysis. Although we do not know whether Mr Hun Sen and his party gave the orders for the enormous number of crimes which have been committed, we know that they have done nothing – neither they nor Mr Hun Sen’s Government – to arrest even one of the perpetrators of these crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">We also know that the Cambodia of today is no richer than the Cambodia of ten years ago, and that for ten years the European Union and the international community have poured millions and millions of euros into the country. Knowing all this, therefore, we should perhaps draw some conclusions from it. The person who has been unable to act as Head of Government in order to prevent crimes, to arrest the guilty parties and to bring even a minimum level of wealth to Cambodia is called Mr Hun Sen.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that if the Commission were to ask the Council to create a mandate to go and discuss the matter with the Americans, the Australians and the Japanese, with a view to making the removal of Mr Hun Sen the condition for the resumption of loans from the Asiatic Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, it would be possible to demonstrate, and to make the Vietnamese and the Chinese understand, as they already have done to a large extent, I think, that the problem of change in Cambodia can only be solved by the removal of Mr Hun Sen and the granting of a mandate to another member of his party, which did, after all, win the election, even if that election was not entirely democratic, indeed, far from it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I was very interested to go back and re-read the report of the European Union's election observation mission to the Cambodian national elections in July last year. In passing, let me say once again what an exceptionally important role these election observations missions play in the development of democracy around the world. The report noted that, compared with previous elections, the atmosphere was less tense and there were fewer violent incidents – although such incidents did occur.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerns remained during the pre-election period over the number of alleged political killings. As Mr Watson said, we have seen the killing of a number of those associated with Prince Norodom's party and we saw most recently the appalling assassination of Chea Vichea. I wholly endorse what has been said about the importance of his political role as one of the founder members of the Sam Rainsy Party and the importance of his role as a noted and brave trade union leader. I strongly condemn that assassination. I wholly support Parliament's call for a thorough investigation and for the prosecution of the perpetrators in accordance with the due process of law.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to take this opportunity once again to call on all political parties in Cambodia to continue to pursue negotiations which could lead to the swift formation of a new government. We all want to see the formation of such a government as rapidly as possible. Parliament rightly continues to take an active interest in the affairs of Cambodia and I will ensure that this interest is reflected in what I say to Council and in the work of the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
