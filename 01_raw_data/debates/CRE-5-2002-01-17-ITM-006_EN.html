<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cerdeira Morterero (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, I would firstly like to express my satisfaction – as you have just done – with the initiative of the United Kingdom, France and Sweden, which we are considering today.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and the existence of a European area of freedom, security and justice involve, in turn, the creation of an area without internal borders in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital must be guaranteed within the territory of the States of the Union, as laid down in Article 14 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. There can be no obstacles to the application of the law in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Tampere Summit called for the principle of mutual recognition to become the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal matters in the European Union. Trust between Member States in terms of their judicial decisions and their correct application is the least we must demand.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Member States must make a greater effort in order to achieve a minimum degree of harmonisation of national criminal legislations. Until now, the application of financial penalties was regulated by means of two European agreements: the Hague Convention of 1970 and the Convention on the implementation of foreign criminal sentences of 1991. I would like to stress that the former, despite having entered into force, had only been ratified by five Member States; and the latter, the 1991 Convention, has not even entered into force. This is undoubtedly a clear demonstration of the need for initiatives of this type with a view to accelerating and making a genuine contributing to the construction of the European area of justice which we agreed on in Tampere.</p>
<p class="contents">While various legal acts already exist in the civil field, in the criminal field – which is much more sensitive – there has been much more hesitation. To date, only decisions on arrests and the guaranteeing of evidence are based on the principle of mutual recognition. We still have a long road to travel and greater political will is required on the part of the Council in order to be able to fulfil the mandate of the Tampere Summit through the work prepared by the Commission, which often comes up against obstacles and little cooperation from the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative represents a significant advance in terms of eliminating these obstacles. Mutual recognition is undoubtedly a key element for the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice. Similarly, I welcome the legal instrument chosen: the framework decision, which will no doubt prevent the complexity and long duration of ratification procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to highlight the fact that, as in the conventions I have mentioned, it is based on the principle of dual criminality, and its absence is, therefore, one of the grounds for non-enforcement. The initiative proposes that a certificate by the competent authority should guarantee the legality of the judgement and hence replace examination of the substance of the case.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficult problem of how to divide up the proceeds between the two States concerned is resolved in Article 10 by allotting compensation payments and orders to pay court costs to the Issuing State and all other monies to the Executing State. I therefore welcome the initiative and largely concur with it.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider that a legal area as called for in Tampere requires the unbureaucratic transmission and enforcement of judgements in criminal cases and that this initiative is a first step towards a comprehensive application of the principle of mutual recognition. I particularly endorse the provisions relating to the law to be applied, alternative custodial penalties and the amnesty, pardon or commutation of financial penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support the scope for the Executing State to reduce the financial penalty as laid down in Article 5. However, I have considered it coherent to insert a threshold which, as in the agreement implementing the Schengen Convention, should be EUR 40, and I would like to emphasise that conversion of the amount of the penalties would be the exception as the currency in the Issuing and the Executing State would normally be the euro. I would like to stress that I personally consider EUR 40 to be a small and insufficient amount, but I have proposed this amount for the sake of coherence with the agreement implementing Schengen, which set that amount.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to insist on both issues, and ask the Council – which is not present today by the way – to take account of the sensitivity and proposals of this House and, in particular, of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and I therefore believe that the initiative must include the following in the framework decision:</p>
<p class="contents">A European legal area must be based on the principle of mutual recognition. Therefore, the mere harmonisation of legal instruments is not sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights sums up, for the first time in the Union’s history, in a single text, all of the civil, political, economic and social rights of the European citizens, and those of all the people who live in the Union’s territory. From now on, all of the Union’s legal instruments must be measured in relation to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the documents to be transmitted must be translated into all official languages of the Executing State. If the person liable to pay the fine or even go to prison knows only one of the official languages of the executing country he would not be able to read these documents affecting him, which would be an infringement of his rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is necessary that, in those cases in which the competent authority of the Executing State is not known, the contact points of the European judicial network should be used rather than designating additional central contact points.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the majority of the amendments have been tabled with the sole objective of improving the original proposal and contributing to compliance with the Tampere mandate, as well as adding one more element to the construction of a genuine area of justice, freedom and security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me to start my contribution in this full Chamber by explaining that my group considers it to be a positive development that a lack of boundaries does not lead to impunity. It will not be possible for a non-EU citizen to abuse his status in order to break laws or, for example, traffic rules. We will soon be agreed on this. The problem my group has is that the implications of this initiative of a few Member States, and the subsequent report, are not restricted to administrative penalties. Much more is at stake, including decisions through which those convicted may acquire criminal records. Serious allegations may even be involved since, in some countries, thanks to the day penalty system, custodial sentences can be exchanged for financial penalties. In those cases, therefore, what is at issue is the recognition of decisions in the field of criminal law.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 1 of the report rightly contains the following comment, and I quote: “This requires a knowledge of the legal systems of other Member States and mutual trust in the operation of the legal system.” and this is true. But how does one promote this trust, how does one examine whether legal systems are fair, and how does one guarantee citizens a minimum level of protection across Europe, for example in connection with the enquiry which precedes the sentence? Well, this brings me back to what I have been saying all along about drafting minimum standards in the field of penal and criminal procedures law. This is important now, and it will be no less important when enlargement is a reality. My group wholeheartedly supports these administrative penalties and the principle of criminal penalties, but not until we have formally established the basis for trust by means of the minimum standards. This is why my group proposes restricting this decision to these administrative penalties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Blokland (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, criminal law is closely related to the national identity of the Member States. National history and culture have given different tinges to criminal law systems. This is precisely the reason why we can see huge differences between the criminal law systems in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The open European area and growing international crime have shown that cooperation in this field is necessary in order to ensure that the Union remains an area of security and justice. After all, the European Council of Tampere subscribed to the principle of mutual recognition within the European Union in criminal matters with good reason.</p>
<p class="contents">The present proposal forms a first step in the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition. I welcome the initiative by the United Kingdom, France and Sweden to make a start on mutual recognition in criminal matters in this reasonably straightforward area. The proposal is quite simply designed. Theoretically, the principle of dual criminality applies, that is to say in both the Issuing and Executing States. The lack of this is a reason for the Executing State not to implement the sanction. Precisely because of the proposal’s simplicity, it might actually be far more effective than the international treaties have been so far.</p>
<p class="contents">Many in this Parliament would prefer a proposal to harmonise criminal legislation. They believe that harmonisation at European level would lead to more confidence in the criminal legislation of other Member States and in the application thereof. I doubt whether that is true. Confidence cannot be enforced from above by harmonising legislation. It is precisely in those cases where diversity can continue to exist, and is even considered to provide added value, that mutual trust can grow. And practical experience is often the best way of achieving this trust, or not, as the case may be. This is why this mutual recognition is the ideal tool for cooperating in this sensitive area. And it is true that mutual cooperation in the field of criminal law will take time in other areas due to the need for mutual recognition. But if it takes its time, this also means that trust has apparently not reached the required level. Wanting to force this trust by imposing harmonisation may well have the opposite effect.</p>
<p class="contents">In the main, the amendments of the Cerdeira Monterero report are practical improvements. I particularly support the rapporteur’s proposal that use be made of the contact points of the European judicial network and no new contact points set up. After all, this would unnecessarily complicate European judicial cooperation. I do not support Amendment No 3, where the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is added as a frame of reference for decisions by the Union. The Charter has, rather, the status of a political declaration and not that of a judicial frame of reference. The ECHR on the other hand, that has been signed by all the EU’s Member States, present and future, is legally enforceable. The suggestion made to the effect that the texts are on the same footing is incorrect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ludford (ELDR).</span></span>   – Madam President, we welcome this initiative as another small step along the road towards fulfilling the Tampere mandate to make the principle of mutual recognition the cornerstone of judicial cooperation. It is right that within a developing area of freedom, security and justice Member States ought to begin laying the foundations for establishing trust in each other's legal systems.</p>
<p class="contents">We need an EU legislative initiative to facilitate efficient cross-border cooperation and improve upon previous international legal instruments, which are often cumbersome and bureaucratic. Indeed, the 1991 Convention on the enforcement of criminal sentences – which otherwise would be relevant here – is not yet in force some ten years after it was signed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right for the EU to base cooperation on the concept of executing the decision of the issuing State, rather than that of deciding whether or not to grant cooperation in response to a request. The other international convention – the 1970 Convention – contains 13 grounds on which a request can be refused, so we can understand why the system does not work at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, many of us in this House are concerned not to allow the principle of mutual recognition to undermine the rights of the individual and in this field generally it is essential that the legal safeguards outlined not only in the European Convention on Human Rights but also, I would say to Mr Blokland, in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights – which ought to be legally enforceable – should be observed.</p>
<p class="contents">My group would certainly agree with Mrs Cerdeira Morterero that we should use the existing system of contact points in the European Judicial Network, as it is pointless to keep reinventing the wheel with different systems of contact points for various initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have a core problem here: people who care about civil liberties – and here I include myself – are put on the spot about agreeing to measures of mutual recognition without having a comprehensive programme to raise the standard of observance of individual rights. My group believes that we need a comprehensive approach to this, and we are very much looking forward to the Commission White Paper on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been reproached for agreeing to the European arrest warrant, while very strongly supporting individual rights. It is a challenge to all of us – Parliament, the Commission and the Council – to put in place those safeguards, because it is difficult to keep on agreeing until we have them. But my group believes that, with the Eurosceptics of the Right objecting to any cooperation in this field, we have to say that those of us who are not on the Right, who care about civil liberties, should agree to these measures but then put pressure on the Commission and the Council to have these citizens' safeguards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I too wish to offer my particular congratulations to Mrs Cederschiöld on her election as Vice-President of this Parliament. The Commission welcomes the initiative we are debating today of the United Kingdom, the Republic of France and the Kingdom of Sweden which seeks to guarantee the mutual recognition of financial penalties. It is worth pointing out that this issue was addressed in the Commission communication on the mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters, which we issued and debated here in the European Parliament in July 2000. The need for this specific instrument was identified in the programme of measures designed to apply the principle of the mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters adopted by the Council and the Commission in November 2000. I wish to thank Mrs Morterero, in particular, for her excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">As she quite rightly stated, there is no international instrument currently in place in all of our Member States for the application of financial penalties in criminal matters. There are only the two instruments to which the honourable Member referred, but one of them has never come into force and the other has only been ratified by five Member States. This means that what we are discussing today is the first European Union instrument in this field, which, I think, we also want to be ambitious. This instrument will implement the principle of mutual recognition through the application of cross-border financial penalties, thereby ensuring that there will be no safe havens in the Union for those who attempt to escape the application of financial penalties set by the competent authorities of the Member States. This instrument will strengthen the progress made in the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition by means of the Council’s approval of the Commission proposal on the European arrest order.</p>
<p class="contents">As Baroness Ludford has already said, the Commission is working on an initiative intended to identify the basic principles and criteria for the legal protection of European citizens’ fundamental rights in criminal matters. It is also worth pointing out, however, that we are not, in this field, working with a blank piece of paper: we are working within a legal framework which exists and which is – if I may say so – consolidated. All the Member States have signed up to and joined the European Convention on Human Rights, all the Member States have legal systems of criminal prosecution that are subject to the supervision of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, and all the Member States have jointly proclaimed, in political though not legal terms, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. These are legal and political instruments that enable us to establish a frame of reference within which we can implement the principle of mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission broadly agrees with the approach adopted in all of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur. We understand the basis of the proposal on setting a minimum threshold of EUR 40 for the principle to be implemented because, in some cases, unless there is a minimum charge of EUR 40, the costs of transfer and implementation would not justify the execution of the judgment. I fully understand the criterion of EUR 40, which has been imported, shall we say, from the Schengen Agreement. I simply wish to point out that the wording should be sufficiently careful as not to give the idea that we are allowing the mere fact that a border has been crossed to be a way of escaping criminal liability, even if this is, in financial terms, quite limited.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like, once again, to thank Mrs Morterero for the positive and innovative spirit of her report and express my hopes that this will be adopted by the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
