<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oomen‐Ruijten </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span><span class="italic">rapporteur. – (NL)</span> Madam President, it is quite some time ago that I was rapporteur on the general directive, the parent directive if you like, on distance selling to consumers. Financial services were a subject for distance marketing then as well. But the objections voiced at the time by the financial sector meant that we did not in the end get any uniform rules for the distance marketing of financial services. If I worked in financial services, I might now scratch my head and wonder if it might not have been better then to lobby in a different direction.</p>
<p class="contents">After lengthy pressure from Parliament, the Commission has now come up with an amendment to the general directive of 1997. I would acknowledge that the proposal now before us contains a number of provisions which take particular account of the specific nature of financial services. I should like to make one or two comments on this proposal, and I have to say that your rapporteur is not happy with the way in which the vote on the proposal went in the Legal Affairs Committee and in the Committee on Consumer Protection. It would be unprecedented for the rapporteur to refrain from expressing a point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy, however, with the amendments tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, for which Mrs Kestelijn was draftsman. Let us consider the proposal. In it, the Commission is opting for a maximum of harmonisation. Right from the start, I fully endorsed this idea of maximum harmonisation. If we want the single market to work as well as it possibly can, then in the fast‐developing area of new media like the Internet and e‐mail, all consumers must be entitled to the same high level of protection in every Member State, irrespective of where a purchase is made. To my mind, the often cross‐border nature of financial provision means that this is absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, a number of amendments were adopted in the Committee on the Environment which cause me considerable difficulty. I will also look at one or two other points, for example the question of the reflection period. When I drafted my report, I had numerous discussions with the financial services sector and with consumer organisations. I very quickly realised that the so‐called reflection period, Article 3 of the proposal, was not at all welcomed. If the provider has to hold a price for 14 days, that means unacceptably high financial risks which are certainly not in the consumer"s interest either. So the sector is very much in favour of scrapping the reflection period. The amendments now place the emphasis on providing information, and that too is consistent with the parent directive.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of amendments have been tabled, and overall my view as rapporteur is that Amendment No 47, tabled by my group, is actually the best one. The right of withdrawal, Article 4 of the Commission proposal, is subject to a number of very complicated conditions. In the interests of consumer protection and legal soundness, I think it is necessary to have a general right of withdrawal. But in order not to disadvantage the financial sector too much, the duration of that right must not be too long. The period of 14 days which I see the PPE Group is suggesting seems to me to get the balance right.</p>
<p class="contents">A third point is the derogation proposed for notaries public. The Commission proposal also seeks to protect the consumer against entering too hastily into agreements concluded by distance marketing. But if a notary assists in the conclusion of an agreement, I do not think you can claim that the consumer is being steamrollered here. So I do think that agreements concluded with the assistance of a notary can be exempted.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the problem of unsolicited communications. Communications to the consumer which he has not requested have to be controlled. The Commission does not really make a choice here. I am making a choice, and I favour the so‐called ‘opt‐out" system. Looking at the whole thing, I am bound to say that this should work. When we looked at the parent directive, I was all for having financial services included at any cost, but now I think that this has to be done in a proper manner. I hope that if things are not looking too good after the first reading, then in the second reading at least the consistent logic of your rapporteur will win the day in the plenary.</p>
<p class="contents" align="center">IN THE CHAIR: Mr MARTIN<br /><span class="italic">Vice‐President</span></p>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Berger </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a key theme in the debates in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has of course been whether we should go for the principle of maximum harmonisation proposed by the Commission or whether we should stick to minimum harmonisation for the time being. In the end, a majority was in favour of the minimum harmonisation approach. We agreed that it might be sensible to switch to maximum harmonisation in the foreseeable future. However, the starting point for this principle should not be the financial services directive itself. Instead, the directive on distance marketing of goods should be included in this right from the beginning. There is an urgent need to bring the two distance marketing directives into line with the directive on electronic commerce, as soon as we know what form it will finally take.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the need for such adjustments in the future, we should point the way now towards the healthy development of distance marketing of financial services in Europe – healthy for service providers and healthy for consumers. I therefore welcome the fact that the committee responsible shares my view that we should not have a reflection period, which is an absurdity in legal and practical terms, but that a general right of withdrawal should be introduced instead. However, what I do not agree with is the length of the withdrawal period, which is now 30 days in the committee's report. I feel that this is far too long and will above all make financial services more expensive for consumers. I think that 14 days as from the time when the customer has full knowledge of the contractual terms and conditions is adequate.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the list of exceptions to the right of withdrawal still needs to be added to. In particular, it should take account of mortgages and the contracts already mentioned by the rapporteur, 'contracts which have come into being with full notarial advice given to the consumer'.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor do I share the scepticism and anxiety about electronic communication which is evident in some amendments. A consumer who does not want to make use of it will not have to, and can continue to have personal contact with his bank and insurance company. But we should not make things too difficult for those people who do want to use these new facilities, by demanding that everything is duplicated on paper, for example. That is not the way to develop the enormous potential of distance marketing of financial services for business and for the consumer.</p>

Using the Internet, the provider can offer his services to clients across national borders without extra cost, and the consumer, without moving from his chair, can compare the services of different providers in both his own country and in others. Convinced of these benefits of distance selling, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted by 42 to 2 in favour of the following position.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, we are in favour of total harmonisation. If we want a real single market for financial services, consumers and providers must be guaranteed the same rights everywhere in the Union. We feel that a formal cooling‐off period puts unnecessary pressure on the consumer to make a decision within 14 days. It is enough for the provider to state clearly how long his offer will remain open.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee also favours a conditional period of 14 days during which the contract may be cancelled. And lastly, we believe that the consumer should be provided, at the time of the negotiation, with all the information he needs to evaluate the offer. We do not think it is a good thing to hand over the completed contract at this stage. This position closely reflects the original, balanced report of Mrs Oomen, who has indeed done an excellent job.</p>
<p class="contents">While the Environment Committee has approved a number of proposals aimed at significantly tightening up consumer protection, I do not believe that this goal will be achieved with a minimum directive, a 30‐day cancellation period and the exchange at the time of negotiation of a full and legally complex contract plus a summary. Proposals of this kind will merely discourage people from buying and selling services via the Internet, by fax and by post. Moreover, we wish to ensure that the consumer who makes a bank transfer or concludes a contract of insurance face to face and not by remote methods is not at any time less protected. On behalf of my group, I am therefore retabling a number of proposals by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in a slightly amended form, and I would commend these to the House.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Whitehead </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which Mrs Kestelijn‐Sierens has just referred to, stressed very strongly the need for consumer protection. In the great debate that occupies us tonight between minimum and maximum harmonisation, those who are arguing, as the Environment Committee did, for minimum harmonisation, are doing so not because they wish to stall the proceedings of the Internet but because they do not want to see in individual Member States consumer protection significantly diminished, as it might be, by the levels of information provided in the directive as it stands.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me, therefore, that the onus is on those who wish to see maximum harmonisation to put this case not merely in terms of what is good for the market and the single market but in terms of how the levels of information and protection can be raised in the subsequent stages of discussion of this proposed directive before it comes back for second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all open to persuasion on that issue but we simply do not believe at the moment that the case has been made. I have to say that to my own Member State government and to others who have taken that view. We believe that consumer protection is critical. It is not some ancillary add‐on element in this. I would say to those who argue on behalf of the expanded single market and its dynamism, look at the facts. A recent survey in the UK showed that 81 % of those surveyed never intended to use the Internet at all for commercial transactions. 50 % of those surveyed believed that they would be defrauded if they used the Internet. When you have that level of suspicion you have to address the point.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the amendments tabled by the Environment Committee have done precisely that. We have seen that the stress lies not with the reflection period – and it is right to scrap that – but with an unconditional right of withdrawal. We have tried to set terms and conditions within which that right of withdrawal is to be exercised. We have said not to the whiz kid consumer but to the marginal consumer who is nervous of the Internet that they can have a valid copy of the contract provided to them in a medium they can understand and which appears to them to have a measure of permanence.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of all, we have said that where some other elements have come in, they have to be addressed and recognised, and the way to do this is to do it piecemeal. To look at the problems that are raised, for example, by the distant selling of car insurance. Having listened to those who sell car insurance over the telephone, Amendment No 38 takes into account the fact that such a transaction must take place before the formal exchange of the durable contract. We accept that. We accept that there may be a problem with mortgages. But that is not to say that mortgages should be excluded from the directive, merely that one has to look at this problem again and see how it can be embraced within the overall context of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Oomen‐Ruitjen talked about notaries. They may, in translation, be a rather more solid profession than lawyers are in my country. It is said that one of the three great lies in the language is the phrase: ‘I am a lawyer and I am here to help you". The idea that in all circumstances the fact that you have a lawyer sitting by you guarantees you the normal minimum of consumer protection does not seem to be a satisfactory point to raise.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again we want to go here as far as we can for the absolute in consumer protection and information. We do that essentially because we accept that the Internet is an amazingly exciting form of bringing about new transactions – expanding commerce, industry and jobs within the Community – but never at the expense of individual consumers in any Member State in the Union and as far as possible protecting those not merely within the boundaries of the Union but beyond it as well.</p>

New technologies also contribute towards increasing consumer choice. Similarly, accessibility stimulates competition, thereby making our markets more efficient. This report is an important one, since it reinforces the internal market in financial services.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the proposal now before us means that the directive is more regulatory and creates more difficulties, rather than making matters simpler for the market players. We in the PPE Group therefore wish to reject the amendments tabled by the committee responsible. Instead, I would endorse the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, which is based on the Commission's original proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to protect consumers, but the legislators should not be allowed to forget altogether that unduly complex legislation raises prices for consumers and hinders trade between people in the market. The extra costs which this directive may create, if it becomes too complex and bureaucratic, will in the end always be imposed on the consumer. Consequently, I wish that the Environment Committee had listened more attentively to Mrs Oomen‐Ruijten, who – as usual where these issues are concerned – has weighed up the implications very carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards electronic commerce, I believe that the new technologies which offer us new sales and distribution channels really will revolutionise the markets. So we cannot afford to be cautious, even to the point of being hostile towards the new technologies. Instead, we should do everything possible to make it easy for them, since there really could be a consumer revolution that would drive down prices and provide alternatives. I therefore despair when I see the niggardly attitude displayed by some people towards the new ways of doing business. In my view, it is precisely in this sector that the European Union should be strengthening its competitiveness by accepting the new methods rather than obstructing them.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hyland </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, the aim of the proposal is to facilitate the sale by telephone, fax and Internet of financial services such as banking, insurance, investment and mortgages while at the same time protecting the consumer from fraud, high‐pressure salesmanship and certain unsolicited sales communications. I support the main thrust of this directive as we must strike a balance between promoting commercial enterprise and protecting European consumers at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no hesitation in saying that promotional campaigns by banks and other lending agencies are contributing in a major way to inflationary house prices, thus putting housing outside the affordability of young people wishing to set up their first home. This is something which the European Central Bank, in cooperation with the central bank in each Member State, should urgently examine.</p>
<p class="contents">The main provisions of this directive include the following: the consumer will have a 14‐day period before concluding a contract which will give that person time to compare various proposals and study the contract in detail before giving a final agreement; the consumer will have a 14‐day withdrawal period, 30 days for mortgage loans, life insurance and pensions, to renounce the contract without penalties and without giving reasons. This right may be exercised in only two cases: if the contract was signed before the consumer knew the contractual terms and conditions and if he was subject to unfair pressure during the reflection period. There is also a limitation of the suppliers' rights to payment if the consumer decides to withdraw after the beginning of the service payment. There will also be the implementation of an out‐of‐court complaints and redress procedure to settle disputes between the consumer and the supplier. There will be a ban on enforced sales, that is, the distant supply of unsolicited services.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly agree with some of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur, including the need for setting a deadline of seven working days for the supplier to return monies that have been received from the consumer. I believe that if this directive is to be effective it must be implemented sooner rather than later. An amendment has been tabled calling for the directive to be transposed into national law by 13 June 2001, instead of the Commission's own proposal of 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">I support this as a policy objective because one of the criticisms of European legislation in general is that it is just not implemented in time. Greater effort must be made by the European Commission, Parliament and the Council to implement European Union directives and regulations in as streamlined a manner as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I also welcome the fact that the Amsterdam Treaty was enacted three days ago and the European Commission has been given enhanced powers to bring forward legislation in the field of consumer affairs with particular emphasis on the protection of human health. I look forward to working closely with the Commission in ensuring that more EU regulations and directives on this subject are implemented in the near future.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Blokland </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, thanks to the single market and new electronic communications, it has become somewhat easier to buy and sell things in Europe using remote methods. For the consumer, sound guarantees and clearly agreed withdrawal rights are extremely important here. In some Member States, consumer safeguards are very good. In others, there is greater reliance on self‐regulation by the market. The subsidiarity principle requires us to see how these two approaches can best be combined. We can do that by setting minimum European standards and protecting the consumer in such a way that he is perfectly happy to buy financial services using remote methods.</p>
<p class="contents">The radical metamorphosis which the Oomen‐Ruijten report underwent in the Environment Committee is therefore quite proper. The maximum harmonisation presented initially by the rapporteur is not consistent with previous legislative proposals of the European Union. Directive 97/1 on general distance selling opts for minimum harmonisation. Under that directive, Member States are free to go further in safeguarding the consumer. If we now opt for maximum harmonisation, we shall be creating contradictory legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to point out a small inaccuracy in Amendment No 18. Directive 97/1 does not deal with the selling of financial services, but with distance selling. Perhaps we can check which directive is in fact being referred to in Amendment No 18.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bru Purón </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I support the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, even though our admired rapporteur does not fully agree with its content. However, I also have a number of comments to make regarding several of the points raised because everything is open to debate and can be improved upon. I shall refer to three amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall firstly refer to Amendment No 21 to Article 3. The right of reflection in my view should be abolished where there is sufficient information. What is more, the reference to the principle of good faith in commercial transactions is a timely one that can be related to the oldest and most unique example of good faith in civil law. However, the article contains a somewhat bland, if not dangerous, reference to minors. This is because minors are obviously protected by civil law not only in the part of the transaction based on honesty and good faith, but also because in civil law any transaction will be declared null and void if minors are not old enough according to the category of goods and transactions in question.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the other amendment, the famous Amendment No 22 to Article 4 on the right of withdrawal, I am also in favour of extending the 30‐day withdrawal period for some contracts, for instance the high‐risk contracts such as life insurance and pensions. The reference to mortgage contracts must also be qualified because, here again, we must bear in mind that 11 or 12 of the Member States give better mortgage credit protection through deeds and registration at a land registry, so it must be stressed that this text refers to a precontractual phase. According to the majority of Member States" legislation, there can be no contract without deeds and registration. Therefore, given that here the form is <span class="italic">ad substantiam</span> , it is not possible to talk in terms of mortgages, contracts or even credit.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I welcome the reference made to credit cards, because they have certainly been the subject of widespread abuse. In my view, the amendment relating to them, Amendment No 25, should be stringently applied since they are commonly abused through the use of the card number alone without a signature. We must therefore be very strict on this point.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Palacio Vallelersundi </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, since it is difficult to introduce new ideas at this stage of the debate, perhaps the best thing would be to sum up what has been said so far. Market globalisation and the spread of new communication and information technologies have undoubtedly given rise to the economic and social changes that are revolutionising the way in which markets serve consumers; they have also transformed the consumers" expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to urgently adapt our Community policies to these changes, particularly those changes that affect marketing methods. It is true that we should make greater use of the methods on offer through the Internet for carrying out commercial transactions and accessing financial services, a sector where consumers are currently proving to be more reluctant. Mr Whitehead provided us with some interesting figures, and there is no doubt that the use of the Internet in this type of transaction should become even more widespread. What is more, Mr Whitehead, the expression ‘never, never, never at the expense of the consumer" certainly rings true.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, however, I should like to tell the Commission about a recent piece of work that refers to the future policies and that is quite excellent. It states that in order for consumers to play their new role in Community policies to the full, they must understand the interdependency of their interests and other interests that also need to be protected. In other words, in making people aware of their rights, they must also acknowledge their responsibilities. This stems from the fact that we live in a Community of law in which Community responsibilities are conferred. As a result, we would be doing the consumer a disservice if, through a sectoral directive, we began to disrupt the balance of the highly complex relations between Community law and the Member States" law, and the principle of subsidiarity has been mentioned in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bru Purón referred to something that he knows a great deal about as a notary, namely mortgage credit. To follow on from what he said, it seems to me that we must bear in mind that the European Union currently has several systems of legal traffic concerning property and registration, or advertising registration it might be said. However, without doubt, one of the characteristics that must be maintained, for example in Spain, is the binding nature of the constitution and mortgage registration which cannot be subject to any right of withdrawal.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember, however, that the rules governing mortgage credit are subject to the power of the courts where the asset is located. In this connection, we must give consideration to Article 16(1) of the 1998 Brussels Convention, which Community law must clearly respect, and indeed, this is something Mr Whitehead should respect for the benefit of consumers" interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, I must digress a little as you seem deeply mistrustful of lawyers, and I disagree entirely with you. I would therefore like to stress that the European building is a legal structure, a structure in law, and if we do not rely on lawyers and, in general, those who work with the law to bridge the gap between the rules and social reality, European integration will fail.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, Mr President, Community law must be respected. I personally would prefer a medium degree of harmonisation, or even basic ideas on harmonisation, which will improve and be complemented with time, rather than maximum harmonisation.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bonino, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, from listening to the rapporteur and all the speakers I have seen how important this directive is. This is very positive, because we have come a long way and, as you will all remember, not everybody was convinced that there was a need for a directive on financial services. The people who are concerned with the consumers' interests will remember the distance selling debate in this House and whatever divisions still exist – and there is still time and room to find some convergence – we have made good progress in establishing some basic rights for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">I just wish to refer briefly to the three main points I noted during the debate. Firstly, the most controversial one: the level of harmonisation. There are amendments which introduce an approach of limited harmonisation of the provision introduced by this directive, leaving Member States scope for maintaining or introducing more stringent provisions. So there are amendments which call for minimum harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed that the provisions of the directive should be fully harmonised. This is set out clearly in recital 9 so, from this point of view, Amendment No 57 can be considered superfluous but, nevertheless, it reiterates the point. The reasoning was that financial services, due to their immaterial character – there is nothing to wrap up in paper – are perfectly suited for distance marketing. Adding to this the cross‐border perspective of the introduction of the euro, it seemed particularly important to establish a common framework for marketing through these techniques. This would be to the benefit of both business and consumers. I repeat the principle: we strongly believe that the right of consumers must be seen in perspective in relation to the rights of other sectors. But our proposal seems to us to be to the benefit of both business and consumers because both parties would know which rules apply and both parties can be confident that the same marketing rules apply, no matter where the services come from. That is a very important point for confidence‐building, which can be profitable for both consumers and business. In view of this argument, the Commission has concluded that at this stage it will maintain its proposal for full harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall just refer to two other points which have been raised in the debate. One is information in advance and the other the general right of withdrawal. As far as information in advance is concerned, the amendments concern information to consumers in advance of concluding a contract and the amendments reject the concept of a right of reflection based on a draft contract as introduced by the proposal for a directive. The Commission can accept the principle established in Amendment No 21 of providing to the consumers in advance of the conclusion of a contract additional or summarising information as a cover of the full contractual terms and conditions. However, this principle must take into account the interaction between this horizontal directive and the vertical directives on financial services that include provision of information. Consequently, the Commission cannot simply take over the amendments as drafted. In particular, we must stress that the principle of information in advance must be applied so that information offered provides added value to the information provision already foreseen in the vertical directives. Otherwise it is useless.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly it must avoid overlaps with the existing information provision and, finally, it must be clear beyond doubt which provisions apply or prevail in case of similarities between provisions in this directive and provisions in the vertical directive. So Amendment No 61, which introduces a right to waive the right to obtain information in advance means the Commission, must reject Article 11 as it establishes that consumers may not waive the rights conferred on them by the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the general right of withdrawal. If we reject the right of reflection, that leads naturally to putting the emphasis on a general right of withdrawal as provided for in these amendments. The guiding principle of this amendment is to align this proposal with the rules of the general directive. Again, the Commission accepts the principle but it needs to review the implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">I just wish to mention two questions which remain open at this stage: the duration as well as the scope and extent of any exemption. I will not elaborate in detail. I have already spoken too much about the amendments. At this stage the Commission wanted to give some ideas and reflection on the three major items you have been debating and certainly we will be looking forward to the final result of the vote on this.</p>
