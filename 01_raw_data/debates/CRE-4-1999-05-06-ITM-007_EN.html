<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gebhardt </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that my last speech of this parliamentary term contains some good news. The directive establishing a mechanism for the recognition of qualifications in commercial, craft‐related and industrial trades is out of the woods. We can approve the outcome of the detailed conciliation discussions between Parliament and the Council with a clear conscience. Even though the European Parliament has not entirely succeeded in securing acceptance of the decisions it had adopted by large majorities at the first and second readings, we have nevertheless achieved our main objective.</p>
<p class="contents">This primary objective was to ensure that a vocational qualification obtained in one Member State of the EU is equally valid in the others. That will be the case in future, even though our proposal on aptitude testing suffered a few knocks. The important point, however, is that we have done something for the freedom of those in commercial, craft‐related and industrial trades in the European Union to obtain employment and set up businesses in any Member State. The directive will not trigger a flood tide of new migrants, but it is a particularly valuable mechanism for young people. In a situation in which high unemployment weighs more heavily on us than almost any other problem, fair distribution of the existing work assumes enormous importance.</p>
<p class="contents">In the third directive on the recognition of qualifications, we are contributing to the fair distribution of work. Newly qualified people in particular, who have no family ties to impede their mobility, can go where their labour is required. They need not stay in the place where they have learned their trade if their skills are not currently in demand there. I believe that, for the sake of strengthening the civil rights of freedom of movement and freedom of establishment, we can endure a tinge of disappointment. The slight disappointment is that, in the host countries, migrants will not always be free to choose between an aptitude test and an adaptation period as a means of proving their knowledge and occupational skills.</p>
<p class="contents">As a parliament, we wanted this freedom to be granted unreservedly to those qualified in commercial, craft‐related and industrial trades. We took the view – and we stand by it – that all migrants will know how they can best prove their aptitude. Any restrictive set of rules is a superfluous bureaucratic obstacle, in our eyes. The Council sees the matter differently, and we had great difficulty in moving it towards the ultimate compromise during the long and arduous negotiations. It was quite obviously under heavy pressure from representatives of craft and trade federations, which would evidently prefer to revive the medieval guild system. That, at least, we were able to prevent, but we did not achieve our aim.</p>
<p class="contents">The parliamentary delegation followed a consistent line at the negotiations but showed itself willing to compromise when the need arose, and this approach was successful in saving our Council interlocutors from a headlong rush into the past. I do not suppose that the Council will show its gratitude at the next opportunity by adopting a more flexible approach, but I am certain that this Parliament will accept what we have done for young people and their vocational development. A large majority would serve as a signal to those young people that we intend to act quickly to improve their vocational prospects through this third directive on the recognition of qualifications.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Caudron </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mrs Gebhardt, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights and, more specifically, our colleague Mrs Gebhardt, for the excellent work that they have all done and the determination they showed during the conciliation procedure. The negotiations with the Council were certainly not easy, but despite this they ended in a compromise which I personally think is quite satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">In this area it must be recognised that, although progress has been made over the last thirty years in moving from sectorial directives to more general horizontal directives – in particular the key directives of 1989 and 1992 – there was, and there still is, a great deal of work to be done. I therefore obviously support the proposals aimed at repealing the sectorial directives, which were supposed to be temporary and have often continued longer than necessary, resulting in serious restrictions to the freedom of movement and freedom of establishment of European citizens across the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the more general system of recognition of qualifications, I am also in favour of improving and consolidating the system, because although in theory the level of recognition of qualifications is satisfactory, it is not exercised sufficiently in practice. European citizens are too often faced with problems when they try to have their qualifications recognised, and they are often refused employment because of supposedly insufficient qualifications. As a Member representing a border region, I am in a position of having to deal with these problems almost daily, in Belgium and in France.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to say that these are serious problems, because they are damaging to the very idea of citizenship. It is impossible to convince Europeans that European citizenship exists if they are daily being denied a fundamental right, the right to employment. This is why, Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again, and to take note of the progress that has been made, but to say that in this area too, our battle is far from over.</p>

Cooperating very harmoniously, not least with Mrs Fontaine, who chaired the conciliation meetings, she managed through a very astute approach, a firm hand and indefatigable persistence to make this compromise possible. That was indeed a fine piece of work.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone who attended those meetings was able to see at first hand how difficult it is to move the Council even a fraction of an inch. Our rapporteur's achievement was truly prodigious. As has already been emphasised, the crux of the matter is freedom of movement in the Community. This freedom would effectively be a joke if migrants could not practise their trade or profession in the country to which they have chosen to move. At the same time, it is a matter of ensuring that freedom of movement is not restricted to unskilled labour; on the contrary, the success of the common market and the people who work in it depends on a high standard of exchange among the Member States. That is the core of the directive now before us.</p>
<p class="contents">Qualifications should be obtainable and usable. The way that this should happen was what we ultimately managed to find. What we found was not a perfect solution, but, as has rightly been said, a tenable compromise that provides a common path for all to follow. My group is therefore happy to endorse the report and will vote for it. Thank you once again for all your work.</p>
