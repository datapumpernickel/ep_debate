<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, like the other institutions of the European Union, the Commission has, as you can imagine, been following, the development of events in Côte d’Ivoire very closely since the military uprising began on 19 September. The Union has condemned the threat to institutional legality that Côte d’Ivoire has been experiencing for almost three weeks. At the same time, it has reaffirmed the need to find a political solution that would not exclude any of the opposing parties, in the spirit of the process of national reconciliation which Côte d’Ivoire opened after the serious unrest of 2000 and which the Union supported in principle and with financial support. Thirdly, the Presidency has reiterated that the Union attaches the utmost importance to respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports President Gbagbo and his legitimate government, both put in place<span class="bold"> </span>by democratic elections. Nevertheless, since the publication of the Union declaration on 24 September, we have not denied that growing concerns have appeared both on the prospect of a political solution and with regard to human rights. The Commission naturally welcomed with great interest the outcome of the summit<span class="bold"> </span>of the Economic Committee of West African States in Accra. The creation of a contact group consisting of six Heads of State, and charged with the task of mediating between the government and the rebels led us to believe that a peaceful solution could be reached that would avoid bloodbaths and lasting rifts that fighting on the ground would inevitably entail. This work must have support. The agreement in principle to a cease-fire given to the contact group by President Gbagbo and by the rebels would allow for a certain optimism in putting a cease-fire in place, although nothing had been signed on 4 October. For the time being there has been nothing and government forces resumed fighting against the rebels at Bouaké on Sunday 6 October. The group of mediators, whose alertness, patience and sense of responsibility incidentally we salute, has not concealed its great disappointment and irritation at the Ivorian Government and its behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point of the Union’s declaration of 24 September, with regard to which concerns are again growing, is respect for human rights by the two opposing parties. First of all, the behaviour of the rebels has deteriorated and is still deteriorating more and more, particularly with regard to attacks on property. As for the government, attacks on members of the opposition and signs of xenophobia are increasing to the point where they are becoming very worrying. The circumstances surrounding the death of General Gueï and his wife, members of his family and close relations are suspicious to say the least. Attacks and intimidation against Mr Ouatara, his close relations and many leading members of his party (Rally of the Republicans) will have a lasting negative effect on the process of national reconciliation. Hostility towards foreigners is also becoming increasingly widespread.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, do not misunderstand these reminders. Institutional legality in Côte d’Ivoire must be subject to wholehearted support from the international community. This wholehearted support must not, however, be indiscriminate or unconditional.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, allow me to conclude by expressing the hope that your institution, by virtue of the prestige in the eyes of the Ivorian authorities, uses its influence to convince them, as the Commission is striving to do, that a peaceful solution is the only way forward that is logical and which offers hope. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to work on the basis of the French version and I just hope I get it right.</p>
<p class="contents">It is tragic that once again we find ourselves standing in this Chamber talking about yet another war in sub-Saharan Africa. It is absolutely right that we voice our displeasure at such an action having taken place. It is true to say that the election was disappointing and that we had hoped for better results. It reflected on the problems of Ivoirian birthright – as to whether you should be allowed to stand as a president if you were born in the country or if your parents were Ivoirian.</p>
<p class="contents">We should always remember, however, that everything concerning our relations with these developing countries is based on the Cotonou Accord. That, of course, gives us a basis for democracy, human rights and good governance. Quite honestly, good governance to me is almost more important than pure democracy because if you can get a stable country that is transparent in its doings then that is a big step.</p>
<p class="contents">Côte d'Ivoire is a huge country with enormous potential and is one of the lynchpins in West Africa. This was very much an internal power struggle. There are those who blame outside influences or rebel groups from other nations, but this was a pure power struggle within the nation itself. It was an issue of people wanting to take power simply as a domestic issue. The problem is much the same as that experienced by Nigeria in that there is a very strong Muslim presence in the north of the country, and a Christian one in the south. There is always a vying between these two groups. As it happens, the Muslims in the north tend to be the poorer of the two groups. The Commission should focus aid onto this area to benefit the Muslims who have not got the wealth of the south.</p>
<p class="contents">I was in Ghana two weekends ago when the ECOWAS meeting of the 14 West African states took place. They discussed the situation in the Côte d'Ivoire. There was real doom and gloom amongst the representatives and leaders of those countries. When things go wrong in a country of that size, it not only destabilises Côte d'Ivoire, it very much destabilises that whole region. Therefore I was delighted that at least the ECOWAS leaders had the foresight and sense to intervene in the situation in Côte d'Ivoire and send a delegation there in the hope that it could mediate between the two parties.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that they are successful because there are problems arising in Nigeria where exactly the same situation exists. That country has a strong fundamentalist Muslim north and a Christian group in the south.</p>
<p class="contents">With the way the Commission is now moving towards regional policies, it is absolutely vital that we get these countries to understand that if they are going to be able to face global prospects as far as trade is concerned, they must pull together as a region. Therefore it is vitally important that they support each other.</p>
<p class="contents">The one disappointment was that NEPAD, the new African partnership on development, has not reacted more strongly in this situation. Written into that new agreement was a peer review. I had hoped that when a problem like this arose, the Heads of States in African countries in that organisation, which has been set up by Africans to look after Africa, would have immediately stepped in. But unfortunately, as with the Zimbabwean situation, they have not done so. If this organisation has not fallen at the first fence then it has certainly stumbled. I sincerely hope preparatory talks can take place as soon as possible because only around a table can we bring this conflict to an end without the death and destruction that usually happens.</p>
<p class="contents">All I can do is ask the Commission to press both parties to stop warring and come together for discussions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Carlotti (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, since the coup d’état on 19 September, the whole of the northern territory of Côte d’Ivoire has been plunged into confused military conflict. Military operations are being carried out even as I speak and fighting is raging in Bouaké, leading us to fear the worst for the civil population caught up in the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we fear for the people of Côte d’Ivoire who have been taken hostage by factions and who are paying for this crisis with their freedom and, in some cases, their lives. We fear for Côte d’Ivoire, which is in danger of becoming further removed from the model for which it is so often admired. Today, Côte d’Ivoire and its society are being torn apart, and we fear for Africa and the African people for the whole region may collapse, and this is a region which has already seen too many wars and human tragedies and where armed gangs are rampant and trafficking of all kinds is rife – these are both distressing everyday realities. This is an outcome which does not, in fact, seem too far removed from the current instability in Côte d’Ivoire. If Côte d’Ivoire becomes destabilised, this will lay the foundations for a crisis similar to that in the Great Lakes region or in the Congo, which have for many years been devastating the heart of the continent. We are concerned by this crisis, and we are saddened by it. We are also surprised by it too, however. It is happening at the very time when the efforts made by Laurent Gbagbo’s regime to deal with two of the country’s greatest challenges were paying off. The first challenge is national reconciliation and, to promote this, a broad forum was organised in 2001 and a government of national union was formed, bringing together the major political forces following the elections in July 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The next challenge is economic and social revival, promoted through fundamental social reforms such as free schooling or health insurance for all citizens. In order to make further progress on these fronts, however, Côte d’Ivoire needs peace. Europe must exert pressure to bring about a negotiated solution and a peaceful resolution to the crisis. It must make every effort to mediate and must welcome the actions carried out under the aegis of the ECOWAS. These attempts have so far failed, but it is indeed difficult to ask a legitimate government to negotiate as equals with armed rebels. The challenge now is to preserve the unity of the whole territory of Côte d’Ivoire whilst respecting constitutional law. We must be particularly careful to ensure that, if an intervention force is sent to Côte d’Ivoire, this does not lead to a <span class="italic">de facto</span> division of the country. The Socialist Group also supports the idea of sending a parliamentary mission – I am addressing my fellow Members here – to give our support to the democratically elected institutions and to go and meet with the various political forces in Côte d’Ivoire.</p>
<p class="contents">In order, however, to help democracy take root in Côte d’Ivoire, President Gbagbo must very swiftly take the initiative of launching negotiations with all the political and social forces in his country. Negotiations must, in particular, focus on the constitutional bottlenecks which are acting as a brake, slowing down national reconciliation. The 2000 Constitution does not fulfil this requirement, it does not allow all the different political positions to express themselves and it once again and still prevents Mr Ouatara from standing as presidential candidate. It does not provide for the possibility of dissolving the National Assembly in the event of major crises, and this may leave the way open for an extremely violent political reaction.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, President Gbagbo must resume dialogue in order to pursue an unqualified and unambiguous effort to achieve national reconciliation, which is essential for a country that has been torn apart for many years by the manipulation of the concept of Ivorian birthright, almost 30% of whose population is made up of foreigners. In this respect, the call for the expulsion of 500 000 inhabitants originating from Burkina Faso, broadcast last Sunday on Côte d’Ivoire national television, is an unacceptable abuse and must be vehemently condemned, in the same way that the attacks on foreigners who live in the country must be vehemently condemned.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, today, Côte d’Ivoire and the legitimate government of Laurent Gbagbo need the firm support of the European Union that you have outlined and which I shall promote very firmly and in every possible way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also note with interest that the Commissioner made specific reference to the RDR, which is the Liberals’ sister party in Côte d’Ivoire. We have attempted to maintain contact with the party, but recently, of course, that has not been possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very disappointed at the part the EU has played in this matter. In April, I asked the Council what measures were being taken to aid the functioning of the National Reconciliation Forum and what measures were envisaged for monitoring the elections in June 2002. At that time, it was said that the EU certainly was concerned about the fact that the 2000 elections were characterised by violence, infringements of human rights and exclusion of some major political parties, and talks were held pursuant to Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. The talks were, however, brought to a close in June 2001, and it was not thought possible to make any particularly significant contribution to the supervision of the elections, or to provide support, or to play an active role.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people in the region are suffering because we remained passive and did not take a more active role. This is a shame, because this is an area in which the EU could have been active, and we were aware of these issues. We are concerned about the troubles spreading out in the region. As usual, there is a great risk that women and children will bear the brunt of the suffering. We know that the position of children in Côte d’Ivoire is not as it should be.</p>

It is natural to support a politician for whom prison, exile and suffering have marked the thirty-year long struggle for his ideas. In two years, he has restored to Côte d’Ivoire a minimum rule of law, revitalised the education system, gained the trust of the international institutions and above all, provided conditions for national reconciliation by forming a government made up of all the opposition parties, and I would point out to Mrs Thors that the RDR <span class="italic">(Rassemblement des Républicains)</span> party entered the government in August 2002. Parliament invited President Gbagbo to Strasbourg in November 2001 – Nicole Fontaine invited him – and, in doing so, wanted to acknowledge the work carried out by this humanist professor and leader. We must help him because he symbolises republican legality, because he symbolises political change in an Africa that is greatly in need of it, because he is the symbol that Africa is anchored in a modern democracy. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, a ceasefire is needed, but on the condition that the rebels surrender their weapons. No constitutionally elected president can negotiate with armed rebels that occupy 40% of his country. The European Union must help in the general reconstruction of the country, which will involve the development of the rule of law, a programme of social housing for the most deprived, and the reorganisation of the Côte d’Ivoire army.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, if Côte d’Ivoire falters, the whole of West Africa will be permanently destabilised, it will be plunged into chaos, and there will be terrible risks of ethnic and religious clashes. We must therefore, as part of an active diplomatic effort, send a parliamentary mission, and this is what we shall begin working on, Madam President, as of tomorrow. As Commissioner Barnier wished, quite rightly and quite appropriately, this parliamentary mission must be able to arrive within three days in Abidjan and it must strive, on the basis of the resolution that we shall vote upon tomorrow, to play a role and provide Parliament with a role to play. It is no good arriving when the crisis is over. We have an essential responsibility towards this country, its president and the people of Côte d’Ivoire. They need our solidarity, Madam President, in the terrible ordeal they are going through, and the European Parliament must therefore have a presence and its presence must be firm. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rod (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, recent events, marked by a number of assassinations in Côte d’Ivoire, are extremely worrying. The military uprising against the current official government is unjustifiable, despite the worsening economic and political conditions. The unprecedented economic crisis, related to the fall in the price of raw materials, and particularly of coffee and cotton, has caused further hardship and poverty in the country. It is also clear, however, that the lack of respect for the concept of Ivorian birthright, which came to a head during the presidential elections in 2000, has served only to intensify the climate of hate and violence in the country, and the accusations that neighbouring countries are supporting the rebels could be used to justify the persecution of the immigrant civilian populations.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we must welcome the statement made by President Gbagbo which calls for foreigners to be protected. It should also be taken on board by his troops. The risk of an outbreak of xenophobia among civilians is indeed great. We must avoid being caught up in a civil war between ethnic groups, a crisis situation similar to that in the Congo, which would be extremely dangerous and regrettable for Côte d’Ivoire and all its inhabitants. Therefore, although we may lament the failure of mediation efforts by the ECOWAS which proposed the resumption of negotiations between the government and the rebels, the intervention forces should not impose an actual division of ethnic groups on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must support the legitimate government in order to restore the rule of law and to protect the civilian populations, of all ethnic origins. In the longer term, a committee of enquiry should be set up in order to discover the causes of these events and to condemn those responsible. The European Union must ensure respect for the principles of human rights, of democracy and of political pluralism, but also, and this is crucial, encourage the economic and social development of Côte d’Ivoire. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first obvious fact is that Côte d’Ivoire is one of the States that deserves our most vigorous support, as it is showing numerous encouraging signs: its level of growth stands at 3%, it is making relatively rapid progress towards democracy, illustrated by the presidential elections that have been universally welcomed as a step forward, it has a process for forming political groupings in place which, following the forum for national reconciliation, should lead to fully democratic legislative elections, and the current government must be instructed to arrange these as soon as possible. Yes, Côte d’Ivoire and President Gbagbo deserve the support of all the European States that are concerned about links with Africa. I do not understand how we can hesitate, unless we are trying to make things worse before they can get better or we are allowing ourselves to be carried away by a feeling of indifference to which I fear many Europeans are certainly tempted to give in but which is unacceptable to France.</p>
<p class="contents">The second obvious fact is that Côte d’Ivoire is in not facing a civil war. It is simply battling with a foreign invasion which, although it exploits the age-old oppositions between ethnic groups, as usual, is primarily a matter for geopolitical analysis. The so-called insurgents are obviously armed, and powerfully so, by one or more foreign powers. An analysis of the situation must not, therefore, be based on ethnographic conclusions, and even less on humanitarian lamentation, but on geopolitical factors.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the third obvious fact, which is crucial but, for this reason perhaps, is too often eclipsed, since it is true that the ignorance – or lack of perception – of this House in geopolitical matters is evident in so many areas. Today, Africa is, out of all the continents, the one which is the most immune to the influence of the global empire. This is due to historical reasons relating to the links that several European nations have forged with Africa and, consequently, due to the fear, which has often stopped Washington, that any destabilisation of regimes would bolster the Soviet Union. However, since the collapse of the Russian power, the empire has been trying to extend its influence over this continent, which is both the richest, potentially at least, and, sadly, the most vulnerable of all. We tried to do this several times in Equatorial Africa – formerly under Belgian control – and extended these efforts to the neighbouring countries of the Gulf of Guinea, which has such substantial oil reserves. We are now benefiting from the ambitions of a personality of uncertain nationality, who, in any case, spent most of his life in the United States, to destabilise a country whose situation has been growing stronger with each passing year and which, as a result, became a major partner of Europe. It is this connection, it is this link that some want to destroy.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we must be firm regarding the true interests of Europe. France has the courage to do this. The support that it is giving to the official, democratic government of Côte d’Ivoire must be shown by all Europeans together, because what France is doing in Africa, it is not doing for itself but for the whole of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Behind it stretches a long history of political, economic and, above all, ethnic stand-offs that continually interweave and reinforce each other. The motion for a resolution that is before us overlooks, whether knowingly or unknowingly, the responsibilities of the current leaders. Côte d'Ivoire is the world's largest producer of cocoa and one of the most important producers of coffee. The country accommodates nearly 5 million immigrants, mainly from the neighbouring countries Burkina Faso, Mali and Senegal. In times of economic boom, they are deployed as cheap labour; during a political and economic crisis, they are the scapegoats <span class="italic">par excellence</span>. The xenophobic campaign in the state media was nourished by President Gbagbo's accusations that Burkina Faso was at the root of the mutiny, without there being a shred of evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people in the north of Côte d'Ivoire originally come from Burkina. They have the feeling that they are now being treated as second-class citizens, particularly since their leader, Mr Ouattara, was barred from taking part in the presidential elections on account of his alleged Burkinan roots. Together with Mr Ouattara, the peoples in the north felt excluded from the political system. This is the core of the problem. Côte d'Ivoire has been broken as a nation by the political misuse of religious differences and of the concept of <span class="italic">Ivoirité.</span></p>
<p class="contents">The international community has made a huge effort to evacuate French subjects and 200 children of American clergymen. I hope that it will display the same level of commitment to prevent even more victims from falling among the civilian population and to prevent the instability in Côte d'Ivoire from degenerating into a regional conflict, the effects of which are incalculable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having listened to their comments very carefully, I would also like to thank the various speakers, virtually all of whom have, in general, simply demonstrated that, with regard to this serious issue, we have a common view of the situation and of the ways to resolve it. The House and all of the Union institutions are concerned, not only by the serious and damaging internal consequences that the current crisis situation in Côte d’Ivoire may have, but also by the destabilisation – as several speakers have said – that the crisis could cause throughout the whole region if a peaceful political solution is not found in the very near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday’s televised speech by President Gbagbo calling for an end to the conflict leads us to hope that this peaceful solution will be found very soon in order to prevent unrest in the country and the whole region, which many, including ourselves, fear will happen.
