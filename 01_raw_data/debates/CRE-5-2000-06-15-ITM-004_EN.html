<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Turco (TDI), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has examined the Commission’s 10th annual report on the Structural Funds regarding the implementation of operations during 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, the sound and efficient implementation of the Structural Funds is of fundamental importance for the credibility and effectiveness of the Community institutions, in particular the European Parliament, considering its monitoring functions.</p>
<p class="contents">Our report, which was adopted unanimously, takes note of the fact that all the resources available for 1998 were fully taken up but it also records that there are still considerable divergences in implementation between Objectives, between the Member States and between regions, and that this full take-up was only made possible by mechanisms for offsetting over- and under-implementation, which, in fact, made the implementation of the budget non-transparent. We therefore hope that the new rules for the next programming period will make it possible to ensure transparent financial management and avoid the usual yearly liquidity bottlenecks;</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to coordination, it urges the Commission and the Member States to coordinate Structural Fund policy more closely with the Cohesion Fund, the other regional development instruments and the various European Union financial instruments such as trans-European networks and the EDSP. This is because we are convinced that we can only reduce the structural divergences between European regions and areas through coordinated action. </p>
<p class="contents">As regards additionality, which is one of fundamental principles underlying the Structural Funds, we call upon the Commission to find as soon as possible instruments to improve verification of compliance with additionality and more transparent procedures for assessing additionality. We strongly urge the Member States to ensure that this principle is strictly upheld. </p>
<p class="contents">We consider it essential, moreover, in respecting the partnership principle, for management decentralisation to be accompanied by a clarification of the responsibilities and roles of the various partners and by a clear distinction between the functions and responsibilities. Furthermore, we have noted that the results of the interim evaluations are frequently not comparable or quantifiable because unsuitable and inadequate indicators have been employed, which is why it is absolutely necessary for us to have objective criteria and more suitable assessment methods for assessing the results of the programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also noted that, although there was an inexplicable and dangerous fall in the number of on-the-spot checks carried out under the regulation in 1998 compared to the previous year, they have brought to light a whole range of shortcomings, from an insufficient number of monitoring schemes in certain programmes to the co-financing of non-admissible expenditure. As a result, we consider that the Commission’s checks in 1998 were, unfortunately, still unsatisfactory, and that they must be sufficiently strengthened in order to guarantee proper implementation of the Structural Funds regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">In our report, we therefore call upon the European Commission and the Member States to adopt a number of actions as soon as possible to strengthen controls and to keep Parliament better informed of measures adopted to increase transparency and improve the implementation of the Structural Funds. Since this 10th annual report was especially concerned with measures to promote local development, we have noted their strategic importance and emphasise their considerable contribution to local development.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, I would like to stress that our report is consistent with the opinion you expressed on 5 June last in Brussels, when you stressed that, in the interests of transparency, even the smallest European taxpayer has to know where and how Community resources appropriated<span class="bold"> </span>to the Structural Funds are spent. I will leave to you the task of assessing whether a Commission report such as the 1998 report allows, I will not say the smallest, but any of the European taxpayers to satisfy their desire.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, lastly, I would like to explain my position regarding the seven amendments which will be put to the vote on Friday. I, myself, have tabled a technical amendment, the third amendment, which corrects a transcription error likely to cause confusion and make paragraph 28 inconsistent with the rest of the report. I also accept Amendment No 1 and Amendment No 2, since they are in line with the report. However, I cannot accept Amendment No 4, Amendment No 5, Amendment No 6 or Amendment No 7, for I consider that they misrepresent the rest of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I would like to thank Mr Nogueira and Mr Larrea, the authors of these last amendments, and publicly acknowledge that, although I do not support their approach, I do concede that their argument is valid and well structured.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has put his finger on the main problems encountered in implementing Structural Funds credits, and he has clearly indicated what we want to see in this area in the future. In particular, I want to thank him for taking account of the opinion of the Committee on Industry in the final version of his report, especially as regards the issue of job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, Mr President, I am going to concentrate on just point: the need to coordinate Structural Fund interventions with other Community policies, an issue the rapporteur is likewise very concerned about.

This is not an easy problem, and it is not a new one either.</p>

However, I have chosen to speak in today's debate because some of the issues discussed in the report are at the core of what must be addressed if the European institutions themselves are to lift the cloud of mismanagement and waste which hangs over them from previous times.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way we can hope to change the public's perception of what we are doing here is not only to achieve better value for money but also to be seen to be doing it. It is only if we can clearly show that the Commission's use of money is managed in a sound and prudent way that we can hope to win back the trust that has been lost over recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">The report with which we are concerned is, of course, retrospective to 1998. Many positive changes have taken place since that time, not least since the new Commission took over. It is crucial, therefore, that we flag up the inadequacies that were inherent in the system and ensure that we go further in our aim to make better use of European taxpayers' money. This is especially so in the Structural Funds, which directly touch the lives of so many of our own citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We have before us an opportunity to concentrate the minds of both the Commission and the recipients – Member States and others – of this valuable EU assistance, on the criticisms identified in the report in many areas concerning the allocation of funds and the lack of monitoring of their use. A key remedy for addressing this very real problem is the effective use of exit strategies as a prerequisite to the awarding of funding. None of us here would personally enter into a business or private financial agreement without being sure of how and when that obligation would come to an end. All too often that is what has happened in the past. Until clearly defined, planned and effective monitoring of the success or failure of a funded scheme is introduced, it remains all too easy for ill-thought-out and badly managed projects to waste precious resources, to continue to throw good money after bad.</p>
<p class="contents">Failure to act will result in the particular problems highlighted in this report. It will also result in the problems we have seen over the allocation of ever-scarcer resources within the Member States. Nowhere is this better highlighted than in the current delays, obfuscation and confusion in the United Kingdom over where to put this valuable money. This is particularly so in my home region, the West Midlands, where this delay is causing a great deal of uncertainty to local communities and the local taxpayers, who are having to underwrite the projects to the tune of many millions of pounds, pending the resolution of the problems I have outlined.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, what is required is a simple benchmarking of projects to compare and contrast their effectiveness, to be undertaken perhaps by an independent auditor and used in conjunction with a clear and well-planned end-programme which will allow the termination of poorly operated projects and put an end to on-going waste – in essence, to introduce private-sector disciplines into this system.</p>
<p class="contents">Only when the European institutions and the Member States adopt ideas such as these, will we again gain the reputation for financial probity that we desire and which the public demands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stockmann (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if economic and social cohesion is rightly called the core of European policy, then it is safe to say that the Structural Funds act as its pacemaker. We are talking today about the functioning of a political instrument which we have since, with Agenda 2000, replaced with a new and we hope better one. Nevertheless, it is the duty and the right of this Parliament to review the Structural Funds by means of their annual reports and to derive political requirements from those reports, even if they appear to have been overtaken by events.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the rapporteur, Mr Turco, has done an excellent job on both counts in his report on the 10th Annual Report on the Structural Funds, 1998. The many amendments made by Members of this House have substantially enhanced the report. I do not want to repeat here those criticisms which have been recorded and can be checked in writing. Mr Turco and others Members have already reiterated these criticisms. However, I would like to strengthen one demand, and that is the demand that in its next report the Commission should devote a special section to reporting on the measures which it has adopted in response to criticisms voiced by Parliament in previous years. The 11th Annual Report should, therefore, at the same time include a progress report. </p>
<p class="contents">Because time is short, I only want to address four problems and approaches which we think point to the way forward. Firstly, the period covered by the report, 1998, was notable for the fact that it was only possible to achieve total implementation of appropriations for the entire programming period by means of last-minute measures. Experience has shown that we need special strategies for the initial and concluding stages of programming periods and a flexibility mechanism for crisis situations like those which arose in 1997/98.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the principle of additionality is one of the main pillars of our structural policy, and I do not want to undermine it. Nevertheless, there is a yawning gap between rhetoric and reality. For example, in the case of Objective 1 areas, it is frequently only partly true to say that there is an independent structural policy to which the European component is added. This is often because all the funding available in political terms has already had to be committed to guarantee adequate cofinancing, and rightly so. However, when it comes to the principle of additionality, this means, if I may resort to a metaphor, that it is like me being given a suit by Europe to complement a tie that I can afford myself at regional level. The forthcoming enlargement will add to this problem. So as I see it, we need a new definition of additionality. This might perhaps be something along the lines of additional European added value, which is already a prerequisite for the framework research programmes and for the Community INTERREG initiative, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we believe that the principle of partnership with local and regional authorities and with the two sides of industry is heading in the right direction and should be further strengthened. We need both more local initiatives and pacts and a regional debate about priorities for a given region. In this way our structural policy itself will contribute to regionalisation. Structural policy simultaneously reacts to and creates regional structures.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, controls and assessments are the alpha and omega of any structural policy that has the noble objective of making itself superfluous as quickly as possible. Even if there are marked structural differences between regions, this should not stop us from looking for common evaluation methods and indicators. Only in this way can we make horizontal comparisons between strategies and projects between Member States in individual areas of activity. The previous speaker mentioned this problem. Benchmarking should also be possible in this policy area soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is therefore worth remembering that regional and structural policy in the European Union as a whole is a response to the specific disadvantages confronting certain European regions and, in particular, the outermost regions such as Madeira, the Azores, the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, Articles 158 and 159 of the Treaty set the objectives for economic and social cohesion, giving regional policy the task of reducing the existing differences between the less developed regions and the others. It also leads to the special treatment of the outermost regions which is covered in Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty, which will allow the Union to continue, consolidate and strengthen its action in order to achieve a specific system of measures that will take account of all the limitations suffered in those regions, whose situation is special, without damaging the coherence of Community law and the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, Mr Turco’s report on the 1998 annual report on such important financial instruments as the Structural Funds is also relevant, since it opens up the possibility of strengthening the effective and decentralised application of those Funds and also because it opens the way for discussion and reflects the specific situation of these outermost regions with regard to establishing criteria for admission to the Structural Funds and their inclusion in Objective 1. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This looks pretty boring, and the press have already gone home. Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the seriousness of the issues involved, as the central point of this discussion should be to learn from the mistakes of the past. In view of the challenge of an enlarged Union, which will in future have 28 or more Member States, we can no longer afford not to use European money for European objectives such as employment, sustainability, environmental protection and equal opportunities in an efficient way.</p>
<p class="contents">This was simply not the case during the last period. I am emphasising this because I have the impression that the new programmes are once again being approved because of pressure from the Member States, although they do not provide for optimum use of funds in accordance with Europe’s objectives. And this Parliament has been calling for optimum use of funds for years. We cannot afford, as we did in 1998, to spend EUR 30.4 billion only to find that unemployment is increasing again in the poorer regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to cite an example that underlines my doubts. The Commission is simply not throwing its weight behind the need to make European objectives the real guiding principle of Structural Fund policy. This House called for this report to include a chapter specifically devoted to equal opportunities. The three sentences at the beginning are not enough, we asked for a specific chapter, so that we could monitor this area of EU policy separately and effectively. Equality of opportunities is not just the remit of the ESF, it is the remit of all the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you another example. Although unemployment is rising in Germany’s five new <span class="italic">Länder</span>, money is once again being invested in roads instead of jobs in the new Community support framework. I expect the Commission to drop its “business as usual” approach and instead to become the motor of sustainable development in Europe again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur, whom I would like to thank very warmly, depicts very varied trends in expenditure under the Structural Funds. The picture is one of some positive aspects compared with previous years, combined with continuing problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to concentrate on two issues. The first is that EU financial resources have undeniably led to a process of recovery in the poorest regions and Member States. Nevertheless, the gap between the least and most developed regions of the Community has scarcely decreased. That means that disparities in regional development continue to exist, even if the overall level is higher. This is of course totally unsatisfactory as far as I and my group are concerned. And this dissatisfaction is all the greater when you consider that the continuing regional differences, as measured in income per capita, are particularly reflected in unemployment figures. Even though there has been a reduction in unemployment in the EU in absolute terms in recent months, the total number of people without jobs is still far too high. In Germany alone there are still over 3.8 million unemployed, and the employment rate is still markedly higher. </p>
<p class="contents">If we were to use this issue alone to gauge the success of Structural Fund policy, we would pass a devastatingly negative judgment on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the problems of unemployment, which are not tackled under the Structural Funds alone, underscore the importance of efficient coordination of the implementation of funds from the various EU and national support programmes and of restructuring and allocating more money to all those funds that generate new jobs.<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>As the rapporteur rightly emphasises, there was some progress in this area in 1998, but it was still far from adequate. In view of all the difficulties which undeniably exist, I regard this as a key starting point for greater effectiveness and thus more efficient use of the appropriations implemented, and I believe that this is something that people hit by unemployment in the various countries would welcome.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That stocktaking can help us correct any past excesses and learn to manage present and future appropriations better.</p>
<p class="contents">We learn that the implementation rate for programmes in 1998 remained satisfactory, although only slightly under 90% of total support was achieved for commitments, and 61% for payments. That is why we support Mr Maurice Turco’s report, and he is to be congratulated for approaching this issue pragmatically and without complacency. Moreover, this report reveals some mismanagement in the allocation of the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond the overall picture, considerable differences in implementation have persisted between the different objectives as well as between the Member States and the regions. The difference between the budgetary appropriations and the final implementation remains a problem particularly affecting Objective 2. Moreover the full utilisation of the Structural Funds in 1998, or at least in terms of the percentages mentioned earlier, has only been possible thanks to a compensation mechanism for under-implementation, such as major transfer of credits from Objective 2 to Objective 1.</p>
<p class="contents">We denounce this type of practice as lacking in transparency. Furthermore, we ask for a fairer distribution of expenditure, more transparency in the allocation and control of the funds, better eligibility criteria, a reduction in the number of priority objectives and Community initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">We also think a reduction in the programmes involved would lead to greater effectiveness in their implementation and the possibility of stricter control. To this effect, we join the rapporteur in asking the Commission to strengthen its control and inform Parliament of the results of its audits and assessments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would firstly likely to remind you that the objective of the Funds is to strengthen economic and social cohesion in the European Union and that, while it is true that the GDP per capita in the regions with the lowest rate increased by 9% between 1986 and 1996, over the same period the income per capita in the four poorest countries rose by 8%. Nevertheless, the difference when compared to the 25 richest regions continues to be the same: two and a half times.</p>
<p class="contents">These figures should lead us to consider the fact that, while the level and quality of life in the poorest regions is increasing, we have not managed to reduce the disparities between the richest and the poorest regions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">A second factor is that only 10% of the interventions from the Funds correspond to local development measures, despite the fact that most population and poverty is found in urban centres. To this data we must also add a factor which will distort the statistics and will change the landscape of the European Union in the next few years, i.e. the incorporation of the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these issues point to the need for a series of criteria to be taken into account in the future. Firstly, we must leave room for prioritising the interventions relating to urban development. Secondly, we need to develop policies which will reduce the disparities between the richest countries and the poorest countries. Thirdly, we must show greater sensitivity towards phenomena which have been ignored in the European Union, such as insularity and isolation. Lastly, we must take account of all sections of the population with the real objective of creating ever more employment, especially in the least-favoured regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is how the required partnership is implemented and integrated, provided of course that the Commission and the state are actively involved. I should also like to stress the need for greater coordination between European regional policy and other Community policies and between the Structural Funds and other funding mechanisms. </p>
<p class="contents">I should like to use the short time available to me to stress how important it is to uphold the principle of additionality and express the view that, despite the development over time of verification methods, it is impossible to compare Member States on this issue, due to the lack of a common methodology. Thus, we cannot logically adopt a proposal to impose sanctions in cases of non-compliance with this principle until a legal base has been adopted and a common methodology agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of additionality must be taken into serious account and I believe that the Member States and the Commission, in the light of forthcoming enlargement, will have to work together to draw up and adopt guidelines defining a more integrated approach to verifying the application of this principle, taking into account, of course, the particular economic situation in each Member State. </p>
<p class="contents">In closing, I feel I must congratulate the rapporteur on his comprehensive report and stress the fact that on the whole, the implementation of the programmes financed by the various funds was on the right track in 1998, the year covered by the report and a good year overall, in which the relative delays of previous years were recouped. Only when it came to monitoring interventions was 1998 a poor year. There seems to be a problem with this generally, perhaps due to a lack of staff, and the Commission must ensure that it takes the measures needed to ensure that the implementation of European policies continues to be monitored.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would add that this should also relate to the question of whether the principle is being complied with, not just overall by Member States, but at regional levels within them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also ask the Commission to consider introducing a little more flexibility at the stage when projects are being set up. I am thinking of one very worthy project within my own constituency which, because of the very short timetable and a misunderstanding, did not enable contracts to be drawn up by the end of December last year. The offer of funding was consequently withdrawn. I do not dispute that this decision was correct and I understand the Commission's wish to ensure that projects are completed in time. The sad thing about this particular decision was that the project clearly would have been.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that there is a great deal of merit in Amendment No 5. If I understand what is being asked for correctly, the practice already applies in Scotland. Management at this level allows for a high degree of coordination and exchange of best practice between those involved. It also encourages pioneering activities. I offer as an example our Objective 3 partnership's development of a tool kit for gender mainstreaming in structural funding. I understand that serious consideration is already being given to its use in other parts of the European Union. May I please ask the Commission to think very carefully about the merits of taking on board Amendment No 5. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to commend to the House Amendments Nos 4, 6 and 7, also in their names, which strengthen and underline important points in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">But I make no apology for coming back to Amendment No 5 in the sense in which Mrs Attwooll spoke of it. It is vital for the concept of subsidiarity to be brought into the heart of our notion of structural funding and for the regional, local and national authorities within Member States to be fully engaged in the process of implementing the structural funds and applying them.</p>
<p class="contents">As paragraphs 20 and 21 say, the additionality principle has not been operating with an effective, transparent style up to now. Several speakers in this debate have drawn attention to that. Perhaps Commissioner Barnier will not be surprised if I bang home again on the point that whatever might have been the failures of the past, he has the opportunity to make successes in the future and to ensure that the additionality principle is not just a formal principle requiring Member States to satisfy certain budgetary conditions in a global way. Rather it should become a substantive principle built into the idea of subsidiarity which he and President Prodi are researching so that at regional and national level within Member States we can see that the funds really are being used to enhance and improve development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Not only have we failed to achieve the main purpose of the Structural Funds, i.e. to help reduce regional disparities and achieve economic and social cohesion; in numerous cases, the situation has worsened and the gulf between the regions lagging behind and the developed areas has widened both in rural areas, especially island and mountain regions, and also in urban areas, which are plagued by mass and long-term unemployment, poverty, and a scarcity, or in many cases, a total lack of basic infrastructures. The report under discussion makes a number of critical observations and evaluations which are heading in the right direction and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on that. </p>
<p class="contents">However, the reality of the situation is even worse. The lack of planning and transparency and the huge number of irregularities and cases of fraud in implementing the programmes, which have helped swell the coffers of parasitical undertakings, have actually widened the gap instead of fostering cohesion. In fact, the Structural Funds have, on numerous occasions, been used as a means of eroding cohesion and fostering asymmetric development. Greece is a typical example of this: in 1996, only two Greek regions were classified among the ten poorest regions in the European Union. However, the following year, a total of seven Greek regions were amongst the eleven poorest regions. Epirus acquired the dubious accolade of being the poorest region in the European Union. The scarcity of resources under the Damoclean sword of Agenda 2000 and persistent cutbacks in order to satisfy other requirements, such as enlargement, do nothing to strengthen cohesion or stabilize development levels; on the contrary, they help set further socio-economic degeneration of the regions in motion.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The development gap between the Member States has certainly been reduced, but there are still disparities between the regions, not only with regard to the GDP per head, but also, particularly, in terms of unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the economic upturn, the unemployment rate in the Union as a whole stood at around 10% at the end of 1998. Moreover, the distribution of unemployment is extremely uneven. Whereas the 25 regions least affected are experiencing a relative stabilisation of the rate at around 3 or 4%, the trend has not been reversed in the 25 worst affected regions, with a rate which is still higher than 20%.</p>
<p class="contents">In its 1998Annual Report on the Structural Funds, the Commission notes, rightly so, that high regional unemployment leads to social exclusion, hence making unemployment even more resistant to economic improvement. An integrated strategy combining measures to boost the economic base of the regions and measures to improve access to the job market, particularly through training, is essential if this situation is to be resolved. It therefore seems to me that structural actions must continue to step up their efficacy and impact in terms of job creation in order to sustain the current economic growth, especially in the regions most affected by unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the work carried out under the European Spatial Development Perspective follows the development of the organisation of the European territory from a traditional, rather centralised model, towards a polycentric model which is the only way to promote a more balanced geographical distribution of work in Europe. The Commission has promised that the emphasis in the new programming period for the Structural Funds will be on improving transport networks, particularly in the peripheral or outermost regions, and on creating sustainable and effective transport systems that provide a balance between the different modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stress particularly that the priority objective of this increased coordination should be to reduce structural divergences between the central part of the Union and the peripheral and outermost regions, as specified in one of the amendments adopted by my committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People in work are a guarantee of peace and freedom in Europe. This must apply, however, to the whole of the EU, including those areas far from the EU’s geographic centre. If the employment objective is to become a reality, EU policies must all be compatible with one another, just as the Committee says in the report. </p>
<p class="contents">We must make use of regional policy on both a large and a small scale. Among large-scale concerns, we in Sweden include general welfare policy (including social services), education, research, infrastructure and cultural policy throughout the EU. The importance of the latter cannot be emphasised enough. Small-scale measures include aid to companies and the use of Structural Funds, that is to say aid directed more specifically at areas where very special conditions apply. These areas may, for example, be characterised by industrial conversion or low living standards or be of the type which exist in northern Sweden and Finland, with low population density, harsh climates and long distances between centres of population. Where such areas in Sweden are concerned, we have for a long time used reduced social charges for companies as a form of aid. </p>
<p class="contents">This is now being brought into question by the Commission, something I find hard to understand. If the major Structural Fund investments the EU is making in these areas are to be effective, the other parts of regional policy have to function, too. The Structural Funds cannot operate in isolation. We also refer to that principle in the report. I should like to hear the comments of the Member of the Commission regarding this principle that policy areas must be compatible with one another. </p>
<p class="contents">The Structural Funds are therefore very important and have to function well. The criticism of the Funds that I have heard in my region is that they are complicated to use. This is something which we must be helped at all levels to change. I support all ideas of partnership and decentralised administration, as well as the idea that the Funds should be used to meet the needs of the regions. There must also be built-in assessment mechanisms. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I want to emphasise that the whole of the EU must share in European growth. I agree with the person who said that wherever people live is the centre of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His report states clearly that the results of the 1994-9 Structural Funds programming period, taking into account the assessments available at the end of 1998, have not met expectations on a number of fronts.</p>
<p class="contents">This is particularly true in the case of Italy. Suffice it to say that there was a considerable delay in the use of many of the appropriations, although improvement was apparent at the end of the programming period, obtained purely by mathematical calculation through transferring Objective 2 appropriations to Objective 1. Suffice it to say that, as far as Objective 4 is concerned, in 1998, Italy did not fulfil any of its undertakings and has only paid out 3% of the funding. The checking and assessment mechanisms have been decidedly inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">There are essentially three reasons for this poor management and they were highlighted by the Court of Auditors: firstly, lack of planning and poor interaction between the measures funded and the various funding instruments, factors which prevented us achieving the expected added value; secondly, lack of global vision which meant that the projects defined were not ambitious enough; thirdly, delays in concluding previous projects and programmes, largely due to the absence of documents justifying the actual expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, considering the forthcoming 2000-2006 programming period, even though management has been simplified and the number of objectives and Community initiatives reduced, I cannot contain my concern and I sympathise with many regional council chairmen as they tackle the issue of the failure to use Community funds and the responsibilities of the Italian Government. Months after the rejection by the European Commission of the Objective 2 area map it had put forward on the grounds that the area definition criteria did not correspond, the Italian Government had still not presented a valid, compliant proposal, and this was not for lack of good will on the part of the European Commission. The result is certainly not outstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot afford to lose more time, and we cannot afford to decline ITL 10 000 billion either; neither the Italian economic situation nor the Italian taxpayer would allow it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – (<span class="italic">FR</span>) Ladies and gentlemen, in turn, I would like to express the great interest with which I read Mr Turco’s report and congratulate him on the precision and competence of his work. I would also like to say to him that, beyond the observations, criticisms and proposals addressed to me as the new Commissioner for Regional Policy, a post which I have held for quite a few months now, this reading is also extremely useful for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to devote my speaking time to responding as precisely as possible to each one of you on the most important points and, first of all, on the implementation of the Funds for 1998. Your rapporteur, Mr Turco, expressed his relative satisfaction with regard to the overall implementation of the Funds for 1998, when 100% of the appropriations available for the year were committed and 100% disbursed.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond this observation – which, I think it only fair to mention, is the fruit of the work of my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, and my colleagues, who were also hers –I can also tell you that at the end of 1999, which is also the last year of the programming period 1994-1999, 99% of the appropriations were committed and 75% disbursed: results which are, of course, still insufficient, but which, all the same, mark a step forward in the direction you advocate. </p>
<p class="contents">However, it is true that the situation of Community Initiatives is somewhat different and this is due to the specific characteristics of their implementation. There is the innovative aspect of most of the programmes, a new approach based on partnership and the inherent difficulty in implementing transnational programmes, by both national and regional authorities. In spite of everything, ladies and gentlemen, a very clear improvement was noted in 1998 and confirmed in 1999, in particular following the redistribution of resources between the various initiatives, as the European Parliament wanted. At the end of 1999, 95% of the appropriations for the period had been taken up under Community Initiatives and 57% had been paid.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to implementation, Mr Esclopé, since you mentioned the inequality between the different Member States regarding implementation, I think I am right in saying that part of the explanation you are looking for lies in the inevitably different nature of the programmes and projects according to the countries or regions. We are well aware that it is the countries and regions that propose the projects which, I repeat, are very different. Therefore, I would put some of your observations down to the differences between these programmes and projects.</p>
<p class="contents">If we compare the implementation of the commitments with the financial perspectives determined in Edinburgh, I agree with you that they almost match. However, ladies and gentlemen, I have taken note of the criticisms and remarks saying that we can do better. Mrs Schroedter or Mr Markov have noted disparities that are still unacceptable. I would, however, point out that it is possible to prove the effectiveness of the Structural Funds, since divergences between States have been reduced. Nevertheless, you are correct, and I myself am concerned by this observation, the gaps between the regions – Mrs Sudre clearly and eloquently stated the figures – prove that the Structural Funds are not yet allocated in a sufficiently efficient or concentrated manner. There are still unjustified, unacceptable gaps between regions, and between the group of the poorest regions and the group of the richest regions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the same subject, I would also like to say that I am taking great care that this social divide, as it has been called, this economic divide between the group of the richest regions and the group of the poorest regions is not exacerbated by another divide linked to the new economy – I am thinking of some extremely worrying figures relating to this subject – that I could call the digital divide, that is to say the democratic access of the most remote citizens, the poorest citizens, the most disadvantaged citizens, to the new technologies and to the opportunities provided by these new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">As to my second point: monitoring, evaluation and control. In your resolution, Mr Turco, you recognise the importance of monitoring, assessing and controlling Structural Fund interventions. With regard to monitoring and evaluation, in all sincerity, significant progress has been observed and I would like to cite three examples of this. Firstly, finalising a harmonised methodology. Secondly, completing the interim evaluation, which ended during 1998 and which has led to restructuring within the programmes, occasionally very significant in financial terms. Finally, thirdly, completing thematic cross-sector evaluations, in particular with regard to small and medium-sized businesses, equal opportunities or partnership. I have noticed that these evaluations are gradually bearing fruit, in particular the new programmes for the period 2000-2006.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still progress to be made in this area, but it must be noted that the evaluation culture seems to me to be more prevalent today in all the departments of the Commission and also among the programme managers. I have also noticed that at the beginning of last June, when I had organised a seminar for the first time between the Member States and the programme managers, the management authorities for all the regions and all the countries. I had also invited the chairman of your committee, Mr Hatzidakis, and Mrs Theato, chair of the Commission on Budgetary Control, to participate in this seminar. To be frank, it showed that the evaluation culture, which is a modern, necessary culture, is making progress.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to control, the Commission broadly shares your assessment of the complexity of the current Structural Fund system. Once again, however, improvements have been made since 1997, in particular within the scope of the SEM 2000 initiative, and I would like to thank Mr Bradbourn for pinpointing them. The establishment of rules on the eligibility of spending for co-financing is covered by an implementing regulation for the new period. The financial control standards that the Member States must observe will also be covered by a regulation. The guidelines relating to the implementation of net financial corrections are also being translated into an implementing regulation for this new period. Furthermore, I would like to remind you that fund legislation for the new period – which Mr Musotto judged to be insufficient earlier on, I noted – provides for intervention monitoring systems to be simplified.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to control, the new legislation also gives the Member States direct responsibility for controls concerning programmes carried out on their territory. As you know, ladies and gentlemen, it is the Commission that is responsible for ensuring that the control systems are sufficiently sound and reliable.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, it is a complex business. Recently, I even heard calls for less of the Brussels bureaucracy, for fewer complications. I will give some thought, clearly and objectively, to all the ways in which matters could be simplified. In particular, I will think about this in the joint discussions on the nature of the new regional policy for 2006-2013. In the meantime, I am bound by a general regulation, with which you have been familiar since Berlin and which I must apply. I must therefore find, in conjunction with my staff, the optimum balance between and coordination of, on the one hand, the desire expressed by some of you earlier for greater decentralisation, greater trust in the Member States and the regions and, on the other, your requirement for rigour, which is also required of me by the Court of Auditors, in order to be able to be accountable to the taxpayers. </p>
<p class="contents">What I can say on this subject, in particular to Mrs Hedkvist Petersen who discussed the matter with me the other day when I was visiting her region, is that I will search for the best balance. But try to understand that I am torn between your demand for increased decentralisation and the need to present accurate accounts to the European Parliament, public opinion and the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">Your rapporteur quite rightly remarks that in 1998 the Commission did not carry out enough on-the-spot checks. Actually, Mr Turco, in spite of the importance attached by the Commission to proper financial management of the programmes and to reliable controls, I must point out that the resources at my disposal did not enable us to carry out as many controls as we would have wished.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out the negotiations underway for a framework agreement between our two institutions, which answers some of Mr Bradbourn’s concerns. Moreover, this framework agreement has now been definitively finalised regarding the transmission of documents to Parliament and it is on this basis that the Commission will provide your Parliament with all the documents you would like.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of you, including Mrs Attwool and Mr MacCormick, have raised the matter of additionality. I would like to specify that the new legislation seems to me to substantially improve the possibilities of verifying additionality, as this will be verified for two types of programme. For Objective 1 programmes, as was formerly the case, but also for Objective 2 and 3 programmes, taken together, this verification will be carried out on the basis of samples and will concern solely the active measures of the labour market. </p>
<p class="contents">This new system will make it possible to have an overall view of the implementation of the additionality principle, including for Objective 2, which as you know, presented great statistical problems during the previous period. The Commission had also proposed a link between the verification of this additionality and the allocation of the performance reserve, but, as you also know, this link has not been adopted by the legislator. I would, however, like to remind you of my desire to verify the reality of this additionality and I would also like to say – as I have said to several Member States – that the verification of this principle, the reality of additionality will be a criterion for the admissibility and approval of new programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">You asked me about your draft Article 5. To be honest, ladies and gentlemen, I must ask you to understand that I cannot approve this Article 5 whatever the good intentions behind it. Once again, I am bound by Article 11 of the general regulation on Structural Funds which, at least until 2006, does not allow the decentralisation or delegation of the executive powers of the Commission to sub-national bodies, as you call them: the Autonomous Communities, Regions, and <span class="italic">Länder</span>. I am forced to comply with the general regulation on the Structural Funds, at least as laid down until 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of partnership is one which the Commission hopes to make as comprehensive as possible. Progress has already been observed, in 1998, in particular with the setting up in 1997 of territorial pacts for employment involving regional and local partners and both sides of industry. But the Commission goes much further with the new legislation for 2000-2006. The partnership is now actually being extended to new operators, who to date were not really, or very rarely involved, and I would like them to be involved from now on. The economic and social partners, the associations, some non-governmental organisations, in particular in the fields of the environment and equal opportunities. Furthermore, the new legislation brings the partnership into play at all stages of the programming from the initial drawing-up of plans by the Member States to the evaluation of the programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, complementarity with other Community policies. Mrs Flesch, Mr Turco yourself, Mrs Schroedter, Mr Mastorakis, you stressed this point. I would like to note that Parliament, which questions the efforts of the Commission to intensify the synergy between structural policies and other Community policies, should know that this is also of concern to me and my staff. This is how the cross-sector theme in their annual report for 1998 should be considered, for example, the actions supporting local development and, I would like to announce, actions in favour of equal opportunities and sexual equality in the report for 1999. </p>
<p class="contents">A substantial amount of effort recently has been put into improving the coherence of the Structural Funds with other Community policies, particularly, Mrs Flesch, with State aid. This is a field in which the Commission adopted, in 1998, a communication reconciling the map of regional State aid with the map of regions eligible for the Structural Funds and on this subject, I regularly have constructive dialogues with Mario Monti, my fellow Commissioner with responsibility for such matters.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also the case for the environment, within the scope of the new programmes for 2000­2006. Let it be clear that here too, ladies and gentlemen, there is no question of turning the Structural Funds into instruments of other policies. The Structural Funds answer one policy: that of cohesion, reducing the disparities between regions and countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of the fund is to support the development of the weakest regions in order to step up economic and social cohesion within the Union, and you stressed the lack of progress made in this area. Therefore, we must simply ensure – and this is no small matter – that structural interventions take sufficient account of sectorial Community policies, but also, in return, ensure that the other sectorial policies of the Union embrace or support the aspect of cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking in particular – in response to Mr Sanchez García and Mr Theonas – of the outermost regions. You know, ladies and gentlemen, of the personal interest that I will continue to take, within the Commission, in the future and the development of the outermost regions. You had proof of this when the Commission’s report on these regions was published: I took a personal interest. I would also echo Mrs Sudre’s comments on this.</p>
<p class="contents">My comments on the subject of the outermost regions and the need for adequate cohesion and coherence between various policies also applies to the most disadvantaged regions, whether these are urban regions, which are increasing in number, or island or maritime regions, to reply to Mr Ripoll y Martinez de Bedoya who questioned me on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to thank you for your attention and say a few words about the annual report and its role as I see it. Ladies and gentlemen, it is right for Parliament to make demands on the Commission with regard to the implementation of the Structural Funds and their impact, and you have presented new requirements. I would go along with Mr Stockmann’s question regarding the inclusion in future reports of a specific paragraph or chapter in order to reply precisely to the remarks or criticisms of the Parliament with regard to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft resolution reflects this wish, this requirement, by asking the Commission to provide yet more information in the annual report. However, for a few years we have chosen to make the annual report more concise, which, moreover, was formally requested by the European Parliament at the time. The document must remain readable for the citizens, not just for MEPs or specialists- and it is not yet completely so, if I have understood Mr Turco correctly. I am very attached to this quest for readability, proximity and explanation by the Commission in the field for which I am responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall therefore continue our efforts in favour of readability and the task of explanation, while being more precise in order to respond to your requests. These are the two aspects – readability and precision – on which I intend to concentrate in order to present a top quality annual report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
