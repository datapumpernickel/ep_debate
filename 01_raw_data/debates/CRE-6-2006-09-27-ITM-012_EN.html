<p class="contents">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although I would have liked the Commissioner with responsibility for trade policy to be here to listen to this evening’s debate, for the subject is very much one of his own, I do hope that this will not be the last time that it is debated in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Globalisation and the liberalisation of world trade are not gender-neutral, and so I am glad to be able to present this own-initiative report on ‘perspectives of women in international trade’ on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.</p>
<p class="contents">The relationship between gender and trade is a new subject not only for women, but also for governments and those who make trade policy, and also for us in this House, so it is high time that we address it and debate the question of what influence global trade has on equal opportunities policy and vice versa. In the report, you will find many suggestions for practical things to do about the gender blindness of international trade, and I would like to emphasise the fact that the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality adopted it unanimously. It highlights the need for coherence between the objective of European equality policy and the goals of trade, development policy and aid programmes if equal opportunities for women and men are to be promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">Of all the poor in the world, 70% are women; their gender means that they do not have the same opportunity to acquire property, land or education, and they suffer many kinds of discrimination on the labour market, and their situation can only be made worse by market liberalisation and the extension of international trading relations that take insufficient account of the structural discrimination against women. To well-educated women, globalisation has brought new vocational opportunities, but liberalised markets have made poorer women’s living conditions even worse. Microcredit and development aid will amount to no more than a drop in the ocean if we do not make a start on making fundamental changes to these global economic structures. Trade policy involves the EU in representing the interests of the Member States at many levels and in negotiating treaties, for example as part of the WTO negotiations. Although it, in the past, set milestones for equality of opportunity in Europe, there is a yawning gulf when it comes to realising this principle in global trade policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Women’s Rights is unwilling to tolerate this silence any longer. As a first step, we demand gender mainstreaming in international trade policy, with explicit monitoring and assessment mechanisms, the latter of which might, for example, involve ranking the Member States in terms of their promotion of gender equity on the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">In order that the objective of equality should not be voided of all meaning, a department for gender equity and trade should be set up within the Commission, with one of its functions to be the provision of gender-disaggregated statistical data. We call on the Commission to present an annual progress report on equality in international trade, and also to set up a fund to help women get access to loans and education. Politicians without money are no more than poets, so, as a responsible trade policy can be brought about only by transparent flows of funds, we demand the introduction of gender budgeting, that being a budget policy that takes gender justice seriously, something we regard as indispensable at every level of trade policy. The Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality intends to organise a hearing on the subject next week.</p>
<p class="contents">The intention is that the EU should become a beacon of equality in international trade policy, just as it has already become for equal opportunities for women in Europe, and that the Commission should play an active part in countering discrimination against women, which will involve ensuring that European companies with overseas production centres and also benefiting from EU market access programmes do not have a hand in the inhumane exploitation of women. It is also important that the EU, before entering into trade agreements, should undertake a gender-specific analysis of the position of women. We in the EU must not promote businesses that use women while committing flagrant breaches of their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that international trading organisations, businesses and structures are dominated by men. If women are to achieve equality with men in terms of their access to power and occupying of decision-making positions, then quotas are still indispensable; effective quotas that represent more than lip-service will help to establish gender parity in international trade relations, and so I am glad that the Committee on Women’s Rights has drawn on an initiative taken in Norway, where companies quoted on the stock exchange have been required, with effect from 2006, to increase to 40% the percentage of women on supervisory boards.</p>
<p class="contents">If this House adopts the resolution on women in international trade, it would be a great triumph and an important step on the road to gender justice. We will have to bring pressure to bear on the Commission to get it to do as Parliament demands. I wish to thank all Members for their positive attitude towards this report, their support for it and their suggestions, and I hope that we may be able to achieve a satisfactory outcome when we vote on it tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Commission welcomes the report of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. For the European Union, the purpose of global governance is to make possible development that is socially, economically and environmentally sustainable. That is why we wish to promote policies that provide sustainable responses to gender-based issues, whether they are countries’ domestic policies in some cases backed by international aid, common policies such as those forming the building blocks of the European Union, or international commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Trade liberalisation has provided new opportunities for many women in developing countries, providing new employment and in many cases reducing the gender gap in wages, leading to greater empowerment and social standing of women in society. Nonetheless, the rapid changes in national economies that can result from globalisation also provide challenges to policy-makers to ensure that the benefits and opportunities of globalisation are maximised and the short-term costs in certain sectors are minimised.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission believes that clear social conditions underpin sustainable productivity growth and promote the efficient production of high-quality goods and services generating a net added value. Policies that mitigate the adverse effects of a changing economy on specific groups of people or regions, good social services and social protection accessible to all, social dialogue, the respect for fundamental social rights including core labour standards, minimum standards for working conditions and for ensuring workers’ upstream involvement in managing change – all these play a crucial role.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission promotes core labour rights in EU trade policy. Core labour standards are defined by the ILO to include Convention No 100 on equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value, and Convention No 111 on discrimination in the workplace.</p>
<p class="contents">In the multilateral context, a reference to core labour standards was included in the declaration of the first World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in Singapore in 1996. Regrettably, WTO members did not agree to include this issue as part of the Doha Development Agenda. Nevertheless, the Commission is committed to addressing trade and social development, core labour standards and commitment to meaningful dialogue between the WTO and the International Labour Organization, both in the EU’s own trade policy review and the trade policy reviews of other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of this process, the International Convention of Free Trade Unions’ reports on core labour standards are prepared ahead of each trade policy review. The Commission is also strongly in favour of observer status for the ILO in the WTO. The European Commission has also pursued social development objectives in regional, bi-regional and bilateral arrangements. All its most recent agreements recognise and promote social rights as part of the universal objective of decent work for all.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has, for example, entered into dialogue and cooperation with countries such as Chile, South Africa and bi-regionally with the ACP countries, the Gulf Cooperation Council, Mercosur and other regions. The European Commission remains of the view that the discussion and pursuit of social issues should not be used for protectionist purposes and it rejects any unilateral sanctions-based approach. The objective is to further social progress with a view to promoting benefits for all.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1998 the EC has also been granting trade preferences under the Generalised System of Preferences, special incentive arrangements to those developing countries that assure the respect of the core labour rights as defined by the ILO and comply with international recognised standards on sustainable forest management. Currently, some 180 developing countries and dependent territories are granted GSP. In the framework of the new GSP scheme, adopted on 27 June 2005 by the Council, a GSP-plus initiative for sustainable development provides additional tariff preferences for countries that have signed and effectively implemented UN and ILO conventions on human rights and labour rights, including those on gender equality. A total of 15 countries have ratified the core conventions and received GSP-plus status.</p>
<p class="contents">A gender helpdesk currently operates under the RELEX family of the Commission. The services of the gender helpdesk are part of a larger effort to build capacity and knowledge to promote gender equality and fully implement the strategy of gender mainstreaming. A tool kit has also been published to give practical help to Commission staff on how to mainstream gender issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The EC is also developing a close relationship with the International Labour Organization on trade-related matters aimed at promoting core labour standards through assessment, capacity-building and enforcement in developing countries. In 2005-2006 the Commission has been funding an ILO pilot project aiming to develop decent work indicators in developing countries for examining the relationship between decent work and trade liberalisation. Case studies have been undertaken in the Philippines and Uganda. The data gathered include disaggregated statistics on employment, wages and working hours for women and men. These data provide a more sophisticated picture of decent work than previously available. The Commission will explore the potential to use these indicators in future aid programmes with developing countries to help them manage social adjustment to globalisation, and the report will be submitted to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission will also look into the potential for using decent work indicators as part of trade sustainability impact assessments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The globalisation and liberalisation of the economy do not just make successes out of people. That is why I ask what place the weakest have in society and what resources there are to promote a solidarity economy. Politicians and economists must be creative in their efforts to ensure that men and women can really flourish and must promote the common public good without excessive government interference, which would harm the national economies.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraphs 15 and 26 mention the classification of the Member States. That is provocative. However, since 1951, this classification has appeared in the International Labour Organisation conventions signed by the Member States of the European Union. The paragraphs that deal with the relations with third countries emphasise that women, as economic players, must be recognised in all of the activities they carry out in terms of personal, family and educational development and in all of the duties they perform within society. The unpaid and informal work done by women deserves greater recognition in European policies.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution also reminds us that we, in the West, must avoid at all costs any form of neo-colonialism and that we must respect the cultures of our economic partners, while ensuring the abolition of all forms of discrimination between men and women. That is why I encourage my group to endorse this resolution in the hope that, in the not too distant future, the political declarations on equality between men and women will finally be reflected in economic life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are also being denied the means to improve their financial situation. This is supported by statistics, according to which 70% of those living in poverty in the world are women, which is a very high proportion. In spite of these figures, many people still fail to appreciate that a lack of equality between the sexes clearly has a negative impact on development in the long term. This is because lack of equality between the sexes means that women do not have equal access to the market means of production and that, in relation to social and political issues, they are not part of the decision-making process. This situation has a negative impact on long term development.</p>
<p class="contents">International trade can also help to ensure that the economic potential of the whole of society is exploited by promoting the involvement of women in the economic, social and political spheres. In this respect, cohesion between the aims of European policy on gender equality and the aims of its trade and development policy is particularly important. Ensuring that women can play their rightful part in the economy is crucial if we are to strengthen the position of women and overcome structural discrimination. To this end, the European Commission should strive not only to include the issue of gender equality in international trade strategies, but also to introduce transparent systems for their monitoring and control. By setting a good example, which I trust will become the norm in time, the European Union can demonstrate to third countries that women must not be treated as second class citizens and must have the opportunity to benefit from full access to the market, to credit and to capital goods.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is important for both the institutions of the European Union and the Member States to include gender equality and equal opportunity issues in the aims identified within the framework of all European funding programmes. The Member States should make an effort to develop national political measures that will foster gender equality and increase female employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Norwegian Government’s decision to bring in a law requiring 40% female representation on the boards of joint stock companies is a splendid example to follow and should be emulated by other Member States. It should also become the subject of a regulation at Community level. Women must have an equal right to participate in economic life, especially in the poorest countries. Potentially helpful measures include universal access to so-called ‘micro-credits’, which would help to combat poverty amongst women, promote self-sufficiency and raise their social status.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that it is important to ensure that women are appropriately represented at government level in the Member States of the European Union and in international organisations. This would ensure that gender issues and problems which primarily affect women are taken into account within the framework of trade negotiations at global level.</p>

This gender power structure is present in every aspect of our society and it hampers growth and every kind of sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the people living in poverty in the world, almost three out of four are women, so equal opportunities for women and men is not just an issue of human rights or some sort of luxury. When every other problem is solved it is crucial for our common future.</p>
<p class="contents">This report by my colleague Mrs Breyer, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, is a very good starting point for the urgent work ahead in the specific area of trade relations in the world. As she points out, women in general experience more difficulties in gaining access to education, property, credit, other resources and factors of production, as well as political decision-making bodies, and these inequalities restrict women’s ability to use the advantages of trade liberalisation. For instance, a large number of women throughout the world are denied opportunities to improve their economic and social conditions and, at the same time, many of them have the added responsibility of caring for children and the household.</p>
<p class="contents">A majority of the farmers in the world are women! A structural change in the EU’s common agricultural policy is an important strengthening of these women in third world countries. However, gender inequality is not just something that exists in poor countries: the representation of women in politics and business is also very low in the Member States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to raise the discussion of quotas to a new level, we must consider that this instrument can be used in a number of different ways. As I see it, the quota instrument should be used only when every other way has been tested and proved unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the rapporteur, I welcome the Norwegian Government’s decision to impose by law a 40% quota for female representation on the boards of joint stock companies. But, basically, this report addresses a number of issues concerning the systematic and thoroughly unjust gender inequality affecting international trade relations. It includes a number of very precise suggestions, which I believe could really make a difference in a political world so much characterised by words and empty promises. It will make for good reading in the Commission and in the Council.</p>

In the same way as the agreements are often beneficial to industrialised countries and harmful to developing countries, women and men are, in different ways, placed at, respectively, a disadvantage or advantage by trade agreements. By tradition, world trade is men’s arena. The board of the IMF consists entirely of men, and 91.7% of the World Bank’s board is male. Trade and gender are connected in a host of ways that we need to study if we are to understand how people in different places, of different genders and from different social classes are affected by trade agreements. Gender is relevant because gender relations affect the distribution of, and access to, resources, work, income and power. Gender affects our behaviour as economic actors. Men and women react differently to economic changes. Financial institutions are not only dominated by men. More importantly, they continue and maintain gender structures in the economy. Men’s and women’s work is valued differently. Women’s work in the reproductive sphere is unpaid and has been rendered invisible. These factors mean that women and men are affected differently, and a gender analysis is therefore incredibly important if we are to be able to design a trade policy that promotes equality and breaks down patriarchal structures. Women’s role in the economy must be made visible. Trade policy negotiations must take practical account of all the conventions, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is all the more disturbing because it is happening behind a façade of lofty ideals such as human rights, equal rights, equal opportunities for all, equal treatment in the workplace and many other popular slogans that are, on the whole, light years removed from reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Trade liberalisation has had its benefits and its drawbacks. The benefits associated with trade liberalisation and globalisation as far as women are concerned include, in particular, new and often well-paying jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Employed women generally become more independent and self-confident, their social status improves, and they become more aware of their rights. Compared with men, however, their compensation is in most cases 20 to 50% lower for the same work.</p>
<p class="contents">In the majority of instances, trade liberalisation benefits only big business. As female entrepreneurs are most often employed in the management of small- and medium-sized companies, they effectively benefit from the opening up of markets only to a limited degree.</p>
<p class="contents">What has the World Trade Organisation done to further gender equality policy and make it a part of the WTO agenda? The answer is, very little. According to the WTO, trade is a neutral area, based on the assumption that trade and market liberalisation are gender neutral, which means that gender equality policy has no direct involvement with this area. In this context, I think the WTO should pay more attention to gender equality in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is interesting to note that almost all WTO Member States have signed the Beijing Platform for Action. Its implementation, however, is more than a formality. It is necessary to keep in mind women’s contribution to international trade. Women in general, and educated, multilingual women in particular have excellent communication and negotiation skills, and as managers they employ methods that are different from their male counterparts.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though the participation of women in private sector trade is remarkable, we need to increase the number of women working in international organisations, such as the WTO, International Monetary Fund, World Bank and other institutions dealing with trade and business. This should ensure that women are not only part of the production process but also part of the decision-making process, and not only at lower levels but also in executive and managerial positions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The figures are startling: 2.5 billion people living on less than USD 2 per day, and, as I said, most of them are women.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty lies at the root of the trafficking of women and children, sexual slavery and gender-based violence. It leads to the non-completion of schooling, to child labour, to increased numbers of children in danger, to illegal immigration, to fundamentalism and to terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Without financial independence, there is neither freedom nor equality. Women, and especially young women, are easily recruited by international criminal gangs, who promise them well-paid jobs in wealthy countries only to throw them into forced prostitution. Women do not generally benefit from globalisation, which tends to favour workers with good qualifications. Rather, they tend to suffer the detrimental consequences of the liberalisation of trade.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a most timely report, on which I should like to congratulate Mrs Breyer. It contains important proposals, of which I wish to highlight the use of microcredit as a means of reducing poverty. Microfinancing instruments have proved effective in combating poverty and it is women who have benefited most and benefited best, and have succeeded in improving their families’ economic situation. Unemployed women and those on low incomes – that is to say, women without access to the usual financial institutions, as is the case with most women in developing countries – have benefited particularly.</p>
<p class="contents">Studies have shown that women can take part in economic decision-making. Further studies show that companies with women on their boards have gained better results. Let us, too, follow the example of Norway, as mentioned earlier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is with that in mind that I would like to thank Mrs Breyer for this own-initiative report, which is the logical response to the imperative need for the issue of the relative roles of trade and women to be once more addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing will be done about the problem of the unequal treatment of women for as long as there is no radical rethinking of economic and trade policies. Do you remember trade agreements? There was the Agnoletto report, which stated that human rights clauses should be incorporated in all international treaties. Since there are both individual and social human rights, it follows that it is justified – to say the least – that all trade agreements should include clauses on human beings’ social rights, namely the right to education, the right to training, and the right to free health care.</p>
<p class="contents">If you want those things – and we do – then you cannot, of course, want to implement a European services directive that makes them into market commodities and hence dependent on people’s ability to pay for them. It is quite clear that that approach is eventually going to be taken to GATS, so that women in certain countries will be denied what opportunities they currently have, for those countries will not have the financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the subject of quotas, these are always crutches, but they can be bridges. That I can tell you from my own experience as a member of the left-wing PDS party in the Federal Republic of Germany, which applies a 50% quota to all its parliamentarians, and that is something that should be brought in everywhere, for if it were, we and our society would have achieved a major advance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Little is known about the impact of trade on women, and neither do we know anything about the effect of trade on gender inequalities. We have seen very few examples of concrete policies in the sector for promoting equality between men and women. This lack of knowledge is due to the lack of sufficient data differentiated by gender in the statistics on trade and also the lack of a gender perspective in economic models and analyses.</p>
<p class="contents">It is possible and necessary to contribute to gender equality by means of trade. In this regard, we applaud, for example, the Norwegian Government’s decision to impose by law a 40% quota for women’s participation on the boards of directors of limited companies. In my country, Spain, too, a law is being negotiated, known as the equality law, which includes making it obligatory for there to be a balanced presence of men and women on the management boards of commercial companies, a balanced presence meaning that there must be no more than 60% of either sex and no less than 40%.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore applaud Mrs Breyer’s amendment urging the Commission also to draw up a legislative proposal of this nature. I would like to take this opportunity, Mrs Breyer, to congratulate you most warmly on your work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Women are often negatively affected by the process of globalisation, as we heard, and I absolutely agree on that. They do not have the same access to education and employment, and are not properly involved in trade. They are often excluded from the decision-making process and from services. As we know, only highly educated women benefit from liberalised trade, and women all over the world often suffer from the side-effects of globalisation and liberalisation. That is why we all agree that equal treatment should become a reality, and in order to achieve it, clear monitoring of employment policies is necessary, together with collecting gender-disaggregated data.</p>
<p class="contents">Trade can be identified as one of the six priority areas for development policy. Achieving gender equality is the key to development in general. The strategy of gender mainstreaming is a long-term, step-by-step approach, based on integrating gender issues into both the political and the practical areas. Development effectiveness requires that gender analysis should be systematically integrated into the conception, implementation and evaluation of all development strategies. Development effectiveness makes it appropriate to envisage specific activities aimed at ensuring adequate attention to gender issues across the mainstream of Community financial instruments, which should increasingly assume responsibility for these key questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Strengthened women’s representation and participation in economic and political life contributes significantly to poverty reduction and development and creates more hope for a better future for the next generation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Liberalisation is now the motor for the economies of Europe and the world, but success has its price, which is increased emotional and economic pressure on families, the uncertainty of labour relations and social stratification. Globalisation affects women more than it does men, as has been mentioned here.</p>
<p class="contents">Women bear a disproportionate share of unpaid work. Their role in making political and economic decisions, however, is unjustifiably small. This argument, which until now has taken place mostly on the level of emotions and beliefs, requires more facts. The compilation of a scientific ranking of gender equity in the labour market would be an effective measure for the reduction of inequality, but one must also find the facts on one’s own.</p>
<p class="contents">I have for some time called on Estonian society to set the objective of 40% female participation in the councils of companies. What is possible in Norway could become a reality throughout the world. The report also states the same position. Europe’s message should be simple and unanimous – gender inequality is a thing of the past. That is indeed the message of the report, which is an excellent document from which to move forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to refer to some points raised during tonight's discussion. As to the issue of European companies that profit from EU market access programmes, within the framework of EU cooperation policy that should not contribute to the exploitation of women employees, I must underline that recent EU cooperation agreements include commitments to the ILO core conventions on labour standards. The EU has included commitments to the ILO core labour standards in all its recent bilateral trade agreements and the GSP and the GSP-plus, which provide trade preferences to developing countries that ratify ILO conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the impact of trade liberalisation, I should like to underline that this has provided new opportunities for many women in developing countries, providing new employment and, in many cases, reducing the gender gap in wages leading to greater empowerment and social standing of women in society. The evidence suggests that over one million women in India have increased their social standing as a result of trade openings. The majority of these are from poor backgrounds.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the inclusion of gender equality in international trade policies, the European Union has been a strong supporter of the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises and more generally of the integration of decent work and social issues in the OECD investment activities. We remain in favour of observer status for the ILO in the WTO, though we have to acknowledge that there is resistance from other members.</p>
<p class="contents">On gender-impact assessments, gender has been included in recent trade sustainability impact assessments. As quality of gender data increases, the trade SIAs will be strengthened in the future, and certainly progress can be made in this area. That is why the Commission will explore the potential of decent work indicators, including data on the work of women and men.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the question of gender budgeting as a standard tool in budgetary policies, the Commission will respond in writing. On the issue of gender budgeting more generally, that is an issue that covers many different areas of operation. However, we look forward to hearing about the progress made on this issue from the European Parliament and we will follow the committee’s work with interest.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to the 40% quota for women on boards of joint stock companies, as in Norway, I must point out that this is primarily a matter for the individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the formation of a formal trade and gender desk within DG Trade, I must underline again that within the Commission DG RELEX leads on the monitoring of human rights in third countries. DG Trade liaises regularly with the RELEX family on human rights with regard to trade agreements, such as GSP, and liaises with the International Labour Organization and DG Employment on labour rights with regard to trade agreements. The European Union, in fact, withdrew GSP from Myanmar for serious and systematic violations of the ILO core labour rights and this shows that the system currently in operation works well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
