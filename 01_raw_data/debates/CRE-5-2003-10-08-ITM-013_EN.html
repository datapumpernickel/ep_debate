Mr Cunha, as our President has said, has been called away to take up other political duties in his homeland, in the north of Portugal, and that is where he has gone. I would like firstly to congratulate him, as does the whole of this House I believe, for the good memories we all have of him and we wish him great success in his new role.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are debating his report, and I have the honour, as coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, of presenting it to you.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing with a very complete and very positive report, enriched with the amendments approved in our Committee on Fisheries. It describes all the enormous possibilities offered by international fisheries agreements, both for the European Union and for third countries. There remain in this Parliament certain recalcitrant Members who are dubious about the international fisheries agreements, but fortunately there are far fewer of them than in 1994 when we discussed this issue in this Parliament. The vast majority recognise their enormous advantages.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, 24 developing countries, who met in Galicia on 16 and 17 September at the <span class="italic">World Fishing Exhibition</span>, approved the conclusions of the fourth Conference of Fisheries Ministers, all of them calling for the maintenance and increase of international fisheries agreements as instruments for trade and development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">That the benefits are mutual, nobody calls into question. And neither that they are essential to both parties. And that there must be no discrimination or differentiated treatment between certain agreements, such us those in the North, and others, such as those in the South, either. The development cooperation in the field of fisheries represented by international fisheries agreements is obvious; and that, through them, the European Union is achieving responsible fishing in these third-country fishing grounds and the development of a sustainable fisheries sector, is also obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">The developing countries, at the fourth world conference which I have just referred to, all called for more cooperation, for more investments in their countries, for more scientists, for more joint undertakings, and this is undoubtedly the way forward for the future. Namibia, for example, is today a world fishing power, a zealous guardian of its fisheries resources and sustainable fishing, and this is all the result of European investments.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither should we forget the essential commercial aspect of these fisheries agreements for the European Union, where they generate work for our fleets, jobs for our fishermen and work for our processing industries.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has the example of the adversity caused by the failure to renew certain fisheries agreements, as in the case of Morocco, which is still a controversial issue for this Parliament. And now it is also aware of the urgent need for relocation in other fishing grounds, within the context of these agreements, and for formulas, such as mixed undertakings and temporary associations of companies, when recovery plans are approved in accordance with scientific reports, which the European Union is the first to respect, such as those which are currently taking place in Community waters and non-Community waters, in external waters, as in the case of halibut in the NAFO.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, the international fisheries agreements are an essential mechanism for the European Union and for the third countries, since both parties benefit mutually from them, as the Cunha report points out in a crystal clear fashion. I therefore hope to have this House's support tomorrow in the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since becoming a Member of the European Parliament, Mr Cunha has done splendid work in drafting a whole array of reports on fisheries matters, for which we owe him a debt of gratitude.</p>
<p class="contents">When I read the report, I was glad to note that the Commission and Parliament are pursuing the same objectives by way of future fisheries agreements. The Commission has always taken the view that the sustainability of fisheries needs to be ensured not only in Community waters, but also outside them. This agreement, therefore, is intended to put a greater emphasis than in the past on the environment, but without neglecting economic and social objectives. Deep-sea fishing is crucial to the economies of many coastal regions in the Community, and so support for it needs to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">The report calls on the Commission to draw up a sound financial chapter, and also to regard a financial contribution as both part of a trade agreement and as development aid. With that I can wholeheartedly agree, but let me say, for the avoidance of misunderstandings, that the financial contribution is, on the one hand, to be paid in respect of the fisheries rights that are conceded and, on the other, is meant to help the third country to manage its stocks in a sustainable manner. It is to be credited to the third country’s budget. The Commission will then give the country with which the agreement is concluded active support in the form of know-how, enabling it, for example, to make fisheries controls more efficient or to improve research into the condition of stocks. I am convinced that new partnership agreements of this kind will be of great benefit both to the developing countries and to the Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He referred to a debate in the Scottish Parliament and a statement by a Conservative Member of that Parliament to the affect that it is incumbent on me, as Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, to represent the views of the UK Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, may I say that I cannot answer for statements made by members of other parliaments, whoever or wherever they may be. Secondly, in view of the fact that the UK Government is a Labour government, and I am a Conservative, it would be rather strange, to say the least, if I felt obliged to represent their views either in my capacity as Chairman of the Fisheries Committee or indeed in any other role.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hudghton seems unusually exercised by my role as Fisheries Committee Chairman these days. It is a great pity that he chooses to divert his energies into cheap, political point-scoring, rather than standing up for Scotland's beleaguered fishing industry. However, he may rest assured that I conduct my role as Chairman of the Fisheries Committee in an even-handed and democratic manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the Cunha report, may I firstly place on record, as Mr Fischler and Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna have done before me, the great appreciation of the members of the Fisheries Committee and indeed of most if not all of the Members of this House for the work undertaken by Mr Cunha during his term of office as an MEP representing Portugal. He has now, of course, returned to Portugal to take up a very senior position and we all wish him well for the future. I am sure that we will see more of him in the days to come.</p>
<p class="contents">The high quality of the work undertaken by Mr Cunha has indeed been reflected in this report on an integrated framework for fisheries partnership agreements with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people are currently expressing anxiety over international fisheries agreements entered into between the EU and these third countries. Documentary film-makers and indeed some international NGOs have beaten a path to countries like Senegal and Mauritania in West Africa, intent on exposing the ravages of greedy European fishermen. Against a background of collapsing fish stocks in EU waters, due, allegedly, to massive over-fishing, these critics claim that Europe is now hell-bent on exporting its problems to these developing nations. Other critics point the finger at the ubiquitous Spanish and French fleets, claiming that such third country agreements, although funded by the EU, are only of benefit to Spain and France.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to set the record straight, and the Cunha report sets out to do this. Firstly, we should explore why the EU finds it necessary to enter into such agreements for international fishing rights. When Spain joined the EU it brought with it a distant water fleet of heavy trawlers, which had plied the world's oceans for centuries. Having only a narrow continental shelf and with limited fisheries resources of their own, Basque and Galician fishermen were catching cod off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador five hundred years before Christopher Columbus 'discovered' America. France has a similar tradition.</p>
<p class="contents">However, just as fast as EU fish stocks are collapsing, stocks of migrating fish are being savagely cut as a result of the new regulations that we are imposing through the common fisheries policy. At the same time, consumer demand for fish in the EU is rising. We are now only 60% self-sufficient in meeting this demand. Consumers are turning away from red meats because of fears about BSE, foot-and-mouth and other scare stories, and are turning to fish as a healthy alternative. To meet this surging demand, the EU has two alternatives. Either it can import fish from outside the Community, increasing our balance of trade deficit and exporting valuable fishing jobs, or we can harness the expertise of the Community's distant water fleet which may well be largely Spanish and French, thus maintaining EU employment in the fisheries sector while, at the same time, ensuring that EU hygiene and food safety standards are maintained. The choice is not difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, while contracts entered into with third countries have seen EU trawlers from Spain, Portugal, France, Ireland and, to a lesser extent Greece and the UK, deployed around the globe from the Southern Oceans to the North Pole, there has been rising concern at the exploitative nature of some of these agreements. In Mauritania, off the West Coast of Africa, it was claimed that Spanish trawlers were hoovering up thousands of tonnes of fish, depleting local stocks, driving native fishermen out of work and causing famine amongst the coastal communities.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the EU had to develop a new system for drawing up these agreements. In future, third country agreements must be a partnership between the EU and the contracting nation, embracing a continuous monitoring process to ensure that a sustainable fishery is maintained. We want a significant proportion of the contract price to be devoted to buying fishing rights. But, and this is equally as important, we also want a significant contribution to be devoted to conservation and development objectives, with monitoring and surveillance high on the list. The EU has recognised its responsibility to the countries with whom we enter into these agreements, while at the same time maintaining its long tradition of distant water fishing to keep a steady supply of good, healthy fish on Europe's tables.</p>

I would also like to emphasise how much he will be missed in this Parliament, in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and in the Committee on Fisheries. I might add that I wish him every success with his duties in his senior position in the government of a great Portuguese region, the North. Even though I am a member of a different political party from Mr Cunha, furthermore, I do not have the problem of which the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Struan Stevenson, complained here. Since he is not a member of the UK Labour Party, Mr Stevenson distanced himself from UK Government policy. I do not have the same problem, but that is just a question of style: the British style on the one hand and, on the other, the Portuguese, Iberian style.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, moreover, Mr President, I would like to begin by underlining how correct and balanced I believe Mr Cunha’s report, as well as the Commission communication, to be. I wish I could be as reserved as Commissioner Fischler, who to all intents and purposes confined himself to expressing his agreement with the report, which he felt endorsed the content of the Commission communication. That much is true. There does not seem to be any major disagreement between us on this matter. I would say that the European Union has developed a very interesting type of diplomacy in the field of fisheries. As Mr Stevenson also said, that diplomacy has led to a very interesting and very original model for fisheries agreements, one which we might even consider exemplary and which could quite happily act as a model for distant water fisheries negotiations between other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">That diplomacy should continue to develop freely, I would argue, with a view to upholding the interests of the European Union’s distant water fleet. This fleet must not be considered as belonging to Portugal, or to Spain, or to France: rather, it should be understood to be a European Union fleet, since the Commission is our only spokesperson, our only representative in these international relationships. Mr President, I support Mr Cunha’s report, as well as the content of the Commission’s text. I hope that distant water fishing in the European Union will continue to develop along the three axes of the conservation of resources, support for the poorest communities and also equal treatment for those working in the fishing industry. To conclude, I would say that we must combat illegal fishing and flags of convenience, which are, at times, the worst enemies of genuine fishing and fishermen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our debate takes place in a context where, first, some stocks in certain northern waters are in crisis and others are endangered. Second, many more are being over-exploited on a global basis. In addition, a report published last week by the International Food Policy Research Institute indicates that, if China is included, developing countries now account for more than 70% of the production of fish for food including both wild fisheries and aquaculture. The consequences are that the EU is dependent on imports of fish and that many EU fishers pursue their activities in other waters.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR accepts, therefore, that there is merit in negotiating fisheries partnership agreements with third countries, rather than leaving matters to bilateral arrangements which may lack consistency both between each other and in supporting the requirements of sustainable development. We do, however, have very strong views about the nature of any agreements made by the EU. First, the agreements reached should be genuine partnership ones and of mutual benefit. We believe that our amendment to paragraph 7 gives fuller expression to this idea than the original paragraph. Second, the agreement should be both responsible and transparent in budgetary terms, so we have amendments calling for renewal of agreements to be dependent on evidence that past monies have been spent as intended. We also call for an equitable - that is just to say a fair or just - sharing of payments by the EU vessel owners involved.</p>
<p class="contents">On paragraph 11, whilst it may be right to forecast an increase in the number of agreements reached, we cannot be certain of this and would prefer by oral amendment to replace the words 'the increase' with 'any increase'.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the agreement should promote sustainability. We are pleased with the extent to which the report makes reference to the principles involved and hope to see these built on where the details of any future agreement are concerned, notably by introducing specific provisions for protecting the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the House to support both this report and their amendments to it. As Mr Stevenson has already said, we must ensure that we do not try to solve our domestic problems by exporting them to developing countries. Experience already tells us just how counterproductive such an approach would be. Indeed, wherever we come from in the EU we have a very strong interest in ensuring the sustainability of fisheries not only in our own waters but beyond. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to this report, I would like to say that international fisheries agreements are undoubtedly a highly important aspect of the common fisheries policy, since they ensure that fishing activity is maintained in many regions of the European Union, and provide direct employment for 30 000 people. They help reduce the Community trade deficit in fish products and account for more than 20% of all Community catches. For these reasons, we should give this report our full support. Studies indicate that every euro invested in these fishing agreements generates economic activity to the value of three euros, meaning that the benefits clearly outweigh the costs. It is important, therefore, to improve and enhance this area, even taking account of the conclusions of the Fisheries Council of October 1997, which has been mentioned here already. This is even more important, moreover, given that there are those who would cast doubt on these agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you, however, that the Commission should take account of certain important aspects of these agreements. One of those central questions is that of appropriate funding. While coherence is certainly needed between the common fisheries policy and development policy, it should not be forgotten that these agreements are essentially commercial in nature: though they should take the development angle into account, the funding for these fishing agreements should come from the fisheries sector, while funding for development policies should derive from elsewhere in the Community budget – from increased amounts for cooperation and development, to be more precise. More partnership agreements should be developed, therefore, balancing the interests of the various countries and parts of the fleet concerned in an equitable way.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by echoing the rapporteur’s statement that it beggars belief that different conditions should apply under agreements within the European Union: under certain agreements, the vessel owners pay fishing licence fees, while under others they pay nothing. This problem, therefore, must be resolved urgently, as must the issue of paper quotas and the opportunity for unused fishing rights to be temporarily transferred. I hope that our support for Mr Cunha’s report will also convince the Commission to take equal note of the proposals he presents in the course of his work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is all very well just changing the name of 'fisheries agreements' to 'partnership agreements', which sounds very good. 'Partnership' sounds like something that is fair and equitable, but, at the end of the day, what we need to see is that this is what actually happens.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment we are only talking about discussion documents from the Commission and when I hear some of the other speakers talking about trade diplomacy, we have to be very careful that this is not about coercion. When we talk about fisheries agreements, looking at Mr Cunha's report and comparing it with one we may have seen five or six years ago in this Parliament, it is better. However, if you look at the underlying majority view of the Committee on Fisheries and, indeed, of this Parliament, it is that the purpose of agreements is to supply European consumers with fish and to keep European fishermen in work. Any other consideration is secondary. This is not acceptable. We cannot talk about sustainability and development as two separate items.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards exporting our problem in relation to overcapacity within the European Union, this has been the tradition up until now: fisheries agreements have been used to export our excess capacity to other parts of the world. When we talk about the countries that are benefiting, I know that when I first came to this Parliament, Ireland was not one of these countries. It clearly is now. Irrespective of what countries are benefiting from within the European Union, what we need to look at is how the developing countries are actually benefiting. I do not see anything yet to prove that the European Union has not merely a sustainable approach to fisheries agreements, but also an approach that takes into account the concerns of the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an agreement at the moment that there will be a separation in relation to payments. This will distinguish the development aspect from the other aspects of the fisheries agreements. But that is not enough. We need to get proof from the Commission that this is what is going to happen, because it is completely unfair to talk about fair trade, an equitable approach to developing countries while at the same time using developing countries by exporting our capacity to those countries. We have to take that into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have to take into account what happened with Morocco. Are our European taxpayers' monies going, in the future, to pay for the collapse of other fisheries agreements? I am talking in particular of Mauritania. This is something that needs to be taken into account. Developing countries are not going to take for granted the situation that has been put to them with the only choice they have. We have to live up to our responsibilities and cut down on our excess capacity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The world changed in 1976, as the empty ports of Hull and Grimsby can testify. We would not even be having this debate if it were not for the total, abject failure of the CFP and the need for more and more waters. And yet, as early as 1994, the warnings from Senegal were there for all to see, at least for those who wanted to.</p>
<p class="contents">These deals have caused havoc and destruction, both environmentally and socially, in some of the poorest parts of the world. What is the response from the Commission? It is the use of this wonderful word 'partnership', which, as yet, means nothing. But the Commission's spin goes a bit further than that. It says that if it were not the EU doing it, then it would be private enterprise, and there would be somebody out there who is 'worse than us'.</p>
<p class="contents">I have seen Kenya, where private enterprises have been causing problems, but in my view two wrongs do not make a right. Perhaps the only good news is that a growing number of Members here are beginning to wake up to what these deals really mean and the opposition in this Parliament is now up to over 100.</p>

Whereas the European Union faces a large shortfall in the increasing amount of fish it consumes and has to import almost half of that amount, the fisheries agreements alone provide one-fifth of total Community catches, worth around EUR one billion and constitutes a particularly significant source of employment both for European countries that have a tradition of distant fishing and for their overseas partners.</p>
<p class="contents">This production takes place under controlled, supervised and responsible conditions, giving European consumers solid guarantees of traceability and of fishing methods that are vastly superior to those provided by third-country imports. These fisheries agreements, which serve a commercial purpose, are a good investment for the Union and those who wish to call into question the appropriateness of these agreements and halt their progress would do well to take a close look at the study produced by the Ifremer Institute, which proves that every euro we invest in this framework generates economic activity worth three times as much. The economic balance-sheet is also broadly positive for the partner countries. Investment must therefore be pursued, and even taken further, particularly in the framework our network of tuna agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the EU-Mauritius agreement, I have been able to assess the scale of the mutual economic interests involved in this key sector that those working in the field in Europe have developed with a number of ACP partners in the Indian Ocean and with Latin American partners. These agreements are a source of supply and of processing activity for European countries and a source of jobs and development for partner countries, and must consequently be supported and extended. When the Commission talks about the coherence that is needed between the various Community policies, it must ensure in particular coherence between the common fisheries policy and trade policy. Hence a misjudged concession made at the WTO on tinned tuna imports in the context of a general removal of customs tariffs, could undermine years of effort and investment, destroy a mutually beneficial sector and lead to relocations that heavily penalise our partners first of all and then us.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore wish to draw the Commission’s attention, Mr President, to this issue, as our Assembly did when it adopted the amendment I tabled during the vote on my report on the agreement with Mauritius. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me follow that up with an old adage – not to say an old truth – to the effect that Europe has too few fish; the waters around the Member States cannot meet our demand for them. That is a fact, and it is one with which we have to deal. Let me take this opportunity to emphasise the fundamental point that we have not started by emptying European waters of fish, only to seek out new fishing grounds in which to do the same thing. It is far more a case of traditional European fishing grounds having been lost as a result of the extension of the exclusive economic zones to 200 nautical miles, which happened as long ago as the 1970s. It is in order to compensate for this loss that the EU has concluded fisheries agreements with third states.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we have twenty-one of these agreements with countries in both the North and the South. The contribution they make to Europe’s economy is an important one; it might even be described as irreplaceable. We, for our part, get the fresh fish that we urgently need, whilst important jobs are safeguarded at home and abroad in the fishing and fish-processing industries. With such a resource as fish, though, a resource that is finite and sensitive to adverse environmental factors, economic considerations must not obscure environmental ones or blind us to conditions in the third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I very much welcome the Commission’s new joint approach. I also believe that it needs to be brought to life, and it is more compatible with our objective of sustainable fisheries. The agreement is nonetheless concerned with a commercial activity, that is to say, simply with fishing in foreign waters and with the economic yield derived from it. I take the view that the amount of funding should reflect the real value of the fishing rights. Fisheries policy should not be used to cloak the objectives of development policy. That is what we have specific budget lines for, and that is why I am not the only one to take this line.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see fisheries agreements in the future too – modern and sustainable ones, founded on partnership – but the benefits and burdens must be shared out fairly among all parties. Furthermore, we cannot look at these things from the perspective of using European money to provide permanent subsidies, if only a few Member States end up reaping the rewards. Nor should we forget the decisive point that Parliament must be better informed in view of the large amounts expended from the European Budget. Indeed, I take the view – and I am certainly not the only one to do so – that Parliament must have a part to play in negotiations, not tomorrow, but today. This is where something, at last, needs to be done!</p>

<p class="contents">Third-party fishing agreements have come under a lot of scrutiny recently, with headlines such as 'EU fishing fleets devastate Third World' and 'West African nations to ban EU fishing fleets'. A recent WWF report highlighting the problems in Angola makes for interesting reading. On the one hand, the EU is providing emergency aid to Angola but, on the other, has signed a fishing agreement which would take from Angolan waters vital fish stocks which go to some of the poorest people in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">According to UNEP, the United Nations Environment Programme, which focused on Mauritania, Argentina and Senegal, all countries have noticed a depletion in their stocks after signing third-party fishing agreements. In Mauritania, catches of octopus have halved in the past four years and in Senegal two thirds of the country's export earnings are reliant on fish exported to Europe. Over half the fish we consume in the EU now comes from outside the EU and half of this is on the basis of third-party fishing agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Of primary concern is the subsequent depletion of fish stocks, the dependence of local communities in developing countries on these stocks for their own food, the poor enforcement rules and catch limits and the apparent contradictions that seem to exist between the EU fisheries policy and EU development policy. All these issues concern many MEPs.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for environmental impact to be taken into consideration with third-party fishing agreements is paramount. I like the fact that the rapporteur has underlined the importance of sustainable fisheries and is highlighting this fact, which should apply to all vessels within the waters affected.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I regret that, for example, in Angola where 35% of the EUR 15.5 million paid is supposed to go towards small-scale fisheries projects, it is actually unclear if this money will go to this aim or not. These concerns are very real and that is why I support the ELDR's Amendment No 2. This amendment would make new fishing agreements dependent upon the presentation of satisfactory evidence that monies paid under the previous agreements for targeted measures have been spent as intended.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not be seen to be renewing agreements where the third party has not fulfilled their side of the bargain. However, fishing agreements should not be signed if they would be detrimental to the long-term socio-economic interests of the country concerned. Third-party fishing agreements play an important role in providing the EU with fish. However, what are we going to do when their fish stocks run out? We should not be destroying the viability of countries and crucial stocks for the future for short-term gain. Third-party fishing agreements must take into account the future viability of stocks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My concluding remarks can be relatively brief. In particular, I would also like to express my gratitude for the great deal of support that our report has received. The one thing that has to be clear is that we cannot apply double standards. The principles that we in the Community apply to our own Community waters must also apply in agreements with third states. That is particularly the case when a sensible and effective conservation policy is needed, but also when seeking to ensure that any decisions taken are based upon current best knowledge. It is by these principles that we want to be guided in future.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we actually mean by a partnership agreement? A partnership exists when, to coin a phrase, the parties to it can meet on the level, with neither dominating the other. That is what we intend to ensure in future. This is about cooperating not only when we want to fish in a third state’s waters; it is, moreover, about us playing our part and working with these countries to enable them – provided that they have an interest in this – to build up their own fishing industries, not only as regards the catching of fish but also its processing. This is an essential aspect of the development that we want to promote – as we indeed should. All this, of course, can only work if these states are wholeheartedly interested and collaborate fully, but we are discovering in practice that such is increasingly the case, and so I can see our concluding of these agreements developing a very positive way.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only say that these principles must be put to the test in concrete negotiations, when Parliament, too, will have the opportunity to ascertain whether or not every one of these newly-concluded agreements comes up to scratch.</p>
