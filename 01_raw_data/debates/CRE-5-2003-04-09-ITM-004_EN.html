Particularly after the attacks in New York on 11 September 2001, the fear of terrorism was so great that all kinds of suggestions were made which had no place in a democracy. Fortunately, the panic has peaked, and such authoritarian initiatives are often rejected by a majority of this Parliament. In this case, the Danish Government is suggesting limiting free access to documents and not giving Parliament the necessary say in respect of Europol’s budget. The opportunities for control by the national parliaments are also not being reinforced. Even the director of Europol is of the opinion that democratic control is inadequate, but the Council does not want to change that. The Council must get out of that habit.

<p class="contents">I consider this approach to be clearly misguided and to be based on dangerous and hasty premises. These are premises that take their inspiration solely from imposing a federalist ideological agenda on the attempts made by the Council, using the current institutional framework and the framework regulated by the Treaties, to make real progress in this area. Furthermore, if any subject calls for the utmost prudence and cooperation between Member States, it is precisely that of the exercise, powers and monitoring of transnational police activity. We might not like the current pillar-based structure, but, while it exists – and this is the structure that exists – this is the framework in which we must work – and work responsibly.</p>
<p class="contents">I have therefore rejected the rapporteur’s proposal. The best thing to do would be for Parliament to follow up the three initiatives in question, by responsibly suggesting the amendments that it has decided on, whilst complying with the legal framework...</p>

The latter contained essentially helpful amendments to the Europol Convention. Nonetheless, the von Boetticher report eventually rejects this initiative. The reasons given are typical of the European Parliament’s approach. It is against a protocol that would amend a convention. I refer to intergovernmental legal instruments respecting national sovereignty. It argues for a European constitution to be adopted first. It is hoped such a constitution would allow all these amendments to be handled by means of a qualified majority of members in the framework of the Community system.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, however, issues of police cooperation must remain within the competence of the States and under their control, together with all issues relating to the movement of persons and immigration. The European cooperation required should therefore be organised in the framework of a so-called interparliamentary pillar. This is what we suggested in our contribution to the Convention, and I would refer you to our Internet site: <span class="underline">www.autre-europe.org</span>.

In fact, the misguided ideological reasons underlying the issue that has been raised stand out even more clearly here.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite astounding that Mr von Boetticher claims expressly in his explanatory statement, that he ‘acknowledges the significance of the Danish proposal as it seems to take a step in the right direction’ – only then to conclude that he must recommend rejecting it! Why? Because he believes it would be a mistake to adopt amendments to the Europol Convention ‘prior to the ratification of the European Constitution’!</p>
<p class="contents">This assessment is misguided. It is both possible and necessary to move ahead within the current framework and this is where we ought to participate responsibly and, incidentally, keeping to the method of taking small steps, since this is the method that has ensured the success of European integration. This was precisely the approach adopted in the proposals put forward by the Danish and Greek Presidencies. The rapporteurs, however, would have needed... a Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">The line that is proposed constitutes a serious deviation from the agenda. I have therefore rejected it, as a way of expressing my support for pursuing the Danish initiative. The radical approach that has been adopted is extremely negative and clearly disregards the interests of the European citizens. Parliament should pursue the initiative, suggesting responsibly whatever amendments it considers appropriate, whilst strictly respecting the current legal framework. This is precisely what the rule of law is and we could do worse than show an example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We do not agree with any of these points. I therefore voted against the Böge report.</p>

Clearly therefore, I did not support those opposed to enlargement of any kind. I was unable to vote in favour, however, because the enlargement decided on at Copenhagen will not be implemented in an open and systematic manner. We shall instead descend into confusion. In time, European integration is likely to grind to a halt as a result of enlargement. The economic and social situation of almost all the new Member States is precarious, to say the least. Calculated in terms of purchasing power, their standard of living is about 40% of the Community average. Nonetheless, accession aid amounted to only 0.03% of Community GDP, according to the report by Mr Wim Kok. In other words, it is a pittance. The SAPARD appropriations intended to facilitate structural adjustment of agriculture in the candidate countries disappeared into a maze of Community red tape. Only 6.48% of the EUR 1.04 billion initially allocated for 2000 and 2001 was implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, the accession of the new Member States must be made conditional upon the results of referendums in the current Member States, and thirdly, the fact is that the new Member States are not yet ready for this enlargement. I would furthermore like to underline the fact that this enlargement is coming at a time when Europe has never been as divided as it is now. We still have a great deal of work to do, particularly in the area of foreign policy. It is essential that Europe develop its own identity in that area. Furthermore, we must put an end to the profligacy of the European agricultural policy before we can proceed with enlargement.

Sadly, divisions within Europe have become more marked in recent months. Sadly also, the Convention has failed to make progress during that period. It is now resigned to achieving no more than cosmetic changes to the current system. All are resigned to the signature of the constitutional treaty not taking place in December 2003 as originally planned. There is no mistaking the signs.

Allow me to explain the reasons for my vote. It emerges from the Convention’s current work on the constitution that a stateless nation such as Catalonia has nothing to gain from enlargement. Its representation in European institutions will continue to depend on the good will of the relevant Member States. The House will however be aware of the attitude adopted by the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of France. The Convention has not led to any breakthrough regarding explicit recognition of the right to self-determination and internal enlargement. It has not promoted the cause of Catalan becoming an official language at European level either. In these circumstances, the accession of new Member States will only aggravate Catalonia’s relative position within the Union. For example, it will lose representation and its contributions will be increased. Several of the new Member States have fallen far short of compliance with the Copenhagen criteria on respect for the rights of their minorities, for example the retention of the Beneš Decrees by Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Lastly, the stance of most of these new Member States on the terrible war in Iraq appears to put a question mark over the whole process of European integration. All those aiming at a Europe capable of countering the irresponsible supremacy of the United States must roll their sleeves up and get to work on a European Europe. At present, enlargement seems reminiscent of lemmings rushing to the sea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why I voted against the Brok report. In my view however, it is unfair to penalise innocent parties for a delay that is entirely our fault. Consequently, I voted in favour of assent. I support enlargement and strengthening, and I am against agreeing to give up on strengthening.

This was because of the ambiguous nature of the wording concerning independence of the foreign and defence policies of a future enlarged Union from the United States. The institutional and financial provision for enlargement is not good. There is a real risk of losing ground as regards political integration, and financial programming is patently inadequate. Our own shortcomings cannot, however, justify our holding 10 nations hostage as we struggle with the Council, nor can they justify our slamming the door against the prospective entrants.</p>
<p class="contents">More than 10 years have passed since the fall of the Iron Curtain. It is now our historical duty to welcome these countries into the Union. We alone are responsible for the delay in institutional reform. Following the unsatisfactory Treaty of Nice, the backlog made it necessary to convene the Convention in order to give Europe a constitution at last. At the earliest, the latter will be adopted after a short IGC in the wake of the Convention, and before 1 May 2004. There should be no mistake about what is at issue today, however. We are not taking decisions on institutional matters or financial perspectives. We are saying yes or no to entire peoples taking up their rightful place in the Union. We are deciding the future of peoples whose historical fate it was to be excluded from the process of building a democratic Europe for half a century.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on the new entrants will fight alongside us for the future of the Union. They have to help us stop drifting towards a free trade area and set our course towards creating a high quality social model. They will join us in the struggle for a political Europe able to speak with one strong voice in the world. They will work with us on a constitution allowing interested countries the freedom to establish a joint foreign and defence policy, thus breaking new ground for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The applicant countries should have been offered more flexible conditions, including different types of association agreements with mutual influence and mutual obligations instead of the colonial style EEA-agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Membership should have been offered with variable geometry, lasting derogations, long-term derogations and derogations dependent on the future economic development towards cohesion, fully taking into account the different levels of economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">The applicant countries should be allowed to decide on their own regarding the buying and selling of agricultural land and second houses, at least until their incomes are comparable to ours.</p>
<p class="contents">Waiting for agricultural reform and a fair deal, the applicant countries should be able to have the amounts provided for in the agricultural budgets as lump sums, instead of being bound to use the money in the silly, wasteful and inefficient way we have done.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of paying full contributions from the first day of membership, they should at least have been offered the five years' rebate that was offered to the UK, Denmark and Ireland, or free membership until they reach a certain income.</p>
<p class="contents">Many civil servants from the applicant countries will now be offered lucrative jobs in the EU institutions with salaries far above the salaries offered to their own prime ministers. The applicant countries shall have a possibility to tax their nationals, employed by the EU and in the EU countries to avoid unfair inequalities, where their citizens are asked to pay contributions from poor budgets to fellow citizens, e.g. paid 20 times the normal salary at home.</p>
<p class="contents">The applicant countries should be offered more flexibility in the application of EU rules. They should adopt the rules gradually by following our rules, such as when they export their products to our markets, but not apply all the rules to their home market, e.g. we should accept the sale of sausages in local markets, when they comply with local laws.</p>
<p class="contents">The fulfilment of common environmental standards should be financed by Community funds so that environmental protection is not spurned in the applicant countries or postponed for better times. The applicant countries should also be allowed to keep their standards, especially when they are higher than ours.</p>
<p class="contents">The applicant countries should take full part in the Convention with full membership and have their fair share of the posts in the Praesidium and the Secretariat. Also, the treaty resulting from the Convention should be adopted by an IGC with the eastern countries as full members.</p>
<p class="contents">All EU treaties and rules should have been translated into the applicant country languages and been made available for the citizens through libraries and the Internet in good time before the referendums. The Yes-side and the No-side should have equal public funding. The governments and the EU institutions should not be allowed to interfere with biased information before the referendums.</p>

<p class="contents">As we look to the future, we must also remember ‘the past’, the ideals of the founders of the European Economic Community. Peace, democracy and prosperity are as important today as they were fifty years ago. We now have the opportunity to revitalise the process and bring a positive message to the peoples of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">From the outset, they will be equals, they will have the same rights as the existing members.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in giving my support to this report and the accession process, I also wish to see the accession countries, national parliaments and governments having the same voting rights at the European Convention as the existing Member States of the Union.</p>

Promises given have not been honoured. The Union’s structures have not been adjusted to allow for smooth functioning with 25 Member States in the near future. It will be even more difficult to function in the more distant future when there are 40 Member States. To make things worse, the necessary finance for enlargement as provided for in the treaty is not guaranteed. This contravenes the agreement reached at the Berlin Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the Community will soon stall. The chances of creating the social Europe we sorely need will therefore be reduced. Territorial cohesion will also be threatened, when it is now more essential than ever. Moreover, the Community we longed for and worked towards for 50 years will not survive this enlargement, but will be replaced by a bland and featureless Union. We set out to build a cathedral and ended up in a department store.</p>

This is an historic day for Europe. Europe is united in freedom. This is a development that the CSU members in Parliament welcome. For many years, we have played a leading role in bringing about this historic event, but, despite all the rejoicing that attends this day, doubts still remain as regards the Czech Republic.</p>
<p class="contents">European constitutional thinking knows nothing of the idea that one injustice cancels out another. It was the European Parliament that, alone, in the course of negotiations on accession, brought to European public attention Czech law's failure to deal with the past, and, over a period of years, demanded that this be sorted out. Parliament's initiatives have been taken up neither by Commissioner Verheugen, who is responsible for these matters, nor by the German Government.</p>
<p class="contents">In vain do we wait for a political gesture in a spirit of reconciliation. It is the opposite that has happened, for, on 24 April 2002, the Czech parliament unanimously passed a resolution to the effect that the legal consequences of the Beneš decrees were ‘unquestionable, inviolable and unchangeable’. The Czech Republic is, of course, a country at the heart of Europe, but we have nonetheless voted against its accession with the intention of sending Czech politicians the message that the wounds inflicted in the past on the expelled Germans are still open, and that we must heal them together, in dialogue with one another. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Enlargement is in danger of becoming a dog’s dinner as a number of preliminary conditions have not been met. Some of these are detailed below.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning first to institutional conditions, clearly the Convention will not lead to a major overhaul of the institutions. It will therefore not enable them to become more democratic and comprehensible. It will not allow for secularism to be declared a fundamental principle of the Union either.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to social conditions, so far there is no provision for a social treaty to accompany the draft constitution for Europe. Such a treaty would contain guarantees to help deal with the danger of business relocation together with assurances regarding public services.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, the agreement cobbled together at the eleventh hour violated the rights of the European Parliament. It sets enlargement in an unrealistic financial framework that discriminates against the accession countries. It threatens the success of the whole enterprise, notably that of the CAP. Readjustment of the CAP to focus on rural development is also at risk.</p>

This enlargement of the Union is best understood as the reunification of the peoples of our continent. At long last all Europeans are coming together to share common fundamental values such as freedom, democracy, solidarity and respect for human rights and the environment. As Members of the European Parliament we should rejoice in having played a part in this process, and commit ourselves to ensuring its success.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we must regret that the budget allocated to this enlargement is inadequate for the scale of the project and for our common future. It is derisory. I would recall for reference that between 1948 and 1951 the United States contributed the equivalent of EUR 97 billion to help Western Europe recover from the devastation caused by war. That amounted to 1.5% of the GDP of the United States. Between 1990 and 1999 EUR 600 billion was invested to finance recovery in the former East Germany. The European Council is only prepared to allocate 0.15% of the Union’s GDP to enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on we must demonstrate solidarity as we respond to continental challenges of this kind. It is worth bearing in mind that our future will henceforth be inextricably linked to that of our new friends and neighbours, and that it is up to us to make that future a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Present-day Czech politicians must wonder why they did so badly, with 489 votes in favour, 39 votes against, and 37 abstentions. As a member of the EU/Czech Republic Joint Parliamentary Committee, I experienced, over the past four years, the Czech's intolerable arrogance at first hand. Over and over again, I appealed to Prague to meet us halfway in the matter of the wretched Beneš decrees, and in this way draw a line under the unpleasantnesses of the past. On each occasion, the politicians in Prague refused categorically to do so. My yes in the vote today is therefore a signal to today's young Czechs, who will, it may be hoped, soon be calling the political tune in Germany's neighbouring republic. I wish the present holders of political office in the Czech Republic much joy from the arguments in their own country as to why the vote in the European Parliament in Strasbourg was such a poor result for them.

From the outset, we did not wish to hinder the choice of the peoples of Eastern Europe in any way. They were to be free to decide whether or not to accede to the Union. If existing Member States put up barriers, this would be interpreted as the construction of a so-called fortress Europe for the richer countries. The latter would be criticised for failing to show solidarity with other peoples wishing to accede to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We do however wish to speak out against the conditions of this enlargement on the cheap. It does not provide for equality between the members. No proper account is taken either of the increase in poverty and unemployment in the candidate countries. These social problems were caused by the policies adopted over the last 10 years in order to meet the criteria for accession.</p>
<p class="contents">It can readily be understood that the peoples affected are now seeking compensation in the form of rights and structural and agricultural funds. Unfortunately, the European Union tends to regard the new members as second class countries. It waxes eloquent over the reunification of the continent, deeming it a political and historical achievement. At the same time it prevents the free movement of people. It heralds democracy and pluralism, but the aims of the changes imposed and the means used to achieve them smack of dogmas leading to social regression. The conditions imposed on appropriations and aid are examples of this. The countries of Eastern Europe are particularly affected.

We cannot deal with all these problems at once; we lack the means to do so, or at any rate the willingness to mobilise the means.

That is why the EU can work only if the Convention and the governments decide on a real constitution, one that is democratic and transparent.

The reason why I voted against the Brok Report is that it presents us with a world of illusions. I could not even vote in favour of the accession of Poland, where too much is getting out of hand, and the Polish Government is playing an active part in the abhorrent war of aggression in Iraq.

This will put an end to the calamitous division of Europe. I rejoice to be able to be present at this historic moment.</p>
<p class="contents">However much I may rejoice in the accessions, I continue to have doubts about the Czech Republic. Whilst I want the Czech Republic to join the EU, I cannot close my eyes to the fact that the Beneš decrees, which legitimised the expulsion of individual ethnic groups, continue to be in force there to this day.</p>
<p class="contents">I cast my vote against the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union. I do not regard it as acceptable for the Czech Republic to continue, to this day, to fail to distance itself from the Beneš decrees in an appropriate manner and thus to acknowledge that the expulsions were an injustice. My vote is intended to be a signal.</p>
<p class="contents">I especially want to draw attention to the so-called ‘Immunity Act’, which continues to give legitimacy to the gravest offences and crimes of the post-war period. Years ago, on the initiative of CSU/CDU MEPs, Parliament called on the Czech Republic to suspend the decrees and laws still in force, in so far as they related to the expulsion of specific ethnic groups from the former Czechoslovakia. The Czech Republic did not comply; quite the contrary. In addition, in April 2002, the Czech Parliament even unanimously declared the effects of the Beneš decrees on law and property rights to be ‘unquestionable, inviolable and unchangeable’. I see that as clear evidence that the Czechs are not willing to make a gesture of political reconciliation. It is this background that makes it urgently necessary to complete this chapter of history. The European Union is a community of laws and values, and one of its elementary obligations is that of protecting minorities. This must be recognised by every country desirous of acceding to the European Union, and for the Czech Republic to ignore this fact is unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am therefore delighted this is about to happen at last, after so many delays caused intentionally by the European federalists.</p>
<p class="contents">The candidate countries have shown themselves capable of introducing the necessary changes in order to join the Union. The latter, however, is currently seized by a dangerous paralysis and I am concerned about the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur referred to strengthening the Union’s institutional capacity. I hold the opposite view. As I see it, enlargement must involve moving away from the old Community method. The stance adopted by future Member States on the eve of military intervention in Iraq confirms my view. Our concept of European solidarity dates back to the early days of European integration. The new Member States understand solidarity quite differently. Those are the facts and we must accept them.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no point in calling for more integration, a supranational level and uniformity. If we attempt to create a Europe of 25 Member States as the rapporteur suggests, everything will grind to a halt.</p>

I thought carefully before doing so, because it means committing the Union to a long and difficult process. It should be borne in mind, however, that creating the Union has always been a difficult process. We must expect it to be long too. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe wishing to accede to our Union have made tremendous efforts in order to join. They modernised their economies quickly and reformed their social systems. Their political systems became democratic. All this was achieved in a few short years. They are to be commended on their courage and the sacrifices they made. The peoples of Central and Eastern Europe have a very unsettled past. Its memories are still fresh in their minds. We cannot reject these people simply because we do not want to slow down our kind of Europe. We have no right to do so. The unification of Europe is a historical challenge. We do not have the right to miss this opportunity. We shall pay a heavy price if we do. The enlargement process must go hand in hand with a deepening of the institutions. We are well aware that deepening would not be taking place if enlargement were not on the horizon.</p>
<p class="contents">All those who earnestly hope for the success of enlargement will have understood that it is essential to vote for assent today. We will then be able to offer the hand of genuine fellowship to the peoples of these 10 countries. The European Union was created to promote the cause of peace. We are charged with keeping the spirit of peace alive and working for a better future for us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have always been strong advocates of the reunification of Europe. We have always tried to reverse the unnatural division imposed at Yalta. We have done all in our power to enable Europe to regain the use of both its lungs.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the European Union began by missing an historic opportunity. The countries of Eastern and Central Europe should have been offered the opportunity of acceding to the intergovernmental part of the treaties immediately after their liberation. Following this formal event, each state should have been allowed to opt for accession to one or other of the common policies. Appropriate timetables should have been devised to take account of local conditions. It could have been possible to eliminate corruption and avoid social upheavals.</p>
<p class="contents">None of this happened. Instead, after endless negotiations conducted by the Commission in its usual bureaucratic style, the same straitjacket and timetable were imposed on all. Borders and protection are to be done away with in one fell swoop, and a multiplicity of safeguard clauses appended to the treaties. The European Union will therefore have achieved something quite special. It will have contrived to replace delight in the renewal of old acquaintances with generalised concern. It would be irresponsible not to acknowledge that this delayed and uniform enlargement is now perceived as a threat rather than an opportunity by many in both East and West. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The political scope we had in 1994 to put the Council under pressure with the European Parliament and to demand deepening of the European Union prior to its enlargement no longer exists. This enlargement, which is of a different order, is again essentially a matter of the basic principles of the European project: political stability, peace and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">The accession countries and their populations have been preparing for this day for many years, in difficult conditions and with many sacrifices. These efforts and the prospect of accession have brought stability and peace in Europe. We must not upset this result today. After all, political stability, peace and security create the conditions for all other policy objectives.</p>

<p class="contents">This vote did indeed take place against the backdrop of a tense international situation. It should not, however, cast doubt over enlargement.

<p class="contents">The Copenhagen Council set a limit of EUR 40.8 billion on transfers from the Union to the new members up to 2006. In 1999 the Berlin Council had allocated 43 billion for the same time period, but for six countries. It follows that the Union now has less money with which to help more countries. Try to get your minds round that one! Furthermore, this budget of EUR 40.8 billion for three years is not quite what it seems. The 10 new Member States will have to contribute to it to the tune of EUR 15 billion. Mr Kok calculated that net transfers to the new countries will be restricted to about EUR 10 billion per year. That amounts to less than 0.1% of the GDP of the Union. Such generosity is bound to encourage the new Member States to restate their case again once they have seats on the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have, however, not voted to approve the accession of the Czech Republic, essentially for the following reasons. The first is that the Beneš decrees, on the basis of which, in 1945 and 1946, 3.2 million Germans were expatriated and deprived of their civil rights, are not obsolete. The second is that the Immunity Act, which is current law in the Czech Republic, is an offence against human rights as understood both in Europe and throughout the world. Thirdly, the European Union's human rights policy would cease to be credible if we were to accept a current law that exempts from punishment crimes committed against the German and Hungarian civilian population in the aftermath of the War. This is not about history, but about present-day politics. This is about the European Union being a community of values in accordance with the Copenhagen criteria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is unfortunate that my parents could not live to see this event. My mother died in January. They were expelled from their home, and lost a very great deal. My uncle was murdered in a Czech camp in 1946. Having, however, been brought up in a spirit of tolerance and forgiveness, there is one thing I can tell you, and that is that those who – to some extent justifiably – have voted today against the Czech Republic's accession because of the Beneš decrees, have forgotten the decisive truth that it is peoples who are accepted. We have to look forward rather than revert to the old politics of revenge; I see it as very, very important to stress that. In view of how certain members of the CSU have just voted against it, that is, alas, again no doubt attributable to elections in Bavaria, where they want to have air sovereignty over certain beer gardens where expellees gather. I cannot go along with that. I find it very regrettable that there are those here who were not big enough to take a forward-looking view of history, but remain imprisoned in their old feelings of desire for revenge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My confidence in the EU Member States is shattered to its foundations, for not only has their lack of unity in matters of foreign and security policy been demonstrated to Europe's detriment, but, for the same reasons, the Treaty of Nice failed to achieve the conditions required before enlargement can take place.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention has not yet produced an outcome, let alone a commitment to the new treaty text being ratified as soon as possible. I regard it as hypocritical to decide on enlargement while the European Union's unresolved problems are swept under the carpet. When this House has such an important decision to take, I would have liked to see more determination to defend its rights in relation to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Lest I be misunderstood, let me say that I am in favour of enlargement, and as soon as possible, even by 1 May 2004, but for that we need a new treaty basis, one that guarantees common action on crucial issues even when there are over 25 Member States.

I did not make this decision easy for myself. I brought myself, after mature consideration, to vote in favour of the Czech Republic's accession, something I did despite my rigorous position on the Beneš issue. The Immunity Act remains part of Czech law. It is an unjust law and a stain of dishonour. There is no place for it – none whatsoever – in a new Europe that takes seriously its affirmation of common values.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with great regret that I note that the Czech Government has not, to date, been magnanimous enough to make a gesture. Despite that, I have voted in favour of the Czech Republic's accession, thus demonstrating a trust that may, for all I know, be misplaced. I would, though, like to help break the vicious circle of misunderstanding and help break down entrenched positions, and I trust that this positive signal will also meet with a positive response from the Czechs.

The reunification of Eastern and Western Europe is for us an historical challenge. It can no longer be delayed. Minor differences must not be allowed to obstruct it.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement has already taken too long. As we suggested, the newly liberated countries of Eastern Europe should have been admitted to a kind of Greater European Confederation back in the early 1990s. This confederation would have been a forum with a variable geometry type of approach. It would have allowed specific types of cooperation to be developed to suit each country.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach would have required a U-turn in the process of European integration however, to bring in flexibility. The Commission expressed its opposition. It found ways of imposing a different approach. The Eastern countries were forced to wait until the superstate was ready before being allowed in.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to reiterate that this is the wrong approach. It has embittered the candidate countries and has failed to enable them to reach a good standard.

Czech Prime Ministers have described the post-World War expulsions as 'just' and 'necessary', and have even held them up as examples in present-day conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">This must be set against the statement in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights to the effect that 'collective expulsions are prohibited.'</p>
<p class="contents">It was for that reason that Parliament's resolution adopted on 20 November 2002 stated, under heading O, that ‘ethnically-fixated policies leading to collective expulsions and the destruction of cultural goods are a flagrant breach of fundamental human rights and the common European legal culture’.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an unambiguous verdict. It is not aimed at exacting restitution of any kind, but makes it clear that Czech positions such as those referred to are an offence against the most fundamental principles of law, which the EU exists to maintain. Although we note with satisfaction President Klaus' statement that the ‘events full of violence and human tragedies’, which had also befallen the Bohemian Germans, were ‘unacceptable acts from today's point of view’, nothing comparable has been said by the Czech Government, or by its parliament, or by groups or parties in it. They have therefore failed to dispel the doubts as to whether the Czech Republic has its roots in the ground of European legal culture. This means that not all the conditions for the Czech Republic's accession to the EU have been complied with, so that we are unable to vote in favour of it doing so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be borne in mind for example that over the last dozen years or so Germany has been devoting some 3% of its GDP to the new Länder to facilitate their structural adjustment. The Member States see themselves as net contributors. They will most certainly not agree to increasing the Union’s budget. In any case, the latter has a fixed ceiling of 1.27% of Community GDP. Consequently any future increase in structural aid to the new countries would have to be at the expense of current Union policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Kok report outlines two approaches to reducing the cost of enlargement. The first of these involves strict application of the rules concerning structural support. This would bring down the cost of enlargement to 0.11% of the Union’s GDP. It is likely that Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece would oppose such a course of action. The second approach involves reducing direct aid to agricultural income to 85% of its current level. The cost of enlargement would then be 0.10% of the Community’s budget. It would require sacrificing the common agricultural policy, however. There is certainly scope for reform of the latter, but it would be unfortunate if it were practically written out of existence. In principle, the cost of enlargement has only been set up to 2006. Subsequent years may therefore become a free-for-all as far as the budget is concerned. The Union’s decision-making process will not have been significantly improved, so blocking is only to be expected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am delighted that Cypriots are being supported in this House. It is vitally important that their wish to join the European Union should be respected. I have some reservations about aspects of the European project, but I am absolutely certain that those countries that wish to join should be allowed to join. Today is an historic day for Cyprus, as well as for the European Union. For too long Cyprus has been the victim of power politics in Europe. It has often suffered at the expense of decisions made by larger and more powerful nations. I know that accession to the European Union is seen by many Cypriots as a path to security and stability and will lead to a situation where Cyprus is at the heart of decision-making in Europe, with a seat at the top table of European decision-makers. I hope that the next few weeks will see the finalisation of the accession of Cyprus and that we will see this small island, which was once a victim in European politics, becoming an equal, respected and influential voice in shaping the future of our shared continent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is because Turkey has illegally occupied the north of the island. The occupation has actually been condemned both by the United Nations and by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I felt it best to vote ‘yes’ to accession. A ‘no’ vote would have penalised the people of Cyprus twice over. Already under Turkish occupation, the people would be rejected also by the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It would have been best to adopt a strong position in dealings with Turkey. After all, force is what it understands best. It should have been made clear to Turkey that it would lose its status as an associate of the European Union if it did not leave Northern Cyprus immediately. I very much regret that no such declaration was made in the past and trust it will be made in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this is not the approach currently adopted by the Union. The Union is still invoking conciliation. Furthermore, the accession of Turkey is now on the cards. Financial aid to that country is to be doubled and it has been granted pre-accession status.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of these circumstances, we insist all the countries of Europe hold a referendum before opening any future accession negotiations with Turkey. Allow me to emphasise once again that such a referendum must be held in advance of any negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For years the European Union held the belief that we needed a deeper Union before an enlarged Union. On many occasions the heads of state and government held forth that we needed to adapt the Union’s decision-making structures and mechanisms before the current wave of enlargement, or any subsequent enlargement. This was the objective of the Treaty of Nice, but the treaty failed to make any progress on the issue. In fact, it made the Council decision-making process more complicated. We therefore needed the European Convention. This should lead to a new treaty on the foundation of the Union, a European Constitution in other words. The signing of the Accession Treaties on 16 April will set enlargement in stone before the work on the Convention has been completed. Enlargement will go ahead when the situation of the institutions is still shrouded in uncertainty. This has been made even worse by the crisis in Iraq, which has shattered our aspirations for a common foreign and security policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every state, every government, has the right to decide whether or not to support Mr Bush’s bellicose policy. It has however become clear that the majority of the countries about to join the Union prefer an alliance with the United States and NATO to closer European integration. This has delighted British Government representatives to the European Convention. In an interview with the <span class="italic">Times</span>, Peter Hain clearly stated that he is building an alliance with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe against any moves towards the creation of a European superstate. The United Kingdom and other countries will therefore not hesitate to use their veto at the intergovernmental conference to ratify the conclusions of the Convention. This veto risks destroying any suggestion of establishing qualified majority decision-making procedures for matters such as the common foreign and security policy, fiscal and budgetary policy, and economic and social policy. There will be a ban on using the word ‘federal’.

Not only has the Union agreed to the ban on abortion, so restricting the rights of women, but it has also imposed a pre-emptive ban on any Community legislation to amend Polish legislation on the matter.

On the question of whether all the countries met the criteria, there were doubts, which have been expressed repeatedly by the European Parliament. On 8 April I received a letter from Commissioner Verheugen saying that even the countries in which he himself identified the most failings, among them Poland, will meet the Copenhagen criteria sufficiently at the time of accession.</p>
<p class="contents">The warnings from Commissioner Verheugen intended for a number of candidate countries, the decision of the Commission to publish a Comprehensive Monitoring Report six months before accession, the peer review of new and old Member States proposed by the Liberal Group in the area of human rights, corruption, administrative capacity and independent financial control (Malmström/Maaten amendment), the capability of the Commission to take measures directly for a further number of years against disruption of the internal market (the safeguard clauses) and also the Mulder initiative report on the reform of the approval of agricultural expenditure are therefore of overriding importance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I see unstable political parties emerge and disappear, a largely collapsed economy with mass unemployment in the east and the refusal of successive governments to rectify wrongs previously committed against members of national minorities. The new division into provinces takes absolutely no account of the fact that the southern edge of Slovakia is Hungarian speaking and that most people there want to have administration and education in that language. The villages in the east occupied by a majority of people from the Roma population group are still administered by a Slovakian elite that thinks that street lighting, waterworks and parks are only for themselves. It may be that many people from Slovakia will choose to seek work in nearby Vienna. With the arrival of Slovakia the EU is importing the environmental problems of the nuclear power stations and the Danube dam. Yet accession to the EU is far less controversial in internally divided Slovakia than in the neighbouring countries of Poland and the Czech Republic, where the majority will perhaps shortly vote against in a referendum. Various groups are expecting improvement as a result of this accession. As far back as 5-9-2001 I expressed the expectation that they will be disappointed, but I respect their choice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In recent years, as the number of different lobbies has grown, there have been moves to transfer Parliament from Strasbourg to Brussels permanently. Most importantly, we have seen plenary sessions reduced to four days and an increase in the number of extraordinary sessions held in Brussels. The treaties state that 12 sessions per year are to be held in Strasbourg. The UEN group intends to ensure that the letter and the spirit of the treaties are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">In election years of course one plenary session held in Strasbourg is normally cancelled. At the same time however, it is unbelievable that the number of extraordinary sessions remains unchanged. This is a completely abnormal situation. I therefore proposed that the two additional sessions on the 2004 calendar be cancelled in order to restore the twelfth session held in Strasbourg, in accordance with the relevant legal provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure you will appreciate that this will require everyone to assume their responsibilities. In our opinion, the situation is clear.

<p class="contents">It was stated that any integration policy should aim at granting immigrant citizens rights and obligations that are comparable with those held by EU citizens. The text that has been presented takes the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome of divisions within the Council, this proposal is for common standards that are harmonised down towards the lowest common denominator, with a reductive vision of the concept of family and with a number of derogations that leaves some crucial aspects unresolved.</p>
<p class="contents">For this very reason, we support the proposals contained in this report, which broaden the concept of the family, guarantee the principle of non-discrimination and prevent the overturning of more favourable legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">On our initiative, the report now includes provisions for not adding the examination of applications to the normal workload of administrations and for eliminating the subjective concept of a long-term relationship. It also excludes illness or disability suffered after the issue of the residence permit as grounds for refusing to renew the permit.</p>
<p class="contents">By introducing such amendments, the report distances itself in qualitative terms from the initial proposal and therefore deserves our favourable vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Abstaining from taking appropriate and balanced measures in this field is precisely the cause of the damaging effects of which all European citizens are aware. The least that these serious and now universally acknowledged problems require is that we do not make them worse. In the words of Commissioner António Vitorino, ‘...it should be clearly stated that the reception capacity of Europe’s cities has limits’.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of immigration cannot, it is true, be addressed by sacrificing the right to family reunification. This is quite clear to me, because I recognise the importance of this concept.</p>
<p class="contents">We can and must, however, only see the right to family reunification in serious terms, without the reason sustaining its existence being compromised. This is not the approach adopted by the report and the resolution on this Directive, which unreasonably extend this right to personal situations that do not involve family relationships. This leftist irresponsibility serves only to increase suspicions and resistance to a natural fundamental right. It is for all of these reasons that I felt obliged to vote against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
