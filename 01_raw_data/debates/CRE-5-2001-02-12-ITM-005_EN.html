<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bakopoulos (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, maritime safety and the prevention of pollution from ships are, unfortunately, highly topical issues. A series of accidents has monopolised our attention recently, many lives have been lost and the environmental impact has been disastrous. The European Union currently has numerous directives and regulations on related matters at its disposal. At the same time, however, the European Union has to monitor and react to legislation introduced by international organisations and, more to the point, it has to do so instantly, so that the Member States do not appear to be shirking their international obligations. Consequently, the European Union needs rationally organised and centralised powers for maritime safety policy. That is why the European Commission has submitted this communication, which contains two proposals: one for a regulation and one for a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the proposal for a regulation is to replace all the existing committees dealing with safety at sea and the prevention of pollution from ships with a single Committee on Safe Seas. All other existing committees dealing with related matters will be disbanded. The purpose of this committee is to facilitate the implementation of amendments to the relevant international conventions by the Member States. It is also important to note that the new Committee on Safe Seas will operate in accordance with the provisions of the regulatory procedure in Council Decision 1999/468.</p>
<p class="contents">As you all know, this procedure makes provision for and safeguards the powers of both the European Parliament and the Member States. At the same time, however, the European Commission has opted for a procedure which ensures that it has the right to decide whether an international amendment to the regulations raises or lowers maritime safety standards. In summary, the procedure which it has opted for in order to achieve this basic objective is as follows: the Member States implement the most recent provisions of international conventions, except for those expressly referred to and incorporated in a Community act, which are dealt with directly by the European Commission, which either refers them for exclusion to the Committee on Safe Seas or does not refer them, in which case they apply automatically. In other words, they are only referred to the Committee on Safe Seas if the Commission considers that incorporating an amendment to an international convention into a Community act would lower maritime safety standards in the European Union. This is the substance of Article 4, the basic article of the proposal for a regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the purpose of the proposal for a directive is to amend existing directives in order to incorporate the Committee on Safe Seas. This obviously needs to be done. The European Commission has presented the right proposal in an attempt at rational organisation and enhanced supervision of both Community and international law on maritime safety and the prevention of pollution. The small number of amendments aim to clarify the text and hence to safeguard Parliament's rights to take part in the regulatory procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to thank the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for their highly constructive comments and unanimous support for my draft report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, some time ago, in this House, I shared my regrets about the French Presidency’s record on maritime safety. I expected great things of this presidency, because it was genuinely extremely concerned. I was, however, deeply disappointed. Furthermore, I hope – thanks to our efforts in Parliament, in conjunction with the European Commission – that we will not be lowering our guard, to use the Commissioner’s expression, and that we will, in fact, ensure that maritime safety is improved.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, the European Union lags behind considerably in the area of maritime safety, particularly compared to the United States, which has had strict regulation in force for a very long time. Since such coffin ships are banned from American waters, they inevitably take the opportunity to come and pollute the coastlines of Europe instead. If Parliament fails to take effective action, the danger of more shipwrecks close to our beaches will increase. Unfortunately, it seems to be a monthly occurrence.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that we shall soon vote in favour of a genuine framework resolution which will bring together all the measures needed to protect our environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bakopoulos’ report is very good and aims to set up a Committee on Safe Seas, which is a step in the right direction. This is a first stage in bringing together the various measures, as replacing the five existing committees with a single Committee on Safe Seas will enable the European Union to react rapidly to developments in international law.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for having agreed to the amendments that I tabled. Maritime safety affects a range of sectors and I believe that it is particularly important that the title of this committee includes terms which relate to prevention of pollution from ships.</p>
<p class="contents">In protecting ourselves against these coffin ships, we are also showing our concern for the protection of the marine environment as well as shipboard living and working conditions. I do hope, therefore, that the European Parliament will heed this recommendation and give the Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution by Ships the opportunity to take account of the Community provisions which govern these two other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall very soon – or so, at least, I hope – be making a statement on an amendment to the rules regarding shipwrecks, so that the polluter pays principle can be applied across the board. We must monitor classification societies more closely in order to improve the quality of their inspections, and we should also pay attention to the responsibilities of ship owners, who all too often escape prosecution because of complicated financial and legal arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we are counting on you not to lower your guard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A good example of this occurred during the last few days. The final EU classification of ports and harbours as part of the trans-European networks attracted a great deal of attention in the case of the medium-sized ports, because European status gives these ports stimuli for growth and investment incentives which are vital for the regions involved. The solution reached up to now through conciliation is acceptable, but I would ask you, when ports are being classified, to apply a measure of goodwill in some cases at least, as the dividing lines are essentially set in an arbitrary way. The medium-sized ports will be grateful to you – and to us – if this is done.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, everyone is now aware that the Commission and Parliament are not pausing for breath. One after the other, we are discussing proposals to improve maritime safety. Nor should we allow ourselves to let the pace slacken, given the situation at sea. The accident off the Galapagos Islands is just the latest in a string of disasters with devastating effects on nature and on human populations. The public is aware of these issues and the debates about safety flare up at regular intervals. We must make it clear to the coast dwellers affected that the European Union may have been tardy in addressing these problems, but that the right approach has been adopted, after years of pressure on our part. Europe is doing something about maritime safety and the prevention of pollution. In this way we need to give a clear signal to the IMO and the world in general, both now and in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has brought forward its proposals in almost record time. Last November we approved the Erika I package. The Council reached agreement at the end of December so that the directive can come into force as from 2002. The Erika II package is now just around the corner, and I am delighted that the second package too will result in genuine progress in safety at sea. I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the enormous amount of work done on the ground, that is to say by the classification societies' inspectors and by the port States. I saw this with my own eyes during a visit last week to the port of Antwerp together with Mr Piecyk. Huge demands are made of the inspectors and we need to give them our support.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before us by Mr Bakopoulos makes a valuable contribution to achieving further progress on safety. The fact that it was approved unanimously in committee is a testament to his convincing work. I trust that Parliament will be equally convinced when it comes to vote. I am not just speaking for myself, but for a large majority, when I specifically welcome the setting up of the Committee on Safe Seas that has already been mentioned. I also particularly welcome the second part of the Commission document, because what is the point of having the committee if the relevant directives and regulations are not brought into line with the new structure? We do not want a dispute over powers, we need administrative clarity; we do not need a dozen working parties or committees, what we need is a clear and dynamic structure, and I believe that will set Europe on the right path and make us a model for the rest of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The purpose of this – as Members have already pointed out – is to streamline the operation of bringing the Community legislation in force into line with the international provisions and conventions on maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment, and with technical progress.</p>
<p class="contents">We socialists support the streamlining effort contained in the proposals and we welcome the proposal to replace the current five committees with a single regulatory committee. This committee will certainly contribute to greater certainty and coherence in the incorporation of international law into Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we would wish both the title and the mandate of such a committee to encompass the two concepts of maritime safety and the prevention of pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to focus particularly on a further consideration: Parliament's role in these operations. It is vital to guarantee that Parliament has the right to participate in the regulatory procedure. We therefore call upon the Commission to ensure that Parliament is always in a position to monitor the activities of the committees, including the activities of the Committee on Safe Seas which is to be established.

Increased safety is very important for maritime traffic. Our group supports the main ideas in the report. The proposed regulation and directive will make it easier to take account of international amendments to Community acts on maritime safety. The problem has always been one of delay, which is the result of the Community’s slowness in drafting legislation. The intention of the proposal is to remove the problems mentioned earlier. Procedures must indeed be simplified.</p>
<p class="contents">Combining several committees that at present operate separately into one Committee on Safe Seas, responsible for matters of maritime safety, is the right way to help clarify how these matters should be dealt with. Sea safety standards are an attempt to meet certain minimum conditions, and one advantage of the pre-inspection procedure contained in the regulation is that it will clarify the question of applicable law and increase legal certainty. In future we must ensure that procedures followed in the Member States specifically to implement international agreements on maritime safety and Community legislation can be made simpler. However, we must safeguard the opportunities for Member States to act within the context of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). In future too it must be a matter of principle that the IMO should be in charge of international maritime safety by concluding international agreements, passing resolutions and agreeing conventions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We also congratulate the Commission on its proposal and we are genuinely pleased with the creation of this committee on maritime safety which is going to unify in a very significant way and coordinate the application of 12 directives and 3 regulations. Commissioner, you have been determined to unify sky, land and sea and in the end you are going to manage it. I truly hope that you do manage it. Our group will support you.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the principle of caution and precaution must fundamentally prevail so that these directives, standards and international agreements are made more demanding, as this committee on maritime safety proposes.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to make a series of recommendations. We believe that the committee on maritime safety must not simply be a committee which does a reasonable job from an administrative point of view, but that it must incorporate the feelings of non-governmental organisations, of environmental protection organisations and of unions so that all these views may be represented.</p>
<p class="contents">We also recommend that the committee puts a special emphasis on the areas in a special geographical position, with special traffic conditions, with special environmental circumstances such as, for example, the Straits of Gibraltar or the English Channel, where we all know that the number of accidents and incidents is well above the average, and where the dumping of crude oil has a great environmental impact and a great economic impact on tourist areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore hope that the committee places special emphasis on these areas with special conditions, and I would like to ask you two questions in this regard: how will the work of the committee on maritime safety and the European Maritime Safety Agency, which is going to be established soon, be coordinated? Is this committee also going to manage or work on the three legislative initiatives contained in the Erika II package? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission's proposals contain reactionary arrangements which undermine the role of international organisations such as the International Maritime Organisation and the International Labour Organisation. Basically, they institutionalise the EU Member States' refusal to participate in initiatives to accept or apply amendments to international conventions or resolutions, their obligations as contracting parties to international law notwithstanding. In acting as the guardian of the interests of European big business, the European Union is interfering in changes to the international law which has evolved since the war and, having graduated to global guardian, it is sacrificing safety, human life itself and environmental protection just so that the monopolies can increase their profits.</p>
<p class="contents">We are radically opposed both to the basic thrust of these policies and to the practice of taking fragmentary, inefficient action in order to allay the acute concerns and reactions of the public, the trades union and ecological organisations in the wake of the plethora of fatal and highly environmentally dangerous accidents at sea. Moreover, the attempt being made by Europe as an economic, political and shipping centre, within the framework of the trade war with other shipping centres, such as the USA, Japan, Australia and others, to fashion its own mechanism for controlling maritime transport and imposing its own choices undermines the International Maritime Organisation. This will lead to distinctions being made outside generally accepted principles and this in itself is fraught with dangerous consequences for the basic safety of shipping in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The main issue as regards the safety of ships in general and tankers in particular is the unaccountability of big shipping business and the policy which supports it at national, regional and international level. This unbridled unaccountability is not only being maintained; it is being extended. A typical example is the situation which prevails regarding ships under flags of convenience, which are directly connected with falling maritime safety standards and which are generally responsible for most accidents and for the most serious accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that a policy based on protecting the safety of ships, passengers, crews and the environment must, first and foremost, fight the unaccountability of shipowners, apply strict sanctions against those who violate the law, which is being flagrantly flouted time and time again, with impunity, within the framework of the ΙΜΟ and international conventions. This policy needs to adjust operating factors to the enhanced requirements of ships, help improve shipboard living and working conditions and safeguard the rights of crews and trades union, including their right to intervene in safety issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a Member of the European Parliament representing the east coast of Ireland, I am particularly angered by the extent of shipments of nuclear waste within the Irish Sea. Only recently, there were two shipments from the Netherlands to the Sellafield and Thorp nuclear reprocessing plants operated by British Nuclear Fuels in Cumbria, and I have been informed that another 17 such shipments are due to take place from the Netherlands in the coming years. Moreover, the German Government has stated that it is ready to restart shipments of spent nuclear fuel to Cumbria and that it will continue such operations until 1 July 2005. This will mean an intensification of such shipments.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though there has been widespread falsification of documents by BNFL over the last two years involving nuclear shipments to Japan, such shipments are now due to recommence. This is not withstanding the fact that BNFL has been fined USD 60 million over this incident alone.</p>
<p class="contents">I am especially pleased that there is now growing international opposition to shipments of nuclear waste from Britain to Japan. The Argentinian Navy is presently on alert to intercept a British ship carrying enough nuclear waste to give off twice the amount of radiation as the Chernobyl disaster. The British Nuclear Fuel's vessel named <span class="italic">Pacific Swan</span> is rapidly becoming the pariah of South America because the captain intends to negotiate the treacherous waters of Cape Horn with 90 tonnes of waste vitrified in 192 glass blocks.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the countries of the OSPAR Convention must now form broader international links with other countries along the main shipping routes of nuclear waste, which includes countries around the Panama Canal, South America, and the coast of Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the European Union an environmental impact assessment must be carried out on the construction of new roads, water and sewage facilities and large infrastructure projects. To date, the British Government has refused to conduct an international environmental impact assessment on the significant risks posed to the environment and people's health along the transportation routes of nuclear waste. I am now calling on the British Government to bring forward a full and comprehensive environmental impact assessment outlining the environmental risks of transporting of nuclear materials within the Irish Sea. Such an assessment should also be evaluated by the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to see the reprocessing of nuclear products terminated at Sellafield. However, in the interim, there needs to be an international agreement outlining the safety standards for such shipments. I must commend the rapporteur, Mr Bakopoulos, on this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that it is only to be expected that the House should unite almost unanimously behind the report presented by Mr Bakopoulos, whom I should like to congratulate on his work, first, because the aim of the Commission's proposal is to replace the five existing committees dealing with safety at sea with one committee, thereby cutting the red tape and, secondly because, in its legislative proposal, the Commission grasps the opportunity and safeguards the right to decide when an amendment to international regulations raises or lowers maritime safety standards. Amendments to international conventions will either be dealt with by the Commission and/or referred for exclusion to the new Committee on Safety at Sea; if they are not referred, they will apply automatically. This will, I think, improve and simplify matters and create legal security. That being the case, I imagine that Mr Bakopoulos preferred not to propose amendments merely in order to make Parliament's importance and presence felt and, because he agreed with this extremely logical proposal, merely proposed a few amendments in order to highlight the importance of and safeguard Parliament's presence during the regulatory procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said which, Commissioner, I think that the presence of everyone here today proves not so much that we agree with Mr Bakopoulos's report, which goes without saying, but that we are most concerned about the issue of safety at sea. As you know, we have fast-tracked our reading of the first three reports on the so-called Erika I package on safety at sea and the safety of shipping, i.e. the withdrawal of single-hull tankers, the proposal on shipping registers and the third proposal on port controls. We intend to push straight on to the Erika II package and its three individual legislative proposals. I think that the Commission's initiatives in general are beginning to pressurise the International Maritime Organisation into acting more quickly and more decisively on this particular issue and encouraging it to adopt solutions at international level, which is always a good thing and something that we all prefer over regional solutions.</p>

Similarly, wanting to secure the right to select amendments made by supranational regulatory bodies, so that only those which help to improve safety standards are incorporated into Community legislation, is the right objective. This double proposal clearly seeks to facilitate the implementation of amendments to conventions by the Member States of the Union and, of course, by having just one committee, to improve efficiency in the implementation of safety policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, who has done an excellent job, and the parliamentary committee have proposed a number of amendments to Parliament in line with the European Commission's initial idea which highlight the need to include the prevention of pollution from ships and shipboard living conditions, which are, of course, closely bound up with safety at sea. The report also makes provision for the proposal for a directive to include the role of the European Parliament which, given that it has been defined, must not be overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, this proposal is a further effort on the part of the Commission to organise the drafting and application of maritime safety policy and the prevention of pollution from ships more rationally. The rapporteur and the parliamentary committee have, I think, supported this effort by tabling amendments which improve and supplement the proposal and which we hope Parliament will accept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the wreck of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> was a catastrophe for European shipping, the accident also had some very positive consequences. The publicity surrounding the disaster and increased political pressure has resulted in more effective monitoring on the part of the Commission of legislation on shipping. The Commission has also very promptly managed to submit a number of legislative proposals to make shipping safer for discussion by Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the fellow Members before me, I would also like to thank the Commissioner for this active involvement. I also wish to thank you for having taken an initially positive view of the need to create a thematic network with regard to short route navigation, which is a very important initiative on the part of AMRIE. Before <span class="italic">Erika</span> the Union already had, and has had most definitely since, acts in place that pretty much cover the whole area of vessel safety and the prevention of pollution from ships. The truth is that the <span class="italic">Erika</span> accident would probably never have happened if all the regulations in force at the time had been properly complied with and if, furthermore, that compliance had been monitored correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal to replace the committees currently dealing with matters of maritime safety with one committee is to be supported. At the same time, responsibility for maritime safety policy will fall more clearly to the new committee being set up. The new committee must monitor and, if necessary, improve the way legislation is implemented and take an active role, on the Union’s behalf, in the IMO and other international organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the amendment to the regulation, the Commission is reserving the right to judge whether any international amendment to the regulations might be harmful to European maritime safety. I also support the Commission’s proposal regarding its proposed procedure in this connection. It is very important, however, as the rapporteur quite rightly points out in his report, that Parliament’s rights to take part in the regulatory procedure should be satisfactorily safeguarded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should also like to thank everyone involved for their contributions and collaboration and, most especially, Mrs Grossetête, who has put forward the viewpoint of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As for your congratulations to the Commission for the work done so far in the maritime sector, I shall pass these on to the staff of the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport following the magnificent work they have carried out throughout this long year, in which they have undoubtedly made a very considerable effort to respond to our citizens’ growing demands. I am sure that you have been requesting such an effort for a while now, but the <span class="italic">Erika</span> disaster has acted as a kind of catalyst.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been pointed out, the purpose of this proposal is twofold. On the one hand, it is to replace all the current committees responsible for maritime safety with a single committee. The proposal therefore constitutes an effort at simplification, clarification and coherence. On the other hand, the purpose is to help update Community maritime safety legislation in accordance with developments in the international Conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to reiterate my gratitude for your work and your proposals and, specifically, for the amendments which are a reminder that the European Parliament performs what the Commission is pleased to say is a crucial role in the regulatory procedure. The Commission is going to incorporate all these amendments once it has adjusted their wording in accordance with the standardised formulations on comitology agreed between the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We also wish to thank Parliament for having reminded us that the single Committee whose creation we are proposing is going to deal not only with maritime safety but also with the prevention of pollution from ships, something which will, in fact, have to be reflected in the Committee’s name.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that we are prepared to incorporate the prevention of pollution from ships in the name, we are not, however, able to incorporate protection of the marine environment in a generic sense. This is simply because protection of the marine environment in that sense might also refer to potential pollution of the sea by, for example, effluent from inland waters such as rivers or to potential pollution caused by types of waterside activity not connected with the problem of maritime safety. That is why we are unable to accept this generic definition, which would mean incorporating other types of competence, which the Committee is not qualified to exercise. However, what we will, of course, be able to incorporate is the specific addition, ‘prevention of pollution from ships’.</p>
<p class="contents">We accept Amendments Nos 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 10 in their entirety. Amendments Nos 1, 3, 7 and 11 simply require a number of modifications. The only ones we are unable to accept are Nos 5 and 12, and for the reasons I have just pointed out, namely that they refer to aspects of marine environmental protection not connected with maritime safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Before concluding, I should like to say that, as Mrs Grossetête has pointed out, we cannot lower our guard. We have to go on extending our remit to cover the whole range of maritime traffic which, as I have said on previous occasions, has changed out of all recognition over the last hundred years, in terms of the number of vessels, the number of tonnes of materials being transported and the nature and quality of those materials.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Fitzsimons referred to the problem of transporting nuclear waste, for example, and we have certainly included this issue in our discussion of the Erika II package. Specifically, the directive concerning minimum requirements for vessels carrying dangerous or polluting goods takes account of the need to respect the Irradiated Nuclear Fuel Code concerning fuel containing radioactive material.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mrs Langenhagen and Mr Hatzidakis, we can also see that, if there is a truly global sector, it is the maritime sector, a fact we have all known for a long time. In recent times, the aviation sector has reached a similar scale, but the maritime sector has a longer tradition behind it. We therefore have to try to ensure that the International Maritime Organisation incorporates as many of our requirements as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the countries of the European Union are acting as a spur or driving force for transmitting environmental awareness to the International Maritime Organisation, and for communicating the requirements for shielding the marine environment and making it safe and for protecting the lives and ensuring the safety of crews.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mr Bautista Ojeda, I wish to say that the powers of the Maritime Safety Agency and those of the Regulatory Committee are quite distinct. The latter’s function is strictly laid out and defined in Community maritime safety legislation and is limited to approving Commission proposals for updating current directives and regulations. The Regulatory Committee therefore has a legislative function, while the agency has absolutely no legislative function and does not in any way intervene in legislation, although it may make suggestions to us. This is a body designed to provide technical assistance to the Member States and to the Commission, and is an advisory body whose function is to monitor the application of Community standards and to disseminate information, and therefore transparency throughout the sector. It does not, however, have a legislative function. There are therefore two distinct areas of operation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe in fact that, as one of the honourable Members pointed out in another speech, the incorporation of ports into the trans-European networks is a key factor in promoting what we are all aiming for, namely the incorporation or integration of all transport systems into the intermodal system.</p>
