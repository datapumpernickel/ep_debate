<p class="contents">I must firstly congratulate the groups in this House on the high degree of consensus achieved in the motion for a resolution. I am aware of the efforts made by Members to avoid using an issue such as this for electoral purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I must also assert my total conviction that neither Spain nor Andalusia is xenophobic or racist. Of course this does not mean that I do not totally condemn the violence used by individuals or groups who deserve to be prosecuted firmly and rigorously by the law, and by the law alone.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be tackling the issue of immigration in a comprehensive and rigorous manner. These events, which are unfortunately overshadowing the political decisions in this area, confirm without doubt that the development of the Tampere Agreements and Title IV of the EC Treaty must be an urgent priority. Today’s problems cannot be solved in five years. They will take a long time, as we are finding out.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislation of the Member States must be brought into line with the agreements of the governments in Tampere, as paragraph 7 of the motion states. Legal immigrants must be integrated socially without any excuses or delays.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the labour market must be organised realistically so that jobs held by third country nationals are subject to labour legislation on wages, social security and social protection in terms of equality. This will eradicate the labour exploitation and markets in marginalised people, which are resulting in the events condemned by the motion, and which are the real basis of the current social problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity, dialogue and agreements between local, regional, national and European institutions and employers, unions and the immigrant communities themselves, whose countries of origin must also undoubtedly assume some responsibility, are essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Collaboration with the countries of origin on this issue is vital. In this respect, the action plans approved by the High Level Group and the Tampere European Council must be allocated a budget. Specifically, I must stress in this debate the plan for Morocco. This is a country with which the European Union has an effective relationship and common interests and which should take particular priority in mutual cooperation and collaboration.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this House must tackle the phenomenon of immigration with sufficient calm to avoid increasing tension in a debate which must go much further than the appropriate words and condemnations prompted by such behaviour. This is a very important social debate in the creation of a European area in which the right to freedom, security and justice will be recognised in the future Charter of Fundamental Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is true of the disgraceful events which have recently occurred in El Ejido. The proof of this lies in the fact that the groups in this House have reacted and tabled several motions for resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We all regret the deaths which have occurred and the violent and disproportionate reactions against the immigrant workers. We all, I believe, agree in our condemnation of the xenophobia and racism which was apparent in certain actions. These events certainly have their origin in, among other factors, the absence of a clear immigration policy allowing the affected communities to live together respectfully and peacefully.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the events in El Ejido will serve as a lesson to everyone and will not be repeated. Yet it is not enough to regret the situation. We do not want Africa to become our cross, in fact quite the contrary. We must therefore act. I should like to highlight certain measures which we are trying to introduce in another European region affected by immigration – the Canary Islands. Firstly we are creating a network of reception centres for minors. Secondly we are conducting a programme of social integration. Thirdly we are carrying out education programmes on tolerance and respect. Finally we are producing a census of immigrants. I hope that these measures will help towards ensuring compliance with the Tampere Agreements on immigration and the new Spanish Act on aliens. In particular they must ensure that people arriving in Europe do not lose their dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was acknowledged by the Commission President, Romano Prodi, on 9 February when he confirmed that what had occurred in El Ejido went against the very principles of the European Union. These events have caused us great pain and shame and have awoken our fears given the extreme racism, xenophobia and intolerance demonstrated. It is incomprehensible that ways of coexisting and ensuring mutual respect cannot be found between two communities which are mutually beneficial. The only way to prevent these events happening again, in a place where there are large communities of immigrant workers, is through social integration. This requires a firm economic, political and social commitment from the competent authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all immigrants. For generations human beings have not always remained within the borders of one nation state but have constantly migrated. Geographical mobility is not an invention of the twentieth century and neither are its economic and work-related causes. We are all immigrants, if not ourselves personally, then through one of our relations or ancestors. However, instead of producing these events which we are condemning, migration must generate social, cultural and economic enrichment.</p>
<p class="contents">What happened in El Ejido is unfortunately not exclusive to this one town of the European Union. We must therefore firstly condemn clearly and emphatically the brutal racist and xenophobic outbursts of certain inhabitants of El Ejido against immigrant workers in the area. A whole community should not have been held responsible, criminalised and attacked for one regrettable but isolated incident.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, all the authorities must act immediately. Coordination between them is the key to combating this type of xenophobia and racism. In particular, local authorities and mayors have a direct responsibility to prevent any demonstration of racism or xenophobia, especially when this involves violent and aggressive acts against people and their property. These authorities must also help to achieve difficult agreements between the parties involved and must not hinder these, as has happened with the mayor in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the political parties must assume direct responsibility for the political actions of their public officials. They must prevent any individual action or declaration which is contrary to the principles and values of coexistence and tolerance expressed by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Union must be responsible for monitoring the application of its principles. It must prevent any racist or xenophobic demonstrations in its territory and support and collaborate with national, regional and local authorities and non-governmental organisations and associations in the application of these principles. This must occur within a framework of constant action to combat racism and xenophobia and to encourage the integration of all immigrants resident in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the incidents in El Ejido are a symptom of a phenomenon which is present throughout Europe and which deserves our full attention. We thought we had eradicated the terror of intolerance which racism had unleashed in Europe. Yet, over the years, social disintegration in Europe has been combining with an increase in migration from surrounding countries and increased awareness of human rights to develop into this climate of racism and intolerance.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why what seemed to be a local and isolated phenomenon in El Ejido is actually a worrying symptom which is coinciding with the emergence of parties like Haider’s. This House therefore proposes the adoption of urgent measures encompassing all the relevant factors and to be applied immediately. We must ensure respect for human rights, tolerance and multiculturalism and we must obtain an increase in budgets and action lines for social and health issues. In this respect we must not forget that the original victim’s attacker was suffering from a mental illness for which he had been inadequately treated. The current difficulties must also be taken into account so that this town can adopt the necessary measures, as indicated previously.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as our Nobel Prize Winner, José Saramago, has said, we are all in each other and as Jesus Christ said, although Saramago disagreed with this, we should not just love one another, more importantly, we should respect one another. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since time immemorial it has welcomed all those who have decided to move there and regarded them as Andalusians from day one, whether or not they were born in our region. Therefore, as an MEP, but primarily as an Andalusian, I can feel only sadness, repugnance and condemnation for the xenophobic and racist events which have occurred and which are foreign to this tolerant community.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet a worrying situation is apparent. All decisions which are or are not taken and all agreements which are or are not negotiated by the Community institutions with regard to the economy of the principal sectors in disadvantaged areas like Andalusia may indirectly lead to these serious incidents. I am referring, for example, to the lack of agreement with Morocco and to the lack of solutions for the fishing industry, part of whose fleet is moored in Almería. I am also referring to the erratic management of the import scheme for fruit and vegetables by the EU which is dominating relations between Almería and Morocco. I am also referring to the immigration policy of the regions, Member States and European Union which, due to actions or omissions, is leading to a few territories like Almería having to support this migratory pressure from north-west Africa on their own.</p>
<p class="contents">All these factors have unfortunately been accumulating over time and are now allowing those who are cruel, intolerant, racist and destructive, of which all our countries have some examples, but thankfully a minority, to light the fuse of xenophobia.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone, whether European or not, who lives and works in Andalusia, is an Andalusian and deserves our consideration and respect. The EU can and must speak out. For you, the south is Andalusia but for us Andalusians it is Africa. We must therefore ensure that the EU provides every possible resource so that the economy of the south can prosper and enable a society to develop with more tolerance and respect for one another. This has not been achieved with the solutions proposed to date which have quite simply been based on looking the other way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was therefore aware how the situation was developing.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in the European Parliament, as in many other institutions, we have watched this situation with concern and were beside ourselves when we heard what had happened. This is because we felt the problem to be ours, as it was. In El Ejido there is a serious social problem, problems of integration and employment and also a grave problem of public safety which acted as the detonator.</p>
<p class="contents">These events have also acted as a wake-up call to our consciences. Here in this House, in Spain and in many other countries, we have all fixed on El Ejido. Yet what we do and say here and the concern we express will really serve no purpose unless this leads to the adoption of a much more determined attitude to finding out what is really happening, not only in El Ejido, but in many other places where this type of problem may be occurring at any given moment.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree in our condemnation of intolerance and we also agree that we must look forward. We will not find the guilty parties in this House or in many other places. Those responsible for what happened in El Ejido are a minority who set out to satisfy their desire for vengeance on the immigrants. We must bear in mind that vengeance is not a solution. These problems can only be solved by close cooperation between all the authorities in order to achieve social integration and respect for all working there. This therefore requires a determined fight against illegal immigration and profound respect for the rights of immigrant workers who are legally working in El Ejido and throughout Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the Spanish democrats wounded by what is happening in their country have our full and complete support. It was not only immigrants who were the victims of atrocities; the democratic system in Spain has been held up to ridicule, despite having demonstrated its tremendous capacity to evolve over the last 20 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Employers would be lost without immigrants. Working conditions are so hard and so deplorable that no Spaniard will accept them. Low wages, the lack of housing – some are living in cardboard huts – the lack of access to social services and the de facto system of apartheid are abominable and unacceptable and are not worthy of the respect which every human being deserves.</p>
<p class="contents">What happened at El Ejido is the result of inadmissible racist and xenophobic practices in Europe today. For four days, the immigrants were collectively hounded. Women and children were beaten. Fleeing from all quarters, hundreds of immigrants took refuge on a hill on the outskirts of the town. We are right to blacklist Haider’s Austria; but we cannot allow little local Haiders to practice policies of racial exclusion and merciless economic domination. What happened in Spain could happen in any country in the Union if we are not careful. We all have a duty to put our own house in order.</p>
<p class="contents">I support this proposal for a resolution, especially the points which refer to the application of Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, and point 11 of this resolution establishing a link between the Structural Funds allocated and the fight against exclusion. It would be to our credit were the European Parliament to roundly condemn these events and support all proposals tabled in order to ensure that the rights of immigrants in Spain and throughout the Union are respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everywhere this violence is exacerbated by the spread of extremist movements. We must take practical steps today to put an end to all attacks of a physical nature. No European society can truly flourish when it harbours the risk of seeing one section of its population fall prey to the hatred of the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Having received a delegation from the Austrian human rights association here yesterday and having seen what has happened in the province of Almería, it is easy to understand that we could easily have prevented this resurgence of racist hatred. These violent scenes at El Ejido are so similar to archive pictures of Alabama in the 1950s, when the KKK terrified the black population, that it is hard to tell them apart. They also put us in mind of Germany in the 1930s, when the Nazis were persecuting the Jews.</p>
<p class="contents">Without wishing to lump everything together hysterically, because each period is different, we have failed to learn the lessons of history. That is my conclusion today. Because this witch hunt which broke out in the province of Almería should have been foreseen. It is the result, first and foremost, of the ghettoisation and exploitation of immigrant labour. Three annual crops of Moroccan and African workers support 100 000 people and manage to bring in an annual turnover of nearly EUR 2 million; and yet 60% of them have no running water in a region where, as we know, the temperature may reach 40 degrees in summer. We also know that many of them only earn EUR 30 a month, while their fellow European citizens can earn three times that. This precarious wage-earning position weakens these immigrants and their families and makes them vulnerable. The irresponsibility of certain elected representatives and the barely disguised complicity of the authorities have contributed to this racist explosion.</p>
<p class="contents">We should counter such acts of terror, Mr President, by setting up a parliamentary committee of inquiry as quickly as possible so that we can decide how we can succeed in preventing other conflicts of a similar nature elsewhere. My fellow Member, Mrs Roure, was right to remind us just now that we all need to put our own house in order.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and I think this is important: why not have the honesty today to relay what was disclosed in a recent UN study explaining that, if Spain wishes to preserve its work, retirement and pension potential, it is no good just giving 30 000 immigrants a year legal status; it needs to be prepared to accept 12 million immigrants between now and the year 2050? We must insist today as a matter of urgency on the right to education and the duty to remember, to recall the dates in history when our countries teetered on the brink of horror. We need to educate our children on these matters and finally have the courage to recognise that we will need to be prepared to accept many more immigrants in years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">It just remains for me to urge you all to attend the demonstration on Saturday. We must take to the streets of Europe to protest against these alliances with extremists which are a disgrace to Europe and which lead our youth astray.</p>

Two types of measure are required for this purpose. The first should seek the integration of people of non-European origin and the other should aim to organise immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the first, the Commission has sent us a series of proposals, contained in two directives and an action plan, which aim to apply the following decision taken by the Heads of State and Government in Tampere. This states that ‘The European Union must ensure fair treatment of third country nationals who reside legally on the territory of its Member States. A more vigorous integration policy should aim at granting them rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens’. This is totally contrary to what we have seen and found recently in El Ejido where there are irregularities, labour exploitation and indecent living conditions, which have been condemned in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope for prompt implementation of the measures to achieve integration. I also hope that the governments which produced such wonderful words in Tampere, including Spain, will work diligently to apply these.</p>
<p class="contents">I have less hope about the development of an effective and fair European policy in accordance with the statement made by the Council on immigration. The only proposal which has been made is for the directive on family reunification. This is a key issue, as we have seen recently in the media that there are many men on their own in El Ejido. Yet we do not know whether this has been accepted by the governments. Outside the Community arena, some governments are making efforts to renew their immigration policies. This is occurring in my country, despite the government, the party in power being the only one which does not like the new law on aliens.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of combating racism and xenophobia, explained in the Treaties, should be the objective of all European institutions and politicians. On 28 February 1998 the European political parties, including the Spanish Popular Party, signed the Charter of European Political Parties for a Non-Racist Society. This requires coherent behaviour, yet local leaders of the Popular Party are throwing more fuel on the raging fire and boycotting the attempts of other institutions to put this out. The party to which the Mayor of El Ejido belongs should, according to the commitments signed in this Charter, act forcefully. It is only, as stated by Mr Hernández Mollar, through unity, responsibility and firmness that El Ejido, Spain and Europe will be able to overcome these events of which we are deeply ashamed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We wish to assure these Moroccan workers that they have our full support – as if being exploited by unscrupulous employers were not enough, they have to suffer this type of aggression.</p>
<p class="contents">And if the aggressors include working-class people, all we can say to them is that, in acting in this way, they are digging their own graves.

<p class="contents">But there are some who bear even more responsibility than the thugs who wielded the iron bars and knives: those who spread racist and xenophobic slander, those who indulge in anti-immigration demagoguery in Spain, Austria, France or elsewhere, sometimes even here in this House, are no better than those who take this stupid, reactionary demagoguery at face value.

I want to make it clear at the outset that the Commission unreservedly condemns the dreadful acts of violence at El Ejido against the immigrant workers of the region. We express our support for the families and friends of the victims. President Prodi and Commissioner Diamantopoulou have both issued separate statements. Naturally I completely endorse what they have said.</p>
<p class="contents">It was especially moving to hear the remarks from Members of Parliament who come from the region about what has happened, uncharacteristically, in a part of Spain that I know reasonably well.</p>
<p class="contents">Racist and xenophobic acts are wholly unacceptable within our Community, wherever they take place. They fly in the face of the very principles on which – as Mr Havel said yesterday – the European Union was founded: principles of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights. Of course progress has been made in recent years but we still have to work together towards a climate of tolerance in which racism and xenophobia are regarded as completely beyond the pale, completely unacceptable, while at the same time we deal very robustly with incidents such as the ones we are discussing this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">We need, in our judgement, to focus on a package of measures including: first, the introduction of effective, anti-discrimination legislation at Union level; second, implementation of a common immigration policy with regard to the nationals of non-Member States to promote, in practical terms, the integration of the immigrant population in Member States’ societies; third, the introduction of measures to combat social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has already laid the basis for Community legislation on combating discrimination on the grounds of race. The insertion of Article 13, which was referred to during the debate, dealing with non-discrimination in the Treaty establishing the European Community, is one of the most significant changes of the last revision of the Treaties. Since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force the Commission has presented a package of proposals for the implementation of Article 13 including, in particular, a proposal for a directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment regardless of race or ethnic origin. This proposal is under examination by the Council and the European Parliament. The Commission hopes very much that this stage will soon be complete.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions of the Tampere special European Council, as Mr Hernandez Mollar said, clearly illustrated the will of the Heads of State and Government as regards the introduction of a common policy on immigration and the principles on which it should be based, with <span class="italic">particular emphasis</span> on the Union’s policy on the respect and promotion of the rights of migrants.</p>
<p class="contents">At Tampere the Heads of State and Government also emphasised the importance of approximating national legislation on conditions for admission and residence of third country nationals based on a shared assessment of the economic and demographic developments in the Member States as well as the situation in the countries of origin. The European Council also considered it important to step up the prevention of illegal immigration. Its objective here is to secure the rights of victims of criminal networks organising illegal immigration, with particular reference to the rights of women and children. Those who organise illegal immigration should be prosecuted with the utmost vigour. The word that is used about them in Chinese society is ‘snake-heads’. It seems to me a fitting description of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also draw attention to the work on drawing up a European Union charter on fundamental rights, which has now reached the drafting stage. Those rights are, by definition, universal. The charter will extend to third country nationals in Member States even though certain rights will be reserved to nationals of Member States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The El Ejido incidents were shocking, as several Members have said in their speeches. But trying to take something positive from them, I hope they will spur us on to translate our aspirations about tolerance, fairness and freedom into real and effective policies that will help to transform the lives of all those families and individuals in the European Union who cry out for our understanding and our help and who deserve it, not at some indefinite moment in the future, but here today.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
