Unfortunately, not all of them will be with us tomorrow. Our Syrian friends are still fighting for their rights and therefore cannot be with us here in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">But, honourable Members, the Arab Spring is a good example of the universality of human rights and of peoples’ aspiration to live in democratic systems.</p>
<p class="contents">This year’s winners embody the dramatic changes that have defined the past 12 months, and I wish to pay tribute to them now. Whether through dramatic acts of self-sacrifice, endurance in prison, or daily confronting injustice, they remind us of the true meaning of courage. By drawing cartoons or organising online, they remind us that courage manifests itself in many different ways. It is about speaking the truth and refusing to be intimidated.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the case, too, for this year’s Nobel Prize Winner from Yemen, Mrs Karman, whom I had the opportunity to meet with just a few days ago. She deserves all the recognition she is now receiving as a result of her struggle for women’s rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the case of the group of Afghan women whom I met at the beginning of the International Afghanistan conference in Bonn and who are a real inspiration to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking out fearlessly is something that has defined the careers of many in this House, and none more so than President Buzek. Under him, Parliament’s work on human rights has significantly increased and I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for his dedication.</p>
<p class="contents">2011 has been a particularly active year for human rights in Parliament. The Subcommittee on Human Rights, chaired first by Heidi Hautala, and now by Barbara Lochbihler, has developed a great number of activities, including the De Keyser report on democracy, which inspired me, in particular, on the idea of the global and coherent approach to human rights and to democratisation and civic participation.</p>
<p class="contents">The historic developments in our neighbourhood have significantly advanced human rights. The bringing down of longstanding repressive regimes has led to the formation of new governments and to free and fair elections. The continuing violent crackdowns in Syria, repression in Belarus, and protracted conflicts, including in the Middle East, require us to keep up the pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">The events of this year have served to highlight the vital links between human rights and democracy. It has led to a new approach for the European Union, which aims to provide greater support to partners engaged in building what I have termed ‘deep democracy’.</p>
<p class="contents">That is where the right to vote is accompanied by effective freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of religion or belief, underpinned by impartial justice, public security from accountable protection forces, and access to a competent and non-corrupt civil service.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also continued using our financial instruments to promote and protect human rights. In 2011, the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights funded more than 1 200 operations in more than 130 countries. Even in the toughest environments, where basic rights and freedoms are the most repressed, we have been able to provide assistance to civil society. To give just a few examples: our funding has been used to fight media and cyber censorship to keep information flowing out of Syria or North Korea; in Uzbekistan, Belarus and Egypt, it provided legal defence for hundreds of political opponents arbitrarily imprisoned. It also supported their families and their lawyers, who risked imprisonment for taking up their case. It supported the rehabilitation victims, those having undergone torture in Zimbabwe or Sri Lanka, and those affected by the campaigns of mass rape in East Congo or Libya. And it supported democratic transition in Morocco, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Burma Myanmar and Libya, also helping in the support and observation of elections in Niger, Peru and Zambia.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also kept up its work to advance human rights on the multilateral stage in 2011. The UN Special Session on Libya, which made the historic recommendations to suspend Libya from the Human Rights Council, was a turning point in allowing this to respond to emergencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Several times this year, the EU raised the human rights situation in Syria, in the HRC and in the General Assembly, building an alliance of countries from all regions, including the Arab world. Our role was instrumental in establishing the Independent Commission of Inquiry on the human rights situation in Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">In June, we secured the adoption of a Human Rights Council resolution on the human rights situation in Belarus, with whom we have tried to engage to improve its human rights record.</p>
<p class="contents">I continue to highlight the human rights situations in North Korea and in Burma Myanmar, reflecting the developments on the ground. I expect the new civilian government in Burma Myanmar will push ahead with political reforms and re-engage with the international community. I hope Aung San Suu Kyi will finally be able to come to this Parliament to receive the Sakharov Prize that she was awarded 21 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">We continue our efforts to build consensus on freedom of religion or belief. I have also maintained my focus on promoting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people through the implementation of the EU’s toolbox.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting and protecting the universal rights of freedom of religion, belief and sexual orientation are central to the EU’s approach.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also begun work on the campaign on forced marriages, which destroy the lives of so many young people, girls and boys. When I was engaged in taking legislation through on forced marriages in the country I know best and come from, I was surprised to learn that 15% of those who ring the helplines on forced marriages are boys. Either young boys forced into marriage with a girl they have never met, or young gay men forced into marriage for what reasons I do not know.</p>
<p class="contents">In Brussels, we have been working to put in place the arrangements foreseen by the Treaty of Lisbon to put human rights firmly at the centre of our policy. We are committed not only to guarantee but also to promote their universal respect by all.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter of Fundamental Rights has contributed to promoting consistency between the EU’s internal and external policies, and the EU accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms will be a cornerstone for future developments.</p>
<p class="contents">With the creation of the EEAS, we have begun to work more closely with Parliament, with Member States and with civil society. The department created within the EEAS on human rights and democracy is currently being reviewed to make it more effective. We have established a network of focal points in all EU delegations that contribute to delivering our EU human-rights policy goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Lochbihler gave us the privilege of meeting with all Heads of EU delegations recently, at the beginning of this month, and I hope that the honourable Member was able to see that human rights are at the core of the activities of the people on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Each of our Member States have played their own part in bringing their national legislation in line with EU standards of full compliance with all the relevant Treaties and conventions on human rights in the wider UN framework.</p>
<p class="contents">But the indivisibility and universality of human rights is increasingly being challenged globally. We will continue to counter this. The ongoing economic crisis should not be used as a pretext for those who want to dilute certain rights.</p>
<p class="contents">All that I have just said has helped me to inform the review of the EU human rights policy that was first announced before this House and I am pleased that my contribution will be tabled very shortly. I want to outline some main points from that now.</p>
<p class="contents">The text I will table this week is a contribution to an ongoing debate. It is necessarily concise, meaning that not every detail is reflected, but I hope that it offers a good basis for future work with this Parliament and with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of MEPs have been involved in the process from the beginning, as when the Chair of the Subcommittee on Human Rights attended the EU NGO forum in July, which produced a first set of recommendations for inclusion. Since then, there have been various informal meetings and contacts with Parliament, including, of course, with the Human Rights Subcommittee, which contributed greatly to the process, and I want to thank particularly Richard Howitt for the work that he has done.</p>
<p class="contents">Though much of the discussion about the review of our policy has centred on the process, I also want to say something about the substance.</p>
<p class="contents">Crucially, I want the outcome of the review to deliver a strong reaffirmation of what the EU stands for: the universality of human rights as binding international commitments and norms. The message must go out that human rights are not negotiable and are inviolable.</p>
<p class="contents">Against that backdrop, I have identified four main priority areas for action.</p>
<p class="contents">First, overhauling the EU’s delivery mechanisms. I want to make our policy more effective, adapting it better to the specific circumstances of each country, coupled with a global campaign-based approach. A key element here is the strengthening of relations with civil society, so that NGOs are better engaged as full partners with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, achieving a joined-up approach in our policies. This is the idea I have spoken of often, to break down traditional silos, and have human rights running as a silver thread throughout a truly integrated range of external policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, building strong partnerships encompassing the whole world: multilaterally working through the UN and the ICC; regionally developing work, for example with the Arab League; and bilaterally through our dialogues.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, speaking as one, which does not mean with a single voice but rather a coordinated and consistent message from everyone, ensuring that the invaluable work of Parliament and the Member States is brought together for the benefit of the whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I propose to use thematic campaigns to deliver on specific cross-cutting themes. This has already been done to great effect in support of the ICC and the abolition of the death penalty. I believe that approach can be extended, for example, to promote the rights of women, by setting realistic, time limited, achievable, objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I am keen to make the best possible use of tailor-made country strategies on human rights, which should be driven by recommendations made locally. Whilst they should stand firm on the universality of human rights and the global standards that apply to all, I believe this will allow us to deliver more across the board than a one-size-fits-all approach for 150 countries. It should allow us, too, to make the most effective use of the assorted tools we have, while engaging with due respect with the views of our partners on the ground. EU delegations are well placed to take this forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to work closely, too, with all my Commission colleagues, to bring human rights fully into the key Community policies, such as development and trade, building on recent communications on the future of development, budget support, corporate social responsibility and the neighbourhood policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Ms Lochbihler when she says that Parliament has a key role to monitor, assess and provide political accountability for the EU’s actions in the human rights field.</p>
<p class="contents">Our financial support for human rights must go beyond the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights and should be reflected in other EU financial instruments. I will work to ensure that human rights are taken into account consistently in the programming of all EU external financial assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that in order to be credible when we raise human rights concerns with others, we have to make sure that our own house is in order too. So I am determined to instil a human rights culture in the EU’s emerging diplomatic structures. We already have an active EU training policy, but there is much more to be done in this direction and we are ready to take that forward.</p>
<p class="contents">And I am very open-minded on the idea of appointing an EU Special Representative for Human Rights, to act as a catalyst and to raise our profile internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to discussing these proposals with Members of this House over the coming weeks and months and to getting their views as we take this issue further forward.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament, this House of democratically elected representatives from all over the European Union, is a champion of human rights, in the European Union and in the world. Your reports and your opinions inspire us and help to guide the work that we do. It is for this reason that being in front of you today on this topic is not merely my obligation, but it is also my privilege. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has to be admitted that we have been waiting for it for several months already. This delay has critically deferred the adoption of the respective reports by the European Parliament, and it has also delayed the report on human rights by Mr Howitt, to which you referred.</p>
<p class="contents">Your statement has highlighted a wide range of problems, but I fail to see there what is mentioned in the title of the statement, namely, ‘raising effectiveness’. Nor can we see either how to resolve these problems or the specific mechanism, which we could also gladly work on in our further cooperation. The priority mentioned in the statement – the reform of the judiciary – is extremely important in my view, yet here as well, a need exists for effectiveness in our activities, because although we have been talking about such blatant cases as those of Khodorkovsky and Magnitsky in Russia for several years … – Ms Ashton, I should really like you perhaps to listen to what we are saying too. Ms Ashton, we would like you to listen to us a little bit – ... we have not moved in this direction by a hair’s breadth.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights have a very important role in the world. We have experienced ‘the Arab Spring’, and democratic elections are crucial in this respect. I should like to see these rights to be more strongly stated in the case of Russia, too. I should like you to express a stronger joint EU stance in response to the calls for help that 80 000 people are addressing to us, so that we should have no double standards; so that we respond to election violations in Russia as we do to violations in Kyrgyzstan, where I had the honour to lead the mission, in Belarus and in Ukraine. Double standards do no honour to our human rights policy. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the Socialist and Democrats’ human rights spokesperson, can I welcome, however, the strategic review of human rights presented today by Baroness Ashton – long awaited. I absolutely endorse the aspiration to raise effectiveness, to achieve concrete results, to emphasise civil society, to better implement the recommendations of election observation missions, to continue the priority given to the defence of human rights defenders, to support the proposals for thematic campaigns and to move to a Brussels-based Council working group.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the High Representative emphasising a bottom-up approach, but may I tell her that in the last year, I have asked EU delegations in two critical countries – I will not name them – who is their focal point on human rights and where is their human rights country strategy? I met silence in response. We know we have a long way to go. We agree with her that worldwide, there is an attempt at erosion of international human rights and international humanitarian law, which is why I welcome her statement today towards considering the appointment of a special representative, perhaps specifically on international justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as we have failed states, let us be honest and say that the EU human rights dialogues and human rights clauses are close to being failed mechanisms – not to be abolished but requiring life-saving surgery. Meanwhile, bolstering our external advocacy, by strengthening internal respect for human rights, requires a mechanism, not just an aspiration. The mainstreaming of human rights – a development in particular trade policies – has yet to really begin, not just compatibility in the language of the communication, but coordination for common ends, using all our external relations instruments at one and the same time. I believe the benchmarks she identifies are the way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as has been said, in the annual report this year, I have been asked to provide an input to the review and I am pleased to do so. There will always be the need for some confidential communication on human rights abuses. But just as those who perpetrate war crimes or crimes against humanity must always be held to account, we who seek to uphold human rights must be held to account too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully support one principal theme, and that is the importance of coherence. This is necessary not only across the range of external policies, but also in the form of consistency with our internal record.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU cannot argue against torture and disappearance in the war on terror as effectively as is necessary when it has failed to fully clean house on our own collusion in secret prisons and rendition flights.</p>
<p class="contents">Our credibility in the desperately necessary battle for equality on the basis of sexual orientation is undermined by the shabby prejudice still suffered by LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) people in some EU states. Our voice will not be heard sufficiently in condemning ethnic, racial and religious discrimination abroad when Roma, Muslims and even Jews are not guaranteed proper freedoms and security at home.</p>
<p class="contents">One procedural reform in the Council might help, and that is to have joint meetings of the Working Party on Human Rights and the Working Party on Fundamental Rights, Citizens’ Rights and Free Movement of Persons: COHOM and FREMP, to use our beloved acronyms. These are committees looking at human rights violations outside and inside the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, disappointing that the European Parliament only merits seven lines in a 20-page document. Ironically, those lines say that the European Parliament has made human rights and democracy one of its highest priorities. Well, not quite high enough to give us a central place, apparently, in an EU human rights strategy. This could probably have been written in the 1970s, taking absolutely no account of our enhanced role under the Lisbon Treaty. There is quite a long way to go before we have a fully coherent and fully credible human rights strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is all about increasing the focus on human rights and democratisation in EU foreign policy. It is a very important step forward and we welcome it. We need to take a serious and in-depth look at what we can do and I would like to quote a remark that you made, Baroness Ashton, yesterday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs which summed up the situation very well: ‘How to do human rights better’. The European Parliament has already called for this on several occasions and we in Parliament are happy to respond to the request to submit our own proposals. We have already made our initial comments. However, it is clear today that some areas definitely need improvement and further development. For example, there must be a mandatory process for calling to account companies which have their headquarters in the EU and which promote or encourage breaches of human rights. We have seen a worrying rise in the number of authoritarian regimes imposing censorship measures on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that I have noted down is that you did not take up the proposal to create a high-level representative or another position within the EU in order to enable human rights issues to be represented across a number of different policy areas. I would like to thank you very much for your verbal support for this. We in Parliament are very pleased about this, as it is something that we have called for.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention that it is very encouraging that the Danish Minister for European Affairs stated here today that implementing and developing this human rights strategy is very important for him. I will take this as an opportunity to emphasise once again that we will perhaps succeed in ensuring that all EU institutions not only adopt one strategy, but also commit to a common declaration and come to a common consensus on human rights. You will have the support of the human rights campaigners here in the House on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, this issue is linked to specific problems, in particular, in the case of indigenous national minorities that have inhabited certain territories for centuries. This applies not only to the Roma minority but also to other minorities. Regrettably, the current government in Lithuania does not respect the rights of indigenous national minorities. National minorities there do not have the right to use their own surnames, which is their rightful entitlement. They are also punished for using their mother tongue when dealing with public authorities, even in places where they account for over 80% of the population. Property rights regarding land seized by the Soviets are also not respected either. We ought to discuss all these matters. It is good that the High Commissioner of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has recently paid a visit to Lithuania. I do think, however, that both the Commission and the Council should also pay serious attention to these matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have paid tribute to those involved in the Arab Spring and to their courage – point noted.

<p class="contents">You claim to be inspired by the European Parliament’s work with regard to human rights. I should like to believe you, but I have my doubts. I will give you two examples of them. On page 19 of your statement, you devote a paragraph to the European Parliament, eight lines in fact. You shower us with advice asking us to intensify our efforts beyond the Subcommittee on Human Rights. I admit that this paragraph perplexes me, and I would gladly advise you to reread all of the European Parliament’s resolutions on these issues and to better integrate them into your strategy in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Second example: the democracy and human rights clauses. What you say on pages 12 and 13 of the statement again leaves me frustrated. Yes, there have been similar clauses in the European Union’s framework agreements with third countries since 1995. Yes, these clauses should, as you say, be taken into account within the framework of free trade negotiations. Yet we have seen no progress on this matter in your statement, and I am sorry about that.</p>

It will be very important to get this strategy right, as it will shape policies for a longer period of time. That is why the EU should opt for a really ambitious approach.</p>
<p class="contents">This will require the preparedness of structures inside the EU, especially the External Action Service. We need to make sure that we have prepared instruments and well-trained staff. It was encouraging to hear from the High Representative that she intends to appoint an EU special representative for human rights who would act as an EU voice in human rights policy internationally and increase coherence of EU policy in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU human rights strategy needs to ensure the full involvement and commitment of all EU institutions. Therefore, it should be effectively mainstreamed into EU policies and mechanisms, including those such as development, energy, environment and trade. All in all, it is necessary to ensure that the EU, through its foreign policy instrument, its enlargement processes and as an international actor, plays a clearly strengthened role in shaping human rights and democratisation in the whole world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can honestly say that you have been a champion of human rights. I should like to lend my support to all of your work in this field, even though this statement has arrived a little late.</p>
<p class="contents">You have said many interesting things. I should perhaps like to raise a small point: I do not believe that enough emphasis is placed on the importance that all our agreements can have – whether it be the aid we give to certain countries, or our partnership agreements, or the trade agreements we are drawing up with countries – in conveying the very idea of democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I should like to emphasise how much I welcomed the statement including ‘more for more’ for democracy in the Mediterranean, which to some extent determined our aid for advances in relation to democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to tell you that, in my opinion, there is still a lot of work to be done with regard to trade agreements. For example, if I take the free trade agreement we are currently discussing with Colombia, I know that, through the negotiations, we have already been able to help Colombia make progress in relation to trade unionists’ rights and human rights in general. However, although we are finalising this agreement, we have still not fully developed the monitoring mechanism which will enable us to see if the country is continuing to move towards democracy. There are still things to be done on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is that I do not agree with everything that has been said, at times, in the broad criticisms addressed to you, but I should also like to tell you that, in spite of it all, the issue of double standards, which we have not always known how to manage, is still of great concern to me. I should therefore like us to work hard on this, by trying to adopt a consistent approach in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that this strategy will help make various parts of the policy more coherent. I am thinking, in particular, of the relationship between trade and human rights. Moreover, it is now time we translated words into deeds and I would, once again, like to ask that you devote some attention to religious freedom.</p>

In Egypt, I talked to the Copts, whose lives are becoming more difficult, particularly now that there is a threat of extremist parties coming to power. In Turkey, I saw that the model which President Erdoğan and Arab countries are so keen to promote strongly disadvantages Christians. Aramaic Christians are slowly being brought to their knees and centuries-old monasteries, such as Mor Gabriel, are at risk of losing all their land.</p>

<p class="contents">Madam High Representative, you said that this new strategy must be ambitious and should make the strongest EU statement so far on human rights in terms of purpose, EU policy and EU commitment. While the main objective of the communication you are presenting today is to open a discussion with the other European institutions on how to make the EU’s external policy on human rights and democracy more active, more coherent and more effective, our expectation is that there will now be a swift, transparent and inclusive process moving forward and a truly ambitious EU human rights strategy will be adopted without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly recommend that a strategy should state clearly that human rights are not merely principles, nor European values, but international legal standards and obligations undertaken by states within the framework of international law. I expect the EU to make strong references to cooperation with the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and various international justice mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that a strategy should ensure that the European Parliament and civil society organisations are stakeholders in overseeing implementation of the EU’s human rights policy.</p>

However, I agree with my colleague, Sarah Ludford, who says that the EU is not going to be seen as credible as a human rights promoter if it continues ducking the serious responsibilities of Member States that collaborated in human rights violations under the guise of the war on terror.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that a country-by-country strategy on human rights that takes into account specificities and priorities along with dramatic campaigns, such as women’s rights, and related governance and rule-of-law questions, such as the fight against corruption, should enable EU foreign policy to improve coherence and achieve concrete results. Benchmarking can be a useful tool for us to reward a genuine willingness to protect human rights and dramatic practices and, through our trade and development policies, to put those who continue to resort to repressive policies at a disadvantage. Take Ethiopia, the second most populous country in Africa, which is massively financed by EU aid and is an outrageous example of our inconsistency, where we turn our blind eye to the blatant human rights’ violations.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe Parliament and civil society must participate in the elaboration of such country-based strategies and in the monitoring of their implementation. High Representative, in your visits, you should make a point of always meeting human rights’ defenders, particularly of women’s rights, and ensure that human rights are a mandatory topic for EU delegations and all in the European External Action Service.

I recall the fact that the Sakharov prize goes to representatives who are fighting for human rights in North Africa. I would also like to remind everyone of the Yemeni woman who spoke in Oslo’s City Hall. Those of us who heard it will not forget her speech, either.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise the importance of us having a representative devoted specifically to human rights issues and I would be so bold as to say here in plenary that it would be worthwhile for every national parliament to have a special minister for human rights. Then there is something that has been mentioned previously and that I would like to emphasise and that is how absurd it is that we are so silent on what is happening in Russia. I am sure that opinions are divided in this regard, but it seems to me that we are being silent on this.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the fact that an election in Mr Putin’s Russia should need to be guarded by 50 000 police officers, or maybe it was soldiers, and that the authorities are throwing hundreds of opponents into prison. Mr Putin ought to take a step back. He really has not made as much progress as he should have done when it comes to respect for human rights and freedoms. We really must also speak plainly in our relations with the ‘big bear’ that is Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, we actually have a problem here and it is quite clear to me that the flag that we display in our Parliament in certain instances has a reputation of which we can be proud. In other instances, it has a reputation for double standards. I see that displayed here today. For instance, in all of the comments that have been made, there has not been a single mention of the thousands and thousands of mass graves that have been discovered in the area of Kashmir, only as recently as a matter of months ago and going back over the last year or so. We, of course, as a set of institutions, are currently in negotiations with India. If you want that agreement to pass through this House – and I am committed to that agreement – one of the things we have to do is to see how we can square that circle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wanted to apologise to Ms Vaidere, but she is not here. I was distracted because we got the news of the death of four people and 46 injured in Liège in Belgium, which has been unfortunately due to what looks like explosions. It flashed on my phone and I must confess that I was very shocked and had to look at it, but I do apologise for not listening for that moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like – because I did not do it earlier – to say thank you to Ms Andrikienė for the work that she did in 2010 on the human rights report. It was an extremely important and valuable document. I skipped over her name – and I do apologise for that – in the earlier part.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to make it clear that this is not meant to be the definitive strategy. The reason for that is simply that I want the European Parliament to be involved and engaged with me as we drive this forward. You can never have a definitive moment in human rights where you say that we have actually got everything written down and everything covered, because situations change. As I have tried to argue in my contribution to it – and, yes, it did take time because I was not satisfied with some of the ideas and I wanted to push further and try out things and discuss and involve people as much as I possibly could within the service – we should look at how we can make it more effective and how we can take the relationships we have across the world and make sure that we use them to further the opportunities for democracy, peace, security and human rights for people across the world.</p>
<p class="contents">So I hope honourable Members will see it for what it is and what it is not. I do not pretend that it is a document seeking to give you all the answers, but rather to put down some thoughts that I hope will inspire further debate. Colleagues have raised a number of specific issues and I am just going to comment on two or three of them.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the issue of freedom of religion and belief. We have done a huge amount of work this year and it is an issue that honourable Members have raised on a number of occasions and which, indeed, Member States have raised in the Foreign Affairs Council. I am very pleased that we were able to achieve the consensus on our UN resolution promoting freedom of religion and belief. It is so significant that we take this forward. You will know that I have said it must be part of the reporting that we now carry out as part of our gathering together of information on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate what Mr Howitt said about not all delegations being up to speed. I know that. We are at the beginning of building a service and trying to make sure that every delegation all over the world has the resources, the people, the training and the way of going about things. It is not yet complete. They would be the first to say that, and I would echo that. What I hope you appreciate is the commitment to try to get there, not just from me, but also from all the heads of delegation when I met with them most recently.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues that concern lesbian, gay, transsexual and bisexual people are really issues of core importance to how we support people across the world. As honourable Members know, I have a long and personal commitment on this issue, and I think it is core to what we do. I raise it with individual countries when I visit, and we also make many statements and promote the importance of this issue in everything that we do.</p>
<p class="contents">For reference on the Commonwealth – I am afraid that Ms Sinclaire did not wait for the answer either – I was a special guest of the Commonwealth, which meant that while I was in Australia, I had the opportunity to address 53 ministers, to have 28 bilateral meetings and to take part in two events, particularly with NGOs, on forced marriage and women as agents of change. On the way back, I also visited China and Japan, especially to show our solidarity for the people of Japan, still suffering from the effects of the tsunami.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms De Keyser raised particularly the issues of other Commission pieces of work, especially trade. Again, I have tried to capture that a bit in my thoughts about how to bring together our human rights work right across the Commission, so that in trade, in development – in everything that we do – it is part of the approach that we take, so I agree with you. Again, I pay tribute to the work that you have done on this.</p>
<p class="contents">On Camp Ashraf, Mr Stevenson, you have been tireless in pushing on this issue. I would say three or four things to you. Firstly, we just have to be a little careful about what we say might happen. Secondly, we are working very closely with the UN on this. The UN is in the lead. I have pushed through my discussions with the Secretary-General and the Special Representative. I have met with the Iraqi Foreign Minister on several occasions, and I have sent a special envoy to do a lot of work, not least with Member States. As you rightly recognise, it is important that those Member States who have nationals as residents in Camp Ashraf also need to be aware of what needs to happen. You will know, most recently, that I have indeed offered support to the UN in every possible way, in terms of how we can make sure that people are properly monitored and can feel secure.</p>
<p class="contents">But what we must be careful about is telling them that things may go wrong. What is important is to put it in place, so that they can feel confident in the UN process properly looking after them. It is a real challenge for us, but that is what we have to do. I think you know that I have worked extremely hard to try to make sure that the EU properly supports this international and UN process. I hope that this will see effect, as the UN now moves forward to try to support people into the future that they want to see for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Karim, I will not answer on Kashmir now, but I understand exactly what you were saying and perhaps we can talk about that. Thank you for your comments about responding to your letters. I do try to respond to letters from Members of the European Parliament as quickly as I can in all cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Belder, you raised Iran. You know that we have done a lot of work with Iran on human rights; we have sanctions against them for that. You know, too, that I watch with great interest and try very hard in my discussions with the Iranians to persuade them to move away from the death penalty. In any country it is wrong. In every country, we try to make sure that we oppose it as effectively as we possibly can. On any individual case that honourable Members wish to raise with me, we will do our very best to let you know what we are doing. We follow all these cases where we possibly can – as many as we know about – both on the ground and within Brussels, and we try our very best, not least with our partners across the world, to make sure that people’s rights are respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Initiated in 2010 and completed this year, the changes in North Africa highlighted that regimes which seemed immovable can collapse under pressure from people in the streets and the international community, disgusted by human rights violations. From this point of view, the review of the developments in the Arab region and the message they send for the future are encouraging. This also applies to progress in combating impunity, as in the case of the extradition of the former President of Côte d’Ivoire, Laurent Gbagbo, who is to be tried by the International Criminal Court. This allows us to hope that international mobilisation can help punish those who have been accustomed to trampling brutally on human lives and the fundamental rights of their fellow human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I wish to express my appreciation for the involvement of the European External Action Service in defending human rights. The European Union is the most concerned global player in this area. At the same time, this stance obliges us to step up our efforts to protect those persecuted by dictatorial governments and traumatised by barbaric violence, especially involving human rights activists. In this respect, I believe that a major role must be given again in 2012 to cooperation between the EU and the UN High Commission for Human Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Human rights and equality: the idea of equality before the law is the legacy of the French Revolution. Nowadays, it is considered a basic human right. Despite the fact that there exists legislation which guarantees equality between men and women, its implementation within the European Union is ineffective. In the European Union, gender equality exists on paper only. In practice, women suffer discrimination socially, economically and politically. Discrimination also affects sexual, ethnic, religious and racial minority groups and those with disabilities, as well as the poor and the elderly. The perception that there is a lack of equal opportunities and discrimination is being felt more widely throughout Europe. To all intents and purposes, the only group which is not discriminated against consists of young, healthy and affluent males. In Poland, the additional criterion of being Catholic must also be met.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights and exclusion: second-generation human rights include economic, social and cultural rights. They guarantee so-called social security. Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union’s objectives include combating social exclusion and discrimination. The question arises as to whether these rights constitute a guarantee against exclusion in the EU. The problem of exclusion concerns 79 million people, which means that the basic rights of 16% of Europeans are being permanently violated. In 2010, the European Union assigned EUR 26 million to fight poverty and social exclusion. What are the results of these actions? Is the Union capable of dealing with such enduring infringements of human rights? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
