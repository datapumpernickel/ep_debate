<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure today to inform you about three important matters dealt with by the Commission. I need to be clear but also go into some detail in this speech, and so I apologise if it gets a little boring!</p>
<p class="contents">I will deal first with the Commission's political priorities for 2003, then with the Commission's human and financial resources and, lastly, with the Convention which is going to start work tomorrow. First, then, the Commission's political priorities for 2003, which will be one of the most important stages in the organisation of our political life. This year, for the first time, the three main institutions will conduct an in-depth dialogue on the political priorities and the legislative working programme for the coming year. We shall do so on the basis of the new understanding presented at the Conference of Presidents on 31 January.</p>
<p class="contents">For next year, we have identified three priorities: enlargement, stability and security and a sustainable and inclusive economy. Fully successful enlargement has been a top priority for this Commission since the beginning of its mandate, and enlargement will therefore remain a key priority throughout the second part of my term of office. In this context, 2003 will be a very important year, in which we must all be ready to assume our full responsibilities towards the new Member States. We must be ready to welcome into the Commission our colleagues from the new Member States and to face new challenges. Let me remind you that if we complete the enlargement negotiations in 2002, then 2003 must be the pivotal year when we prepare ourselves to make sure that enlargement goes ahead smoothly on 1 January 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">During 2003, therefore, the Commission intends to do several things. Firstly, we must help the future Member States prepare to fully assume all the responsibilities arising from accession. Secondly, we must make sure the Commission fulfils all its obligations from the very first day of accession. Thirdly, we must rethink Community policies. This will be the most significant enlargement in the entire history of European integration, and it is essential that we reflect on what common policies the enlarged Union will need.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if enlargement is to be a total success, we must also give a high profile to the other two priorities I mentioned just now. Indeed, the three subjects we are talking about today are closely linked. First and foremost, stability and security. Within the Union, our main objective is to step up progress towards a European area of justice, security and freedom. Therefore, the fight against crime in all its forms – including terrorism, or rather, starting with terrorism – is and will remain at the top of our agenda. I also believe that there needs to be particular focus on all the complex effects of immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Outside the Union, another of our priorities is to spread stability and security throughout our continent and to the regions bordering on the enlarged Union. To achieve this, we need to strengthen our partnerships with neighbouring countries. The reinvigoration of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership must do more than seek to establish a market place: it must create a genuine community of good neighbours. To this end, we shall pursue our strategy of strengthening the Barcelona process. In particular, on the economic front, we shall seek to develop joint projects and initiatives together with the countries on the Mediterranean's southern shore through a new financial institution based on the EIB's operation – notably, this morning, we approved the idea that it should be an institution in which the EIB holds the majority share – on the basis of the guidelines the Commission has, indeed, adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we shall spare no efforts in seeking to help resolve the conflict in the Middle East, where the most recent developments have, at last, generated a glimmer of hope after months of tragedy. We shall also move forward with the association and stabilisation process in the Balkans and, in the wider world, we shall continue to support the reconstruction of Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">Our third priority for 2003 is a sustainable, inclusive economy. I believe it will not be long before the economy recovers, but a lot depends on how resolutely the EU implements the Lisbon Strategy. Indeed, the external dimension of this strategy is particularly important as it can help us direct the path of globalisation and ensure that its benefits are shared as widely as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve this, we shall be fighting on several fronts. Firstly, the negotiations begun at Doha will be entering a crucial phase, not this year but in 2003. Then we must ensure that the Kyoto commitments are implemented. Finally, we must improve the global partnership between north and south, practically affirming Europe's solidarity with Africa. Proper discussions will be opened on these issues at Monterrey in a few weeks’ time. The situation is certainly not the most encouraging, there is certainly no cause for optimism in our – at last serious – commitment to the Developing World, but the Commission undertakes to work in this sphere.</p>
<p class="contents">My second subject for today is the analysis of the Commission's human and financial resources. Our Annual Policy Strategy does not simply identify the key political priorities; it also seeks to ensure that the Commission has sufficient resources for its tasks. This is the commitment I gave at the start of my term of office, and it is now becoming reality as we achieve coherence between policy decisions, planned activities and resources. This Commission has never undertaken to do anything without having the necessary resources and will never do so. We must therefore ensure – and this is the plan we are working on – that optimum use is made of human resources. We have made every endeavour to improve the situation, through productivity gains, negative priorities – identifying tasks to be abandoned, that is – and internal redeployment. At this point, however, we cannot prepare properly for enlargement without more staff. There is absolutely no doubt about that if you consider, for example, that the number of languages used – in Parliament too, of course, and in all the work of the different institutions – will almost double.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Commission must also be ready to ensure application of the Community acquis right from day one of accession. This means we have to complete all aspects of enlargement preparations by the end of 2003. To this end, precisely with a view to preparing gradually for enlargement, after rigorous analysis, the Commission has requested 500 non-permanent staff in its Annual Policy Strategy for 2003. We all know that the current ceiling for administrative expenditure does not allow sufficient resources to cover preparations for enlargement. The Commission therefore considers it essential to use the flexibility instrument it has proposed. This request for 500 non-permanent staff in 2003 forms part of a global package of staffing needs to cope with enlargement, and it is derived from a detailed analysis of all the activities the Commission will have to perform in future. The complete results of this analysis will appear in the preliminary draft budget for 2003 and will be presented for debate in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Our other two priorities – security and an inclusive economy – give the Commission additional responsibilities too. However, in order not to have to ask for yet more staff we have decided to approve new initiatives only if they can be carried out by redeploying our existing staff and/or by phasing out some of our existing activities. This shows how seriously and responsibly the Commission is committed to its priorities and also to budgetary discipline. Apart from anything else, the Commissioner for the Budget is here and she is watching to make sure that I respect this undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to financial resources, the Commission and the Budgetary Authority must urgently find a more structural solution to the permanent overstretching of external relations Heading 4. No action can be totally efficient under the current constraints: in other words, we are wasting resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year's international developments, and especially the events of 11 September and the ensuing war in Afghanistan, showed once again that the Union needs specific mechanisms for making the extra funds it needs for crisis intervention swiftly available. This is of the utmost importance if we are genuinely to strengthen the European Union’s voice in the world. The breakdown in Heading 4 that the Commission proposes therefore accommodates crucial political priorities such as Afghanistan, the Euro-Mediterranean Bank and the Global Health Fund, without jeopardising our other fields of external action. I would therefore urge this House and the Council to address the issue of resources as soon as possible, for the actions I have mentioned cannot be put off.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, focusing on the Commission's political priorities for 2003 must not make us forget that we are on the threshold of a genuinely historic event that will shape the future of Europe. Indeed, tomorrow, in this building, the Convention mandated to put forward proposals for the Europe of the twenty-first century and to prepare a first draft of Europe's future Constitution will meet for the very first time.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the present Treaties, the European Commission has the role of initiating legislation and safeguarding the general interests of the Community. Naturally, therefore, the Commission wishes to deliver a strong political message on the Convention's significance and on its objectives. Let me start by reminding you that the Convention is the result of the joint efforts of the European Parliament and the Commission, and we must be proud of this joint achievement, for not everybody supported the idea of a Convention some months or even weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore very pleased to see a constitutional debate on the future of Europe getting under way, especially as most of the Convention’s members will be elected representatives of the people, not just representatives of national governments.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to see that the appointed representatives are of a very high calibre. No one can attempt to direct the Convention or to dictate the way it should work or the conditions it should respect. The Convention is composed of the highest calibre people who will manage their work themselves, independently. I believe that not only will it work freely and produce excellent results but that afterwards, ultimately, the governments will not be able to ignore its outcome when they set about reforming the Treaties. The governments are still sovereign, of course, but the work of this Convention will have a huge impact on the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, as we know, the Convention is open to ideas coming from civil society. Thus, no one will be able to claim that the new Treaty is the result of negotiations between Brussels bureaucrats and diplomats from which ordinary citizens have been excluded. We must not forget that the desire for a Convention was conceived the morning after the night of the Nice Council. It was conceived when we realised that we could not go on like that. It was not the result of a coincidence, it was generated by the realisation that a method had failed.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission intends to play an active role in the Convention's work via the two designated Commissioners and my own direct, personal undertaking. We are aware of what is at stake and we can see that European integration is the only new development, the only proper institutional change being attempted in the world. It is the only practical attempt at democratic globalisation amongst the seas of words.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must also, through this Convention, propose a common plan for European society with which our citizens can identify, and we must therefore decide immediately, at the start of the Convention’s work, what we want to do together and in what kind of society we want to live in the coming years. It is this choice of society in Europe that will determine the means we use to achieve it and the powers and responsibilities the future European Union should have, not the other way round! Therefore, we must first decide what we want to do together and then adapt the institutional structure to suit our objectives. We believe that the Community method is still a suitable instrument, the instrument that has distinguished and characterised Europe’s greatness thus far. However, we cannot take the conservative line of simply defending it to the hilt: we shall be proposing innovative ways of adapting it to the needs of tomorrow's Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident that this House will support the Commission as we strive to find solutions that will ensure that the European Union’s decision-making process is both efficient and democratic.</p>

We will certainly have to discuss that on another occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, we can of course go along with everything that you have said. You spoke about enlargement, and I would ask you to think – and perhaps say something later – about whether you in the Commission might also apply the system we want to introduce after the accession treaties are signed, that of having observers from the candidate countries here in Parliament. Do you think it might be possible to involve figures from the candidate countries in the work of the Commission, while these countries are not, as yet, Members?</p>
<p class="contents">You then talked about the Mediterranean. If it is true that around 7 000 deaths a year occur in the Mediterranean, for example among people in transit by boat from Morocco to Spain or Portugal, how can we, on the one hand, achieve an improvement in the situation in these countries, and, on the other, make the prevention of these pitiable people's deaths an achievement for our security policy?</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke about the Mediterranean Bank, which can be a positive element to which we are not opposed, but no structures must be created in addition to the European Investment Bank. I would therefore be grateful if you could say something about that.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke about stability, and, as far as stability and the repatriation of debts in national budgets are concerned, I would like to encourage the Commission to keep on course and write your warning letter, as you had planned, ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... to both these Member States. I find it an unacceptable system in which those who are at the end of the day to be criticised, themselves decide whether such criticism should be meted out! I think we need quite new ways of forming judgments in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">My final observation, Mr President, is perhaps aimed more at us ourselves, but I would be grateful if the President of the Commission could say something about it.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruptions)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Just calm down! It is your convictions too that I am expressing. The Council is not here today. I do not want to criticise anybody, but we must prepare for the future, and for the reform of the Council, by ensuring that the Council is represented when the President of the Commission makes an important statement in this House. This is not now aimed solely at the Spanish Presidency; it is a topic of general relevance to the reform of the Council. I believe that there is an urgent need for reforms to the European Council of Ministers!</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr Poettering, I am very happy to answer your questions and I will try to be as brief as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">You raised the question of observers coming from the candidate countries to visit the Commission. In my opinion, this is a good idea. Technically, it will not be easy, but if we want the Commission to be able to work<span class="bold"> </span>up to speed as soon as enlargement has taken place, we must start to establish this relationship of training and learning now. It will not be easy because the candidate countries are not, of course, as yet in a position to decide who their future Commissioners will be, and the rules are not yet quite clear. I can assure you, however, that we are addressing the issue and we intend to resolve it openly and constructively.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is security. I have always maintained that, like all serious problems, the major issue of macro-immigration is something that cannot be resolved at national level. It is absolutely impossible for the problem of the great waves of migration from the east and the south to be resolved purely by national measures. European cooperation is needed, and so we must conclude this element of the Tampere agenda and work together on protecting borders, as we proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">A further point is the Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank. What were the political and economic aims behind this? We have seen increasing dissatisfaction on the part of the southern Mediterranean countries in recent years, caused by our favouring the east – as they put it, in clear, direct terms. I explained that, in effect, we had been compelled by history to undertake this enlargement immediately but that I was committed to setting up a strategy for the south as soon as possible. This we have done. The bank could have merely been a fund or a facility, as has been suggested – that is a fund set up for the purpose – or it could have been a genuine bank. A <span class="italic">bona fide</span> bank will have greater autonomy, a greater capacity to intervene in the private sector and greater flexibility, and, most importantly, it will be in a better position to perform an education role, to get the leaders of the countries of the southern Mediterranean to work together with our people. We therefore decided on a bank, but we do share your concern, Mr Poettering, the concern of everybody here and in the Member States, not to create another minor bank and further bureaucracy when there is a European Investment Bank which is already dealing – with extraordinary success – with EUR 9 billion of investments in the southern Mediterranean. I would inform you that there have been no cases of default on payment, except with regard to the investments made in Gaza, and you will understand why that might be the case there. We want to capitalise on this experience and so the Commission has proposed a bank. However, the major shareholders in the bank will be the European Investment Bank, the Commission, the share-holding countries and, most importantly, the countries of the southern Mediterranean. Although these countries will, of course, start off with a fairly small share, their role in the bank itself will increase with time.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the last point, I do not feel the Commission needs to give Parliament any explanation of how it is dealing with the matter. It has fulfilled its obligations and mandates consistently and complied with the need to give early warnings where the figures showed that this was necessary. We have not carried out any special assessments. We have complied with our primary obligation, which is to fulfil our mandates, and will continue to do so in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The complaint is that we are experts in devaluing important debates. This is the most important debate in terms of the European Parliament’s work over the next year and we are dealing with it as if it were a question of procedure and a rubber-stamping debate. I believe that this is absurd and things should not be done in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the messages; firstly, I would address the Commission. Mr President of the Commission, in December we criticised you, but now we must welcome the Commission’s efforts and I am quite happy to say that the Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, has actively contributed to our reaching an agreement which makes it possible for there to be a legislative programme and a work programme. Please carry on in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, you have asked us to support you in relation to having more civil servants and more resources in order to deal with enlargement. I would remind you that Parliament already indicated in Agenda 2000 that enlargement could not take place without amending the forecasts for 2000. You have added Afghanistan and other priorities. The Council should be hearing this because it is the Council which is most intransigent. No representative of the Council is present. I have noticed that Mr Poettering, in a display of generosity, has not applied the Poettering doctrine; I imagine that if the Secretary of State comes, he will apply it; he will say that it should be a Minister. But, in any event, it is important that the Council should also hear this message from the Commission. You have our support.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am not going to go into detail on each of the issues because they are all very important and there is a degree of convergence. I will make a final point. In relation to the Convention, we are in agreement; I also welcome the fact that you said it was a joint initiative of Parliament and the Commission. This morning I read some headlines in a prominent Italian newspaper which said that it had been you alone. I am delighted that you have countered what the Italian press has said by pointing out that it has been a joint effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Parliament wanted something like the Convention before the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It wanted it afterwards and it wants it now. I believe this is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, you are the guardians of the Treaties, and my specific question is, are you prepared to exercise your powers of initiative in the Convention in order to preserve and strengthen the Community method? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you, Mr Barón Crespo, for your positive comments on our progress; moreover, I said in a previous debate that my rhythm was like that of a diesel engine, and diesel engines take a while to get going but then run at full speed and keep going for years!</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of flexibility in the budget is of paramount importance. We cannot confuse the need for rigour and your supervisory obligation and the Commission’s obligation to be subject to your supervision – which is the fundamental basis for democratic legitimacy – with the failure<span class="bold"> </span>to be flexible and take<span class="bold"> </span>major new events<span class="bold"> </span>and<span class="bold"> </span>changes<span class="bold"> </span>into account. This is a question of adapting to change that we must address together. We must succeed in genuinely taking control of the budgetary changes<span class="bold"> </span>which prove to be necessary and which are discussed and agreed on. This is the line we are taking.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the joint effort and the comments in the Italian press, I did not say that I was alone but that I was alone the morning of the press conference, and I can assure you that I certainly was alone, for I had Mr Chirac on one side and Mr Jospin on the other, with the journalists facing me, and I can assure you that nobody dreamed of suggesting the Convention then. Of course, Parliament had already proposed it – that is clear; it was fiercely debated but it seemed a totally unfeasible project. It was only the negative events which made it a clear possibility, and we were able to move forward. It is my opinion that, if that crisis had not happened, we would not have the Convention now. Of that I am convinced, for even crises can be learning experiences.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the right of initiative, it is, of course, the great distinguishing feature of the Community institutions, marking them out from other bodies, and we are committed to it. It is vital that we defend it, as you said, and strengthen it, but we must also adapt it, modernise it and bring it into line with Parliament’s work, for the right of initiative is not a weapon: the right of initiative is the driving force behind the institutions. We must be totally responsible in our use of it, and that is our aim. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is good reason for returning to them and developing this debate. I look forward to such a debate’s being held in a few weeks' time with more detailed proposals concerning your priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to thank you for your contribution to the new procedure we have now brought about. Above all, I want to say thank you to the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio. We now have a timetable and new procedures for bringing about better cooperation between the Commission and Parliament when it comes to the annual legislative and work programme. I believe that this interaction in the form of a partnership will operate extremely well, that it will be easier for citizens and the rest of us to follow the procedures and that the follow-up will be better, etc. I believe that, as early as in a week or so, Parliament’s different committees will enter into discussions with relevant members of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">That is an important part of the work of reforming our various institutions, both for Parliament and the Commission. I should like to ask the President of the Commission how those in the Commission intend to proceed with the work in the White Paper, sent out in March of last year, on better forms of governance. Many of the issues affecting democracy and the future of Europe will be discussed in the Convention but, at the same time, we of course have ‘everyday issues’ which also fall under the working title, ‘better forms of governance’, for example increased openness, simpler procedures and increased participation on the part of citizens. I wonder if you can say something about those matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, we are all involved in a battle in which most of us are displaying solidarity – liberalising the markets, standardising rules, streamlining systems, eliminating monopolies, abolishing privileges, which are certainly very important operations – but, and here I share Mr Modrow’s concern, we are also faced with a situation in essentially all the European countries of increased disparities. These are facts, statistics. I am not criticising or passing judgment. I therefore feel that it is essential to initiate another debate on these subjects, to focus on them once again, for the European model has always been concerned with<span class="bold"> </span>justice and solidarity as well as efficiency. There is no doubt that, if we fail to do this, we will be sowing the seeds of Europe’s destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, however, setting an example of solidarity. Enlargement is a unique event, it is the only instance in the world of countries whose economic situations differ widely being brought together. If only others in the world would try to do something similar to what we are attempting. This is a practical display of solidarity. We must move forwards in this direction, but I would stress that the carelessness with which all of us in Europe are currently treating these major issues of solidarity and social balance is unacceptable. They warrant much deeper reflection at this time, and prevailing thought on these matters appears to be far too one-dimensional. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This issue of temporary work has been scheduled for debate on 20 March for some time: we chose 20 March because we needed to fine-tune certain technical aspects since, as you know, there are certain specific rather than general solutions which impact on cost and services in the different European countries. Therefore, approximately a month ago, when we set our agenda, we decided to give ourselves until 20 March, not least because it was not envisaged that the issue would be debated at Barcelona. However, we will focus on this matter when the Commission meets immediately after Barcelona. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will be able to raise the funds needed for Afghanistan, as promised at the Tokyo donor conference, from the foreign policy budget. New things may also, for example, be required of us in respect of Cyprus. If the successful outcome is actually achieved, with a political process leading to Cyprus's accession to the EU in 2004, this will mean that we will have to make preparatory funds available in 2003. That, then, will be a new requirement – and let me add that I hope this will be so.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has decided, within the framework of the common foreign and security policy, to send a police task force into Bosnia from 1 January 2003 onwards, and this too will make demands on the European budget. I believe that we should work together on this, affirming that we also want part of this mission, being a joint action, to be jointly financed, and that is something we have to make clear. Mr Mulder, we had the opportunity to talk about this yesterday. The Commission has proposed a new financial instrument for crisis operations, and I am gladdened by the many expressions of support there have been for this in Parliament. Together, perhaps, we can convince the Council that the right response would be to fund such emergency measures on a Community-wide basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the way the Barcelona process is being made deeper and given a more definite form. I would again like a definite answer about something I cannot comprehend, namely why you decided against this facility, which, in this year alone, could demonstrate with what commitment we are working on a pro-active Mediterranean policy, whereas – as we learned from our experience with the foundation of the ‘Bank for Eastern Europe’ – a bank or its subsidiary needs a longer period of time even to become operational, and is much more expensive in terms of personnel and budget allocations. Quite apart from that, have you even found a political solution to the problem? If we need partners in the Arab states – where there are already so many funds that certainly not all the Arab states will get involved – what will you do if Israel also wants to participate in this bank? Would this not handicap its foundation from the start, and would it not therefore be better to start work on a facility capable of demonstrating to everyone the European Union's commitment to a Mediterranean policy?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me ask in conclusion: When will the Commission, as guardian of the treaties and thereby obliged to watch over the Member States' commitment to Europe as a community based on law, send a warning letter to Member States which jeopardise the rule of law? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You made the direct comparison with the EIB, and it is precisely in order to avoid a long start-up period that we have opted for a structure in which the European Investment Bank holds the majority share. The EIB has EUR 9 billion invested in that area, it has experts and an established way of operating. I have, of course, in recent days, been in almost daily contact with President Maystadt regarding this matter, discussing the technical side of the issue. For their part, they can see no problems or obstacles and are ready to get off to a quick start.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in my speech just now, I stressed that there have been no defaults on payments. Why have I mentioned this, Mrs Randzio-Plath? Because, in my opinion, this shows that the EIB is proceeding with extreme caution, that it is pursuing this policy with all possible care, but, at the same time – and this would not be possible with a facility – we can undertake operations which we have not attempted before: we can be much more active in the private sector and we can work together with local, regional and national banks, thereby greatly increasing our action; we can thus have a very different type of activity.</p>
<p class="contents">This structure also provides part of the answer to your second question. I can see – and I would stress that we are still at the stage of the Commission proposal and so we can still explore the matter further – that the countries of the southern shore of the Mediterranean appear to be content with a structure with which they can form a relationship and work together and in which they can be shareholders and sit on the management board. In other words, we have opted for this compromise formula to enable these countries to make an active, responsible contribution – they can sit on the management boards and have an active role – and, at the same time, to exploit the experience of the EIB, on which we can all rely.</p>
<p class="contents">Which countries will take part? It is open to the countries of the southern Mediterranean, but we have not addressed the specific issues because they will be dealt with in a political debate with the Council, nor the future debate with the third countries. For now, I believe that it is right to take this path, to link Europe and the southern shore of the Mediterranean; to start work and see what opportunities present themselves in the future. I can assure you, however, that we have also reflected on the problems of coordination with the World Bank, which already operates in this field but only has a quarter of the EIB’s investments, employs four fifths of its resources in a single country, Turkey, and, in other words, does not have a general activity dedicated to the Mediterranean; the African Development Bank operates throughout the Mediterranean but with negligible impact. Our bank’s responsibility for development will be absolutely vital, and the choice we have made strikes precisely the right balance between innovation and caution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Giscard d’Estaing will adopt a position on whether MEPs’ proposals are good enough to be translated and debated. Every MEP must naturally be entitled to make proposals and have them translated, put on the agenda and, finally, voted on. Today our delegation has obtained the fifth draft agenda. We are not familiar with the first four, and I would therefore ask our own President to ensure that, in future, we are given all the documents as soon as they arrive in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the Commission President, Mr Prodi. I see that the Commission is opposed to a competence catalogue which is able to place limits upon the EU’s activities. In that connection, I should like to ask Mr Prodi whether, at least, the debates in the Convention might not be prepared for by putting forward proposals as to what might be transferred back to the Member States if, for example, there was an obligation to halve the number of laws. To draw up a competence catalogue, knowledge of each individual area is required such as only the Commission and the national governments have at their disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should just like to thank Mr Prodi for the fact that, two years after the decision, we can now obtain agendas and Minutes from meetings of the Commission. That is major progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
