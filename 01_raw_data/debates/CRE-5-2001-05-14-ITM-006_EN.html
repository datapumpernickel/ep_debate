<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Evans, Robert J.E. (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, this report comes from a Commission proposal presented in January 2000, a proposal drafted under Articles 149 and 150, which called on the Member States to foster the mobility of people undertaking a course of study, a period of training, voluntary work, or work as a teacher or trainer in another Member State, whether on a Community programme or not. When this recommendation from the Commission was presented to Parliament, it was very quickly clear that it was a flawed document and indeed the Commission accepted this itself. Perhaps with hindsight it might have been easier if we had rejected it some 18 months ago and started again, but we did not and I and colleagues have worked hard to present something to Parliament and to salvage something from it.</p>
<p class="contents">At our first reading in Strasbourg last October, Parliament voted amendments which I felt would improve the quality of the text, and I announced some of the irregularities and flaws to which I alluded a moment ago. We also sought to extend the scope of the original proposal, for example to include researchers, as had been requested by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. Thirdly, we called on the Member States and the Commission to set targets and precise goals to measure the progress towards the goals that had been set, i.e. to set indicators to monitor them.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues may recall this report came before Parliament at a particularly sensitive time for the Commission. I understand that it was anxious to match action with resources and for that reason it rejected all those amendments that required it to take follow-up action. It did not reject all the amendments, only those that asked it to take follow-up action, something that is particularly important. It also rejected anything related to researchers, which I understood.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, I have had lengthy deliberations and negotiations with Commission staff, whom I thank for their time, with the French Presidency, which prioritised this report, and indeed latterly with the Swedish Presidency, which has equally been generous with its time and energy.</p>
<p class="contents">We looked at ways to cover the following important areas: the nature of voluntary work and administrative, financial, linguistic and cultural obstacles to mobility. The common position which has now been arrived at contributes to the clarity of the text, particularly where it deals with third-country nationals. It rejects, however, most of Parliament's amendments on social security and social protection rights, areas that we felt were crucial for interest groups, for students, teachers and others. This is why we have had to make a few amendments to the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">I presented six amendments at second reading, which refer in particular to the action plan that stemmed from the Nice Summit, which it is important to refer to because it clarifies many of the points that we wanted to raise. I have asked for some follow-up action from Member States. I have looked at ways in which we can reduce the administrative costs of implementing this recommendation. I have clarified, I hope, the follow-up action that is expected of the Commission and removed an unnecessary and potentially harmful qualification in the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these amendments are admissible and I have had discussions again with the Swedish Presidency to make certain that they are in line. There will be one or two small technical points that I would like to bring up tomorrow as oral amendments, just to clarify the text and for the sake of linguistic consistency. I want to make the report unambiguously clear so that it can go through and Member States are absolutely clear what is expected of them. As a result of this report we will be taking a few, albeit tentative, steps towards creating mobility for those in education, teachers, students, academics and others, so that they can actually move from one country to another within the European Union, make that a reality and take a first step forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are now debating a report about which in my view there is very little difference of opinion. In the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport the report was unanimously approved, and I should like to compliment the rapporteur, Mr Evans. I am happy with this report. It further strengthens the joint position and has also taken account of the conclusions of the Nice Summit. The mobility programme gives students, teachers, volunteers, placement students and others the opportunity of gaining experience abroad. With an internal market that is operating more and more efficiently, in which people increasingly go and work in other countries, and with an increasingly multicultural society that is extremely important. That experience may lead to increased knowledge of various languages and cultures, even in European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps even more importantly, Mr President, it has been shown that participants, develop a greater sense of Europe, the European intellectual tradition and the importance of European cooperation. For that reason also it is a good and extremely important programme. That is why it is a pity that, as we know, there are quite a few obstacles facing those wishing to avail themselves of the mobility programme. Barriers, for example, in the field of social security, medical expenses insurance, residence permits, recognition of study credits, language problems, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">At the first reading a first initiative was taken towards measures that would remove these hindrances. In the joint position, I feel, a good compromise was reached and in any case it is another step in the right direction. It was possible after all to further improve the text of the recommendation. There are further guarantees that Member States will not use the freedom of manoeuvre offered by the treaty in such a way that the free passage of individuals is, in practice, unnecessarily impeded.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to seize this opportunity to highlight yet again a problem that has existed for years, and has been known about for years, and about which complaints are heard whenever one visits one’s constituency, and that is the enormous bureaucratic maze facing anyone wishing to use this programme. There is a mountain of red tape. I am therefore glad that the report on which we are voting this week provides for an evaluation, a report on the implementation of the programme and the measures taken by Member States in this area. I hope, Mr President, that the cumbersome working practices and procedures will be included in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I welcome the Commission’s intention to make such a recommendation for researchers. As the rapporteur has already said: they experience the same obstacles and I am delighted that the Commission hopes to be able to present a recommendation on the subject shortly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a great day for education policy throughout Europe. The adoption of this recommendation must inevitably lead to greater mobility of students and others in education, and the mobility of students is of the utmost importance for the continued development of the European Union. The more people that move to another country for a period – whether for education or for work purposes – the greater will be the understanding between our peoples at a human, cultural and professional level. Understanding is the ‘glue’ that is required to bind the European Union together. The greater the mobility of students and others, the more strongly this ‘glue’ will be able to hold the European project together.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major gain is that we will see better adaptation of the workforce to the international labour market and to the labour market of the future, which will be characterised by flexibility and the ability to adjust. It is quite simply essential for Europe to meet these requirements if we are to hope to keep up with the other major economic players on the global stage. The Americans have a very high degree of mobility among students and among their workforce. This is undoubtedly an area in which we can learn something from the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I must therefore say thank you – a big thank you – and congratulations to Mr Evans, who has done some very substantial, first-rate and persistent work in connection with this report. I will also allow myself to express pleasure at the fact that this recommendation is directed at people in the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe. It is of the utmost importance that young people from the applicant countries also participate in the EU’s education programmes. In this connection, it might be asked whether the EU’s education programmes are adequate. We should look at whether they can be made more efficient and possibly expanded, so that more young people can go and study abroad. All young people should try to study in another country sooner or later in the course of their education, and it is also similarly important for teachers and volunteers to receive inspiration from elsewhere. We are on the right track with this proposal from Mr Evans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The tabled amendments refine the draft further, making it clearer and more up to date. We are still, however, far from our goal in everyday practice. We must do all we can to get the agreements translated into action and to make the freedoms which we advocate as a basic principle of the European Union an actual part of the daily lives of all people, not just young people, in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues, it is true that citizens have already been enjoying greater mobility since the internal market was introduced, but there is still a long way to go. We must continue to dismantle all barriers to freedom of movement. Equal rights and benefits, recognition of periods of study abroad, promotion of multilingualism, promotion of information exchange and the dismantling of administrative and financial obstacles must be translated into reality and not just written down in the action plan. A previous speaker has pointed out that we still have not reached our goal in the matter of taxation, the recognition of health insurance, employment and social law, social security and the mutual recognition of academic qualifications. I therefore call for a greater application of the EU principle of non-discrimination in all these areas, too, because mobility also needs underpinning socially with some minimum standards so that persons who are mobile are not disadvantaged in other ways. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We attach fundamental importance to it, as Members of this House have said, from the point of view not only of the personal enrichment of the individual but also of the creation of the great European family.

<p class="contents">Mr Evans, I should like to thank you so much for the work that you have undertaken, for your commitment and for your efforts to find solutions to problems that are not always easy, owing to the institutional barriers which, unfortunately, prevent us from making progress as rapidly as all of us would wish.</p>

In addition to Mr Evans, I should like to thank all those members of the committee who have helped to ensure that Parliament, the Council and the Commission would together be able to find solutions at the end of a long process.</p>
<p class="contents">The text of the Council common position on which Parliament has to vote is the result of a long debate between the three institutions. I think that the final text reflects the efforts of all those involved in the question of mobility in Europe, even though I agree with those Members who say that a text is not enough, and that it must be followed by specific actions.</p>
<p class="contents">However, by continuing the debate on the recommendation, I think that we are nevertheless progressing along the lines proposed at the Lisbon and Nice Summits, which recommended that education and training policies should play a major role in European economic growth and social renewal, and which therefore made mobility one of the key elements of those policies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also from this viewpoint, Mr President, that we should understand the action plan for mobility approved by the Nice Council, since it provides an operational supplement to the measures laid down in the recommendation and constitutes the expression of a new commitment to mobility on the part of the Member States. On the subject of commitment, I should like to assure this House of the commitment of my colleague, Mr Busquin, who is actively working to ensure that mobility for researchers develops along the same lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I set out the position that the Commission intends to adopt on the occasion of this second reading, I hope you will permit me to refer back to the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading, since your rapporteur has mentioned them.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to be able to say that both the Commission, in its amended proposal of 9 November last, and the Council, in its proposal of 19 January, have accepted, either in whole or in part, the great majority of those amendments, particularly those intended to improve the quality of the text in order to reinforce Community action. The text of the common position thus incorporates 40 of the 56 amendments approved by Parliament at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, at second reading, Mr Evans is proposing six amendments to the common position, on which I shall now comment. Some of these amendments, namely Amendments Nos 1 and 3, add an explicit reference to the action plan for mobility as a new legal act covering the area of mobility. They are therefore intended to create synergy between these two initiatives. Synergy implies the agreement of the Commission as well, because we are in agreement with both these texts. Nevertheless, in the recital amended by Amendment No 1, I should like to add a reference to the Nice Council, which was originally provided in Amendment No 3. This is actually a very small correction that in no way changes the content.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with Amendment Nos 2 and 4 which provide clarification regarding the action taken in response to the recommendation, in particular with regard to the timing and content of the reports by the Member States and the Commission on the implementation of the recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the greater detail sought by Parliament in Amendment No 3, regarding the profile of the members of the group of experts, are entirely relevant. Finally, I support the point of view of Parliament’s Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, in proposing to remove the time specification of – and I quote – not exceeding, in principle, one year, in the definition of the mobility and activities of volunteers, in Amendment Nos 5 and 6. This results in a more flexible form of words, whereby the mobility referred to by the recommendation is the mobility of limited duration which appeared in the Commission’s original proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">So you see, Mr Evans, the Commission is able to accept the six amendments proposed at second reading, subject to a slight change to the wording of Amendment No 3. In my opinion, this convergence of the viewpoints of Parliament, the Commission and, I am sure, of the Council too, show that we are all heading in the same direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also, Mr President, like to thank Parliament, which has always understood the importance of mobility, and which has always demonstrated its willingness to cooperate throughout the process, even at difficult moments. Is that not so Mr Evans? We have reached an agreement which is not a political one, but is one that concerns the fundamental needs of our students and teachers.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to remind the House of the important role assigned to Parliament in Community initiatives on the subject of mobility, such as the communication on the new European employment markets which makes provision, amongst other things, for the setting up of a high-level task force on qualifications and mobility, or the Social Agenda, which recommends the modernisation of the rules in order to ensure that workers’ social rights are retained in the context of mobility. I should like to draw this latter text to the attention of those Members who have quite rightly pointed out that one of the major problems that still remain to be solved concerns the area of social affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to make it clear to you how much I am committed, on behalf of the Commission as a whole, to the rapid implementation of the mechanism provided in the recommendation. This mechanism will enable us to ensure that there is follow-up action, in the form of joint action by the Member States. In saying this, I hope I have responded to the legitimate concerns that Parliament has expressed throughout the procedure, regarding truly effective follow-up action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
