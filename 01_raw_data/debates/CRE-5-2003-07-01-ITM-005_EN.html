<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Scheele (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this draft regulation seeks to guarantee a high level of protection for human life and health, animal health and welfare and the interests of the environment and consumers in connection with genetically modified food and feed. The high level of protection for human health and also environmental interests is achieved by means of a very demanding authorisation procedure. This needs to be said right at the outset, because many Members continue to confuse this with health concerns in connection with the limit value for adventitious and unavoidable contamination that we will be discussing later.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may start with authorisation, the placing on the market of genetically modified food and feed will only be permitted after an independent and stringent assessment of their possible risks to human and animal health as well as to the environment. In the future, the assessment will be carried out by the European Food Safety Authority, while the authorisation will be granted by the Commission. In its first reading, Parliament called for a greater degree of decentralisation. We have had only limited success here. One point that is important for us, and which has also been taken on board by the Council, provides that the environmental risk assessment for seed will be carried out by the Member States' authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to labelling, I am very pleased that the consumer-friendly system of labelling genetically modified food and feed has been accepted. As you will remember, at this time last year we had a very controversial and also very emotional debate in this House. I have been able – and as rapporteur this does of course make me very proud – even in the face of opposition from the largest group in this House, that of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to gain acceptance for a very consumer-friendly system.</p>
<p class="contents">At this time last year we also discussed the possibility of having a GMO-free label. I was and still am strongly opposed to this. However, the question no longer arises in the second reading, because it was already answered in the first reading. I should simply like to remind you once more that we know from numerous studies and surveys that a majority of European consumers want to know when foods contain genetically modified ingredients.</p>
<p class="contents">A further aspect of this legislation that constitutes significant progress – something that is always forgotten because of the other hotly contested points – is the labelling requirement that is imposed for the first time on genetically modified feed, particularly when you consider that a large proportion of the genetically modified organisms imported by the European Union are used as feed.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most controversial issues in this debate is the question of thresholds. Here too, I should like to correct something at the outset. I know that it will not do any good, because the Members who repeatedly make this claim have already written their speeches, but I should nonetheless like to say this once more. This 0.9% threshold does not relate to a conscious use of genetically modified organisms, where people might say, 'it is only labelled above 0.9%'. It is a necessary threshold for technically unavoidable and adventitious contamination. In its first reading, Parliament set it at 0.5%, and the Council is now proposing 0.9%.</p>
<p class="contents">At second reading, I have focused on the issue of coexistence, which clearly affects how we are going to retain different forms of agriculture in Europe in the future, but is also directly related to consumer choice. I wanted European legislation to be logical; if genetically modified organisms are authorised centrally then the rules for coexistence should also be laid down centrally. There was no majority in favour of this. The compromise on the table, with which I am very happy, and which nearly all of the groups in this House support and which has also been endorsed by the other European institutions, is very good in my view. Through this compromise we give the Member States the possibility of taking appropriate measures to guarantee coexistence and thus also freedom of choice for consumers in the future. As a Member of the European Parliament, I would obviously have liked the Member States to be placed under an obligation to do this. Unfortunately, the short time available meant that it was not possible to negotiate this.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, though, that this compromise does put the onus on the Member States not just to sit back and point the finger at Brussels where this important issue is concerned, but also to fulfil their own responsibility in this respect and to protect consumers' freedom of choice.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take a few more seconds to thank Members from the other groups for their fruitful cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Trakatellis (PPE-DE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Madam President, the two regulations we are debating today add to a series of Community legislative acts on genetically modified organisms relating not only to the restricted use, but also to the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment, new foodstuffs and new ingredients and compulsory information on soya seed and genetically modified corn labels. These regulations add a panoply of legislative arrangements, with rules on the marketing and sales of food and feed products which consist of, contain or are produced from genetically modified organisms. In addition, consumers are given the necessary information, so that they are informed when they want to buy a product. Thus, when a product consists of, contains or is produced from genetically modified organisms, the words that this product consists of, contains or is produced from GMOs must be written on the packaging.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council's common position reinforces the proposal for a regulation for which I am acting as rapporteur in connection with the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and products and the traceability of foods and feed, the European Parliament's amendment to Directive 2001/18 and the Commission proposal, particularly those provisions designed to ensure the regulation is implemented more efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus the Council attempts, mainly on the basis of traceability, to ensure that the market will function smoothly and to achieve a high level of consumer protection in cases where it is not possible to use analytical methods to distinguish between conventional products and products produced from GMOs, in the following ways: introduction of systems to recognise the identity of GMOs by assigning a unique identifier, a requirement for undertakings to transmit information on identity of the product, a requirement for undertakings to retain additional information for at least five years. Consequently, I think that the fast adoption of this regulation without proceeding to the conciliation procedure with the Council is what we are asking for.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Council and the Commission accept just certain amendments which, I would say, make traceability and labelling requirements for genetically modified organisms slightly stricter, it will be possible to introduce rules at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, as far as the question of mixed crops is concerned, I would like to emphasise that we are talking here of foods and feed, which is why we call on the European Commission to develop guidelines for the coexistence of genetically modified and conventional crops.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think the added amendment concerning the creation of a register for the publication of technical guidelines on sampling and testing for the methods is useful, because this both reinforces transparency and helps to achieve a coordinated approach and efficient implementation of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Fast approval of the regulation in question and of the regulation on genetically modified food and feed will ensure consumers are informed about foods and feed produced from genetically modified organisms, so that they can make an informed choice of products. This will result in the lifting of the <span class="italic">de facto </span>moratorium on the approval of new GMOs and prevent a trade war with the USA, Canada, Argentina, Egypt and other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I am basically of the opinion that Europe is lagging behind in these new technologies and in biotechnology, as described in the Council's conclusions and the road map and the significance of this development, with these two reports today and the vote tomorrow, will be considerable for Europe, because we are noticeably lagging behind our competitors as regards this promising technology of the twenty-first century, with adverse consequences at all levels: economic, social and even environmental. I therefore propose that we proceed to vote for these amendments, which do not change the substance of the legislative text and, consequently, that we avoid conciliation and that we have these two regulations in force as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of being unable to keep up with the speed of developments in biotechnology was what basically resulted in reservations and I think that it is time the European Union moved in a positive way towards this technology. That is the intention of these two regulations, so as to give consumers the chance to be informed and the European Union the chance to make progress at last in this technology compared with its competitors.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we should proceed to vote for a text which is as close as possible to the Council's position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The discussions have been intensive, complex and have often provoked strong emotional reactions and divided opinions. It is now important to draw the discussions to a close. Allow me to draw your attention to the three principal elements of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">First, it will ensure a high level of protection of human and animal health on the basis of a streamlined, efficient and more transparent authorisation procedure. Animal feed produced from GMOs will, in future, be subject to authorisation. The simplified procedure based on substantial equivalence will be abandoned and authorisations will be limited to a period of 10 years. The public will have the opportunity to make comments prior to decisions and to the authorisation of products.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the proposal provides consumers with what they so overwhelmingly demand – an indication of whether or not food and feed ingredients are produced from GMOs. This will provide consumers with the freedom to choose between GM and non-GM products. Similarly, feed produced from GMOs will have to be labelled to facilitate the freedom of choice for farmers and other operators dealing with animal feed.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the proposal increases the legal certainty for operators and traders, which they need to carry out their daily business.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position adopted by the Council in March is both balanced and rational. It represents a major step forward in building public confidence in the application of biotechnology to food.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that a compromise package has been tabled to facilitate the final adoption of the proposal. I would like to thank the rapporteur and also the shadow rapporteurs for their hard work towards arriving at this compromise package and for their willingness to ensure a balanced result as well as a timely resolution of the outstanding issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise package includes provisions concerning the issue of coexistence between different forms of agriculture. The Commission agrees that this is an important issue for which appropriate solutions need to be devised.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would have preferred to address coexistence separately in the context of Commissioner Fischler’s current work. However, the Commission is prepared to support the compromise package and – as outlined in the package – to develop guidelines on appropriate measures to be taken at national level. Such guidelines are on course to be adopted by the Commission later this month.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, let me state the Commission's position on the amendments as tabled. The Commission can adopt the compromise package, consisting of Amendments Nos 1, 7, 8, 9, and 44 to 48, provided all the other amendments are rejected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union has been building a system that allows us to base decisions on whether or not to authorise the use and release of GM products on the best available scientific and technical advice. Once that base is secured it is then a matter of ensuring that the consumer is correctly informed so that he or she is able to choose whether or not to buy GM products.</p>
<p class="contents">The two proposals now being considered in second reading are important parts of the overall design of our system for dealing responsibly with GM products. They have been fully debated inside all the political groups and different committees.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the proposal for which I am responsible, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, and the presidency for their efforts to finalise the proposal on labelling and traceability. I hope that Parliament and the Council will be able to agree on the amendments to be adopted later in plenary, so that we can reach agreement on both food and feed and traceability in labelling in this part-session.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal will provide an important complement to the existing regulatory framework. You will all be aware of the difficult negotiations leading up to the adoption of the common position. The gap between the different positions has narrowed, as many of the amendments adopted at first reading were introduced in the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">As was to be expected, the issue of coexistence has surfaced as the key issue at second reading of both proposals. The new Article to be introduced into the directive under the political agreement for the proposal on food and feed will provide for a legal base under which to work. This, linked with the forthcoming initiative from the Commission on guidelines for coexistence will provide Member States with the possibility of implementing appropriate measures to deal with coexistence.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the key issues, the Commission can support the amendments that provide clarification of the common position. These include Amendment Nos 1, 3, 4, 18, 24, 26 and 27, as well as the second part of Amendment No 17, and the first parts of Amendment Nos 8 and 13.</p>
<p class="contents">Conversely, Amendment Nos 22, 23, 25, and 28 seek to introduce texts on coexistence that are identical to that which would be laid down in Directive 2001/18/EC and the regulation on GM food and feed. The Commission considers this to be duplication but we could accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">The remaining amendments, the majority of which are retabled from first reading, cannot be supported. Amendment Nos 2, 9, 10, 14 and 15 refer to exemptions via thresholds. Acceptance of these amendments would undermine the political agreement reached on the proposal on GM food and feed. As I have previously said, consistency and coherence between the two proposals must be ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the first part of Amendment No 15 seeks to reinstate national provisions for traceability under Directive 2001/18/EC. To accept this would only create legal uncertainty, given that the proposal on the table will provide Community rules for traceability as well as labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 7 refers to the 'may contain' clause for food and feed products in the original Commission proposal. This was also the subject of a very difficult debate and to reopen it now would have serious consequences for the operability of our system and the forthcoming WTO Panel.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 6, which refers to the definition of the placing on the market, was also subject to considerable debate in the Council, following adoption of the same amendment at first reading. The wording of this amendment was included in the common position via reference to the full definition of placing on the market from Directive 2001/18/EC. The Commission cannot support further amendment of this definition particularly as the tabled amendment would contradict definitions already laid down in Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment Nos 5 and 29 refer to the precautionary principle. I would point out that the Council addressed this amendment in the common position as supported by the Commission. The precautionary principle relates to risk assessment which is why it appears in Directive 2001/18/EC and the proposal on GM food and feed. Traceability is a facilitating measure, but it is not based on risk assessment. To go further than the current wording of the recital is not appropriate and the Commission cannot support these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment Nos 11 and 12 refer to traceability and labelling requirements for processed products and acceptance would again impinge on the agreement reached under the proposal on GM food and feed which covers such products.</p>
<p class="contents">The second parts of Amendment Nos 8 and 13 seek to extend the time-period for the holding of traceability information from five years to ten years. Even if traceability were still possible after ten years this information would be of no practical value.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 20 addresses the reporting obligations of the Commission, which are duplicated in Amendment No 3. Reporting obligations are already reflected in Article 12 of the common position and further requirements are not necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of coexistence, Amendment No 16 in a similar manner to an amendment on the proposal GM food and feed, seeks to introduce text to address this issue into a new Article 26a of Directive 2001/18/EC. However, the text of Amendment No 16 is not in line with that proposed for this new Article under the political agreement for the proposal on GM food and feed and therefore we cannot accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendment No 21 refers to the date of application of the regulation. It should be noted that the applicability of the regulation was referred to in the Council and Commission statement, accompanying the common position. In this regard the Commission points out that Member States have already endorsed a Community format for attribution of unique codes to GMOs based on the OECD format. Of course the Commission will make sure that this system is accounted for in terms of new authorisations as required under Directive 2001/18/EC.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, it has been a very intensive debate on the whole issue of how the European Union should handle GMOs. With some difficulty we have put together a system which will offer security and choice to our citizens. I hope that the vote tomorrow will give us a workable compromise and I thank you all for the discussions we have had and for finding a good solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sommer (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the swift entry into force of these proposals for a regulation is a precondition for the final lifting of the <span class="italic">de facto</span> moratorium on green genetic engineering, which has been in place for several years. It is the current ban on growing and importing GMOs that for years has cut off Europe's scientific community, its consumers and farmers from the positive developments in the field of green genetic engineering. Moreover we are facing complaints before the WTO from countries that wish to export genetically modified products to the EU, but may not do so because of the moratorium. The USA has already filed a complaint.</p>
<p class="contents">What escapes all of those who want – often for purely ideological reasons – to prevent GMOs from being used here is the fact that genetically modified food and feed have been a reality throughout the world for some considerable time already. And particularly where protein feed is concerned we are dependent on imports from third countries, where the growing of genetically modified plants is the order of the day. In 2001 the EU imported over 16 million tonnes of soya from the USA and South America: in the USA the proportion of the total soya crop that is GM is 68%; in Argentina it is 100%.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reality that is facing uncertain consumers and farmers in Europe, as well as a research sector that is unable to plan ahead. Consumers and farmers treat green genetic engineering here with suspicion because they do not know what the issues are. This is due to a policy of insufficient information, which – at least in my home country of Germany – is entirely intentional.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not making policy to order here. Through these draft regulations we need to secure freedom of choice for consumers, and my group as much as any other, Mrs Scheele, is in favour of protecting human health and therefore also in favour of robust consumer protection. But with this legislation we also need to cater for agriculture, the environment, small and medium-sized seed producers, industry, the retail food trade and many other branches of industry. And we need a labelling requirement so as to be able at long last to assess imports from third countries properly. To do so we need to employ reasonable, realistic thresholds, admittedly political thresholds, which are based on what is technically feasible and workable. It is a great success, particularly for our group, that all of the other groups are now supporting the Council's common position on the limit values: 0.9% for authorised GMOs and 0.5% for GMOs that are ready for authorisation and in a backlog because of the moratorium.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the decision that this regulation should not include provisions on seed. Seed needs its own rules and we cannot have the coexistence issue, that is, the coexistence of genetically modified and conventional plants on agricultural land, being used as a vehicle to place a general blockade on green genetic engineering. It was only on this condition that my group agreed to the compromise. The Commission is now under an obligation to ensure that the <span class="italic">de facto</span> moratorium is not artificially prolonged by some Member States.</p>

It has, I know, in large part been an uphill struggle, with a Council and a large number of Members of this Parliament not having been interested in what might be regarded as the ideal legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still three problems with the outcome, which lead me to think that it cannot be characterised as ideal. Firstly, I think that the limit value for labelling in the case of adventitious pollution by GMOs is still too high and, secondly, we are coming, over a period, also to accept adventitious pollution by non-authorised and unlabelled GMOs. The third point to which I would draw attention and which I still think is a defect is that we have not obtained the best rules concerning the co-existence of GMOs and other crops. There will now most certainly be many instances of GMO pollution, with lengthy compensation cases in their wake. If we are not very careful, we are in danger of actually destroying the basis of ecological production and of general agricultural production throughout Europe. In spite of these defects, we are in the position of not having any choice, and I too shall therefore support the outcome with which we have been presented, including Mrs Scheele’s report. The alternative would be far more frightening, namely that of not obtaining any rules at all.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we are obtaining some sensible rules on traceability. In that connection, I hope that Parliament will decide that data concerning transactions involving these products must be kept for ten years, and I also think it important that the results of inspections and controls carried out by the Member States should be kept in a central register so that the best possible data is always available. Only time and the first cases of matters going wrong can reveal whether the rules on traceability have been secure enough.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite crucial for me that the <span class="italic">de facto</span> moratorium should only be lifted when the system for developing and assigning unambiguous identifications of GMOs has been fully implemented, that is to say when the rules are in place and there is full traceability from day one. In that connection, I should like to thank Mrs Wallström for the assurances she gave in her speech.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that European consumers who are as critical and aware as the majority of them appear to be will demand the necessary rules on co-existence from their governments, leading to action being taken nationally and the correct rules on co-existence put in place. I also hope, moreover, that this large group of critical consumers will exert a natural restraint upon the demand for these artificially modified foods which consumers have not of course asked for but which chemicals groups and certain European governments definitely want us also to consume.</p>

I confess to having no such absolute certainties. I am a sceptic rather than an opponent of genetically modified crops. I acknowledge that they may bring about benefits in terms of the reduced use of pesticides and herbicides, that there are no proven health risks – or none yet established – and that GM crops could, across the world, be grown in circumstances which would not permit the growth of conventional crops.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I see no certain gains from growing GM products in Europe. I believe changes in European and American trade policies are likely to prove of greater benefit to developing nations, and I have fears that we could be making mistakes that will have unforeseen consequences for our environment.</p>
<p class="contents">A common framework of policies is needed if we are to avoid the risk of a trade war with the United States, with appeals to the WTO, and to curb the risk of divisions amongst ourselves across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I await with interest the result of the field trials currently being carried out in my own country, to see whether they provide any evidence on the effects of biodiversity. I am pleased to hear that the Commission's proposals for guidelines on the subject of coexistence are on schedule. It is vital that these ensure that conventional and organic growers should not lose out as a result of this technology. They must be protected from the risk of financial loss, and the proposals here should allow individual Member States to take significant steps to prevent cross-contamination – at least that is the hope.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a strong sense that we are all being driven too fast by narrow commercial interests, mainly concentrated in the United States. As a result, I have no doubt that this is an imperfect package and we will have to return to this subject. In the meantime consumers must be given the information to make their own choices and, if this ultimately slows the development of this technology while more research is undertaken, then that may be no bad thing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also all know that the majority of consumers do not want genetically modified food or the large-scale cultivation of genetically modified crops. Nor is there any getting away from the fact that there is a link between the <span class="italic">de facto</span> moratorium and these proposals concerning labelling and traceability. We think there are good reasons for scepticism. The cultivation of genetically modified crops presents well documented risks to biodiversity. There are possible health risks if sufficiently careful tests are not carried out. There are quite clear power relations between large and multinational businesses in these industries and the farmers in various countries affected by this technology. It is no coincidence that most GM crops cultivated around the world are resistant to a specific pesticide. We therefore see them as having few advantages; we see cause for great caution; and we support the <span class="italic">de facto</span> moratorium.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, it is, however, a question of labelling and traceability. We therefore choose to support making the rules as strict and as tough as possible. It is also on this basis that we shall vote. In that way, we can give consumers the best opportunity of choosing what they want to purchase and of opting out of what they do not want to purchase.</p>
<p class="contents">What is quite clear is that the European Parliament’s proposals will improve these legislative proposals. In particular, I think that the compromise reached on Mrs Scheele’s report is a clear step forward. I should also like to thank the rapporteur for the open way in which she has worked on these issues and which has given other groups the opportunity to exert some influence. What are important in the compromise are, in particular, the wording on co-existence and the possible measures proposed to enable the Member States to avoid contamination by GMOs. Our group would like, however, to go still further. We are therefore going to vote in favour of the amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, designed to prune the threshold values for authorised GMOs back to 0.5%. We also find it unacceptable that, during a transitional period, genetically modified organisms otherwise not in actual fact permitted in the EU should be permitted.</p>
<p class="contents">It might be wondered whether these new rules are sufficient to justify lifting the moratorium. Our answer is an emphatic no, for a lot more is required if consideration is to be given to doing so. The rules need to be implemented in the Member States. Clear rules on co-existence are required, and rules are also required concerning environmental liability in relation to genetically modified crops. Only then do we think that a start can be made on the debate. In that context, the relationship with the United States is also used as an argument, but we can never satisfy the United States in this area. That is an illusion. Our task is to embrace a more responsible position, both globally and in the European Union. It is not, then, acceptable to begin by yielding ground. Instead, we must assert our right to put consumers and the environment first and to set rules as strict as we like. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At long last, consumers will no longer be able to be sold genetically manipulated food under false pretences. When, as was the case in Germany, 90% of all genetically manipulated soya products were not labelled, this was tantamount to saying that consumers were incapable of making their own decisions. Now, at long last, they are getting freedom of choice. Foods such as oil and sugar, up to 100% of which consisted of genetically modified raw materials, finally have to be labelled. The products of gene technology must be transparent from the field to the fork. The threshold is admittedly too high for our liking, but it counts as a huge success that we are enabling the Member States to take measures to ensure that GM, traditional and organic farming are able to coexist. We have also very clearly enshrined the ‘polluter pays’ principle here; otherwise in the long term freedom of choice would not be guaranteed at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we in the European Parliament have no influence on the lifting of the moratorium on genetic engineering. If the Commission lifts the moratorium under pressure from the USA, labelling will enable consumers to respond with a moratorium on purchases. We will move from a political moratorium to a practical moratorium on purchases imposed by consumers. The litmus test for the genetic engineering industry is not authorisation but sales. Genetically manipulated products will have to maintain their hold on the market. I am sure that at the moment no manufacturer will dare to bank on genetic engineering. Manufacturers are as afraid of labelling as the devil is of holy water. They also know that more than 90% of consumers reject genetically manipulated food.</p>
<p class="contents">We regret the fact that products of animals that have been fed genetically modified feed will not be subject to the labelling requirements, but we are relying on the labelling requirement for animal feed and on the fact that farmers know what consumers want.</p>
<p class="contents">Where seed is concerned too I expect the Commission – and I would ask them to comment on this – not to play any tricks; we really need EU seed legislation with a zero detection limit value. Anything else would amount to deceiving the consumer. Otherwise, these two regulations would quickly become wastepaper. Our expectations here are quite clear: that the Commission should implement this zero detection limit value for seed, because we know that it is possible to have seed with a zero limit value as it is already on the market in Austria and other countries. This is not about unavoidable technical uncertainty. I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to give your views on this once more.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that we all know that Bush's claim that the EU is responsible for hunger in Africa was cynical. The problem there is not one of technology, but of distribution. We also know that these countries are certainly in no position to buy expensive seed from the US genetic engineering industry. I therefore hope that tomorrow will indeed mark a milestone for consumers and that consumers will indeed respond to the lifting of the moratorium with a moratorium on purchases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I have to mention the fact that today’s consensus is the result of a compromise which is not really particularly satisfactory, adopted purely because of the unyielding reluctance of the Commission and, in particular, the Council, to build a better basis. Indeed, the resulting framework certainly cannot be said to be complete. That is not so much because the issue continues to be addressed by 35 different reports without even the slightest attempt being made to link them, nor because, for the present phase, it has been decided to split the matter into three different regulations – one of which is not to be debated in this part-session, moreover – as because the framework which emerges is in itself highly dysfunctional, a fact which has been purposefully disregarded in the name of the urgent need to regulate the matter. I could cite many examples, such as, for instance, the fact that authorisations are to be valid for ten years and the obligation to keep correspondence and the results of tests carried out for only 15 years. In addition, it will be a long time before we have identification codes and the sampling techniques are random, with no standardised procedures, while, what is more, there is the recommendation to monitor the life of GMOs and products produced from GMOs closely, without, however, it being possible to require additional risk assessments. There is one example, in particular, which I feel is absurd: so-called co-existence. I know there is no point in going back over the arguments raised in the debate on this matter, but the fact is that the path chosen – the decision to require the Member States to produce rules governing the area before the Commission has had time to give its opinion – is surely highly unusual.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope I am wrong when I say that it will not be the benchmarking techniques which stop pollution, in addition to which there is no mention of the ‘polluter pays’ principle, while, moreover, the acceptability criteria of 0.5 – 0.9, which caused so much debate, are completely invalidated.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we certainly needed to move on from the current derogations, but that could have been achieved with more meaningful and, above all, more coherent provisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, in the two texts in our debate today, there is no indication of any progress having been made. The most critical point is still the thresholds for the presence of GMOs permitted when such a presence is technically unavoidable. The Council is proposing 0.9%. This is too much! We should go back to the position adopted by Parliament at first reading, which envisaged a maximum of 0.5%. As for unauthorised GMOs, how can the Council make them legal in the food chain by proposing a threshold of 0.5% when these are GMOs that are prohibited in the EU?</p>
<p class="contents">A response is also required to the issue of crop contamination. The Commission has shifted responsibility onto the Member States, while reserving for itself the right to draw up, at a later date, guidelines on the coexistence of conventional and genetically modified crops. In the immediate future, Member States must be able to take sovereign measures as a matter of urgency, for example by suspending authorisations when there is a risk to public health or a risk of contaminating the environment. It is also necessary, in my opinion, to exclude seeds from the regulation, by making a distinction between living GMOs that should fall within the scope of Directive 2001/18/CE, thereby making their traceability compulsory, and genetically modified foods.</p>
<p class="contents">It will also be necessary to define a real system of liability for the introduction of GMOs into agriculture and the environment. In my opinion, the ‘polluter pays’ principle should apply here, so that a farmer who uses GMOs will have to pay compensation for any damage caused to conventional farming.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am fully in support of maintaining the European moratorium despite the complaint that the United States has submitted to the WTO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, the GMO issue raises a major sovereignty problem: the sovereignty of the public over the commercial exploitation of scientific discoveries, the sovereignty of farmers over what they sow, the sovereignty of consumers over what they eat, and the sovereignty of States over what they control.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, GMOs pose two major risks. The first of these concerns human health: there is a risk that the transgene introduced into the plant may code for the synthesis of a toxic protein. The mad cow disease prion has demonstrated that certain undesirable proteins may have very long-term toxic effects. The second risk concerns the environment: this is the risk that undesirable genes will be spread to the wild flora and to the rhizosphere. On this point, one can only deplore the extremely unwise conduct of the Americans, who have spread GMOs over millions of hectares without having taken the precaution of accurately evaluating this risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must ask ourselves who actually benefits from GMOs. For the consumer, the benefit is non-existent at the present time, as it is for the environment, because we are still waiting for the reduction in the consumption of pesticides that GMOs were supposed to make possible. For farmers, the benefits are slight: a few savings in relation to seed preparation, treatments and weed control, but at the cost of increased dependence on seed companies and the manufacturers of crop protection products. For developing countries the benefits are only theoretical, because the companies in question have been working only for markets that are solvent, which means that we cannot accept the American criticism of European countries on this point. It is therefore the seed companies who are the ones receiving the real benefits, and that means the American multinationals, who are most advanced in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">What should we do? Certainly we should continue with the research. We should explore both the potential and the risks of transgenesis, even though this technology is extremely costly and appears better suited to crops grown on a very large scale with very little diversity, which are not a feature of European farming, or at least of European farming before the Fischler plan.</p>
<p class="contents">We should continue the research in a way that protects our complete freedom, and without allowing anything to be imposed upon us; we should act with extreme caution, not giving way to pressure, and should take a more rigorous approach to consumer information. These, Madam President, seem to me to be the broad lines that we should be following on this essential issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We should show that we are rational, consistent and coordinated on what represents, in spite of everything, considerable progress. However, our debates here today show that opinion remains very divided. While ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market, we should assist our farmers in making their choices and, above all, we should ensure a high level of protection for the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more importantly, we must convince the consumer that our decisions are well-founded. This means that we shall have to adopt strict rules governing authorisation and control procedures – which means that the scientific criteria for authorisation must be harmonised at European level – and there must be total traceability of products in order to guarantee the safety of animal feeds and foods for human consumption. It also means communication without ideology. Consumers are often worried because they do not have accurate information. The need for credible information for the public at large is consequently even more important. Labelling must be clear and legible, so as to allow consumers to be free to make the right choices. Consumers must be able to be certain that all the GMOs that are present in the products that they buy will have been strictly evaluated from the point of view of safety. They will then be able to choose to buy the products that they want.</p>
<p class="contents">These texts propose lifting the moratorium. As soon as all the safety and traceability guarantees exist, the lifting of the moratorium must follow. If we do not lift it, we run the risk of holding back research in Europe yet again, and of causing our best research scientists to leave and go to the United States or Asia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the 1980s, plant-transgenesis technology has been making progress everywhere except in Europe. Last year, about 60 million hectares outside Europe were growing genetically improved crops. The European Union is having difficulty in protecting about 10 000 hectares for the experimental cultivation of certain transgenic plants.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to quote the French <span class="italic">Académie des Sciences</span>, which says, ‘Transgenic varieties have been rejected in Europe, although there has never been a health problem regarding consumers or damage to the environment’. The <span class="italic">Académie </span>goes on to explain that almost all the plants cultivated today are the result of thousands of years of genetic selection from wild plants. Gene exchanges between varieties or species have very often led to profound changes in the morphology of the original wild plant. Many species have been domesticated by man by the addition of different genomes; examples of this include tobacco, wheat and rape.</p>
<p class="contents">Ever since human beings have tilled the soil, they have been practising genetic engineering without knowing it. While cross-breeding and selective breeding carried out on a hit-and-miss basis by human hands have been accepted, more precisely targeted interventions involving the production of genes are regarded as the work of the devil. As far as the <span class="italic">Académie des Sciences</span> is concerned, transgenic foods are not intrinsically any more dangerous than other foods, and this has been recognised by the Codex Alimentarius. Why, then, is there all this fuss, all these vague fears about GMOs? The dogma of the precautionary principle is leading to precautions without any scientific principles at all.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall be voting in favour of the compromise negotiated with the Council, even though the compromise is too timid. I urge the Commission to do away with the illegal moratorium on GMOs and to ensure that Europe does not miss out in the biotechnology revolution. Is it necessary, Madam President, to remind the House that, at the present time, 95% of people with a doctorate in biology are working on the American continent? That is a disgrace for Europe! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why we should welcome the imminent entry into force of these European rules concerning the labelling and traceability of GMOs. The exacting provisions contained in the reports by Mr Trakatellis and Mrs Scheele will enable us to ascertain the composition of foods, to follow their distribution route and to know whether or not animals have eaten GMO-based feeds. Subject to these strict conditions, the lifting of the moratorium is a welcome development.</p>
<p class="contents">For all that, though, will consumers be reassured? The truth will only become apparent at a later date, but it can be summed up in just a few words, namely free choice for consumers as to what they put on their plates. This has already been pointed out at great length by the two rapporteurs and by the Commissioner. Yet in order to convince people, and to reassure them, we will have to get it right. Labelling errors for products that are certified as being GMO-free will not be permitted, just as there is no question of making traditional and organic farmers pick up the tab for the crop contamination that is an inevitable risk.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, therefore, let me say that we should continue with research, remain rational, and convince, communicate with and inform the public even more, explaining to them that transgenic crops involve not just soya, maize or rape, but also gene therapy, the kind of treatment which, for example, has enabled children with primary immunodeficiency to live a normal life outside their ‘bubble’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our fears are not unfounded, if account is taken of the increasingly suffocating pressure from the USA to import genetically modified products.</p>
<p class="contents">The arrangement setting upper permissible contamination limits creates a <span class="italic">de facto</span> situation with which we radically disagree, first because it shifts the responsibility to the consumer, who is not, however, in a position to evaluate the risks inherent in food produced from or containing GMOs and, secondly, because it paves the way for the suffocating dependence of farmers on the mainly American multinational biotechnology companies, which have sole rights to produce and sell genetically modified seed and the agrochemicals that accompany them.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from anything else, the use of GMOs will result in the genetic erosion of non-genetically modified varieties, with unforeseeable consequences for biodiversity. We must fight to ban imports of products made either from genetically modified raw materials or containing GMOs, not for limits on how these products are moved and traced.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we disapprove overall of the use of GMOs and the 'could be worse' philosophy.

<p class="contents">The labelling of all genetically modified food and animal feed will give consumers in Europe what 93% of them are asking for: the choice of whether or not to buy GM products. Meat producers, for example, will be able to avoid using GM feed for the first time through labelling. It is not complete choice, because of the threshold levels for authorised – and temporarily for unauthorised – GMOs if their presence is adventitious or technically unavoidable. These levels are too high, but they can be reviewed in the light of developments in technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the new regulations GM food and animal feed will have to go through a strict authorisation procedure – not just a notification process – and once on the market they can be monitored for effects on the environment. However, as other colleagues have mentioned, of central importance are the measures which can now be taken by Member States to avoid the contamination of other products by GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">Coexistence has become a major issue since we started discussions on these reports, and conventional and organic farmers, and food producers, as well as consumers, will welcome the proposals before us today. I represent Wales, a country where the National Assembly tried to implement separation distances between GM and non-GM crops, only to be informed by the Commission that this action was not legally sustainable. About a quarter of agricultural land in Wales is under agri-environmental schemes, or registered as organic, so this is of crucial importance to the economy as well as to the environment. I am sure that my constituents will be very pleased that action can now be taken on coexistence. I particularly welcome the fact that it is clear here that producers and users of GMOs must take all necessary measures to prevent contamination of other products so the burden is not on the conventional farmer.</p>
<p class="contents">These new regulations will defend the fundamental principle of consumer choice and we will see people exercising that choice by not growing GM crops and by not buying GM food.</p>

Now, there is a further argument for promoting organic farming. It is a clear signal to consumers that the only way in which they can be certain of steering clear of GMOs is by buying organic products, especially when you think of all the animal products whose labels will not state whether GMOs were used in the animals’ feed. The political system has abandoned all responsibility. From now on, it is crucial for the GMO-free areas of Europe to be extended through organic farming and for other farmers voluntarily to refrain from using GMOs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are talking, in effect, about traceability, labelling, zero tolerance, maximum thresholds, freedom of choice for the consumer, health, the environment and precautions.</p>
<p class="contents">While all this is going on, who is looking at GMOs in Washington? The answer is, President Bush himself, who is urging the European Union to put an end to its moratorium and has even brought the matter before a panel of the World Trade Organization. Likewise, who, in President Bush’s entourage, is looking at GMOs? I can give you a list. There is John Ashcroft, the US Attorney General. His senatorial election campaign in Missouri was partly funded by Monsanto, a GMO multinational. Then there is Donald Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defence, the President of a laboratory that Monsanto bought in 1985. There is Ann Vaneman, US Secretary of Agriculture, a member of the Board of Directors of Calgene, the multinational which created Flower, the first transgenic tomato. There is also Linda Fisher, Deputy Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, formerly responsible for the Monsanto lobbying bureau in Washington, and finally there is Clarence Thomas, a judge of the US Supreme Court, who was nominated to his position by Bush Senior and who used to be a lawyer at Monsanto. I could go on; the list is a long one.</p>
<p class="contents">What does this mean? It means that the Bush administration is treating the GMO issue as a matter of sovereignty, in economic, industrial, scientific and agrifood terms. Just as it did in the case of bananas, hormones in meat, oilseeds, cereals and chickens, the United States is turning GMOs into yet another battle in the transatlantic agriculture wars. Meanwhile, what are we doing? Our legalism is up against their imperialism.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the real question, Madam President, is not a scientific one concerning health or the environment. It is the same question as it has been for forty years. Does Europe, with its 450 million inhabitants, want to be independent? In the Persian Gulf, it said ‘no’ while, at the same time, accepting the American war. In the Gulf of Mexico, at Cancun, on 14 September, if it says no it will be an agricultural and tropical Munich, but then Europe is female and loves to be dominated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I, along with the majority of the British Conservative MEPs and the majority of members of my group, see genetic modification as an interesting and potentially very useful development for mankind and for our environment. Genetic modification of plants and seeds holds out the possibility of better food production in harsh climates and of assuring future food supplies to a fast-growing world population. It also holds out the possibility of reducing artificial agricultural inputs, notably pesticides and herbicides, whose use can cause collateral environmental damage.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has heard no convincing evidence that GM foods are a threat to human health or to biological diversity. If we had, we would have been very reluctant to see these proposals adopted at all. As it is, this debate has been remarkable for the chorus of Greens, Liberal Democrats and Socialists hymning the prospects of GM foods subject to safeguards.</p>
<p class="contents">Some MEPs may still want to differ from the Council over the question of the thresholds but we should remember here that we are talking about very tiny amounts. The text we adopt will specify that GM presence of more than 0.9% of any ingredient will trigger the labelling requirement. That is a tiny amount. Let us be honest. The 0.9% tolerance level is, in itself, on the very margin of detectibility. There is something bizarre about Europeans putting in place such requirements when consumers in other parts of the world do not insist on them, when there is no health evidence that supports them, and when we are probably legislating for the technically impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one question for the Commission. If this legislation is adopted, and if some countries are reluctant to lift their moratorium on genetically modified foods, what action will it take? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Neither are we discussing whether it is right for there to be genetically modified food in the USA, Mexico, Canada or Europe. There already is. Had we not wanted this, we would have had to take action around twenty years ago and conclude a worldwide agreement. We did not do so. This means that we now have to ensure that we put a legal framework in place.</p>
<p class="contents">What should the legal framework contain? It needs to state that there is research and that a product shall be completely safe and harmless according to current scientific knowledge. What we expect of any food colouring and any emulsifier in yoghurt is also what we expect of genetically modified food and seed, no more and no less. We have repeatedly said that it will take a package of measures to assemble a reasonable body of legislation in the European Union. The first part was Mr Bowe's report on the release directive several years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">It was always, however, clear to us that this was not enough, that something more was needed in addition to the release of food, seed or plants. What is actually needed is for the processed plants to be labelled so that the people of the European Union have freedom of choice, which incidentally they also have in respect of any other foodstuff, for example with the fat content of milk or with other foods. They should be able to exercise their right to choose.</p>
<p class="contents">No one has countered what has been said here by saying that genetically modified food is the work of the devil and no one is scaremongering. We simply say always that products have to be safe according to current scientific knowledge. We are trying to ensure that this is the case. And we are trying to ensure that food is comprehensively labelled. We have heard that a threshold is arbitrary and we know that this is the case. Whether it is 0.5% or 0.9% I really do not care. I would like us to have comprehensive legislation as quickly as possible and the reports by Mrs Scheele and Mr Trakatellis are valuable and necessary contributions to achieving this. Then we will also have the security in the European Union of being able to say to the Americans and all of the others: yes, you can produce and export to the European Union, but on our conditions and in accordance with our legislation! We owe this to the people of the European Union; that is our job as their elected representatives.</p>

Whether or not these consumers are right in having doubts about GMOs, the customer is ultimately always right.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislation on labelling, however, to my mind, misses the mark on at least two fundamental counts. First of all, the consumer does not get what he wants. A consumer who wants GMO-free products does not want less than 0.9% or 0.5% GMOs in them. No, he does not want any GMOs at all. A non-GMO label would therefore have been much better. It is unfortunate that this can no longer be on the agenda, as we rejected it at first reading. Moreover, a label of that kind would have made superfluous the whole debate we are now having about co-existence.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem is that this is about political labelling which goes much further than information of potential relevance to public health. As far as I am concerned, paper traceability instead of factual traceability is a mistake. It is asking for fraud, and so the next food scandal is already in the making.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is to be hoped that this proposal will lead to a lifting of the GMO moratorium. This is what matters most; it means that Europe’s lack of knowledge compared to the United States is only growing. I should therefore like to ask the same question which Mrs Jackson raised a moment ago, namely whether this proposal will lead to the moratorium actually being lifted, because this is still shrouded in uncertainty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we have in this background is the feverish desire of the Commission and the Member States, especially since the complaint lodged by the United States in the WTO on this matter, to lift the 1999 moratorium on GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">The most positive aspect of this compromise is that it allows Member States to adopt any measures they wish in order to prevent the contamination of traditional and organic crops by GMOs. These States would simply need to demonstrate the necessary political will to achieve this. Even if these directives, which are to be voted on tomorrow, provide a barrage of arguments against ‘any GMOs’, the problem of genetic contamination, of seeds in particular, still remains to be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Tolerance of the adventitious presence of GMOs varies from 0.3 to 0.5 % depending on the species, whereas the same threshold of 0.1% should apply to all species. Such a threshold is crucial in order to guarantee the purity of the variety and the traceability and labelling of all seeds throughout the production chain; and to keep some sectors truly GMO-free. The liability of those who introduce GMOs into the environment, and I am thinking in particular here of the seed industry, including European companies, must be clearly established in accordance with the ‘polluter pays’ principle. In other words, the cost of remedying the damage must be borne by GMO farming.</p>
<p class="contents">Since it is impossible to determine the precise contamination range of pollen produced by a genetically modified plant, it will be in the interest of the producers of these plants to have good insurance, unless they are able to train bees to gather pollen very selectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, today’s legislation means that the moratorium will be lifted. Member States can therefore no longer prescribe their own requirements and ban products off their own bat if GMOs have been tested and approved at European level and meet all safety standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that the Commission will be tabling a proposal shortly in which it will indicate how GMO farming, organic farming and traditional farming can continue to exist side by side. I wonder what the proposal will be like, but I assume that sufficient guarantees will be given for traditional and organic farming.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Consumers have the right to know what they eat and to be certain that their food is safe. Consumers must be able to choose, and labelling is crucial to this. I am not at all happy with the rules that have been laid down, not only in the Environment Council and in the Agriculture Council, but also in our own group. After all, traceability has not been factored in as the guiding principle: as modified DNA can be present unintentionally, a margin is provided for. We will therefore never be able to say again that something is completely free of modified DNA, which, to my mind, turns freedom of choice into a farce.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you two examples: foodstuffs made <span class="italic">of </span>GMOs, such as sugar, starch and vegetable oils, fall within the scope of the labelling obligation, while sugar, oil and starch do not contain any protein or DNA. Other foodstuffs, however, that have been prepared <span class="italic">with </span>a GMO do not fall within the scope of the labelling obligation; these are cheese, wine, beer, soft drinks and last but not least, our daily bread, while bread improvers used to prepare bread contain yeasts or fungi with a GMO. These <span class="italic">do</span> contain residues of modified DNA in a verifiable manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The distinction drawn is therefore hypocritical and I can understand very easily that industry has difficulty with it. I regret it and I hope that in two years’ time, thanks to the amendment clause, something better will turn up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There was, therefore, a need to provide European consumers with a response, by adopting legislation on labelling, which should enable everyone to choose what they eat.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, however, have several reservations. The first concerns the 0.9% threshold. Why, when a lower presence is technically detectable – with a threshold of 0.5% being accepted for non-authorised GMOs – are we refusing to be less demanding? The situation would be different if a 0.9% presence becomes a reality before the moratorium is even lifted.</p>
<p class="contents">My second reservation concerns consumer choice. Will this choice be guaranteed in future, when we do not envisage any binding legislation on the subject of coexistence and instead leave it to Member States to adopt appropriate measures? Perhaps we already know that coexistence is impossible, that we can regulate neither the flight of the bumblebees nor the direction or strength of the wind and that planting GMOs is irreversible? If this is the case, we are taking a considerable risk for Europeans, because we cannot make the issue of GMOs solely one of consumer choice, turning a blind eye to public health and environmental problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, no one has to date been able to produce powerful, irrefutable and convincing arguments that prove the benefit and the harmless nature of GMOs. GMO crops and biotechnologies are too frequently lumped together, but GMOs are only one of biotechnology’s many applications. Refusing to extend the use of GMOs in Europe does not mean that we are against progress, or against gene therapies; it simply means that we are choosing the precautionary principle over the trial and error of the sorcerer’s apprentice.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone is well aware that what still counts the most in this field is economic and financial interests and that the EU’s agricultural and environmental future will be shaped by pressure from the United States and from WTO negotiations. This is most regrettable, because it should not be forgotten that the United States has still not ratified the Cartagena protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the feeling that all of these debates and our votes tomorrow are preparing us for agreeing to raise the moratorium without too much argument. Our vote will, therefore, be much more political than it appears to be and we would be failing the citizens if we did not demand, before any decision is taken, to be better informed about the real risks that GMO crops will entail for the environment and for people’s health.</p>

We must make it clear that European consumers are entitled to decide for themselves whether they want to buy GMOs or not.

Demand for GM food is not driven by consumers. On the contrary, it is driven by – and is only for the benefit of – multinational GM companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States' concern for the starving populations of the world is as genuine as George Bush's concern for the Iraqi people's rights. By the way, Iraq currently has a GM ban. The United States should not be allowed to force this to be changed. If the United States and GM multinationals are so concerned about world hunger why do they not put the resources spent on research and PR for GM into helping them fend for themselves, not into forcing them to become even more reliant on multinational companies to grow their own food? They should also stop exploiting them.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the coexistence issue, this is a myth. Unless crops are grown, harvested, processed, eaten, and even the waste disposed of in laboratories, it is inevitable that there will be contamination. What are we going to do in Europe? Are we going to start introducing Schengen agreements for bees, birds and the wind and also ensure that we do not have any kind of cross-pollination? It is absolutely impossible!</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about the polluter-pays principle, the multinationals must be held accountable for the fact that conventional farmers, and in particular organic farmers, are not going to be allowed to do what they have done in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all about profit and greed. The consumers do not want GM food, so why are we being forced into it just for the benefit of multinational companies? What we have agreed in Parliament, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, does not go far enough. The threshold is far too high, since a lower one could be achieved.

This will give all participants in the market – including consumers – a guarantee of legal certainty; it may have come very late in the day, but I hope it is not too late. In terms of the practical implementation of this technology, we Europeans are over ten years behind developments in other countries, while our researchers are without doubt equal to the best in the world. To put it another way, what this amounts to is that research findings have been left unused for ten years, and research in Europe has been scrapped, especially into green genetic engineering, even though the usefulness of this is not a matter of dispute. As Mr Davies has given a number of examples of this, I do not need to do likewise.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent years, however, public discussion has not been about the pros and cons of genetic engineering, but has instead been a campaign mounted along ideological lines, aimed at obstructing a modern and forward-looking technology, so it is not to be wondered at that the results of surveys show the majority regarding genetic engineering as the work of the devil and abominating it. A number of interventions in this House today gave me the feeling that the plague was on its way back to Europe. We have to be very careful here. This situation means that it is perfectly reasonable that the regulations should contain very stringent rules on authorisation, labelling, and traceability, even though these threaten to break the bounds of practical feasibility. The reason why I say this is that I think that we, simply by applying very stringent measures, are guaranteeing the absolute maximum of safety that is practically feasible – and this is something that we also need to tell the public over and over again in the information campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the information requirements provided for in the regulations are certainly an important means towards this end, I would like to appeal also to the Commission and say that I too regard Europe-wide information campaigns as necessary, as Mrs Breyer has announced a campaign for a moratorium on buying GM products. If the labelling of these products results only in their being rejected, we will certainly not be able to catch up on the rest of the world. Whilst this compromise motion is certainly an intelligent solution, I do have my doubts – and a number of interventions seem to justify them – as to whether it will succeed. When it comes to drawing up guidelines – and I can tell the Commission that I am agog to see what will happen when they do – there will be a lot of hard work to be done; it will not be easy, and I hope it does not turn out to be a bureaucratic monster.</p>

We have seen already other pieces of legislation come before this House, for one of which I was the rapporteur, which were part of the jigsaw creating the total picture of control over genetically modified organisms.</p>
<p class="contents">With this particular piece of legislation we have to recognise a number of things. The main objective of this legislation and the agreements around it is to give people the right to make a genuine choice about GM products. We have listened to the concerns of people across Europe calling for the right to make an informed choice about GM food. We are trying to put in place a labelling and information scheme that makes the choice a reality. I have some sympathy with the remarks made by Mr Maaten about the imperfections of this scheme; nevertheless we have to work within the boundaries of what is scientifically provable and practically possible to implement.</p>
<p class="contents">We live in an imperfect world, and the use of thresholds reflects the reality. Organic regulations allow for the presence of up to 5% non-organic ingredients. In practical terms that means that an organic readymeal could contain minor ingredients like herbs and spices which are not readily available in organic form. We do not label very low levels of residues of pesticides or chemical contaminates in foodstuffs although we know they are present.</p>
<p class="contents">In any labelling regime there are bound to be imperfections. There has to be a cut-off point where the practical and the scientific reality cuts in. That is the best we can do with the science we have. One of the ingredients in the pizza that you might eat tonight might be a salami sausage but not every constituent ingredient of that sausage will appear on the pizza-box label.</p>
<p class="contents">Our job is to make the best deal that science allows. Our priority has to be to give the consumer real choice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This penalty is completely unacceptable, particularly if we compare the threat to society that he represents and the threat to our future health posed by GMOs. We are more aware in Europe than elsewhere that this is unacceptable, because we are obliged to guarantee our fellow citizens the real choice of whether to eat or whether to refuse to eat GMOs. Let us not be intimidated by the lies and pressure piled on by President Bush, who is supported by the pro-GMO agri-food industry and who is denying his own consumers a choice.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take the lead, let us dare to close the loopholes in our regulations. We must very clearly refuse to allow non-authorised GMOs onto the market. With regard to the labelling of authorised GMOs, we know that the food industry can detect the presence of even 0.1% of GMOs. This is the approach that we should follow, but having said that, unless there is a guarantee that GMO and non-GMO crops can coexist with one another, the best regulations in the world will be useless if GMOs are present everywhere in nature. This is absolutely crucial if we are to give consumers freedom of choice and protect the environment, maintain GMO-free crops and guarantee that they remain GMO-free. This is the real challenge we face. Let us not be fooled: unless coexistence is guaranteed, there will no longer be any choice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, labelling will be difficult for industry and will provide no honest information for the consumer. In its Common Position, the Council gives it as its opinion that the reports are aimed at preventing the consumer from being misled. How kind! The only problem is that it will not work like that. The fact is that labels do not have to show any adventitious or technically unavoidable contamination that might be present, at any rate not below a certain threshold value. Mrs Roth-Behrendt deserves our thanks for making that so marvellously clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether the figure is 0.9%, 0.5%, or perhaps we will hit on the idea of 0.1% or even 0.01% – the whole thing is nothing but a load of eyewash. If there is no danger to health – and there is none – then what is all the song and dance about? Pity the consumer who will eat GMOs without knowing it, whom we will quite deliberately be misleading. Read item 12 of the Scheele report and you realise how worthy of a comedy turn the whole thing is, for it says that, in order for the requirement of labelling to be dispensed with, the operator must certify to the competent authorities that he has done everything possible to prevent genetically modified organisms from being present. The good fellow has made such an effort, so we will not put the labels on and keep the consumer informed! The consumer will never discover what he has eaten. Never will it dawn on him that he has eaten GM food. In the committee, I attempted to prevent this, and put the case for doing away with negative labelling and saying yes to positive labelling. That would have been honest, and big firms like Nestlé, Unilever, and others would have gone along with it. No doubt it was too late for that. Let us treat the whole business as a didactic drama. Let us be glad that we have made co-existence possible, let us hope that someone will assume liability for it, and let us take this as a lesson in what political dishonesty can be like! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to say that I have quite a few reservations about this report. First of all, I think that labels should tell the whole truth, and not be 0.9% removed from the truth. It is regrettable, in my opinion, that we have not decided to introduce a GMO-free label, because that would have made matters much clearer for the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">I also regret that we have remained caught up in the small-print mentality; it would, in fact, be much better if a label could indicate in an open and clear manner right from the outset whether a product is GMO-free, contains GMO or may contain GMO. This would at any rate have provided consumers with the clarity for which many are waiting.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, I can agree to this legislation, because I think it is about time the ban was lifted, and I should therefore like to hear from the Commission what steps it intends to take to bring this about. For the Member States, it is time to closely examine not only co-existence in agriculture, in transport and in ports, but also how this is to be monitored. It should not be made too easy to get round this directive, and the Member States should really ensure that it is observed in any event. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is, I feel as if I am in a kind of hostage situation.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, I want to reject GMO technology, which is far from being problem-free. It is no panacea. On the contrary, it exposes us to risks because it is impossible to predict the characteristics to which a modified gene may give rise in its new environment. Co-existence sounds good, but we also know that GMOs are infectious. We do not therefore know what situation we are facing. There is also a concentration of power, and the big multinational companies exercise incredible pressure, especially upon the African countries. On the other hand, if we cannot put a stop to GMOs, strict rules are naturally needed. We must minimise the risk. I am therefore going to vote tomorrow in favour of the amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I want, however, to say once and for all that there are so many issues left to solve, for example in connection with environmental liability, that there can be no question of lifting the moratorium. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consumers have to know what they are buying and what they are eating. Effective, reliable legal framework conditions for authorising, labelling and tracing GMOs need to be created as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Both regulations, along with the lifting of the <span class="italic">de facto </span>moratorium on authorisation, are crucial to the implementation of a forward-looking strategy for European biotechnology, demands for which Parliament endorsed at the beginning of this year. The moratorium impedes the progress of green biotechnology in the European Union, and, in particular, both damages Europe’s innovative SMEs and stands in contradiction to the Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The room for action set out in compromise motion No 1 on the Scheele report is desirable. We must, however, ensure that, if individual Member States decide to go their own way, this does not frustrate the aims of this regulation by interfering with the common internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the adventitious and technically unavoidable presence of GMOs in non-genetically-modified products, we need rules that work in practice. In the final analysis, as we all know, every threshold value we set is arbitrary, but the 0.9% threshold value provided for in the Common Position is reasonable and helps to guide manufacturers and consumers. The threshold value is important in terms of different types of cultivation being able to coexist, as, in the natural world, there are no techniques for preventing such things as cross-pollination.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important yardstick by which the new legislation must be judged must be the practicability of its framework conditions, which must, in particular, be in line with WTO rules and must not allow excessive bureaucracy to hamper the development of biotechnology in Europe. Above all, they must help to inform consumers and protect them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that, if this figure of 0.5% had not been hammered out and adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we would not have such a rigorous Common Position and also the present basis for negotiating an acceptable compromise on co-existence.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to address is that I do not think it is very fair for us to be now acting as if we were about to vote ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to genetically modified organisms.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We know for a fact that we do not have the option of saying ‘no’, whether to GMOs or to many chemicals and other products. That is one reason why I campaigned for the most stringent conditions in the authorisation process and for comprehensive labelling. Mrs Flemming’s criticism was that the method of labelling was politically dishonest. I would ask her – although she is no longer here – whether not labelling something that was 100% composed of GMOs would mean that we were being more politically honest with consumers. I believe that the European public are perfectly grown-up enough to come to their own opinions on this, and also that biotechnology cannot but become more credible and be taken more seriously if it does not hide behind badly-framed rules on labelling. To those who draw attention to their energetic campaigning for labelling as ‘GMO-free’, I have always said that the fact that products are ‘GMO-free’ can be indicated by additional labelling. We cannot conceal from consumers the fact that genetically-modified organisms are everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have to stress the fact, and bring it to people’s attention, that this stance was friendly only to industry and not to the consumer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But my key point is that even if tough new rules are adopted tomorrow, as we hope, this should not be seen as a green light to lift the de facto moratorium. These directives do not address properly the very real risk of contamination of non-GM and organic agriculture with GM varieties. Nor do they provide for liability rules to cover farmers who are victims of such contamination.</p>
<p class="contents">Research by the Commission, by the European Environment Agency and by the Department for Environment in my own country all conclude that licensing GM crops will almost inevitably lead to widespread contamination of non-GM crops.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to ensure that the public has the right to choose to reject GM we must ensure not only that GM is labelled, but also that non-GM continues to exist. Unless we can address the problem of contamination, that cannot be guaranteed. I do not believe Mr Fischler's guidelines will be adequate. The moratorium therefore must stay in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there are a number of national consultation processes going on in the Member States on GM crops. It is vital that those processes are taken seriously. It is therefore a matter of much regret that the UK Government's process has been under-funded and badly publicised. Its deadline must be extended if we are not to conclude that government ministers have already decided in favour of GM cultivation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The evidence of the cooperation that has taken place between our institutions is in the presentation of the legislation before you for voting on tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course there have been expressions of different views by many sides during the course of the debate over the last two years and, indeed, in this Chamber this afternoon. There are some inevitably who will not be satisfied with the legislation that is put forward. Some for instance say that we go too far in achieving the balance that we have tried to achieve and that this will put off and set back the development of biotechnology in Europe in the future; that we are losing our good scientists to the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">That may be true but, nonetheless, we have to ensure that we have in place good legislation that gives valuable information to the consumer so that the consumer can make the choice of whether or not to consume GM foods.</p>
<p class="contents">We have put in place in this legislation – the best legislation in the world on this issue – providing free market authorisation, monitoring, labelling and labelling supported by traceability to give it the appropriate level and full credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Others reject GMOs and I suspect some of them would reject GMOs at any cost. I have to tell them that they will never be satisfied and there is no legislation that will satisfy them. In those circumstances, have they placed themselves in a situation where their views cannot be fully taken into account? Perhaps that is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who have worked hard on this issue – Mrs Scheele, my own staff and I hope myself – have attempted to achieve a balance so that we get in the legislation the best solution for all points of view, having taken into account views expressed right across the spectrum to achieve the result which is before you this afternoon and for voting on tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say to those who are very sceptical about this technology that all the scientific evidence available to us indicates that GM food is as safe as conventional food. There is no scientific evidence going in a contrary direction. We have said time and time again that our decisions here in Parliament and in the Commission must be science-based. If we move away from that we are in peril.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been asked to deal with the question of the moratorium. A number of Member States and a number of others asked for the <span class="italic">de facto</span> moratorium to be put in place to enable legislation to be brought forward to achieve what we have in this draft legislation at the moment. I cannot believe that it was the intention of those who wanted this work to be done to then say that, despite all this hard work, effort, expense and debate, they nonetheless believe that the moratorium should remain in place.</p>
<p class="contents">In those circumstances, reflecting the views of those who asked us to engage in this exercise and provide this legislation, we have now come to the stage when we must lift the de facto moratorium. Legislation is in place which gives adequate protection and information for consumers. It is a sophisticated piece of legislation – the best in the world, as I have said – to enable consumers to make the choice for themselves of whether or not to consume GM foods. The choice is for them. In those circumstances it is appropriate to move now to the beginnings of the lifting of the de facto moratorium on food and feed.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe we should be doing this in the face of any threat of WTO proceedings or anything of that nature. The work I have been doing – and I am sure it is the same for you – has been done on the basis of trying to achieve what is right, trying to achieve a result that provides the kind of choice for consumers that we believe is necessary and provides the choice for them in a meaningful way and in an informed manner.</p>
<p class="contents">We do this work because we believe it is right. We do not do this work because other people believe we ought to speed it up and do what they believe. I do not do this work under threat of WTO proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">To those of you who have expressed scepticism and still have some worries about this legislation, within a period of two years after the adoption of this legislation and it becomes law, there is specific provision in the legislation for a review. Therefore, it is possible – and it is intended – for us to return to this issue in that timescale so that we can, with the experience of the operation of the legislation, determine whether there is any need for adjustment and for amendments. In my opinion that is an important part of the legislation which will assuage the concerns of those who are expressing anxiety about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Will I take infringement proceedings or do I believe the Commission should take infringement proceedings if there is a failure to comply with the law? It is the Commission's function and role to look to the legislation, ensure that the laws of the European Union are properly applied and implemented and if there is a failure to apply <span class="italic">any</span> legislation – including this legislation – then we must take our responsibility and move in the way that we are required to do under the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I thank Mrs Scheele for her hard work and for the cooperation she has afforded to me in meetings personally and with my staff, and compliment her on the outcome of some difficult work over a long period of time. I also enjoyed working with her during that period.</p>

It confirms at the same time how difficult it is to reach some sort of consensus on this complex issue. This adds to the merit of the two rapporteurs, Mrs Scheele and Mr Trakatellis, who have managed to approach very distinct positions and to work out some viable compromise solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this debate I can trace a wish to be in a different debate about saying 'yes' or 'no' to GMOs. This is not the situation. We are not discussing whether to say 'yes' or 'no' to GMOs. Maybe this would have been easier, but we have passed that stage. We already import into the European Union 35 million tonnes of soya every year. This is a fact. It is not fair to say that we have not tried to act according to the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have revised Directive 2001/18/EC about placing live GMOs on the market. We have proposed traceability labelling. We have looked at food and feed proposals. We have added this. We have written a new text into the environmental liability proposal. We are always discussing ways to complement the existing legislation in order to meet the concerns of citizens in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have proposed reflects these concerns and, at the same time, the potential of this new technology. This is exactly what it addresses. We see that there is probably a lot of potential in using GM techniques, but we also see that there are risks. That is why we now have much stricter legislation in place. That is why we are tracing and labelling these products. That is why we have added a text in the environmental liability proposal. This is exactly what we have taken into consideration. We are trying to do our part and to take our responsibility. That is the only way to address such a complex and difficult issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it enough to restart authorisations? This debate also reminds me of a boy I know who, when he was five or six years old, was served small green peas as part of his dinner by his grandmother. He assured his grandmother that ‘yes, I love green peas, but I don't eat them’. The same will apply if we now put in place completely revised legislation but are not willing to apply it. What kind of signal are we sending to the rest of the world? A signal that our legislation, which ensures this balance of looking at both the potential benefits and the risks, does not work – we are not ready to apply it. That is the main point for me. We should be able to start to implement the legislation that we have now worked on for such a long time, trying to ensure an informed choice for the European consumers and farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">We must demonstrate to the rest of the world, including the US, that it works. This is how we do it. We make a risk assessment, we trace it, we label it and we make sure that we have this correct balance.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, as my colleague, Mr Byrne, has said, the Commission will take its responsibility. As you know, the process also leaves it very much up to Member States to demonstrate that they can work with this issue, but if they are not willing to do it the Commission will certainly take responsibility. Once again my thanks go to the rapporteurs and to all in the House for a very exciting debate.</p>

That is utter nonsense. Consumers are making it clear – and saying so in every survey – that they do not want GM products. So far, industry has been able to slip GM foods past the consumers on the quiet; now, the food manufacturers have to tell them the truth about their products, so if the <span class="italic">de-facto</span> moratorium is lifted, we will be in a completely new situation. Labelling has now arrived, so that consumers can make known their feelings – whether for or against – about this type of food. For the GM industry, the litmus test is not to do with whether or not they get authorisation from the EU, nor is it the procedural hurdles; it is whether or not consumers will buy these products. It is the market that is the litmus test; it is the market that will decide. I do not fear the end of this moratorium – far from it. You have to ask yourselves why it is that not one single manufacturer has, so far, put these products on the market labelled as such. Manufacturers will watch as these products do an economic nosedive. If these products have to be labelled, the manufacturers will have to tell the truth about them. It is the consumers themselves who will bring in a moratorium on buying them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also accepted responsibility when it comes to lifting the moratorium. Commissioner Wallström, at the time of the directive on release into the environment, you told us that liability would be incorporated in the environmental liability directive, but it was not.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruptions)</span></p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that, earlier in the debate, I asked the Commissioner to say something about the rules on seeds. My fear is that this House is being tricked. I urge the Commission to make a statement about this, because Parliament’s voice is not being heard on the subject. Will there be a limit value of zero for seeds as is already the practice in a number of states? Is it not technically avoidable? I ask you to speak and account for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consumers have minds of their own and want to be informed – about ingredients, composition, and additives; some of them want information about methods of production.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to meet this need for information, especially in those areas where ignorance gives rise to fears. Consumers want to use choice as a means of getting rid of uncertainty. People are afraid of anything that is new. As we have no long-term experience of GMOs, information is urgently needed if there is to be freedom of choice. I support the compromise. If we are to put this important regulation into effect, we now have to avoid a conciliation procedure. Only if it is adopted soon will it be possible to end the moratorium, thus avoiding trade disputes with the USA, Canada and Argentina. I hope that the EU will shortly abandon its reservations about GMOs. If people had opposed the wheel when it was invented, we would still be going everywhere on foot. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
