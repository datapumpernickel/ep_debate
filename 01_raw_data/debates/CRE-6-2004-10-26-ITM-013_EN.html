I greatly welcome the fact that six Member States of the European Union are connected with this global network on missing children, which has been set up on an American initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Existing funding programmes, especially AGIS and Daphne, and previously STOP – which has now expired – continuously addressed the issues of child-trafficking, sexual exploitation of children, child pornography, violence against children in general and, in this context, the issue of missing children also. In particular, both STOP and Daphne have been used to support financially the Childoscope project of the Belgian organisation Child Focus, and also the Institute for International Research on Criminal Policy of the University of Ghent, in line with the Council resolution of 2001 on the contribution of civil society to finding missing and sexually exploited children.</p>
<p class="contents">Programmes, such as AGIS and Daphne, however, focus on cooperation among EU Member States. The global network on missing children, on the other hand, is a worldwide initiative and is not limited to the Member States of the Union. In principle, the creation of websites in the EU Member States that could be used to search out and find missing children could be an appropriate subject for funding using one of the relevant funding programmes. The Commission can only encourage relevant governmental administrations and civil society organisations in the Member States to set up websites in the framework of the global network on missing children and submit appropriate project proposals for the relevant programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know that speed is of the essence in finding missing children, not only through the Internet which, when properly used, can be a powerful tool in finding people as quickly as possible, but also through the mobile phone networks.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two questions to put to the Commission. Firstly, do we know how many missing children there are in the enlarged European Union? Secondly, I would like to ask the Commission whether it would undertake through its 2005 work programme an initiative to establish a missing children website in all European Union Member States? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very difficult to be precise and the accession of ten new Member States to the European Union does not make it any easier to give a general figure. Whatever the figure is, it is far too high.</p>
<p class="contents">That is therefore a strong argument for us to develop the website proposal which the honourable Member has mentioned. I will make certain that my successors – I hope, my successors! – in the European Commission are made aware of his proposal and take it seriously.

What specific measures have been planned or put in place to ensure that the Burmese regime will now release Aung San Suu Kyi and fulfil the other demands made at the Gymnich meeting in Tullamore, Ireland?

<p class="contents">The additional measures agreed by the Council are designed to apply both direct political pressure and indirect economic pressure on the Burmese military regime. To apply direct political pressure and to sharpen the international isolation of the military regime, the Council has agreed to expand the EU-wide travel ban on senior Burmese military officers and their families. Under the new rules all Burmese military officers of the rank of brigadier-general and above will be barred from entering the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">To apply indirect economic pressure, the Council has agreed to adopt new measures prohibiting new investment in listed Burmese state-owned enterprises. Under these new measures, it would also be forbidden to provide loans or credits to Burmese state-owned enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission realises that the new measures, though they further isolate the military regime, cannot force it to carry out the actions demanded by the European Union at Tullamore. However, we believe that this increased pressure will significantly increase the costs to the regime of not complying with European Union demands.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I could add one point about assistance. At the moment, as the honourable Member will know, assistance from the Community budget is restricted to basic humanitarian aid and health care, and it is delivered through UN agencies and non-governmental agencies active inside Burma and close to the country's borders in Thailand and Bangladesh. The Commission is currently discussing with the Member States, but also with UN agencies and other donor organisations, the means which will allow us to optimise and expand our assistance from the budget to the Burmese people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Off the cuff, I cannot give the honourable Member details of all the companies that are, or will be, covered by the proposals, but I can certainly ensure that we correspond with him on the particular company that he has in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to hide a couple of points from Parliament. Firstly, in applying sanctions against named companies, you have to be careful that you are not obliging companies to break existing contractual arrangements or deny payments for goods they have received. It is always a trickier business to apply financial or economic sanctions than it sounds when one addresses the issue rhetorically. However, the point the honourable Member makes about the crucial importance of the energy sector in Burma is one we have to take account of.</p>
<p class="contents">The other thing that I would like to say very frankly to the honourable Member is that there are limits to the extent to which we can apply pressure and achieve the desired outcome. Like, I am sure, every Member in this Parliament, I would like to see Aung San Suu Kyi released from house arrest. I would like to see her and the NLD able to play a full part in the political life of Burma and Burma itself released from the trap of impoverishment and totalitarianism in which it at present finds itself.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the case that Aung San Suu Kyi's husband taught at a university with which I am now intimately associated, so it is a case that I have followed with huge interest and concern.</p>
<p class="contents">My own judgement is that, a little like the case of Zimbabwe, it is more difficult to achieve the desired outcome if neighbouring countries and regional organisations do not cooperate in achieving a desired human rights objective. I hope that, in this case, ASEAN will act rather more vigorously in the future than it has in the recent past. The situation in Burma is horrendous, and we must do everything we can to achieve some improvement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The focus is understandably on Aung San Suu Kyi, both because of her record and because of her international status. She has been garlanded – alas, <span class="italic">in absentia</span> – for the extraordinary heroism she has shown over the years. There are, as she would say, very many who have been persecuted along with her, whom we also need to take account of, and that includes most of the leadership of the NLD.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the honourable Member is entirely correct that the effectiveness of any sanctions – and certainly of travel bans – is entirely dependent on the extent to which Member States implement those sanctions. He might not be surprised to hear me say that, during the last five years, I have sometimes seen a little distance opening up between what people advocate at European level and what happens in the Member States. That is unfortunate.</p>
<p class="contents">On his first question, we know Parliament took a more vigorous view of ASEM and Burmese participation in the Council. I am not, at this late hour, going to pick an argument with the Council, even when it is not present. I think it was understandably concerned that we should not allow the ASEM process, which has been reasonably valuable over the years, to be taken hostage by our concerns over Burma. It is possible to take a different view on that. At least we were able to ensure that Burma's human rights record was discussed in plenary session in ASEM and to toughen up the sanctions regime against Burma in the Council. It was a difficult matter of judgment and I can understand why Parliament has its own view, but I hope Parliament will understand that the Council did not take the view it did because of pusillanimity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The diligence with which we pursue these policies is not always as popular with some Member States as it might be. Sanctions can be sometimes a rather Pavlovian foreign policy reaction: what is important is to examine the credibility of sanctions and to ensure that, where you put them in place, you apply them as rigorously as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I was unable to give the honourable Member who asked the first question all the information he would have liked, but I have tried – as I am sure that my successors will try – to be as open on this as possible. It is perfectly legitimate for Parliament to want to be absolutely clear about these matters: about what is being done in the name of human rights policy in Burma and about how we are trying to make a success of an objective which we presumably all share both in principle and in practice. That is, to secure the release of an extraordinarily brave woman and those who, with her, have fought not just for democracy, better human rights and civil liberties in Burma but also for a better deal for an extremely talented people who have been impoverished by totalitarianism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As regards the financing of non-military crisis management operations, the rules referred to in the question are laid down not only in the Financial Regulation, but also in its implementing rules. The implementing rules already offer simplified procurement procedures for crisis situations in external relations, such as the use of negotiated procedures. It should be recalled that such simplified procedures constitute derogations from the normal procedures. Moreover, Parliament monitors their use by the Commission and a special report on their use is presented every year to the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Arrangements for crisis management operations under the CFSP are currently being reviewed in the light of the functional needs of these operations, which it should be possible to accommodate within the existing framework of rules. For the longer term, the Financial Regulation provides for a review every three years, or whenever necessary. The Commission undertook to report on its experiences after the first two years of application of these new rules, that is, by the spring of 2005. This review will cover both the Financial Regulation and its implementing rules in order to see if, in the light of experience, any modifications to the rules are necessary, including the procurement rules for external actions in general and for crisis management operations in particular. I hope that is relatively clear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to reports I have received, there have been long delays in the arrival of equipment in the country, with six to eight months passing between the requirements being determined and the equipment actually arriving. The European Union has decided that it wishes to provide itself with instruments to ensure that crises, especially those in neighbouring countries, are overcome rapidly. Yet we are surely failing to achieve our aims if equipment arrives only when the crisis is already over.

At present, each time there is a crisis-management operation, all the necessary supplies and equipment have to be procured from scratch. However, the contracting, which obviously takes some time, cannot begin until the head of mission has been appointed and has engaged his own staff. Therefore we have to find some way to allow the procurement to begin before the crisis-management operation is formally adopted so that the supplies are available as soon as the operation starts, or very shortly thereafter. We could obviously provide technical assistance with this preparatory work, but I am sure this is one of the factors that will be taken into account in the review of the implementing rules which I mentioned earlier. In my experience it is not always possible for us to operate as rapidly as we would like, and that is because of the rules which have been put in place, usually with good reasons – greater transparency, proper budgetary procedure, etc. Unfortunately, when people draw up those rules they do not always think about the real world in which we have to operate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During this visit, Commission representatives met representatives from five human rights organisations and from two organisations in the field of forensic medicine, as well as government representatives and representatives from the police, gendarmerie and judicial institutions. The Commission came to the conclusion that further efforts had been made to step up measures against torture and ill-treatment, with the provisions of the new Penal Code playing an important role in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">Custody procedures have been brought into line with European standards, although prison officers do not always inform detainees of their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The authorities have announced a zero-tolerance policy against torture, and punishments have already been handed out to a large number of torturers. The Commission emphasises that there continues to be a large number of cases of ill-treatment and presumably also of torture in Turkey, and that it is now a case of eradicating these practices entirely. Further efforts must be made in this regard by the Turkish Government.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Turkey’s progress towards accession, the Commission stresses in its recommendation that reform processes and the fight against torture and ill-treatment, which are to be extended, must also be consolidated, and that the Commission will continue to monitor this process closely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The answer to the first is a clear ‘yes’. The Commission will continue to take all necessary measures, firstly to help Turkey in its fight against torture and ill-treatment, and secondly in order to monitor current developments. Special missions will of course also be sent to Turkey in the event that this is necessary. I should also like to make one further point; the sources to which you refer in your question, Mr Claeys, and which speak of systematic torture in Turkey, come from a political camp which you would not normally use as a reference source, and one which is diametrically opposed to your political position. You would not normally associate yourself with views that come from this part of the political spectrum. I am merely pointing this out for your information.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second question, as a candidate country Turkey naturally undertakes to comply fully with the political criteria, as do all candidate countries. Ensuring that this does in fact happen in future is regarded by the Commission as its most important task in relation to Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Financial Perspective put forward by the Prodi Commission, which covers the period until 2013, does not earmark any funds for a potential accession by Turkey. This means that it is impossible to comment on the way in which the potential costs of such an accession might be distributed. There is no way in which detailed comments can be made on this issue at present, as Turkey cannot be expected to join the EU for another 12 to 15 years. During this period both the European Union and Turkey will experience economic developments which are as yet unknown to us, the budget of the European Union may undergo far-reaching changes of which we are unaware, and expenditure on related policies may also change. As a basic principle, it will be possible for any matters which require regulation to be regulated under the Accession Treaty, including matters relating to costs. Turkey’s accession will not cost more than the Member States and the Community budget are prepared to spend at that point in time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As in the case of Poland, the elimination of regional disparities will of course also be an important factor if Turkey ever joins the EU. At present, however, it is still entirely impossible to comment on the financial implications this will have. I should merely like to point out that there is an upper ceiling for resource transfers into the new Member States, as well as into the old ones, which is set at 4% of gross national product. This means that the transfer of unlimited quantities of money is impossible. In fact this 4% ceiling has never been reached for the large Member States such as Spain, Italy or Poland, and it never will be. It is therefore reasonably safe to assume that, when the time comes, it will not be a question of comparing Turkey with Estonia or Lithuania, but rather with Spain or Poland, and this means figures of a very different order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission attaches great importance to the ongoing reforms of public administration and the judiciary in both countries. Not only must these reforms ensure that both countries are able to meet the conditions for membership, but they must also, above all, guarantee that after accession both countries are able to honour their commitments effectively as Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Signs of concrete progress have recently emerged in Romania, for example the formal adoption of a strategy to accelerate reform of public administration, the 2003 strategy on reform of the judiciary and the adoption of three fundamental laws for judicial reform in June 2004. Romania still needs to ensure, however, that these measures are implemented successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">A strategy was adopted in Bulgaria over a year ago on reform of the public administration, not least as a result of a great deal of pressure on my part, and in general the country is making good progress with its implementation. I must make it clear, however, that major efforts are still required in order to make improvements to the organisation of work, to the administrative capacity necessary for implementation of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and in particular to the management structures of the Bulgarian administration.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the judiciary, Bulgaria is continuing to make progress in implementing the 2001 strategy on judicial reform, even though there have been delays in certain areas. The Commission is closely monitoring developments in this field, and has supported these reforms by means of pre-accession assistance and close cooperation with other donors, including the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Reforms of public administration and the judiciary are among the absolute priorities to be supported in the framework of PHARE multi-annual programming for 2004-2006. In addition, informal committees on reforms of the public administration and judiciary will be set up in order to conduct a structured dialogue with both countries on these issues and to monitor and support the extension of operative capacities in both fields. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission looks into all of them. As far as border controls are concerned, we are working with both countries to improve the system, albeit not always successfully, as is apparent, and in fact the programmes are not yet complete. Overall, however, we believe that there has been an improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to corruption, you know that I have made very frequent reference to the issue in this House, and that all our progress reports call on Romania and Bulgaria to take firmer, more transparent and more decisive action in the fight against it. Although there are signs of progress in both countries, overall I should like to make it clear that I am not yet satisfied with the progress made in the fight against corruption in either of them. During the talks I held with both regions this stood at the top of the list of issues where the Commission expects to see significant improvements. In any case, I should like to make it clear that, before any possible accession by Romania and Bulgaria, they need to have effective legislation and effective institutions in place to fight corruption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Five Greek regions have been included in the Community action to address the effects of enlargement in regions of the Member States having borders with applicant countries. Given that the Commission itself has taken the view that Macedonia (Western, Central and Eastern) and Thrace are in by far the most difficult position, according to the criteria of income, the strength of the labour market, infrastructures and human resources, will the Commission give its assessment so far of the use of Community financial resources for these regions? </p>
<p class="contents">Which direction will Community action take after 2006 in view of the expected accession of Bulgaria and Romania and the beginning of EU-Turkey accession negotiations (it should be noted that Greece has borders with all three applicant countries)?

These programmes provide for the funding of measures to promote cross-border, transnational and transregional cooperation in the regions of EU Member States. The European Union provides cofinancing for structural policy measures in the Greek regions under the third Community Support Framework for Greece, which covers the period from 2000 to 2006, and programmes have been agreed for the regions of Western, Central and Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, the aim of which is to promote development and structural adjustment. A planned total of EUR 2.7 billion in public funding is to be allocated to measures in the three regions in question, with EUR 2 billion, or 75%, being provided under the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Although extremely good progress has been made with measures to improve local infrastructure, delays have unfortunately been experienced with measures to improve the performance of the local economy and the labour market and with those to promote use of human potential, due to the difficulty of implementing these measures. In many cases, the actual implementation of these extremely complex and ambitious programmes remains too demanding a task for the authorities responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these sources of funding, the above-mentioned regions also receive significant amounts of funding via the operative programmes implemented throughout the country under the Community Support Framework for Greece, and over 65% of Structural Funds earmarked for Greece flow through these horizontal programmes. The northern regions are also involved in a number of cross-border programmes, which include firstly the EUR 46.6 million INTERREG programme for Greece and Turkey, which was approved in late 2003, although no measures have yet been implemented under it.</p>
<p class="contents">The second of these programmes is the cross-border INTERREG/PHARE programme for Greece and Bulgaria, for which EUR 254 million have been earmarked. A large number of projects have begun under this programme, including measures in the field of transport infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the northern regions are involved in INTERREG/CARDS for Greece and Albania, as well as INTERREG/CARDS for Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. EUR 126 million are earmarked for the programme with Albania, as well as EUR 103 million for that with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and several programmes are underway, including those relating to economic development and employment. The INTERREG/CARDS programmes are likely to be converted shortly into Neighbourhood Programmes in order to promote and strengthen cooperation between Greece and Albania and between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">Pre-accession assistance for Turkey will begin with the 2004 programme, and includes a component for cross-border cooperation between Turkey and Greece, with annual funding of around EUR 2 million at present. The project’s aim is to improve cross-border cooperation between Greece and Turkey at a local level and to support the development of the economic potential of border regions. It is expected that funding for these measures will be increased in future years.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the focuses of the PHARE programme for cross-border cooperation between Bulgaria and Greece, which currently receives EUR 20 million in funding annually, has been infrastructure, and in particular the rehabilitation of regional roads with access to the two existing border crossings. There are also plans for the cofinancing of three new border crossings with approach roads, of which one is nearing completion. To date over two thirds of programme funds have been allocated to this priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Environmental issues are second on the list of priorities, and after Bulgaria and Romania join the EU cross-border cooperation between Greece and Bulgaria will be promoted under INTERREG on both sides of the border. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to try once again to explain this in my own words. There are three different programmes covering the north of Greece, including firstly those relating to cross-border cooperation with Bulgaria, a future Member State. As soon as Bulgaria joins the EU, this programme will be discontinued and replaced by a normal INTERREG programme at the border between Bulgaria and Greece, as is usually the case between Member States. This does not, however, mean that less money will be provided; it will merely be a different programme. Greece also has a joint programme with the neighbouring countries of Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which are not yet candidate countries. Provision has therefore been made here for another programme, and the Commission is planning to combine these instruments into a single Neighbourhood Programme in order to simplify matters. This programme will run for the whole of the next Financial Perspective. It is not my impression that a lower level of funding is to be expected at this border, indeed rather the opposite, in view of the high priority accorded to the Western Balkans in our strategic considerations. Thirdly, programmes exist in relation to the border with the candidate country Turkey, and more funding will be made available for this border region as part of the intensive cooperation with Turkey, which is only in its initial stages.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, it can be said that purely technical alterations will be made to certain aspects of the situation in the Greek border regions, but that there is no reason to expect that funding will be reduced; in fact, it is more likely that the opposite will be true. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is also true for the opinion that Advocate-General Léger issued on 25 May 2004 in case C-438/02 Åklagaren versus Krister Hanner, regarding the compatibility of Apoteket, the monopoly that exists in Sweden for the distribution of medicinal products, with certain Treaty provisions on the free movement of goods and the right of establishment (Articles 28, 31 and 43).</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Systembolaget, the distribution system for alcoholic beverages in Sweden, the Court of Justice has already made a pronouncement on that monopoly’s compatibility with Article 31 of the Treaty, in its ruling of 23 October 1997 on the Franzén case. The article states that the structure and activity of State monopolies must be organised so as to ensure that no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed exists between nationals of Member States, so that trade in goods from another Member State shall not suffer any disadvantage in law or in fact compared with a domestic product.</p>
<p class="contents">Having thoroughly examined the Systembolaget system with regard to points of sale, choice of products and promotional activities, the Court decided that the monopoly sales structure of Systembolaget was compatible with Article 31 of the Treaty. In the current state of affairs, the Franzén ruling provides the Commission with a guideline from a legal point of view in the context of assessing the compatibility of Systembolaget with EU rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a misapprehension that crops up occasionally: whereas a fine imposed by the Commission for a cartel or abuse of a dominant position is credited to the Community budget, an order for reimbursement of illegal and incompatible state aid requires a transfer of money from the firm that wrongfully received it to the Member State in question and not to the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the case law of the Court of Justice and Article 10 of the Treaty, when a Member State encounters difficulty in enforcing a Commission decision requiring the reimbursement of an illegal and incompatible state aid, the Member State and the Commission must cooperate in order to find a solution to the difficulty. It is not a case of negotiation, and the Commission’s decisions remain valid in all respects. This kind of cooperation is currently taking place between Spain and the Commission. The Commission does not intend to review the decisions in question since that would create a distortion of competition in the EU shipbuilding market. In recent years the Commission has received a large number of complaints from EU competitors regarding the aid granted to Spanish shipyards. Moreover, it would seem impossible, anyway, from a legal viewpoint, to authorise the aid in question, in view of the condition not to grant any further aid in future to Spanish shipyards, which was laid down by the Council back in 1997 and repeated in Article 5 of the regulation on aid to shipbuilding that was applicable at the time when the aid was granted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is perfectly aware of the importance of the shipbuilding industry in Europe and also of the importance the shipbuilding industry attaches to a level playing field within Europe, which would be at odds with an unregulated system of State aid to shipbuilding.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been two recent visible signs of the importance the Commission attaches to this sector. First, you mentioned unfair Korean competition: you will certainly be aware of the Commission's bold initiative – which unfortunately took a long time to be reflected in a Council decision – firstly to bring Korea to the WTO and secondly, at the same time, to put in place a temporary defensive mechanism against unfair Korean competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The second visible sign of interest is the Leadership 2015 programme, which was coordinated by the Commission with the participation of representatives of the European Parliament and the shipbuilding industry, to identify a number of proactive policies.</p>
<p class="contents">This gives you an indication of how the Commission, with the other European institutions, has tried to accommodate the needs of the sector, while at the same time trying to comply with the law when it comes to specific subsidies. As you know, in the case of IZAR there is a whole history of non-compliance with the rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The tax relief scheme ‘unlawfully introduced by Italy’ because it was not the subject of prior notification, and ‘incompatible with the common market’ in violation of European legislation on State aids, was launched in 2002 for the benefit of 1 600 municipalities in northern Italy, some of which have never been hit by natural disasters.</p>

<p class="contents">The decision to begin the formal investigation procedure was actually adopted on 17 September 2003, once information had been forwarded by the Italian authorities on 4 July 2003. Besides, the applicable regulation does not set any time limit for the examination of a case by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I must point out that the Commission adopted the decision to close the formal investigation procedure on 20 October 2004, or five weeks after receiving the final details from Italy. With regard to the second part of the question, the articles that appeared in the press before the Commission adopted its decision were based on information that did not come from the Commission itself, which only informs the media of its decisions after they have been adopted, usually by means of a press conference and/or press release.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission’s decision specifies that Italy must order all the beneficiaries to refund the incompatible aid, with interest, and it must inform the Commission of the measures implemented and planned in order to comply with the decision within two months. The Commission is monitoring the recovery procedure and may take the case to the Court of Justice if it is not properly carried out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to say in reply to Mr Staes that he must surely be aware of the fact that early in 2003 the Commission began an investigation into the inkjet and laser printer market. Since then, the Commission has gathered a large amount of evidence and held many talks with printer manufacturers and reconditioned cartridge suppliers. Our inquiries have focused on the problem of determining whether the printer manufacturers are infringing Community competition rules because of the shapes and prices of their cartridges. The investigation is extremely complex in both economic and legal terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently completing its analysis of the evidence gathered, and at this stage it is still too early to say whether or not there has been any infringement of competition law or whether the proceedings can be closed. The Commission will, of course, make any further news on this matter public as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The main objective of the food labelling legislation in the EU is to provide consumers with factual information regarding the characteristics of foodstuffs, such as composition, quantity and shelf-life.</p>
<p class="contents">Under EU food law, origin labelling is not mandatory, unless the origin is clearly connected with one or more characteristics of a foodstuff, or it is necessary that the purchaser should not be misled as to its true origin, for instance where its name includes a geographical reference.</p>
<p class="contents">Origin labelling in itself would not provide the consumer with clear information as regards animal welfare or methods of production. We continue to work through international organisations to improve world standards in areas such as animal welfare. This would offer the best way forward in meeting the honourable Member's concerns about the application of these rules in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards standards of food safety, all food and feed placed on the market in the EU must be safe, irrespective of where it comes from. Third countries may only export food products to the EU if stringent conditions are met and a verification mission has been carried out by the Food and Veterinary Office.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, obligatory checks are carried out on all imports of animal products at the point of entry, in the EU border inspection posts. The recently adopted Food and Feed Regulation aims to harmonise controls on all other imported food products.</p>
<p class="contents">These measures ensure that the food standards applied in the export sector of third countries trading with the EU meet EU food safety requirements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the issue of her supplementary question: there is specific legislation relating to beef labelling, namely Regulation No 1760/2000, which specifies the particular requirements in relation to beef, including its origin, and was enacted in response to the issues surrounding the BSE controversy some years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Any labelling in any Member State which mis-states the origin of the beef in question is a failure to comply with that piece of legislation. The Commission is always concerned at any failure to comply with EU law. If this has happened on any occasion in Ireland or indeed anywhere else in the manner that you have described, this is a clear failure of compliance with EU legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In those circumstances it is a matter for the competent authorities of the Member States, and in this instance the competent authorities in Ireland, to ensure that any failure to comply with EU legislation is properly investigated and dealt with in the appropriate manner. It certainly would not be the wish of the Commission to see any failure to comply with legislation of this kind and this is a matter which should be dealt with properly and by the competent authorities of the Member State in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Response to recent studies of Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The extent of foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and the best advice to offer to expectant women remains controversial. A recent study by Dr Raja Mukherjee, London, claims that drinking any amount of alcohol can be damaging and that one in every 100 babies born is damaged by their mother drinking while pregnant but that many cases go unrecognised. Studies in the US, South Africa and Scandinavia suggest that one in 300 infants is affected by FAS. Affected children can suffer problems with memory, attention span, hyperactivity, physical abnormalities and a diminished IQ. There is a need for further research into FAS. However, heavy alcohol consumption is known to be damaging to the unborn child and some EU governments recommend a limit of one to two units of alcohol per week for pregnant mothers-to-be. In the light of this does the Commission have any plans to introduce EU legislation requiring alcoholic beverages to carry warning labels about the potential for damage to unborn children? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully share her concerns on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Foetal Alcohol Syndrome – FAS – is a mental and physical disorder that can include mental retardation, brain dysfunction, physical abnormalities, learning disabilities and psychological disorders. FAS occurs as the result of prenatal alcohol exposure. Recent studies increasingly suggest that there may be no clearly safe drinking limit above zero alcohol for pregnant women. Key elements to prevent FAS are awareness–raising and consumer information. The Commission is at present developing a working paper on a coordinated approach in Europe to tackle alcohol–related harm. FAS is one of the possible topics to be addressed in the paper.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is carefully studying the types of information that should be provided in addressing this problem. Possible guidelines on these could be included in the Commission's working paper on alcohol, which is planned for next year. The Commission also intends to prepare a report on the application of Council recommendations on alcohol and young people from 2001, which, among other things, will address the need for further action. In addition, the possibility of having a conference on alcohol next year, together with the WHO European office, is being explored.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to emphasise that we should not forget the central role of our Member States in tackling alcohol–related harm. An integrated approach needs concerted action by all stakeholders, including families, schools, employers, industry, advertisers and national regulators. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also thank you for all the work that you have done over the past five years on the public health agenda. It is much appreciated. As you said, new research suggests that in some cases, one in a hundred babies could be affected. Other research suggests that the figure is one in three hundred. In fact, according to Friday's <span class="italic">Guardian</span>, which dealt with what is happening in France, about 7 000 babies born there are thought to be mentally or physically damaged by passive consumption of alcohol in the womb. Mr Philippe Douste-Blazy, the French Minister for Health, said that FAS was 'aside from genetic factors, the prime cause of mental retardation in children'. This is clearly a European issue and one that we have to take seriously. I hope that the Commission's alcohol strategy will look at what is happening in the United States of America, where alcohol products are properly labelled with a health warning.</p>

<p class="contents">As you may know, DG SANCO is at present preparing a Community strategy to reduce alcohol-related harm, as called for in the Council conclusions in 2001. Several areas for action have been identified as key areas. One of them is consumer information, to improve awareness of the risks connected with the consumption of alcoholic beverages. At the moment the draft proposals concern the legal and practical feasibility of having health warnings on the containers of alcoholic beverages, as well as at points of sale. These would include information on, for instance, pregnancy.</p>
<p class="contents">If the public health authorities do not move in and occupy the field, it might well be occupied by industry. That is not entirely satisfactory, because the information being made available by the industry might not be consistent with best public health practice.

These findings confirm the results of earlier FVO missions. Based on Commission recommendations, commitments were received from the Greek authorities on action to rectify these deficiencies.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the new Rentis market, there has been slipping in the timetable notified by the Greek authorities for its construction. According to our latest information, the construction works are scheduled for completion in mid-2006. Despite the fact that the Commission has had a number of high-level contacts with the Greek authorities in recent years about the food control system, progress has not been satisfactory. This relates to the specific issue of insufficient staffing levels in the Greek veterinary service to ensure effective implementation of EU veterinary legislation. That is why, in May 2004, the Commission sent a letter of formal notice to the Greek authorities urging them to remedy this situation. In the absence of appropriate assurances from the Greek authorities, the Commission sent a reasoned opinion to Greece on 18 October, asking the Greek Government to address effectively the problem of understaffing in its veterinary services within a period of two months. Failure to do so could lead the Commission to bring the case before the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also considering similar action in relation to the control systems in Greece for the approval of red meat establishments.

Under its first strand, dealing with health information, the Working Party on Mental Health has been created, bringing together project leaders and stakeholders. In the 2005 work plan, the focus of activities will be on promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders in children, adolescents and young people, based on improved data collection and analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no doubt that human rights and humane treatment are fundamental to mental health practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the recent adoption of the Council of Europe’s recommendation concerning the protection of the human rights and dignity of persons with mental disorders. It also supports the UN standard rules for the equalisation of opportunities for people with disabilities as well as the efforts to establish a UN legally binding instrument to protect the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities. The Commission is fully engaged in the negotiations on this instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the use of caged beds within psychiatric and social care facilities in Hungary and Slovenia as well as in Slovakia and the Czech Republic and welcomes the report on this issue that was published in 2003 by the Mental Disability Advocacy Center. As a result of this report, the Commission made enquiries about the exact position on the use of caged beds in these countries and drew the attention of the national authorities to the necessity to remedy this problem. According to information then received by the Commission, it appeared that the situation was improving. It was reported that Hungary has imposed a caged bed ban that will come fully into force at the beginning of 2005. In the Czech Republic, caged beds are reported as being gradually replaced.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has launched a study on conditions in institutions in all the 25 Member States in order to establish the situation that currently exists, with a focus on disabled persons. The findings of this study, undertaken by Inclusion Europe, were presented in Brussels on 22 and 23 October. The study confirmed that caged beds, or netted beds – as they are also called – are indeed being used in several Member States, including old and new Member States. Furthermore, the study showed that the question of caged beds cannot be dissociated from the more general context of living conditions in large residential institutions. These conditions are sometimes unacceptable and do not respect the most elementary requirements of human respect and dignity. The study found that community-based residential services provide opportunities, but not guarantees, for better outcomes.</p>
<p class="contents">From 2005, the Commission will produce a biennial public report on the overall situation of people with disabilities in the European Union. The report is intended to provide a useful tool for all disability decision- makers by providing accurate, dynamic and up-to-date information on the situation of people with disabilities throughout the European Union.</p>
