<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our task is to vote on a Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget – the first this year – which was adopted by the Commission on 31 January and has already been adopted by the Council on its first reading. There are several aspects to this Supplementary and Amending Budget. It is intended to modify the remarks for budget line B7-541 in order to enable the European Agency for Reconstruction in the Balkans to extend its activity to Montenegro and cover its administrative costs. It aims to update the EUR/dollar exchange rate, as obliged by the Council Regulation on budgetary discipline. While the 2001 budget is based on a parity of EUR 1 = $ 0.91, the Commission will have to present the required adjustments to EUR 1 = $ 0.87. This will then give rise to what are really only virtual savings of EUR 245 million. EUR 60 million will be transferred from the reserve to finance the agreed BSE tests. And then there is the issue which is of crucial interest to us all, as is evident from the discussions and debates held over the last week: an additional EUR 971 million will be released to cushion at least some of the impact of the BSE crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The figure of EUR 971 million is broken down as follows: EUR 700 million will be used to cover the 'purchase for destruction' scheme for cattle over 30 months, EUR 238 million will go towards the buying-in of beef in public stocks, and an extra EUR 33 million will be used to finance the additional BSE tests conducted on cattle over 30 months intended for human consumption. Let me make it clear from the outset that I am in favour of adopting the Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget, albeit in a modified form. I say “modified” because we should give some encouragement to the Member States to take on more responsibility for the common agricultural policy. So I support the draft, although I sympathise with those Members who want to reject this Supplementary and Amending Budget in its entirety.</p>
<p class="contents">My initial reaction was to say no to the draft as well. Since I became a Member of the European Parliament, I have had to defend the common agricultural policy at home. And that really is not an easy task. We spend almost half our budget on our agricultural policy, and almost a fifth of that goes on supporting beef production. But now that the beef market has collapsed, we are supposed to come up with almost EUR 1 billion to destroy the beef cattle which have been raised at such expense, because they have become unsaleable. And it is very difficult – if not well-nigh impossible – to explain to the general public, the taxpayers and consumers, why this has to be done. For one thing is clear: though this may be an enormous amount of money to cushion the initial impact of the BSE crisis now, it will not be enough for the rest of the year. It is the proverbial drop in the ocean. Or a tiny bit of sticking-plaster on a suppurating wound. And this suppurating wound is our common agricultural policy with its system of production incentives.</p>
<p class="contents">These mechanisms date back to a time when there was still a shortage of most foodstuffs. But these times are well and truly over. Today, there is a surplus – a glut – in all the key markets. Coupling financial support with production creates an incentive – indeed, a necessity – to increase production and rely on more and more intensive production methods. This intensification has a significant environmental impact and marginalises less productive locations. And we cannot even defend the system on social grounds, for while the large factory farms have constantly expanded, small family farms have gone to the wall, unable to survive under these conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">In total, 80% of EAGGF funding flows to less than 20% of farms. We have to break away from this system. We cannot merely continue to treat its symptoms: we have to find a cure. By its very nature, the system simply creates more and more problems. So let us use this latest crisis as a chance to overhaul our common agricultural policy. Let us use it as an opportunity for reform, focusing on the following objectives: maintaining a sufficient number of farms to preserve the environment and the cultural landscape, and recognising two core elements of the farmers' role, namely to produce high-quality foodstuffs while protecting the environment within the rural development framework. And, of course, also achieving one of the European Parliament's longstanding goals: the promotion of rural regions. However, this means supporting other forms of economic activity as well as agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us see the Supplementary and Amending Budget as the final step in our old agricultural policy – a step which has to be taken because no other instrument is available quickly. But when we come to adopt the next financial measure, we must have a clear outline of a reformed agricultural policy. For one thing is clear: although as a budget specialist, I have to focus on the financial aspects, I am well aware that the current crisis is not a financial crisis at all but a crisis of our agricultural policy. And the sooner we set about correcting the problem, the better.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that two million cattle are to be slaughtered and destroyed in an effort to ease the burden on the markets, there is talk of an ethical problem. Ladies and gentlemen, two million older cattle are slaughtered every year in Europe. This is business as usual in other words. But as a rule, these animals end up on the dinner table, not in an incineration plant. However, I think it is a little far-fetched to talk about ethics. Especially when there is talk of a 'Herod premium' in relation to a calf slaughter programme. Good heavens, we do pride ourselves on our Western Christian roots, don't we – so I would just remind everyone that King Herod killed new-born male infants. He killed people, not animals. And despite all our love and understanding for animal protection, we should leave the church out of it. There is a difference between humans and animals. Let us not forget that.</p>

Is it permissible for a crisis to be used, or abused, for one’s own political ends, for the greening of agriculture policy or on the contrary for its liberalisation? The real problem of BSE is caused not by large or small-scale businesses or the number of cattle per hectare: the real problem is that Member States have made a mockery of European rules and hence, in fact, have abused the trust of European consumers and farmers. In that sense, I am bound to say, partly in view of the discussion in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, that Amendments Nos 2 to 5 are not in accordance with the unanimous opinion of the Committee on Agriculture as communicated to the Committee on Budgets. Amendment No 1 is included in the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the seven-point programme of the European Commission will come up for discussion later. We are now concerned with the budget amendment before us. The Committee on Agriculture agrees with this budget amendment, which is in line with the proposals made by it back in November 2000. Although its foundation is weak, for example because of the relationship between the euro and the dollar, which is at this moment considerably less favourable than is desirable for the agriculture budget or is presented by the Commission, this is still the most practical course to follow. The space within the existing budget will be used and the Financial Perspective remains intact. That will no longer be the case in the near future. Now that beef consumption has fallen by 28% and export is virtually impossible, we are heading towards a surplus of 2.5 million tons of beef, though the storage capacity of the European Union only totals 1 million tons.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences for farmers’ incomes are dramatic and the low prices certainly did not encourage consumers to increase consumption. The expenditure ceiling will soon be in sight. It was decided in the Committee on Agriculture of the European Parliament to discuss four alternatives for future funding, namely changing the Financial Perspective, saving on the current budget, adjustment of the division of costs between the Union and the Member States or additional funding through levies and discounts. Because of the present foot-and-mouth crisis, that discussion will have to begin earlier than we should in fact prefer.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it will be clear to you that the support of the Committee on Agriculture for the budget amendment can be seen as support for the Commission: it is exhibiting, in any case, more dynamism than the Council, which is bogged down in the individual national agendas, instead of solving the crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do so in the awareness that in recent years BSE has often been accompanied by significant government failures, and the mistakes of the past are still coming back to haunt us. So the Community has a responsibility to play its part in overcoming this crisis as well. We will also vote for the 70/30 split, because we want to adopt the budget as quickly as possible, even though some people in this House would have wished to examine this issue more fully for future occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also add that at this difficult time that we should do our utmost to act in a serious and responsible manner and not add to the panic. I for one do not want to have to adopt one supplementary budget after another. I should like to remind everyone that we are only a third of the way through implementing the much-vaunted Agenda 2000. We cannot celebrate this as a success and the basis of European business until 2006, and then slam on the brakes and deal it a death blow at the first available opportunity. That will not enhance our credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In any emergency, urgent measures are needed – but anyone wishing to change tack too abruptly at such a time could easily capsize in Europe's fickle waters. An energetic approach is needed, but so too is sensitivity, if the issues are to be addressed seriously. The task now – of course, against the background of enlargement towards Eastern Europe and the next world trade round as well – is to develop the common agricultural policy and the European model of consumer protection and agriculture in line with Member States' pledges in the international arena regarding Agenda 21, resource protection, sustainability, and balancing natural resource use on the one hand, and the use of technology and the economy on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe that the situation is now so serious that it is not enough for the European Parliament alone to deal with these issues. In my view – and this is our group's demand – the Heads of State and Government must discuss these issues at their forthcoming summit in Stockholm and provide honest answers to this crisis. An answer must be found to the loss of consumer confidence. The Member States must finally do their homework more promptly than in the past. We have countless examples of occasions when the Commission was initially pressed to act and finally responded, but the Member States acted too late. We must put an end to this situation. We must also find answers to some of the attacks and aspersions cast on the professional integrity of farmers. Some of what is happening goes beyond what is acceptable. The Heads of State and Government must find an answer to this problem. And the question is, do we really want to overcome this crisis? For if we fail to do so, we will find that two years down the line, half the beef farms in Europe will have gone out of business. So this means that there must be a response, and a change of course, from the Heads of State and Government too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last year, we had a rather more pleasant duty to perform on behalf of the Member States. We were able to reimburse the sum of 3.2 billion to them. This year, in an area which plays an enormously influential role in European policy, we are forced to implement a measure which no one can possibly relish. Not only because of its underlying theme, but also because there is no alternative to the Commission's proposed approach. This is not just annoying but it enrages me to see that in order to rectify a situation, we have to support a process which is almost impossible to justify to anyone with any common sense.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to say yet again that it is incredible that foodstuffs which were produced with massive amounts of money now simply have to be incinerated. We are not only dealing with a financial crisis. Of course I am speaking as a budget specialist here, but I cannot focus solely on the financial aspects, for we face a crisis of confidence as well. The people watching us cannot understand that we are just accepting this without demanding real follow-up measures. And as much as I value Mr Böge's calm approach – and he is certainly a good example of how we should be responding in this situation – no normal sentient and thinking person could possibly stay genuinely calm and simply say yes to what is being demanded of us.</p>
<p class="contents">We are required to decide on a measure which stretches our credulity to the limit. So I have every sympathy with those who say, “Let's reject it.” Or those who say, “Let's put the thumbscrews on the agriculture ministers.” I sympathise with all of them, because what is happening here is almost beyond belief.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, however, what we must do is to bring about a change of course. But this cannot be achieved overnight. We cannot completely reshape our agricultural policy in the first two months of this year and make it the basis of our decision here today. That is simply not feasible. We cannot halt meat production overnight, because the calves are already gestating. And to pretend that all we need to do is press a switch to make everything better is simply an illusion. We have to be honest enough to admit this. But we must also make it very clear that if we support this measure here today, we are not giving the Commission or the Council a free rein. In the coming weeks and months we will be looking very closely at the proposals you submit to us. We will not be saying, “Carry on as usual.” Let me make this very clear. We must not take desperate measures in the heat of the moment, but there will be no 'business as usual' either. Instead, you will have to put forward proposals to ensure sustainable development and discuss them with us in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">You must also understand that as far as the budget is concerned, the end – and the upper limit – have been reached with this decision today. There is no more after this. Everything that happens in future will have a dramatic impact, not only for us but also for you, when you have to prepare items or agree measures in the Council. You can assume that you have our agreement once again this time, but it will be far more difficult in future, unless very good grounds and substantive policy amendments are put forward in this context. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have in front of us a budget relating to the BSE crisis, but know that at this moment a far greater danger is haunting Europe: the danger that foot-and-mouth disease will spread on a large scale. This budget will, in any case, not be adequate to confront all these calamities. If we approve this budget, there will not be the slightest leeway left in the 2001 budget. Is that sensible? In the view of my group it is not. We believe extra leeway should be created for the months ahead. The only leeway that we have been able to find at the moment would be created if instead of a proportion of 70-30 for financing the disposal of livestock, a proportion of 50-50 were introduced. This would create the extra scope of approximately 300 million euro in the budget for dealing with other calamities in the future and maybe also for financing measures for combating foot-and-mouth disease.</p>
<p class="contents">In the view of my group, the greatest threat looming at the moment is the renationalisation of agricultural policy. Every country will try in its own way to find funds to confront the outbreak of all those diseases. We must prevent every Member State pursuing its own independent policy: all policy must continue to issue from Brussels and that is why that extra leeway in the budget is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask the Commission what steps it has taken since the Haug resolution of last July on the guidelines for the budget: that resolution clearly asked for a consideration of alternative forms of finance in relation to outbreaks of disease. What has the Commission done on this point? Is it possible to insure ourselves in future against these kinds of calamities? Is a levy on meat required for an emergency fund? We would like answers to all such questions, because it is unacceptable that diseases should break out and we should have no resources to do anything about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am afraid that I must take issue with Mrs Haug: the destruction of cattle is indeed an ethical problem and cannot be treated as a market support measure. It is the tangible consequence of a bad agricultural policy: first the support and funding of overproduction, and then the destruction of overproduction. We saw this with the butter mountain, we see it with the milk lakes, and now we have the same problem with beef.</p>
<p class="contents">What is required is a fundamental shift in our approach to agricultural policy, and I can only appeal to this House to recall its earlier resolutions. For it was the European Parliament which, since 1990, has repeatedly highlighted the problems and called on the Council to set a new policy course. It was this House which took the BSE issue seriously, long before it reached the crisis levels that we see today. So I think it is very important, in this decision, to make it clear to the Commission and the Council that we need codecision rights for Parliament in this area at last, that we need to strengthen Parliament, and that we must finally agree on an agricultural policy reform which translates this concept into reality.</p>
<p class="contents">We are witnessing a substantial loss of confidence everywhere. Everyone who is currently engaged in an election campaign – as in Baden-Württemberg for example, where the <span class="italic">Land</span> parliament elections are imminent – knows that at present, a great many questions are being asked about the European institutions. If we want to address this loss of confidence, if we want to restore confidence, we need fundamental reform. It is simply not enough to muddle through with pragmatic solutions and wait for the next crisis to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a change of policy course. We must move away from overproduction, the funding of overproduction, and the funding of the destruction of overproduction. Everyone who sits on the Committee on Budgets knows that this agricultural policy is also open to a great deal of abuse. We are aware of the cases which crop up time and again. We know about several cases relating to butter and milk. We urgently need to set a new policy course, and I would like to make it clear that with today's debate and tomorrow's vote, we are sending out a signal that it is time for a fresh approach to agricultural policy. And it is time to restructure the budget so that Parliament has more influence over compulsory expenditure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First and foremost, there is a gulf between the Commission’s own diagnosis of the anticipated cost of the BSE crisis and the funding plan before us.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to repeat Mr Fischler’s point of view, as published in <span class="italic">Le Monde</span> one month ago to the day, which said that the costs of this crisis will be huge, even in the best case scenario where consumption would not fall more than 10% in 2001 and where our exports would be maintained. Intervention buying alone would have a budgetary cost of EUR 3 billion. One month later, consumption has fallen by 27% and exports have halved. Yet we have been proposed a budget of a little less than EUR 1 billion, or a third of the estimated minimum costs. This budget deficit gives a spectacular insight into the major political deadlocks that are provoked by a steadfast and increasingly intolerable refusal by the majority of the Fifteen and the Commission alike to consider even the slightest change to the Financial Perspective, even if this would lessen the effects of such a serious, unexpected crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">In the medium term, my group is certainly in favour of far-reaching reform of the common agricultural policy, a reform that would put an end to spending all the budget on illegitimate funding of agribusiness which centres on high productivity and is dangerous to human health and to the environment. We want to see a CAP that no longer sends millions of animals to the incinerator; instead, we want a CAP that reserves its funds for real farmers, paying them a decent price for their products to enable them to practice long-term farming, sustainable development and safe, healthy livestock feeding.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite the opposite is what we have today where small and medium size producers are in deep trouble and are being well and truly lynched. They are victims of a pernicious agricultural policy that was pretty much foisted upon them. We do not believe in making things worse in order to further our own ends. We shall therefore vote in favour of this budget as an emergency measure. We cannot, however, leave it at that. The European Union must see its responsibilities through to the end. On this issue, I shall voice my opposition to the idea of renationalising the CAP or, to put it more accurately, renationalising the funding of the CAP, as one amendment is underhandedly seeking to do, which would be tantamount to disintegrating the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, I would like to ask the majority of this House, which is dedicated to boosting the quality of European integration, if they can imagine what an enormous impact the talks on the future European Federation and on the unification of the great European family would have if, all at once, the oldest common policy were smashed to pieces, if the cardinal principle of solidarity crumbled at the very hands of the Fifteen and if, in the face of a major crisis, there was a return to the principle of every man for himself? I believe that such issues are certainly worth several EUR billion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, has the European Union gone so far down the path of madness that it would sacrifice the oldest and most complete of its common policies, by which I mean the common agricultural policy, when, paradoxically, it is also imposing and stepping up the integration process in the other sectors. Our group has many reservations about the SAB which was adopted on Monday by the Committee on Budgets, and is even openly opposed to it, since the Committee is challenging the traditional distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure, that the report is trying to force us to accept. Of course, EUR 971 million is not enough by far given the serious nature of the situation; it is merely a starting point to mainly fund the ‘purchase for destruction’ scheme and possibly the screening tests, if necessary. But then what will we do?</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis is so extensive that direct aid should naturally have been released immediately in order to support farmers’ affected income and the beef industry as a whole. There are sufficient funds for that. Once the SAB is adopted, there will be a margin of approximately EUR 500 million. We know that huge savings can be made on some of the budget lines. For example, we would make instant savings by reducing the aid given for setting aside agricultural land, which would pave the way for protein crops. Europe depends to a great extent on the United States for its supply of these as a result of the Blair House agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">By rejecting direct aid funded from the Community budget, as proposed by France, the Commission and the Council are preparing for the renationalisation of agriculture. If this goes ahead, we will have to bear all the consequences of any such renationalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first instance, we must acknowledge the failure of European integration, a failure upon which we must reflect before undertaking further common policies, particularly on a single currency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The draft before us merely entrenches the structures which supported large-scale factory farming and production and are therefore partly to blame for the crisis. Seventy per cent of the supplementary budget is to be used to pay for the incineration campaign. It thus shores up the factory farming structures which have contributed to the crisis. We will lose all credibility with the honest and blameless European farmers if we vote for this supplementary budget. We will be sending out the wrong signal if, with this incineration campaign, we now sweep the problems of those who are partly responsible for the crisis under the carpet. So I support the rapporteur when she calls for a fundamental shift in our agricultural funding regime in favour of small-scale farming.

Firstly, which short-term measures must we adopt in order to restore some measure of stability to the beef market? Secondly, what must we do in the medium term when this House debates the Agriculture Commissioner's 7-point plan? And thirdly, what must we do in the long-term? This House will also debate this issue, in connection with its review of market structures in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Please, let us keep to this. For now, the immediate task is to adopt measures for the farmers throughout Europe so that the massive fall in beef prices does not put their livelihoods in even greater jeopardy than is already the case. That is the purpose of this supplementary budget, and, please, we should deal with everything else in a calm and sensible way. Let us not delude ourselves: until last autumn, there was a balance between supply and demand in the beef market, and it is important to be honest about that. There are no milk lakes or butter mountains, and, Mrs Rühle, let me make one thing quite clear, it was the government which you support which agreed eighteen months or two years ago to adopt what you now describe as a bad system, namely Agenda 2000. That should be stated clearly for once, and you might like to discuss it at some point within your own party – which includes Mrs Schreyer, the Budget Commissioner, who proposed it, and Mrs Künast, the German Agriculture Minister, who supports it – and yet you act as if you had nothing to do with the whole thing! I cannot let that pass. If anyone is able to put forward any other short-term proposals, they should table them here as proposed amendments today or tomorrow. I am prepared to go along with that, but I have yet to hear any reasonable alternatives, and we have to be honest about it. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, that applies to you too, since you belong to this party as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be honest for once, and if a strategy is pursued which allows the small farmers to go to the wall – which is the message I heard, especially on the German side, from the Agriculture Council on Monday evening – my response is that it is simply not a strategy. When I hear the German Federal Chancellor's recent assertion that it is a question of large versus small, and the German Consumer Affairs Minister's announcement today that large farms also need to be given appropriate support, which is why she does not support any upper limit on the animal premiums, I have to ask: what on earth is going on here?</p>
<p class="contents">In the short term, we must take every possible measure to restore stability. The supplementary budget provides the right answers. We must debate the medium and long-term solutions in a calm and reasonable fashion. Ultimately, that is the only way to identify appropriate solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope others can learn from our experiences and maybe our mistakes as well. I think the most important lesson is that there is a need to take stringent measures from the outset, firstly, to prevent further outbreaks and, secondly, to ensure that consumer confidence increases.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless safety measures are dramatically increased we cannot succeed in restoring consumer confidence, which is critical in the long term to European beef markets. In the UK now our markets and beef consumption have returned to 1995 levels. However, to restore confidence, we really need to be clearly targeting our aid and we must encourage Member States to vigorously take up this aid, which to my understanding has not always been the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to address the issue that various people such as Mr Mulder and Mrs Haug have raised, namely whether the aid should be the traditional 70/30 split between the EU and the Member States or whether we should go for a 50/50 split.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, whilst I sympathise with the reasons behind what has been outlined by Mr Mulder and Mrs Haug, and I appreciate their serious concern about the level of funding being sufficient for the unidentified needs for the remainder of the year, it would be extremely difficult for this Parliament to go down this route because, firstly, the financial regulations state that 70/30 is the agreed split and anything new would actually require a change in the financial regulations and, secondly, speaking as a UK Member, I want to see parity, with other Member States being dealt with in exactly the same way as the UK. So, if we want to ensure fair play, it is important that we have the same split.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, if Parliament votes for this new approach the Council will have to have a second reading and this will only serve to prolong the process until a decision is reached, and this goes against our experience in the UK, which is that you must deal with things quickly and speedily to restore consumer confidence, which is vital to beef markets in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons I am against the rapporteur’s recommendation. I do not want to apportion blame about the crisis but I have similar concerns to those outlined by other Members about the approach and length of time it has taken the Commission to attempt to tackle BSE with rigour and determination. The Commission should have banned spinal cord from food and human consumption and animal feed once the disease was apparent in the UK. The Commission should be undertaking a full and immediate audit of control procedures to prevent contaminated cattle from crossing borders.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I would like to say that I support the request for the SAB and I think it is important we get Member States to take up this aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It literally means that EUR 700 million in EU funds is to go up in smoke, as this is the amount to be spent on beef that is at risk and that will have to be destroyed. The worst thing about all this is, however, that the BSE crisis is seriously threatening the equilibrium of the EU budget. Some of the expenditure in this supplementary budget is being financed on the rather optimistic supposition that considerable savings are to be had from the euro-dollar exchange rate. This is probably mostly wishful thinking. But the most serious aspect of the issue is that the margin for the Financial Perspective is in danger of being used up entirely. After the proposal has gone through, the margin will only be EUR 506 million, or just over 1% of the total amount in that category. Nevertheless, we may assume with a degree of certainty that the demand for beef exported outside the EU will rocket.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumption has dropped in many of the large countries, which is reflected in increased stocks. As, at least for a few years, we can expect consumption to fall permanently, we should aim to release these stocks for export. Within the framework of the current Financial Perspective, there is no longer any scope for doing this. As a result, there is fear that other agricultural expenditure will be cut. That might well mean a cut in income for individual farmers, in other words, individual farmers will have to pay for the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to remember that the BSE crisis was not caused by farmers. They used the legally approved feed in good faith, although it turned out to be toxic.

They are simply part of normal business and we should not be perturbed by the amount of money involved. The real question is what it is used for and why it is necessary. And I say that if the European Parliament had had codecision rights in respect of Agenda 2000, a different decision would have been taken in Berlin. For example, we would have meadows instead of maize, we would have suspended intervention, all of which was proposed by the Commission and by Parliament. We would have linkage with the working costs, we would have the 1990s threshold, which applies in conjunction with the working costs. We would have adopted all these measures which are now back on the agenda, and, Mr Böge, we would then have something which we genuinely could call Agenda 2000 and progress. But now, under your influence, in which I also include COPA and the broad spectrum of the Christian Democrats, it is precisely these reforms which have been blocked. That is the major problem: we are having to address this issue again today and spend money on a policy which has gone in quite the wrong direction.</p>
<p class="contents">If we take Mr Fischler's proposals, it is the destruction, not the slaughtering, which is the problem. We in Europe will then feature in pictures all over the world which show the slaughtering campaigns and destruction. From a cultural point of view, and in terms of Europe's cultural claim, we cannot sustain that for very long. It would undoubtedly be sensible, Mrs Haug, to agree on the slaughtering of young cattle and calves in this context. It is not a matter of a ‘Herod premium’, but of ensuring that these new-born calves do not develop into massive bulls, but go on the market, after the appropriate tests and removal of any unsafe material, as quality meat. That was Mrs Schreyer's proposal. I regret that the proposal did not come from Mr Fischler and I hope that we will be able to follow that up later when we discuss his 7-point plan. In other words, it depends on how we spend the money. As the budget spokesman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists has pointed out, we have often reimbursed money in the past. But that is not the problem: the key issue is whether there will be enough money left over to set a new course in our agricultural policy. I can see the following danger: if we pay for the special measures required to deal with this crisis out of the normal budget, then when we do want to set a new course, the funds will no longer be available. The emergency measures will no longer be necessary, but the money will have been spent. So I think it is quite acceptable for the Member States and the EU to cover the costs here as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like those responsible for this crisis – who are not found in the political arena but in the private sphere – to pay into a compensation fund for those who have been affected, i.e. the farmers and those who have suffered human tragedy, as is the case in Great Britain …</p>

However, this disease affecting livestock in Europe is not the result of a curse. Cows did not go mad because they ate grass, or even smoked it. Cows have gone mad because they have been given a dose of politics. Cows have gone mad because they have had to swallow the common agricultural policy that the European Commission has forced down their throats for nigh on thirty years.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, this intensive policy and these animal feeds are the result of the decisions taken by Member States and the Commission, particularly, let us admit it, by the French Government, by the French agricultural unions, why not admit that as well, but also by the Commission, particularly in the international agreements which favoured European cereal producers over American-grown soya bean meal.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, we may need to have the courage to confront European opinion head on. Europe is guilty. Europe must make amends. To my mind, the taxpayer in France or any Member State should not have to pay twice for this. The European Union does not actually levy taxes. When it is brave enough to levy taxes, it will perhaps be able to take on its own policies, but Europe does not levy taxes and there is no question of taxpayers paying twice over, firstly through the Community budget and then through their national budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, nonetheless, utterly inconceivable that the European Union should be splitting up, essentially in the rift between the European project, with a monopoly on great prospects and plans for the future and the nation states or Member States which are being turned into leper colonies designed to contain European policies, as they are fulfilling the same function as the pesthouses of the Middle Ages, right down to the quarantines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree that the Supplementary and Amending Budget No 1/2001, which makes EUR 971 million available for additional costs arising from the BSE crisis, should be endorsed by Parliament. I nevertheless feel that the following observations need to be made about this proposal:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the EUR 971 million that have now been made available are necessary but they are not sufficient. In any event, we will see.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the BSE crisis, the real problems faced by producers, the collapse of consumer confidence and food safety requirements connected with protecting public health deserve more than vague answers and the postponement of solutions, however obvious conflicts of interest or budgetary problems may be. The sensitivity of the situation calls for rapid, full answers. Let us not, therefore, allow this climate of crisis to continue. This issue needs, as it has needed in the past, to come off the agenda. Let us find the courage to draw a veil over it, since this will help to restore the confidence of Europe’s citizens. Let us not confuse the current emergency with the essential review of production methods to be promoted through the reform of the common agricultural policy. This reform is necessary but it must not be carried out hastily, which would be the case if it were carried out in the midst of a crisis or if it were guided exclusively by financial considerations or national interests. These factors would, in fact, condemn the reform from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, what has been said demonstrates the need for the European Parliament to gain real decision-making power on all agricultural expenditure, including expenditure that falls under subcategory 1-A. It also shows the need for an extension of the nucleus of expenditure that falls under subcategory 1-B. In this way, the legitimate interest of Europe’s citizens will be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, what is at stake clearly, in my opinion, calls for this issue to be addressed fully and in depth at the Stockholm Council, and I hope that this will be done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But when I say 'the European Union', I do not mean the Commission or the Council or Parliament but I am essentially referring to our Member States as well, which make up the EU. Please do not misunderstand me: no one can point the finger at anyone else and pretend that he himself has had nothing to do with this whole sorry affair. The European agricultural policy in its current form, with all its weaknesses and errors, was created and shaped by all the Member States and parties of all political hues. So we must all join together to change it.</p>
<p class="contents">That does not alter the fact that at present, we face a situation in which we have to manage the crisis on the old playing field in line with the old rules. We cannot ignore this fact. As yet, we have no new rules and we have no reformed agricultural policy, although that is what we are calling for. Of course, Mr Ferber is right when he distinguishes between short, medium and long-term issues. That is quite correct. But anyone who is now asked for funding and support for the expenditure necessary to manage the crisis has not only a right but also a duty to call for the much-needed reforms. We have a programme which runs until 2006, with a review in 2002. But we already know that the review will reveal that there is a need for a fundamental reform of the agricultural policy. So our vote in favour of this supplementary budget is a vote coupled with a clear statement. And we will remind you of that very soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the preventive measures that have been put in place such as the ban on meat-and-bone meal should, on scientific evidence, see the elimination of BSE and its threat to human health.</p>
<p class="contents">The testing of all animals over 30 months and the removal of specified risk material should go a long way in restoring consumer confidence. For example, in Ireland, out of 48 000 cattle tested there has not been one reactor to the BSE test, and to me that is an indication that the disease is confined to other animals in the suckler cow and dairy herds.</p>
<p class="contents">My concern is that it will take some time through natural wastage to effect their removal and I would ask the Commissioner to examine ways of expediting this process. The emergence of BSE in the older animal group tends to undermine consumer confidence even if they are not destined for the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the Commissioner on the need to rebalance the market. The ‘purchase for destruction’ scheme may be necessary in the short term but it is immoral and certainly alien to the ethos of farming.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the Commission again to examine the possibilities and its policy in relation to food aid. There are a lot of people who believe, Commissioner, that something more positive could be done with this quality meat product. I caution against panic measures in relation to the long-term future of Europe’s beef industry. We must be optimistic even in the face of crisis and plan for a viable future, albeit within a new framework, in relation to production at farm level.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, from an Irish perspective, I believe that any attempt to reduce the size of the beef herd would be contrary to our national interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should just like to make, as would the Members of my group, a few comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, my first comment is to reiterate that not so long ago, you proposed a review of the Financial Perspective to increase external expenditure and the ceiling of heading 4, which certainly was a requirement and we agree with you here, and to do this by lowering the ceiling of agricultural spending in heading 1. If we had not supported you on that issue, it would be extremely difficult for you to propose the SAB that you put before us today.</p>
<p class="contents">You should, therefore, acknowledge that we have been more cautious and careful than you have. We think that every sinner should be allowed to reform rather than being put to death, and so we welcome your conversion.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment is that we obviously need to totally divorce the problems of a complete reform of the common agricultural policy from the problem we are faced with now. Today, our house is on fire. We must, therefore, do everything we can to put this fire out. When your house is going up in smoke, you do not start to question the quality of the building that you are trying to protect – you start by putting out the fire. So, let us put aside the problems of reforming the agricultural policy and concentrate on the urgent issues in hand. That is not all, however.</p>
<p class="contents">Listening to Mrs Haug, Mr Abitbol and other speakers, I am struck by the general challenge launched on the CAP. Yet, I do not think that it can be said that it is because the CAP is what it is that there is this specific medical and veterinary problem, unless one has a slightly theological or fatalistic vision. There is a serious veterinary problem and a specific medical problem, which is the spread of the disease from livestock to humans. This has given rise to a whole raft of issues, but this could have happened, for example, in the case of foot-and-mouth disease, if we now discovered – God forbid – that foot-and-mouth can be spread to humans. We should not be like the Prophet Philippulus, the Tintin and Milou cartoon character, who walks along beating a gong saying “Retribution is nigh.” That is not the problem that we face.</p>
<p class="contents">My last comment is to mention the problem of how the burden should be shared, either 50/50 or 70/30. I believe that it would be truly paradoxical for us to reduce the need for Community solidarity at the very time when this disease and the problems that it creates for farmers are becoming a problem that affects the entire Community. This would be an absolute contradiction, which is why we do not support Mr Mulder and his friends on the proposal before us.</p>

<p class="contents">Instead, I would like to take this opportunity to ask you to reflect on what I believe are two extremely relevant points which featured in the amendments tabled in the Committee on Budgets in the context of this debate. Firstly, the obligatory costs. As we are all aware, Parliament does not have much power when it comes to these costs, which include agriculture. It is the Council which has the last word, for the CAP has always been synonymous with the European Community and the now the European Union. I feel that the time has come to move on and to grant this Chamber greater powers: we have been elected by the European citizens and, as such, we have the duty to represent their interests in all fields. As part of the budgetary authority, we should have the right to exert weighty influence on all budgetary matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the splitting of the costs between the Member States and the Union. The Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party has tabled a series of amendments on this point, seeking, as you are aware, to revise the intervention percentages to achieve a 50/50 split between the Union and the Member States. I do not feel that this would be the right thing to do, and I will tell you why. In the first place, given the difficulties the political world is currently experiencing as a result of the BSE crises, such a decision would appear in the citizens' eyes to indicate withdrawal from the problem by the European institutions. In other words, the Union would soon be accused of being ready to intervene to ban State aid or set milk quotas, but just as ready to wash its hands of crises in the moment of need. Take heed: when I say citizens I am not just protecting the farmers, who have been directly hit by the crisis, but also and above all the individual consumer who has, quite frankly, been in a state of terror for months now over a situation which is getting worse every day. That is who we must protect, and it is certainly not by offloading the financial burden of the situation onto the Member States that we will do so. Secondly, if we were to support this political position we would be encouraging the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy, which would be an absurd thing to do at a time when the post-Nice debate certainly does not provide for the cancellation of Community policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will take time to restore confidence. One of the reasons is that BSE is only the latest development. What is also at issue, of course, is the long-distance transportation of livestock and a good deal else which will have to be changed as part of a transformation of the whole of the EU’s common agricultural policy. For all these reasons, far-reaching measures will be required which will have to be effective in the very long term and on several different levels if it is going to be possible to restore confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, I think the Commission’s proposal is a good one. It is dramatic, but it is nonetheless sensible and balanced. Above all, it is necessary. The Commission talks about getting production down and thus avoiding over-production and meat mountains. A transitional period will be required, but this is a justified aspiration and will pave the way for an acceptance of principles oriented more towards the market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also talks about an overhaul of the common agricultural policy in 2002. I think it ought to be possible to begin this work no later than this year. If the EU is to be competitive, there must first of all be changes to the common agricultural policy, even though that will obviously require a transitional period of a number of years. We cannot go on producing for meat mountains. Instead, producing for consumption is what it is about.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is that of whether the Commission’s proposal is enough to restore confidence. It is probably not. That means that more will need to be done. I am less impressed by some of the points in the Commission’s proposal, for example concerning the distribution of costs between the EU and the Member States – at present 70 per cent for the EU and 30 per cent for the Member States. That is a part of the legal basis, but nonetheless something which needs to be changed as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">There are at least two reasons why the costs ought instead to be distributed on a 50/50 basis. Firstly, there are budgetary reasons concerned with making it possible to tackle the whole of this operation successfully. More than 40 per cent of the EU’s budgetary resources now already go on agriculture. It is impossible to go beyond that level. Secondly, another form of cost distribution is, in actual fact, only fair. We have for a long time been familiar with the problems and the reasons for these. Nonetheless, different countries have done a great many different things, and those which have invested to avoid this crisis have themselves borne the costs. It is only fair that those who have done little, and perhaps in certain cases nothing at all, should now themselves bear a larger part of those costs which are necessary in order to overcome this crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We accept that we are dealing here with a genuine budgetary emergency. We need this extra EUR 900 million in order to implement the plan which the Commission has drawn up to combat BSE. Above all, we must make our cattle farmers and public aware that the European Union is a common solution to their problems. We would do irreversible harm to the process of European integration if we did not find a common response to this general crisis, which is the first truly general crisis in the Union. And this response must be first and foremost a financial one. Later on we can discuss when we must apply all the principles of Agenda 2000 in the field of agriculture, but now – and I say this again – is not the time to be talking about the future of the common agricultural policy. Now we have to offer real responses, financial responses. We have to help European cattle farming with hard euros. This is not the time to be discussing cofinancing rates, and there is therefore a majority in this House which, in principle, rejects the budgetary amendments to the Haug report, despite the opinion of certain people such as Mr Stenmarck.</p>

Agenda 2000 establishes a multiannual budgetary framework, which has been approved unanimously in the Council and by a sufficient majority in the European Parliament. Would this not therefore be the time to say why the real budget for 2001 is, by a considerable percentage, less than that approved in the Berlin Financial Perspective for this year? I would also like to say that perhaps the true financial debate does not lie in seeking an impossible revision of the Financial Perspective approved in Berlin, but in complying with the budget that was actually promised there. I believe that that would be a truly European response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With this increase, the budgetary margin still available for agricultural expenditure within the CAP will be practically exhausted. There is therefore a clear need to initiate the debate on financing the BSE crisis in the years to come. This debate must, however, be conducted methodically and at the right pace and include an overall evaluation of European farming, the current state of the rural world and of how the CAP has responded to this situation. I feel that the CAP must be reconsidered in order to provide the appropriate responses to what is today known as the ‘European agricultural model’. It will also be necessary to amend the drafting of its objectives within the Treaties. The CAP has today largely outgrown its origins, objectives and implementation tools.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it would be unacceptable, however, to use the excuse of the BSE crisis to force through reforms that everyone concerned wishes to see. This is what appears to be happening as a result of the amendments now being tabled by the Commission, which seek or propose to amend the bases of cofinancing for support measures for the beef sector. We all know that some Member States want to see the CAP renationalised, but I think this would be a terrible mistake that would cause the European Union to move backwards instead of forwards. Such a move would penalise the poorer countries particularly harshly since farmers in those countries would receive less favourable treatment than their colleagues in other parts of the Community. I do accept the need for debate on this issue, however, although it must be conducted in the context of an overall assessment of the CAP and other Community policies, not in this opportunistic way, taking advantage of a crisis to impose national self-interest when what is required is a Community response showing solidarity with those who are in difficulty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to accept that we will have to incinerate a great many of the older cattle in order to restore consumer confidence. It has the advantage of taking away some of the production when those cattle are incinerated, so I support the majority of this budget going towards the incineration of older cattle.</p>
<p class="contents">As we move forward to reforming the CAP – and we all accept that it has to be reformed – we must not do this with a gun to our head. We must do this in a calm way. It is no good just blaming the large farmer versus the small farmer. It is not as simple as that. It is about intensive production and this does not always take place on the large farms.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot in Europe look only at the way we produce our food under the CAP. We must also look at food imports from outside the European Union. It is madness for us to put our house in order and then to see food coming into the European Union that does not meet the same safety standards as ours. We have to be very concerned about this but we do not want to take too negative a view as regards consumption. Consumption can return, and it has returned in the UK. It has been a painful process, but now is not the time to make a judgment on exactly what in six months’ time the consumption will be in Europe. If the safety measures are put in place, if confidence can return, then the consumption can rise again quite dramatically. That will be the time to reform the CAP and make sure we get it right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I support the idea of the 70/30 ratio, as we have had in the past. I want to point out that there are people in this Parliament who think that, because we reduce the European budget and force the Member States to take up the cost, we are saving the European taxpayers from something. Nothing could be further from the truth. The question is whether the money is paid through the European Union or through the national governments. In any case, the crisis is here and it will cost the European taxpayers. It is not the appropriate strategy for the Members of this House to recommend that we should pass our responsibilities on to the national governments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to underline the fact again that in this European Union we seem to think, when we introduce a supplementary budget of this size, that it is a major burden on the taxpayers of Europe. It is actually a relatively small amount. The budget of the European Union is a little over 1%. Now the Member States which fight hardest and most vociferously against increasing that budget are the ones that take 47-50% and spend it themselves. So the European Union takes 1%, of which in the past, agriculture took 80%. Today agriculture takes about 40%, so as a percentage of GNP the budget of the European Union takes a lot less from the European tax-payers than it did 15 to 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point I should like to make is that so many people, by connecting these outbreaks of disease with the common agricultural policy, tend to somehow blame the CAP for the problem. The truth is that the European consumer never had cheaper food and never had safer food. The evidence for that is in the longevity and the health of people. Even in the poorest regions of this Union and in the poorest cities and towns we do not see hungry children any more because this Union has guaranteed and supplied cheap food of a high quality. We should remember that.</p>
<p class="contents">So what are the solutions to the problem? I would have preferred to hear the Commissioner plan for what consumption will be for the next three or four years and take immediate measures to reduce production. I do not agree with my Irish colleague, Mr Hyland, that it is in anybody’s interest to produce something for destruction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, agricultural policy has now been at the forefront of public debate for weeks. This is a challenge and an opportunity for this policy area, for it is clear that there must now be a debate about our agricultural policy expectations. Is it only about quantity? To what extent is quality also an issue? How vigorously must we pursue the other goals which we demand of agriculture as regards landscape preservation, culture, animal welfare, and environmental protection?</p>
<p class="contents">During our debate, we have also heard from many speakers who have made it clear that previous proposals, which were supported by the Commission and the European Parliament, focused very strongly on these goals, but were unfortunately rejected by the Council. I hope that the Council now recognises that it can no longer ignore this debate, but must tackle it head on. But of course I must also point out that while we are focusing the debate on these objectives, we must not neglect to take the action necessary to overcome the current crisis. We will not improve the situation if we fail to take decisions; on the contrary, this would simply make matters worse.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission faced up to its responsibility to make proposals as early as November/December, when the second BSE crisis broke out. We are now securing the funding for the decisions which were adopted back in December. EUR 971 million is a very substantial supplementary budget, and I am most grateful to Parliament for approving it. The additional EUR 971 million means that in total, more than EUR 7 billion will be made available to the beef industry this year. This represents an increase of more than 50% on last year's figure. I emphasise this point to make it clear that the European Union is not abandoning its farmers in the current crisis; on the contrary, we are spending a significant proportion of our budget in this area and I think it is important to underline that fact again here.</p>
<p class="contents">But I also agree with all those who say that spending EUR 6 billion on subsidising production and allocating a further one billion to deal with production – in the sense that we are destroying part of it – also proves that there is an urgent need for action and a new direction in this area. Let me explain once again what the supplementary budget will be used for: a proportion, i.e. 33 million, will go towards funding additional BSE tests, a significant share will be used for the buying-in of beef in public stocks, and the majority will be allocated to cover the 'purchase for destruction' scheme for cattle. It is important to make this clear. But the money will go to the farmers, as partial compensation for their revenue shortfall.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also remind you that we still have very different systems in the beef industry. If the price falls below a specific margin, the meat from male cattle at least, must be compulsorily purchased by the European Union. And what about the ethical issues involved? Of course it is sad that we are currently allocating EUR 700 million to the destruction of cattle. It is a sad day for agricultural policy, and a sad day for the taxpayer. But I must also point out that there really is no alternative. We are not simply promoting a slaughter programme: what we have is a necessary measure because far less slaughtering is taking place than usual.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say a few words about food aid as a possible alternative. For food aid to be provided in the form of beef, the recipient country must have closed refrigeration circuits. You cannot simply load beef on to a ship and send it to a region in crisis somewhere in the world. You will just end up with a shipload of rotten meat which is completely unusable. These are factors which have to be considered. The European Union's experience has shown that the regional market was then partly destroyed, which must be a warning to us not to make the same mistakes twice.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say once more: it is clear, of course, that what is on the table is a package of emergency measures for which funding is now being secured. Nonetheless, we are already discussing the further steps to be taken, and are doing so in the Agriculture Council as well. We will be discussing the second package this week. It includes measures which go beyond the current policy of eradicating the problem. Of course, we can, and must, discuss whether further measures are necessary. But we have to agree something at this stage. And I would like to say that I am rather bemused by some of the newspaper reports about the package of measures proposed by Mr Fischler. These reports seem to bear very little relation to the measures put forward. For example, I read about a mass slaughter programme which has allegedly been ordered by Mr Fischler. But I should point out yet again that this is an offer from the European Union to buy up meat for which there is currently no market. We are saying that we are only prepared to do so with cofinancing. A proportion must also be funded by the Member States. Given the indignant reactions, even though there is a safety net wherever it is clear that there will be compulsory purchase by the European Union, I cannot help but feel on occasion that there is some deliberate mischief-making going on.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the question of the further measures which can be adopted as a result of the crisis. I think it is a good thing that so many proposals have been tabled. I also think it is right to give more thought to other options, such as an early marketing premium. After all, the problem is partly resolved if an animal goes to market at an earlier stage in the rearing process and therefore has less weight. And it is also important, in my view, to consider uncoupling the premiums from output, to ensure that the premium schemes take greater account of the other agricultural policy objectives. But let us be clear on one thing: what we are doing today is securing the funding for a package of measures which were necessary as an initial response to an emergency. When we come to debate the second package of measures, we can examine the issue of crisis management. But at that stage, of course, the necessary steps should have been taken, and we must then open the third phase with the <span class="italic">mid-term review,</span> in order to ensure that the premium schemes take greater account of the other agricultural policy objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude with a few words about foot-and-mouth disease, which has rightly been mentioned by several Members of this House. The crisis in the United Kingdom has already reached major proportions. Due to the incubation period, it will become apparent in the next few days whether the disease has spread to the continent. We must be prepared for this possibility. As budget specialists, we must also be prepared for the fact that we may face major problems in the future. And finally, we must also recognise that we may not have reached the lowest point in the agricultural crisis yet. Of course, I hope that this is not the case, but we must be prepared for this eventuality. So it is even more important to manage the crisis in a rational way, but also to adopt a course which leads to our desired goals: namely to combine agricultural policy goals with consumer protection, animal welfare, and environmental protection objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
