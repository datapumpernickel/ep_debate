<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Randzio-Plath (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, the directive sets out to identify and prevent subsidies that distort competition. To this end, it proposes to require public undertakings, and private undertakings that perform public tasks, to carry out separate accounting procedures, recording separately the reserved and the competitive spheres of the business. The legal basis for the directive is Article 86(3), and the Commission is therefore authorised to issue the directive itself. In fact this is now out of step with the spirit of the time, and with what we understand by European legislation, and must be changed. But today’s debate is to be welcomed with open arms because it exemplifies the new form of transparency in the Commission’s legislative work in areas where it has supervisory powers, and also bears witness to the interest Commissioner Monti and his offices take in the opinion of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The businesses which the directive covers have special or exclusive rights or provide services of general economic interest. As such, the possibility exists that cross-subsidies are provided, and also that complaints about cross-subsidies will ensue. Thousands of businesses will be affected. It seems debatable as to whether they will actually consider the burden the directive imposes to be commensurate with its aims. The majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has wholeheartedly endorsed this measure because there is a need for more transparency within the internal market. The whole committee would agree with this, even if the rapporteur represented the minority view in some areas. It is doubtful as to whether the measure really seems suited to following up suspicions concerning competition-distorting subsidies, particularly as it fails to provide any harmonised internal accounting procedures at European level.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I am formulating these doubts so as to afford the Commission the opportunity to dispel some of them in a concrete and constructive manner at the revision stage. I have already mentioned that the Commission is expecting complaints about cross-subsidies, and has actually already dealt with complaints in the past. However, it has also been apparent in the past that the Commission has always made provision for sector-specific regulations, which cover a variety of regulatory areas. Unfortunately, it did not continue down this path. Of course, one could say that it would be easier if we now had a uniform regulation for the remaining areas, and indeed that was the view taken by the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. However, I also believe that any directive should be assessed according to its efficiency, careful targeting, precision and subtlety, so as to enable the Commission to carry out its supervisory function to optimum effect. </p>
<p class="contents">There was a further problem with the discussions on this directive in that the Commission failed to emphasise that, under Article 295 of the EC Treaty, it is entirely the Member States’ responsibility to determine what services are of general economic interest and how they should be provided. I ask myself whether the Commission’s ulterior motive, in failing to emphasise this in the transparency directive, is to tamper with this sovereign definition by slow degrees, thereby undermining the principle of subsidiarity. It is for the Member States to decide whether supplying television transmitters constitutes a public task and, as such, whether or not every single transmission is included. It is not appropriate for the EU to intervene here. In this respect, there should be another reference in the text of the directive to the Amsterdam Protocol, because this established that it is the responsibility of the Member States to establish the financial and organisational structures for public service broadcasting corporations and their different activities. Aid for fulfilment of public tasks is expressly permitted, and this was the position adopted by the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. However, broadcasting corporations may not receive state aid where they operate outside their public remit.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">And so the Commission must, as a matter of principle, clarify that under no circumstances will it cast doubt on the meaning of ‘services of general economic interest’ per se. It must make it clear that the draft directive does not constitute a further attack on the system of public undertakings. Needless to say, the competition rules must be adhered to by all. Indeed it is important and right for the competition rules to be applied effectively and fairly and for cross-subsidies that go against the purpose of aid to be prevented. However, competition rules are not an end in themselves but the means to an end of undisrupted operation of a social market economy in the internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Peijs (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Article 86 of the Treaty captures the very essence of the resolution. Paragraph 1 stipulates that in the case of public undertakings and undertakings to which Member States grant special or exclusive rights, Member States shall neither enact nor maintain in force any measure contrary to the rules contained in this Treaty. Paragraph 2 adds, in summary, that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest shall be subject to the rules contained in this Treaty. It is up to the Commission to monitor the observation of this Article and to provide fitting directives or decisions to the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">The amendment to the directive to which this resolution pertains must enable the Commission to carry out this task more effectively, which is certainly necessary given the ever growing liberalisation of recent years. Public undertakings and former public undertakings increasingly embrace the commercial world where they, partly with government funding, engage in competition with private undertakings, i.e. their own citizens. </p>
<p class="contents">Let it be clear, then, that the much desired level playing field no longer exists. The present situation promotes money wasting, distorts international trade and, as such, forms a threat to the internal market. It is surely only logical and reasonable that public undertakings, at the time when they enter into the market, should abide by the same rules as private undertakings. As a means of guaranteeing a level playing field, the Commission has decided that undertakings with a net turnover in excess of EUR 40 million should keep separate accounts which should illustrate the different activities, the costs and profits pertaining to each of the activities, the method according to which costs and profit are accounted for and the way in which the net profits generated by each activity are used. These are the considerations with regard to the proposal. In short, what is the origin of investments in the commercial field?</p>
<p class="contents">Initially, the Commission proposal met with a great deal of resistance from EMAC and the Commission. In actual fact, there was only a handful of PPE-DE Members and the Liberal Group who were in favour of the planned transparency. This caused me concern. We, as MEPs, are elected to exercise democratic control over the executive, in this case the Commission. The Commission is, in turn, responsible for observing Article 86. We thus have the duty to ensure that the Commission carries out the assigned task properly but, at the same time, some of us would prevent it from doing exactly that. I wonder how we must come across in a situation like this. We make it abundantly clear that we strive for fair competition and utilisation of our internal market but, when the chips are down, we are once again looking solely after our own interests. </p>
<p class="contents">In the report on the adoption of the single currency by Greece, I blame the governments for not doing what needs to be done. Those against this directive are thus giving the governments a helping hand. As Parliament, we cannot do anything else but to ensure that the markets operate clearly and transparently and that we do not give preferential treatment to certain undertakings and not others. </p>
<p class="contents">This directive may seem tedious, but is, in reality, the acid test.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think she has managed to come up with a reasonable balance within our committee in what almost became, on occasions, an ideological debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In your proposal, Commissioner, you quite rightly exclude a number of sectors, and we can only be pleased at this. Secondly, as our rapporteur pointed out, I should like to draw attention to the fact that the jurisdiction of Member States in this field must not be disregarded. At the present time, there is no definition of services of general economic interest at European Union level. We must therefore bring subsidiarity into play, and we are well aware that in such areas, national sensibilities may be expressed in diverse ways. I can therefore only urge you, Commissioner, to show as much drive and determination in making full use of all the terms of the Treaty, particularly those which, following the Treaty of Amsterdam, grant you new scope for action, especially with a view to defining the ability to provide services of general economic interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge Mrs Peijs to read again the latest version of the Treaty with regard to what she considers to be the last word on the law on competition within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">My third observation, Commissioner, is on public broadcasting services. Once again, I cannot ignore what we incorporated into our Treaty when we amended it in Amsterdam. This sector is very clearly covered by specific conditions. This shows the determination of the Member States to treat this sector as a sector in its own right falling outside the rules of competition which exist in other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that the proposals on transparency that you are putting forward cannot be applied to that sector under the same conditions. I think it would be rather difficult in such a sector to implement the notion of separate accounting systems making it possible to draw a distinction between competitive activities and public service activities in the broadcasting sector, especially as, I might mention in passing, there is no single harmonised European accounting system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We want to thank Mrs Randzio-Plath for cooperating so well. </p>
<p class="contents">State aid distorts competition and is unfair to both consumers and companies. In principle, the Treaty prohibits all types of state aid, including cross-subsidies. The Treaty does not, however, prohibit the existence of public undertakings providing services in the public interest. Whatever one may think about this, it is for the Member States themselves to define what is meant by services in the public interest. The Member States should not, however, themselves decide what kinds of aid they will be granting these undertakings. </p>
<p class="contents">The Court of First Instance in Luxembourg stated as late as last week that state support for TV and radio companies may <span class="italic">only</span> be provided once the Commission has said that this is compatible with the Treaty. The rules must be applied in the same way to all parties. All aid which is not used to finance services in the public interest is prohibited and is to be opposed. State radio stations and TV companies now often provide services which are outside the scope of what we call services in the public interest. An example is Internet connection. Those resources which the State has injected into companies to finance their basic activities ought not, of course, to be used to finance the provision of Internet connections. In that case, competition is distorted, to the disadvantage both of consumers and of private companies. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal requires companies to openly account for the resources provided to them as public undertakings and for how these have been used. Companies must also show what costs they have, where their income comes from and how this is derived from their various activities. These are very reasonable demands. Both these obligations are simple means of upholding the rules governing relations between private and public undertakings. This is important for the purpose of maintaining proper rules in the internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I should like to thank Commissioner Monti for having had the courtesy to consult the European Parliament. A Commission directive has been referred to us, even though, I believe, it is not legally mandatory to consult Parliament, although the subject is clearly a crucial one. This leads me to reiterate the hope that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will propose subjecting all legislation on competition policy to the codecision procedure, thereby enabling us legally to work on a more equal footing.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns the actual purpose of this proposed directive. It has an extremely specific aim, which is to prevent, subject to monitoring by the Commission, any legitimate public aid to services of general interest being misappropriated to the benefit of activities which are themselves open to competition. Having said that, the problem is by no means easy to solve, as the previous speaker made clear. Indeed he states – and I would be curious to know Mr Monti’s response to this – that Internet connection does not, for example, come under the heading of universal service. I think that this runs quite counter to the objectives of the European Council in Lisbon, and that it is necessary, on the contrary, to have a comprehensive vision of universal service. One might go so far as to imagine, even if this is a matter for subsidiarity, that the Community as such should at least define the minimum standards of what the universal service may be. Otherwise we are heading towards a relatively chaotic situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I should like to know the Commission’s reaction to Recital No 4 of our report, in which the rapporteur and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs effectively ask the Commission to specify how important it considers services of general interest to be. I await the Commission’s response on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and finally, there is one amendment, Amendment No 3, which is explicitly intended to exclude the broadcasting sector from the scope of the proposed directive. I think this amendment is an improvement on the current text. Paragraph 6 is a masterpiece of diplomatic language but is relatively incomprehensible. I should therefore like to see the Commission expressing its support for Amendment No 3 as proposed in plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The tenor of this report relates to analysing which public undertakings can receive financial aid from the Member State governments operating within the EU. There are clearly opposing views in this House on this subject matter. There are those who would like to see undertakings which are only in direct competition with the private sector to be subject to the terms of this directive, whilst others would propose that public undertakings which are clearly of a general interest could fall within the exceptions in this directive. It can be said that the right reserved to Member States to determine what constitutes service of general interest is preserved, and the one area that I would like to deal with specifically is the question of broadcasting.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind this House that the protocol attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam of the EU recognises that the system of public broadcasting within Member States of the EU is directly related to the democratic, social and cultural needs of our society. We must ensure that with the advance of new technology the public service broadcast ethos is not undermined. I would argue that it is more essential, now that we have a strong public service broadcasting sector, to ensure the maintenance of that democratic, social and cultural sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, this is why I believe the role of public service broadcasters must be maintained, and while I welcome the fact that the right must be reserved to Member States to determine what constitutes ...</p>

That is nothing new. This directive has been in force since 1980 and it is certainly high time that it was revised, because it is out-of-date in many aspects on account of the liberalisation process. But the question is this: if this fundamental amendment is approved, are the Commission’s proposals heading in the right direction?</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I intend to raise several points and would ask the Commissioner to examine and take account of them once again when it comes to producing the final version of the transparency directive: Firstly, the exemption regulation for small- and medium-sized enterprises, which, since 1980, has included those businesses having a turnover of less than EUR 40 million. Since then, the turnover indices have increased many times over. It is therefore necessary, and would make good sense, to raise the threshold to EUR 100 million. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the recently introduced balance limit for public credit institutions of EUR 800 million, which did not exist before. These credit institutions were completely excluded hitherto. EUR 800 million is nothing at all! In my previous national parliament electoral constituency of 70 000 inhabitants, the savings bank, which only operates on a regional basis, actually had a balance of EUR 1.5 billion! It would not be right to create a new opportunity for the Commission to step in.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: separate accounting. Hitherto, it was only the Member States who were obliged to report on their financial activities. Now the undertakings themselves are going to have to produce separate accounts. Surely this is motivated purely by the fact that the Commission would like another instrument of control.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly: the definition of services of general economic interest. These services will only be excluded – just listen to this – if the undertakings are given special or exclusive rights in an open, transparent and non-discriminatory procedure for an appropriate period of time, i.e. after a tender procedure. What about the social services? What about the traditionally evolved social activities? Professor Monti, I do not want to give the Commission carte blanche to be able to interfere in anything and everything. We trust you not to want to control everything, Professor Monti, but I very much doubt as to whether we can say the same of every last official! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This directive sets out to identify and prevent subsidies which distort competition. In order to do this, the directive proposes to require public undertakings and private undertakings that perform public tasks to carry out separate accounting procedures. I obviously agree with the rapporteur that competition rules must be applied rigorously in order to prevent cross-subsidies that go against the purpose of the aid. However, in the sphere of public broadcasting it is essential to remember that, in accordance with the Amsterdam Protocol, in the system of public broadcasting in Member States, it is up to each Member State to specify the financial and organisational structure of public service broadcasting.</p>
<p class="contents">This has, as I said, been a difficult report; it has been fraught and often very tense in committee and, more specifically, at the committee votes. However, I believe the final outcome will work and is a practical and correct approach.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maes (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, despite this discussion in Parliament concerning the changes which the Commission would like to make to the directive on the transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings, we will not have much of a say in it because it will be the Commission, and the Commission only, that will make decisions without further involving the European Parliament or the Council, much to our regret. In our opinion, on the basis of its autonomous powers concerning competition policy, the Commission approaches some sectors from a purely economic angle without taking into consideration other social aspects. For example, in the dossier on financing public broadcasting, the Commission still overlooks the cultural aspects and the aspect of media-pluralism, to our mind. Admittedly, an exception is made but then this exception accommodates further exceptions. For example, it is very difficult for public broadcasting to survive in an increasingly commercialised environment. I am against the commercialisation of culture. In my opinion, culture is above these market laws. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has thus overstepped the mark. With this amendment to the directive, it is trying to change the Treaty of Amsterdam, namely the public broadcasting protocol which was attached to it. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the IGC should apply the normal legislative procedure for codecision by the Council and Parliament to general competition policy legislation. I can already tell you that I will be here once again when you produce a directive on film. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would particularly like to thank Parliament for the support it has shown for the Commission’s initiative and I welcome its approval of the steps to increase transparency in the use of public resources and thereby guarantee fair competition. You welcomed the Commission’s consultation of Parliament, despite the fact that it was not obliged to do this under its institutional statutes as Mr Jonckheer and other speakers recalled. Moreover, the way the debate went reassures me that it was useful for the Commission and in the best interests of the initiative for Parliament to be consulted. </p>
<p class="contents">As it stands, the directive on transparency gives the Commission the authority to carry out inquiries into financial relations between Member States and their public undertakings. In short, the draft amendment to the directive is intended to ensure the introduction of separate accounting procedures for specific types of firms. The firms affected by this measure are those which, on the one hand, provide services of general economic interest in exchange for various different types of compensation, which may be special dues or payments, and, on the other, also perform normal general activities, thereby operating in competition with other firms. Clearly, the profits generated by the continuation of reserved activities or by compensation provided for reasons of general interest or public service are not intended to finance competitive activities, and must therefore not give rise to internal subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in recent years, the Commission has had to examine a growing number of claims related precisely to such internal compensation. As Mrs Peijs mentioned, in the course of its inquiries, the Commission has had to examine these cases of internal compensation and it was frequently unable to obtain sufficient information regarding the costs and profits generated by the various activities. Therefore, the Commission now proposes to introduce a system of separate accounts for these types of companies which will allow them to perform their role as surety for competition properly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress that the obligation to keep separate accounts also benefits the Member States, in that it provides them with the necessary information in order to avoid granting state aid which does not comply with the Treaty and to notify the Commission of the aid envisaged. </p>
<p class="contents">The directive requires that companies which provide general services and which, at the same time, operate outside that public service mission, keep separate accounts. This requirement applies to both private and public companies. The directive does not apply to companies which only provide general services and do not carry on any other activity, nor does it require the separation of different activities which all come under the heading of general services.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, ladies and gentlemen, the directive is intended to make the areas around the line between services of general interest and other activities transparent with the minimum of disruption. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise the fact that the directive makes no changes either, of course, to the provisions of the Treaty on the awarding of general services, or to the awarding of the management of these services to specific companies. The directive lays down the principles for the introduction of greater transparency, although, in observance of the subsidiarity principle, it leaves the Member States free to adopt appropriate national measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to some of the comments made. Mr Jonckheer wondered whether Internet access was to be included in the universal service. On this point, I can only say that the last Telecommunications Council did hold a debate on this matter. </p>
<p class="contents">As regards the doubts expressed by the rapporteur, Mrs Randzio-Plath, I would briefly like to summarise them.<span class="bold"> </span>On the subject of the definition of general services, I would stress once again that the directive does not make any changes, it does not reduce the current competences of the Member States – Mrs Berès and Mr Langen – regarding the definition of public interest. This also applies to the public broadcasting sector, in respect of which the Amsterdam Protocol confirmed the competence of the Member States in the definition of the admission of public service. Mrs Berès, Mr Jonckheer, Mr Crowley, Mr Skinner and Mrs Maes remarked that it might be possible to exclude broadcasting. I have to say that this sector could well be among the fields where the directive is most frequently applied, where this directive on transparency is of most service, for, even taking the Amsterdam Protocol into account, of course, this nevertheless leaves the Commission with the task of verifying that aid granted for the provision of public services is not excessive in respect of the costs. A requirement for verification therefore remains, and this directive should be useful for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">The size of company is irrelevant, and I am now addressing Mr Langen <span class="italic">et al</span>: the EUR 40 million threshold excludes small- and medium-sized businesses. If we were to raise this threshold we would be excluding companies where, due to their size, we cannot suppose that the aid does not affect trade between Member States. In any case, in order to give an idea of the size, only 0.2% of all non-farming enterprises in the Community are above this threshold. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say – and it appears that this has been perfectly well understood by the Members of Parliament – that this directive is not in the slightest an attack on public companies. Quite the opposite, to be honest, I see it as a great show of support<span class="bold"> </span>for public companies. This is because it provides clarity and therefore does not expose public services to the attacks which would otherwise have been levelled at them. As Mr Olle Schmidt stressed, this transparency is essential not only for a proper application of competition policy but, indeed, if I may say so, it is also crucial for there to be a proper relationship between the authorities and the taxpayers, the citizens. </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that, although, as Mrs Peijs stressed, this directive may appear extremely tedious, it actually allows us to get to the heart of the issue, not only of competition but also of civil coexistence and economic democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
