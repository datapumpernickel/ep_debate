It is not clear whether the text submitted to the Turks at the time was the same as the one that had been accepted by the European Council in 1999. I should like to know the truth. I voted in favour of Turkey’s accession during the vote in December 2004, out of respect for those who campaign for human rights. Since that vote, there has been no end to the provocations on the part of the Turks. The brutal repression by the police during the demonstration of women on 8 March 2005, the denial of the Armenian genocide, the attitude towards the Kurdish people and the non-recognition of Cyprus lead me to vote against the start of the negotiations. I question whether Turkey’s membership will not be the outcome of US pressure and of the economic motives of certain European governments. We need to see acts on the part of the Turkish Government, proving its willingness to comply with the rules of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is altogether alarming to witness these ‘European’ elected representatives compromise themselves by telling lies, acting disgracefully and giving in. Is it a matter of pleasing a certain internationalist pseudo-elite, of protecting a few obscure economic interests or, indeed, of giving in to the political will of the United States?</p>
<p class="contents">From a Machiavellian viewpoint, can this kind of attitude guarantee effectively that such and such an ‘enlightened conservative’ or such and such a ‘progressive’ will reap the lucrative benefits of re-election? The reality stems more from the fact that these ‘representatives’ do not listen to their voters but scorn them instead. European public opinion clearly says ‘NO’ to Turkey’s membership. It would, in actual fact, be totally irresponsible for an Asian country which is, moreover, poor and with a Muslim culture, to join an unstable Union that has an uncertain institutional and economic future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not enough for Turkey to recognise Cyprus, an occupied European territory, in order to be able to join the Union. Turkey must not join the European Union quite simply because it is not a European country.

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, on the eve of the 3 October deadline – the date on which the Council must reach a decision about the opening of the accession negotiations – we are far short of the target.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, Turkey is digging in its heels and even becoming more radical as regards at least two points: the recognition of Cyprus, which can under no circumstances form the subject of negotiations, and the stubborn refusal to tackle the issue of the Armenian genocide, a willingness to tackle which I consider to be a preliminary condition for membership.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I, together with others, tabled two amendments to supplement a resolution that is particularly reticent on the subject of the Armenian genocide.

However, the EU has not been reformed sufficiently to enable it to receive Turkey as a member. That especially applies in the cases of agricultural policy and the Structural Funds. Nor has Turkey done enough to comply with the EU’s political requirements. Quite a few requirements concerning respect for human rights have not been implemented. The Armenian genocide of 1915 has not been recognised, and nor has Cyprus’s sovereignty. Moreover, the financial consequences for the EU of Turkish accession are still uncertain.</p>

Indeed, by signing the protocol on customs union on 29 July 2005, Turkey has needlessly put everyone on edge. This was, to some degree, to be expected. That its signing would be tantamount to the recognition of Cyprus is mainly, and only, based on declarations made by European Heads of Government and has never been corroborated by Turkey. What is more, on returning to Ankara – following the negotiations in December 2004 under the Dutch Presidency – Mr Erdogan made it known at once that the signing would certainly not amount to recognition of Cyprus, whether explicit or implicit.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Cyprus issue, I take the view that the Council should make every effort to bring about the unification of Cyprus. For this, we need to take the Turkish Cypriot community out of its economic isolation as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As expressed in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the resolution, Turkey must, of course, embark on full implementation of the customs union without delay, thereby, among other things, opening up its ports to Cypriot ships. Parallel to this, though (and hence with the same timescale), the economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community must end, and so paragraph 7, appealing though it is, is too non-committal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its development towards being a normal country in which all ethnic groups, all political opinions and all religious faiths are considered equal is stagnating. Last week, a court banned a conference on the mass murder of the Armenian people in 1915, which had been denied for many years. The large Kurdish community in the South-East still has no prospects of education, administration and media in their own language, of normal representation in the national parliament or of regional self-government. Prominent forces in Turkey reject further concessions to European wishes and even hold out the threat of Turkey’s membership application being withdrawn.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few weeks, interest in the situation in Turkey seems to have shifted to the country’s relationship with Cyprus. It is unacceptable that ships from southern Cyprus should still be barred from Turkish ports, while Turkey claims that it has observed all agreements since as long ago as 2004. This does not augur well for other areas of discussion. As an EU Member State, Cyprus has the right to veto negotiations and membership. The disadvantaged groups within Turkey do not have such influence. That is why this House should especially take their problems and interests to heart. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The case of Mehmet Tarhan was a recent example of how conscientious objectors are punished with years of imprisonment. There are renewed conflicts in the Kurdish regions, police and military forces are omnipresent, and state and non-state actors commit human-rights violations. Freedom of the press is continually violated: for example, anyone publishing material that takes a critical line on the genocide of Armenians or the continuing Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus still faces imprisonment.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the EU Heads of State or Government are concerned, a key motivation for this accession is geopolitics. A Commission working document drawn up to render Turkey’s accession to the EU plausible states: ‘Turkey is a strategically important country (...)

<p class="contents">On that basis, I had no option but to vote against the joint motion for a resolution before us, on account of two points that I believe are of crucial importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, by rejecting the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats clearly stating that ‘…most importantly…, from the outset, the negotiations must be conducted with an open mind, and ways forward other than full accession should be considered’, Parliament clearly refuses to incorporate a Plan B into its resolution, which I feel is essential if we are to avoid the possibility, at some point in the future, of the opening of the negotiation process being taken as full commitment to accession.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, moreover, abundantly clear that the Cyprus issue has not been properly resolved. Turkey is seeking to join the EU but does not accept the Union in its current form. Let us face facts: you cannot join an organisation that you do not recognise, just as you cannot negotiate with a party that does not recognise your organisation.

The resolution of the European Parliament of 18 June 1987 emphasised four points comprising major obstacles to the accession negotiations with Turkey. They related to:</p>
<p class="contents">1/ the refusal of the Turkish Government to recognise the Armenian genocide</p>
<p class="contents">2/ its reluctance to comply with international law in its differences of opinion with Greece</p>

The current Prime Minister and the Foreign Affairs Minister belong to the former group and deserve all our support. The debate about the opening of the negotiations has recently been fed by political opportunism, many, as my group chairman, Mr Cohn-Bendit, has said, riding on a wave of latent racism. It would be unfair to be stricter at present than the Heads of Government had agreed in December and it would also send the Turkish people the discouraging message that Europe does not actually want Turkey. Those who make negotiations conditional upon the recognition of Cyprus overlook the fact that a swift recognition of Cyprus by Turkey would spell the end of Kofi Annan’s attempts to set up a fresh round of negotiations about the island’s division. The EU must support the reformers, demand the correct implementation of the customs union and insist on the penal code being honed down further. The opening of the negotiations will send Turkey further into the direction of a secular state where people, along with international law, are respected in full and in practice.

<p class="contents">It is true that the liberalisation of international transport has the potential to help revitalise rail transport, by fostering its growth and putting it on a more equal footing with air and road transport. It is also true, however, that if services are liberalised in unchecked, haphazard fashion at European level, this could lead to serious problems for some Member States such as Portugal, where specialised infrastructure, such as high-speed rail links and the management models thereof, has yet to be put in place. Furthermore, the provision of public service in the area of transport, which is a key factor in employment and economic growth, remains to be guaranteed.</p>

<p class="contents">Despite welcoming the Commission’s proposals on the new wave of rail transport liberalisation, UNICE is calling for more, and faster. It is calling for the ‘opening up of the markets’ throughout the passenger rail transport sector, and not only international transport, as the Commission’s proposal had envisaged for this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">UNICE also highlighted the position previously adopted by the majority in Parliament to open up passenger rail transport as early as 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet again, the majority in Parliament (and that includes the votes of MEPs from Portugal’s Social Democrats, People’s Party and Socialist Party) is pandering to the demands of Europe’s captains of industry, by approving the liberalisation of international passenger transport in 2008, and national passenger transport in 2012. What is more, Member States can even bring these dates forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, we are extremely disappointed that our proposal to block this fresh step in the liberalisation of rail transport was rejected, and will continue to strive to defend public rail transport services and the working conditions of employees in the sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recipe for that is freight traffic on the roads and competing low-cost airlines in aviation. They separate the management from the rails and the implementation from the provision of services, and hope that private companies will bring lower prices, provide a customer-friendly service and attract more customers. I think that that approach will ultimately fall short of expectations. Their only interest will be in reducing costs by closing down lines, thinning services, increasing charges and discouraging the many loss-making customers.</p>

It is essential that the downward trend in rail transport’s market share be reversed, and we must be resolute in our efforts to achieve this, by building an open, competition-based market.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Commission’s proposal to allow rail companies access to the infrastructure of all Member States for the purpose of operating international passenger transport services by 2010 at the latest, the rapporteur includes national services in the opening up of the market, so as to offset the inevitable reduction in the cost-effectiveness of international services and the enormous barrier that this presents to entering the market. Moreover, within the context of opening up the networks to passenger rail transport, our proposal is to give the Member States the right to restrict the opening up of the market in certain cases in order to maintain the economic viability of a rail service of public interest. I feel that the main gaps in the Commission’s proposal have been plugged and wish to restate my positive opinion and vote on this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, what we need is an extensive evaluation of the different Member States’ past experiences of railway liberalisation. Both the Commission proposal and the Jarzembowski report are premature and lack a solid basis. The proposed directive fails to provide binding agreements in relation to the quality of services, security or environmental requirements. In addition, the same form of liberalisation of the rail network is imposed on all EU countries, which differ widely in terms of the position from which they would start and of the way in which their railways are used. This makes it necessary to list the forms of rail liberalisation that have worked in the past and those that have not. There is also the issue of whether Europe can indeed add value to the way in which Member States can, in future, make their national railways more efficient, more customer-friendly and more environmentally-friendly. It may be the case that, once the situation in the different Member States has been assessed, we will have no choice but to admit that this subject should ideally be tackled at national level after all, because each situation is unique. For the time being, I refuse to endorse the wild liberalisation plans that are now before us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The 25th anniversary of the Polish trade union movement Solidarity is an important date to remember, and not only for Poland. Its basic message – solidarity in a pan-European context – also deserves the attention of the European Parliament. On the one hand, it represents an important signal, since this movement led by Lech Walesa epitomises the courage of the Polish nation in opposing a totalitarian regime under the shadow of the Soviet empire. On the other hand, it provides a shining example of values such as solidarity, freedom, peace and human rights – a legacy for Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to pay due attention to the historical events that led to the demise of the Berlin Wall, to the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia and to the independence of the Baltic countries, we must not forget the victims of totalitarian regimes and, at the same time, we must truthfully present this history to a younger generation that has never experienced totalitarianism. This MEMENTO of totalitarianism provides a sombre warning to those who yearn for its return, as well as a source of strength for those nations that continue to endure it up to the present day.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it serves to remind us of a great man, John Paul II. His words – Do not fear! – resounded in Gdansk and, during his pontificate, left an indelible imprint on the hearts and minds of people all over the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context, territorial cohesion encompasses economic geography and forms part of the objectives of any structural policy. Its inclusion at Community level alongside the objective of economic and social cohesion is only significant because for some people it underpins the federal notion of an EU ‘State’ as a territory.</p>

Many issues cannot be resolved by local authorities alone, which is why cooperation with other municipalities and the participation and involvement of the public rank among the basic principles of rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">Maintaining quality of life in rural areas and fostering people’s attachment to their homeland are essential to bringing migration from the land under control. Economic attractiveness and lasting economic opportunities are as important in this regard as economical land use, conservation, awareness-raising at local level and adequate infrastructure. Various village contests and town-twinning partnerships have proven their worth in giving impetus to this living space, which is home to two-thirds of all Austrians, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Rural areas cannot, therefore, be sustained by agricultural subsidies alone, especially as the EU policy under which they are granted has so far done little to foster employment, instead, to some extent, further accelerating this migration: despite large subsidies, many farms are closing and not all members of future generations can make a living on the farm.</p>
<p class="contents">Ensuring vibrant rural areas requires, in particular, that we boost organic enterprises and give smaller businesses a better chance of survival. Under no circumstances must there be a cut in subsidies for less-favoured areas: areas which make up 71% of the agricultural land area in Austria, for example.

<p class="contents">Albeit from differing perspectives and with varying approaches, we have joined forces to support the strategy proposed by the Commission for the sustainable development of the outermost regions. The proposal covers the priorities, the instruments and, most importantly, the creation of a ‘Specific Programme of compensation for additional costs’ and the establishment of a ‘wider neighbourhood action plan’.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there is global agreement on the strategy, criticisms and reservations remain, due to the fact that it falls short of clearly addressing the needs of the outermost regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I agree with the rapporteur that the following priorities must be emphasised:</p>
<p class="contents">1 to accord preferential treatment to the outermost regions with regard to the conditions of access to the Structural Funds within the framework of the revamped cohesion policy; in light of their particular constraints, they should be granted priority financial aid, regardless of their income level;</p>
<p class="contents">2 to increase the budgetary allocation to the Specific Programme, to be distributed fairly, in view of the constraints that they face; and</p>
<p class="contents">3 to clarify the action plan in the context of the future ‘European territorial cohesion’ objective of the revamped cohesion policy, and in the context of the Union’s neighbourhood policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We therefore proposed that the Commission be called upon to create a specific Community programme to support the outermost regions, with sufficient financial resources (the financial resources proposed by the Commission in its proposal on the outermost regions in its proposed financial framework for 2007-2013 fall short of what is needed and must be increased), to offset permanent structural disadvantages (and not constraints, as the rapporteur puts it), a programme that would act as a unifying instrument to bring together all of the currently dispersed measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that in order to ensure the sustainability of fish stocks in the EEZs concerned and to preserve fishing activities in the outermost regions, it is essential that exclusive competence regarding access to the waters of the outermost regions be equivalent to access to its EEZ, in compliance with the national jurisdiction in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, given that most of the territory in these regions is covered by nature reserves and other protected areas, we feel that there should be permanent measures for the outermost regions in this area.</p>
