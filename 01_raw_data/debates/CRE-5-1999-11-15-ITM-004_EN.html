<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lange (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this legislation represents the final piece of legislation stemming from the Auto-Oil programme. Ladies and gentlemen, we collectively, the European Parliament, have made this legislation a success story. We, the European Parliament, can take credit for the fact that air quality in Europe will be significantly improved. We have succeeded in securing a 60% improvement in air quality in the future, specifically in cities. This did not fall like manna from heaven: we achieved it in the Conciliation Committee. Madam President, you were the Chairperson of the Conciliation Committee delegation. You led the delegation in which we won this from the Council. So we should not hesitate over the last component of the legislation, and we should opt for the Conciliation Committee route in this case as well, because the Council has obviously not dared to make that final leap and has been very cautious on a couple of points.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has certainly incorporated some important points in its common position, such as the two-stage stipulation of binding limit values, stricter durability provisions for emission control devices in lorries and buses, an on-board diagnostics system, and roadside testing. But it has been quite cautious with regard to four particular points, which I think we need to put right.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point is that the Council has deferred the reduction in nitrogen oxides from 2005 to 2008, and has also introduced a second phase for the 2005 stage, so that we now have a gradual reduction. To my mind, this makes no economic sense at all, because we know that nitrogen oxides and particulate emissions are bound to follow the same curve, so that if we tackle one of these two pollutants, there is an automatic knock-on effect on the other. So it also makes no economic sense to have two different limit values within three years. Instead, we need to reduce NOx emissions in one fell swoop. </p>
<p class="contents">Some people say that there is only one technology that can achieve this. That is clearly wrong. There are several technologies for simultaneously reducing particulate emissions and NOx emissions to the level called for at first reading, either by using the ammonia process or else by using charge cooling combined with a regeneration filter. So there are various options, and these options are not just theoretical, they are at the prototype stage. That means that we do not need to worry about this not being technically feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, this would also be a waste of engineering effort, and would make economic nonsense. But we also need to take this step for ecological reasons, of course. Why? We are, for instance, talking about a target ozone limit value for 2010 which is 80% below the current value in the European Union. If we really want to achieve that, then it is specifically the NOx emissions from lorries and buses that we will also have to reduce. In the European Union we have 168 million cars and 23 million commercial vehicles and buses. These 23 million commercial vehicles emit as much as the 168 million cars, that is 50% of total NOx emissions. So we absolutely must do something about it!</p>
<p class="contents">The second point on which the Council has been rather cautious is re-equipping older vehicles. We know that lorries and buses have a long life and tend to clock up high mileages. So it is of the utmost importance to encourage re-equipping of such vehicles, so that older vehicles become cleaner as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Council has been rather cautious about introducing enhanced environmentally friendly vehicles – an area where we have proposed several additions – and about strict controls to prevent cycle beating, as has already happened in the USA. This means that manufacturers can simply get round limit values by electronic manipulation. We need to add something here. Emissions legislation aimed at improving air quality has been a success story, and we have an opportunity to put the icing on the cake. Of course we also need to be highly ambitious with our proposals when we go into the conciliation procedure. We want to emerge with a good compromise, so we cannot take a compromise as our starting point. I therefore call on all of us to be courageous, to achieve a swift conciliation procedure and to work together to ensure that our success story – improving air quality in Europe – really is a success right to the end.</p>

I think – and Madam President you will know from your own experience – that the action taken by Parliament in the case of the Auto-Oil issue was very courageous indeed. We have tried to clean up passenger cars as well as truck traffic, including heavy commercial vehicles, and not just the cars as such, but we have also tried to ensure that clean fuels are used. This whole package will ensure that air quality will indeed improve. The only encouraging thing I have read recently about the environment, in the Dutch press, is that this improvement in air quality owing to the use of cleaner cars is already in evidence. </p>
<p class="contents">I would be dishonest if I failed to mention that a few people in our Group do not fully agree with the report and the amendments proposed by the Environment Committee. I think that, possibly, further negotiations need to take place where further compromises can be reached before the vote takes place. The people who are of the opinion that the requirements now prescribed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and its rapporteur, Mr Lange, for heavy commercial vehicles, are too strict, should consider the following. In Europe, we still boast a sound automotive industry for heavy and light vehicles. The same automotive industry exports vehicles to the United States which must already meet stricter requirements or, at least, the requirements as prescribed at present. I think it is in no-one’s interest that we in Europe set lower standards than what would be perfectly feasible, even in the longer term. This is why I urge that the proposals by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection actually be adopted in tomorrow’s vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has a direct effect on the quality of the air we breathe, that is to say the air’s nitrogen dioxide content and the amounts of ozone being formed in the atmosphere. All this also has an effect on acidification and eutrophication. It will also reduce the number of particles in the air that are hazardous to health.</p>
<p class="contents">All this can only succeed sufficiently well, however, if the action required under the directive is taken as quickly as possible. The most difficult challenge is the rapidly increasing volume of transport, which is predicted to double between 1990 and 2006. In my opinion, the rapporteur, Mr Lange, is quite right when he proposes that heavy goods vehicles should be included in a common strategy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from road traffic as quickly as possible. We have to respond to the race against increased emissions by speeding up the adoption of measures to reduce them. I therefore offer my strong support to the rapporteur’s proposal that new limit values be introduced as quickly as the latest technology allows and certainly not only once the Member States happen to approve them.</p>
<p class="contents">In a market economy, money is the deciding force. Therefore we have to use financial pressure to push forward environmental values. Tax incentives have had a major importance in encouraging the use of more environment-friendly fuels. Using tax concessions as a carrot to replace heavy old commercial vehicles is well justified, as are tax benefits for environment-friendly vehicles. All this would serve to speed up the introduction of vehicles that pollute the environment less.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to mention a change that would cost nothing. You yourselves must daily encounter situations where heavy vehicles such as buses and construction machinery leave their engine running at times when nothing is going on. Imagine how much we could reduce air contamination if we did not let our vehicle engines idle in this way. It really costs nothing. It is just a question of attitudes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my book and, of course, in anyone else’s, this is a contradiction in terms. Trucks pollute. This is what they do. And since freight transport, in particular the international variety, invariably takes place by road, we cannot do much more than endeavour to reduce this harmfulness. As far as this is concerned, a compliment is in order for the Committee and the Council, but, above all, for the rapporteur. Given the number of amendments adopted in first reading, his role as a rapporteur can be seen as an outright success.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very satisfied, even at this early stage, with the outcome before us. We are now dealing with the second reading of a directive, aspects of which will need to be introduced as early as the year 2000. This is why we are under a certain amount of time pressure. </p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is re-opening a number of previous proposals. We can support him in many of those, but there is one section where we do not support the rapporteur but rather the Council’s common position, and this concerns the two-stage approach to the NOx limit value of EURO IV stage. I heard very clearly what the rapporteur says about this. However, the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party considers that if this limit value for 2006 is laid down now, it will, in practice, force industry to apply one specific technology, whilst we are not entirely convinced of the environmental friendliness of this technology. In our opinion, evaluation in 2002 and implementation in 2008 offer a better chance of using a more effective technology. </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Council proposes introducing a category of very environmentally friendly vehicles. We welcome this proposal in which these vehicles are linked with tax incentives. We also listened with great interest to the rapporteur with regard to the improvements he is intending to incorporate in this proposal. </p>
<p class="contents">Also, we give our full backing to the rapporteur’s proposals to cut CO2 emissions so that we can achieve the Kyoto objectives, but also to the tax incentives for adapting older vehicles and the adjustment of test conditions, so that actual emissions of vehicles in use can be measured, albeit in the longer term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Trucks and buses contribute to air pollution in ever greater proportions, as we have actually done a lot to reduce car emissions, for example by using better quality fuels and tax concessions, as Mrs Myller said.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first reading, Parliament was very successful in getting through strict limit values for particulate pollutants, which are very dangerous for the health. The Ministers of the Environment then adopted Parliament’s proposal and now our job is to demand that industry adopts just as strict a line on nitrogen emissions. Industry needs sufficient time, and industry will certainly get the time it needs to prepare itself for this technological change. The engineers have proved very inventive before, and I trust that the right technology will be in place by 2006. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We ought to continue to do so, both now and in the future. As a result, we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left shall be voting for just about all the amendments from rapporteur Lange. We think it is our role to ensure in this situation that the best possible technology is used as early as possible. I am also convinced that some of the pressure which has been exerted on us as Members of the European Parliament in connection with this issue has exaggerated the difficulties involved in adjusting to the demands made in this recommendation for second reading. </p>
<p class="contents">I am rather hesitant about one section. This is section 11, about whether a time limit should now be set for financial incentives in connection with environmentally friendly vehicles. However, this is a minor question in this context. I should like to thank the rapporteur for producing a very good piece of work on a matter which is technically quite complicated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The great car culture has been referred to before in European Parliament reports as the main culprit of air pollution in Europe and Parliament is now playing an active role in establishing limit values for various pollutants so as to bring this environmental problem under control. It goes without saying that the European Parliament must support a whole raft of measures to control environmental pollution in order to comply with its obligations under the Kyoto Agreement to reduce the level of European Union emissions of six greenhouse gases by 8% by the years 2008-2012.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that the European Commission and the European Parliament have held extensive consultations with the European automobile industry on these various matters, and it has voluntarily agreed to accept a timetable to cut carbon dioxide emissions in new cars by 25% by the year 2008. We have made extensive progress over the last few years in relation to meeting these problems, for example with the systems installed in cars which have completed 80,000 kilometres and which were built over five years ago, to monitor the durability of anti-pollution equipment. We have tax incentives which must also be used to encourage the early introduction of vehicles containing advanced anti-pollution equipment. We will support the phasing out of the sale of leaded petrol. We have also supported measures which would guarantee that the sulphur content in petrol will be cut three-fold and that the sulphur content in diesel will be reduced seven-fold by the year 2005. The Lange report this evening on the control of emissions of gases and other pollutants produced by vehicles continues the progress we have been making.</p>
<p class="contents">May I say in conclusion that since May of this year the European Parliament has the power of codecision on all environmental matters as a result of the enactment of the Amsterdam Treaty? The European Parliament must and should use these new powers to push forward an even stronger legislation in the area of environmental control. I support Mr Lange and congratulate him on his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has once again delivered excellent work with regard to making traffic more environmentally friendly. After the Auto-Oil programme for passenger cars, a sound approach has been adopted with regard to heavy-duty vehicles too. I am also pleased with what the Council adopted from Parliament in first reading. It is clear that consensus within Parliament has led to good results in the Council. However, I fail to grasp why, when agreement has been reached in the Council, Parliament should have to wait so long for the official common position. I actually find this important enough to raise as an issue. I fear, namely, that it will increasingly become a habit for common positions to be held up. The Council could, of course, say that the procedure has become more complex since the entry into effect of the Treaty of Amsterdam and therefore requires more time. However, I cannot see the difference in this respect. A text had to be laid down prior to Amsterdam and this is still the case after Amsterdam. </p>
<p class="contents">Alongside this, I should add that such delays create huge problems for the implementation of the relevant legislation. This is certainly the case for heavy-duty vehicles. For the car industry, it is essential to know exactly what is going to happen and when. If the decision-making process occurs much later than necessary, then it is impossible for the car industry to accommodate this adequately. </p>
<p class="contents">It is now the case that, regarding the strict NOx values, some car industries are aiming for 2005, first reading of the European Parliament, others for 2008, the Council’s common position, and some others still for 2006, the draft recommendation for the second reading. This intermediate phase is creating a great deal of confusion as it is. Timely clarity in this respect is what is called for. </p>
<p class="contents">As for my reaction to the content of the proposal, it is only natural that Mr Lange would like to see a few improvements made. If we are serious about meeting the Kyoto objectives, then this sector certainly is important. The vehicles concerned are large, have a high mileage and, as such, cause high levels of CO2 emission. More far-reaching investment into more economical engines, and not just for passenger cars, will certainly have an effect. I would therefore urge the Commission to take concrete action. </p>
<p class="contents">I am also in favour of tax incentives for the vehicle category of very environmentally friendly vehicles. This will help ensure that the proposed emissions are achieved in good time. Mr Lange is right in indicating that, alongside standards for emissions, standards will also come into play for other aspects of these environmentally friendly vehicles, such as noise and fuel consumption, which was mentioned earlier. Certainly in terms of noise, heavy-duty vehicles play a key role. Needless to say, test cycles for measuring vehicle exhaust gas values should mimic the real driving situation as soon as possible. Negotiations on a worldwide harmonised dynamic test procedure is also a step in the right direction. </p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I would like to say that I fully agree with Mr Lange’s report. I will therefore vote in favour of all his amendments. It would be good if Parliament and the Council were to draft a sound directive without a conciliation procedure. Unfortunately, over the past couple of weeks, the Council has clearly stated that it is not prepared to adopt draft amendments from the second reading. This may well result in a conciliation procedure, which will, in turn, cause delays. This is why I would like once again to urge the Council – and will do so via the European Commission if need be – to adopt the sound proposals tabled by Mr Lange. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 20 December last, the Council of Environment Ministers adopted sound amendments from Mrs Hautala. These comprised strict limit values aimed at preventing air pollution and carcinogenic particulate emissions from trucks. Unfortunately, the Council has decided in favour of 2008, compared to Parliament’s 2005. Mrs Hautala has already touched upon this. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to discuss CO2 emissions from trucks. The European Commission needs to table proposals fast. With regard to ordinary cars, Parliament had expressed its preference for a three-litre car in 2010. We have ended up with a feeble compromise of an agreement relating to a six-litre car in 2010. No agreements have been reached at all for trucks, whilst the mileage of trucks is rising at an alarming rate. It is expected that it will rise by 40% by 2015. This is why I would ask the Committee to submit a directive for more economical trucks. Otherwise, we will never meet the Kyoto objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the German Government, which sat on the issue during its Presidency, clearly had other ideas. The matter was seriously delayed and did not return to Parliament until the middle of the summer. If the initial timetable had been followed, the manufacturers would probably by now already have certified the requirement in stage 3 of the Programme. Environmentally more friendly diesel vehicles would already have begun to be driven on European roads. Now, Mr Lange has drafted comprehensive amendments at this late stage in the discussion of the issue. If Parliament complies with Mr Lange’s proposals, there will be further delays. That would not be good for the environment in Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">Europe presents a variety of faces. Sweden and Finland, especially their northern parts, are very much dependent upon efficient road transport. It is quite right that we should impose tough environmental requirements upon motor vehicle manufacturers. They should really need to employ absolutely all their skills and knowledge in accomplishing the tasks we set them. We must not however draw up proposals in such a way that they contain aspects which are bad for the environment. If our decisions lead to the simplest solution becoming general practice, which is to say that of basing exhaust purification technology on catalytic converters which require large admixtures of ammonia solution, then the distribution system alone, involving the distribution of this ammonia solution to all petrol stations throughout Europe, would mean that a not insignificant portion of the environmental benefits would be lost. A technical solution like that would be especially problematic for us in northern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say too that the EU cannot provide direction in Europe by means of directives which are not adapted to the real situation throughout Europe. Let us make very high environmental demands, but let industry too have the time it needs to develop the best possible technical solutions for the future which are good for Europe’s countryside and for the environment in Europe’s large population centres. From this perspective, the common position is a better alternative for the environment than continued delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I personally feel that the Council has included many highly important provisions in its common position, such as reducing emission limits for carbon monoxide by October 2000 or 2001 by 30% in comparison with 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">We always face the same problem, and I can remember our discussing that, Mr Lange: you promised to come to an arrangement with the Council so that your amendments would be accepted in part. The question now is this: what are we to do? Are we to vote for your amendments tomorrow or the day after? Will there be a hold-up? I wonder what is really better for the environment now. I very much regret that the arrangement with the Council has not worked out. We are really faced with a decision on a matter of conscience, and this evening I will have another very good look at all this, because things have not worked out as we discussed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing we need to be clear about: the Council has accepted a great many important points here, but our cars are not yet clean by a long chalk, and they never will be. Who would have believed that we would now be facing an explosion in traffic not only in the industrialised nations but also in the Third World? It has not even begun to take off in those countries yet, and it is bound to grow further – and I can only wish for the population of those countries that it will. Perhaps, Mr Lange, you could try again to reach some sort of compromise with the Council during an overnight meeting. In that way, we will all be relieved from having to decide on a matter of principle, that is whether to vote against your very good report – which I would dearly like to vote for – or else, I think it is fair to say, to vote against the environment, by procrastinating yet again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No one has said so yet, but that is guaranteed too.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work. The report largely addresses the critical issues and fits in well with existing clean air legislation. At this point I would like to make a general comment about the formal structure of the report. I wonder if the technical criteria set out in the annex really are a matter for us to discuss as Members of Parliament. Without expert guidance, the annexes are simply impenetrable for most of us – that has been my experience at least. I think perhaps that in future, with technical reports like this, the Legal Service should bring them into line with what we have already proposed and agreed upon.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to comment on the most difficult and controversial points of this second reading, in terms of content. I agree with the rapporteur that the transition to new standards should be done in a single stage. By setting the deadline for 2006, we are demonstrating to the Council that we are willing to compromise, as we too will be making a concession as compared with the first reading. I consider that the Council proposal, which does not provide for this to be introduced until 2008, is not acceptable here. The directive on improving fuel quality and the catalytic converter technology now available make it possible for the Council and Parliament to come up with a truly ambitious project, without burdening industry and the transport sector with charges. Let me remind you of our experience with the Auto-Oil programme for cars. We stuck to our guns then, and it has now turned out that we took the right approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point, as I see it, is to encourage re-equipping of older vehicles by means of fiscal and other incentives. I think there is enormous potential here. Heavy goods vehicles have a very long service life. We should most definitely look at the fiscal options, even if the conversion only meets one criterion. This is an area where a lot more can be achieved. By and large, I am very pleased...</p>

<p class="contents">The second reading of the report contains a number of amendments which the Commission can support, for example the amendments relating to the Enhanced Environmentally-Friendly Vehicles, the EEVs concept. The EEVs provide for a fuel and technology-neutral concept based on the best available technology which will allow Member States or local authorities to encourage the use of the vehicles which qualify as EEVs through tax incentives. EEVs will always be a concept which will complement future mandatory emission limits.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore the Commission can accept in principle to study the possible expansion of the scope of the EEV concept to include perhaps other vehicle characteristics such as noise and fuel consumption and other propulsion technologies. The Commission can also support the amendments relating to the expansion of the directive to include other alternative fuels, in this case ethanol, the amendment relating to tax incentives applied to the re-equipment of old vehicles, the amendment to include heavy-duty vehicles in the overall Community CO2 strategy and the amendment relating to the market quality of liquefied petroleum gas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can also support in principle the amendment that deals with abnormal emission control strategies, but we would prefer to see the reporting date on this issue deferred. A reporting date at the end of 2002 would enable the Commission to fully evaluate the effects of the new type-approval test cycles being introduced from next year on the regulation of in-use emissions from new European vehicles. In adopting a common position with much more stringent limits for particulates, we should note that the Council moved a significant way towards the view expressed by the European Parliament in the first reading. The Commission supports this precautionary approach towards the emissions of ultra-fine particulates.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the main issue in this package of amendments for second reading is the early application date of stringent limits for oxides of nitrogen, NOx. The Commission believes that the state of development of the necessary technology to achieve such stringent NOx limits makes it difficult at the moment to accept a date earlier than October 2008. In this regard the technology feasibility review is necessary, since the emission control devices to meet the ambitious NOx limits are still under development. While they have demonstrated great promise in laboratory trials, there is no certainty yet as to the long-term operational efficiency of such devices which will make them a viable and durable technical solution to achieve emissions controls in the longer term. There are also important issues still to be resolved with respect to the quality of market fuels and notably sulphur content.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission can accept the following amendments: the first part of Amendment No 3, Amendments Nos 6, 7 and 10, Amendments Nos 16 to 26 and Amendments Nos 29 to 47. The Commission can accept in principle Amendments Nos 1, 4, 5, 13, both parts of Amendment No 12 and Amendment No 15. The amendments which the Commission cannot accept are Amendment No 2, the second part of Amendment No 3, Amendments Nos 8 and 9, both parts of Amendment No 11 as well as Amendments Nos 14, 27 and 28. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
