That is not an entirely correct description of how things look in reality, as noted as early as during the Berlin Summit in March 1999 when the budget guidelines were drawn up. It was then clearly shown that we can in fact tackle enlargement successfully within the EU’s budget. In the opinion on the Brok report, for which I was responsible and which has been backed by the Committee on Budgets, the conclusion is the same.</p>
<p class="contents">The vast majority of international investigations point to macroeconomic gains in connection with enlargement. This applies to the candidate countries, but in fact it also applies to all current Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">To these should be added all the other advantages which cannot be measured in figures or assessed in economic terms. Through enlargement, we shall be participating in the largest common market in the world, with almost 500 million people and 25 per cent of world trade. We shall obtain increased competition and a more rapid process of reform in Western Europe too. Better conditions for economic growth will be created throughout Europe. Albeit in a somewhat longer time-scale, we shall be obtaining a common currency for the whole continent. Together, we shall be able to solve Europe’s cross-border environmental problems. We shall acquire an extended and stable democracy and, with it, opportunities for enduring peace on what has been a constantly war-torn continent.</p>
<p class="contents">The composite picture of enlargement does not therefore point to insuperable costs but to gains, however the calculations are carried out. They are so great that enlargement ought to be undertaken as soon as it possibly can be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am focusing on Slovenia because I have been involved in that country’s accession process and because it is a fine example of how realisation that the end is in sight can speed things up.</p>
<p class="contents">There are only a few days to go before the Slovenian general elections. This is not the most opportune moment for it to focus on foreign policy and the interchanges between the different parties could become heated and exploitative. However, with the exception of insignificant minorities, no political group is questioning the principle objective of the Slovenian policy which is to join the European Union as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The political line therefore remains unchanged. The speeches of all those who have contributed to today’s debate on enlargement paint a not-dissimilar picture. The report on Slovenia presents us with a problem which is also part of the Czech question, the Croatian question and the situation of other nations. However, at various different stages, always during or immediately following the Second World War, measures were adopted which do not clearly meet the Copenhagen criteria, given the prevailing spirit at the time, and yet the political and ideological architecture of the period, including the peace treaties, was founded on precisely those laws.</p>
<p class="contents">The third amendment to the Slovenian document, for example, welcomes the Slovenian Government's intention to ascertain whether the laws and decrees currently in force, which date from 1943, 1944 and 1945, are in conflict with the Copenhagen criteria. Internal battles are being sparked off in the individual countries over these issues. While an amendment, as we said, welcomes the Slovenian Government's intention to ascertain whether the laws are in conflict with the Copenhagen criteria, the Slovenian parliament’s Foreign Policy Committee, which has decision-making power, stresses that the bases established between 1934 and 1935, upon which Yugoslavia was created, are fundamental, and requests that the Slovenian Government firmly enforce this position in its entirety, that part of the country ...</p>

On the other hand, it has been demanded of the new Member States that, prior to accession, they should have adopted and implemented the whole of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>and that the transitional periods should be few and brief. There is an irreconcilable conflict between these points of view. Some have suggested that this conflict should be resolved by offering the applicant countries membership of the EEA first. This is not a realistic idea. The EEA would not suit the applicant countries and, besides, they will be satisfied with nothing less than membership of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Rapid enlargement of the EU is a political inevitability. That is why I have asked and I am now asking why we could not change the terms of membership. We could specify a basic version of the <span class="italic">acquis, </span>which would contain core parts of the EEA agreements and a common foreign and security policy. In addition to adopting and implementing this basic version, the new members would obviously have to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria, agree to adopt the <span class="italic">acquis </span>in its entirety as a longer-term objective, and commit to the political goals of the Union. In this way we could create preconditions for membership of many or even all the applicant countries in the next few years. In splitting the body of EU law in two, the level of integration achieved by the present Member States could be guaranteed and cooperation could be further enhanced.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Union were to enlarge rapidly it would have to decentralise dramatically, as was stated in the ELDR Group’s position on enlargement. Thus, the tasks and competence of the Union would have to be curtailed and it would then concentrate on the core issues that can only be dealt with at EU level. This would mean that the Union would obviously also become differentiated, so that some present Member States would move further along the path of integration than others. A Europe of enlargement would be one of both decentralisation and differentiation. Talk about the fast accession to the Union on the part of the applicant countries is just empty words unless the conditions of membership are changed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, this form of preparation, as experienced at grass roots level, is having exactly the opposite effect. National sovereignty and independence are being eroded, multinationals are wading in and unemployment, poverty, wretchedness, corruption, pornography and trafficking in human beings are rising to new heights, while governments are generously offering up health, education, culture, industry and the agricultural economy in return for the support of the new, often Mafia-style master class of the USA, the European Union and ΝΑΤΟ. It is for these reasons and, more importantly, because of our own experience in Greece, that our opposition to the enlargement of the European Union is meant as an expression of brotherly solidarity to the workers and people in general in the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on these people to join with the people of the European Union in fighting a European Union which exploits and interferes, including militarily, which fleeces the people of their wealth and the fruits of their labour and which abolishes the social rights for which they have fought so hard and sacrificed so much for so long. We call on them to fight for a different Europe of all the people, a Europe without this inhumane side, in which people will defend their destiny and live with each other in peace, freedom, comradeship and mutually beneficial cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Cyprus is concerned, despite the fact that the Poos report contains much that is true, we feel, in addition to the foregoing, that the process of integration into the European Union and the decisions taken at Helsinki will not only fail to resolve the problem of the occupation in accordance with UN resolutions; they will legitimise the occupation and the definitive partition of the island. And, for the record, we note that the question of the withdrawal of the occupying army was hardly even touched on when the occupying force was granted candidate status.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, because there has been much talk today of the tenth anniversary of the reunification of Germany, I should like to ask the Council and Mr Verheugen if they have any idea when this unified Germany intends, having occupied Greece, to pay the loan needed for war reparations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the Romanian Government has problems in estimating the number of orphans who are presently in the orphanage system in that country. In correspondence received by the European Commission delegation office in Bucharest from the Romanian Government it is estimated that there are between 100 000 and 140 000 orphans in Romania at present. The brutality of the Ceausescu regime ensured that so many children were orphaned in Romania since the late 60s. There are up to 100 000 people employed within the Romanian orphanages themselves. This is a complicating factor when one addresses this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I visited Romania at the end of July to see at first hand the workings of one of the largest orphanages which is in northern Romania. It is clear to me that the institutional, ordered regime which operates in that country results in many long-term health consequences for orphaned children. It was also clear that the staff who work in Romanian orphanages need further child care opportunities. Many of the orphanages in Romania are old, antiquated buildings. New, modern facilities such as those built by the Romanian Challenge Appeal are going to be needed if the quality of life for orphaned children is going to be improved. I visited two of these houses that I can recommend to anyone. I saw at first hand what benefit these homes – and they are homes – are bringing to the orphaned children.</p>
<p class="contents">It is imperative that the accession negotiations between Romania and the Union detail exactly what the Romanian Government needs to do to improve the standard and quality of orphanages in that country. It is not sufficient to make commitments. They must act.</p>
<p class="contents">I had the opportunity of meeting with non-governmental organisations in Romania which are working with the orphanages. I publicly commend the work of these and, in particular, the Romanian Challenge Appeal based in Birmingham and others from Ireland supported by a number of people including Daniel O'Donnell, the Irish entertainer, who has pledged GBP 1 million and has raised that in Ireland and other parts of the world. It is people like this who have done so much.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that Romania is not allowed into the European Union unless it addresses this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I regard the report as a great achievement. Not only will enlargement affect human beings, it will also have an impact on the plant and animal kingdom. This all-round view demonstrates the enormous complexity of the issue of enlargement. There are many individual aspects to be taken into account. The Committee on Fisheries wants to have its say, but has no intention of putting a brake on things. We have some quite specific proposals. We are not going to start back at square one, but we do insist on upholding the Community patrimony, which is of course known as the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, as does the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. After all, although the Brok report contains ten points concerning the agricultural policy aspects of enlargement, the common European fisheries policy goes unmentioned. Now that is a real Community policy, and an all-encompassing one to boot. It encompasses all aspects of our daily life and directly affects the European labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences of failing to take the fisheries policy into account could prove disastrous and should not be dismissed merely by referring to solidarity amongst the nations. Unfortunately, so far, the report has failed to take account of these aspects, apart from the fact that the unanimous opinion of the Committee on Fisheries reappears as the annex. That is not enough. We therefore call upon the rapporteur, the Commission and the Council to supplement the agricultural policy section with the fisheries policy section, for example by changing the title ‘Agricultural Aspects of Enlargement’ to ‘Agricultural and Fisheries Aspects of Enlargement’.</p>
<p class="contents">It should not prove difficult to make the necessary editorial changes. After all, the Committee on Fisheries believes legal provisions and information obligations, for example, to be of fundamental importance too. I would urge you to support the relevant amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Polish people believe that the country will be ready for accession with effect from 31 December 2002, and Poland has certainly made great strides since the accession negotiations started in March 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">There are already a number of progress reports available to us, and Parliament, which plays an important part in this process, has repeatedly made its feelings known on the subject. Parliament supports the Commission’s strategy, according to which, each candidate state should be dealt with and assessed on the basis of its own progress and merits. However, there are also problems requiring a cross-border solution.</p>
<p class="contents">In Mr Gawronski’s report, the Commission is urged, by the rapporteur among others, to examine measures for furthering development and for strengthening the synergy between Poland, Lithuania and the Russian region of Kaliningrad. I feel it is entirely reasonable to ask this of the Commission, and that the Commission’s response should be to put forward a proposal. I have already made this point once this afternoon, on another occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, when it comes to the question of how positive people are about the enlargement process, it is worth pointing out that opinion polls in several candidate states show that enthusiasm for accession to the EU is on the wane. Not in all countries but in several. That comes as no surprise, because a whole decade has passed since the historic turning point of 1989/1990, and there is still no comprehensive information and communication strategy for the people. Mr Verheugen said the same this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, all hopes and expectations are pinned on France. Above all, the Nice Summit must clarify whether, and how, the EU, for its part, can get itself completely ready for enlargement in good time. When the current Intergovernmental Conference finishes, institutional reform should create the necessary institutional conditions for an enlarged EU, i.e. for a Union comprising 25 Member States or more. It is absolutely essential for an enlarged European Union to be able to function effectively and have the capacity to act. Not only does the success of the French Presidency depend on it, the progress of the entire enlargement process is at stake for all concerned, including Poland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The candidate states have spared no effort to meet the requirements. It is clear, though, that some countries have made more headway than others. This is why it is impossible to set a general date of accession; each country is welcome as soon as it has met the Copenhagen criteria, either before or after the European elections. It is remarkable that the national documents are often far more upbeat than the Brok report. We do not do the candidate countries any favours by scaling down the requirements or making out that the situation is better than it is. A great deal still needs to be done. This includes issues such as democracy, the constitutional state, decentralisation, the fight against corruption, EU regulations, industrial changes, consumer protection, environmental measures and agricultural reform. The EU must pull out all the stops in order to support the candidates in these areas and not raise any new barriers, of course. And all parties must aim for the shortest possible transitional periods, if any at all. It is better to have a sound accession at a slightly later date than a premature one which proves inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted a dangerous trend. Frustration in the candidate countries is mounting because they feel the accession process is taking far too long. And at the same time, there is growing resistance to accession among the population within the Member States. And even the European politicians have insufficient insight into the negotiating process. If this situation does not change, the whole reunification will be up in the air.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore call on the government leaders to assume their responsibility and to stop this trend in its tracks. They must enter into a dialogue with their own people, and thereby convince them of the huge importance of peace, stability and prosperity across the entire continent, and of the historic importance of the reunification of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is rumoured that you are no stranger to these countries yourself. I believe you will join me in my assessment that a great deal has happened in these countries, but that this can largely be attributed to their own efforts, also on the financial front.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU largely makes its presence felt as a result of reduced agricultural products, which drive the prices down in these countries. This is particularly true of the time we had the pig crisis, when pigs that were almost paid for finally ended up in Poland, having gone via the Soviet Union. The debate intensified as a result. When we now talk in terms of liberalising trade, the so-called zero option, then this is because the Commission did not satisfy Parliament’s demands early on, for it to refuse point-blank to grant export subsidies to the applicant states.</p>
<p class="contents">People in these countries – and especially in Poland – are now discussing what has become of the compensation payments. The Polish people are asking themselves whether they will receive these payments once they are members of the EU, or whether they are regarded as second-class citizens. I have tried to impress on them that it will take a good deal longer yet, and that in fact it will not be discussed until after their accession, which will be several years hence. I have told them that it is more important for the time being, to concentrate on the structural funds. It would be a good idea if Poland were to request an increase from SAPARD, and perhaps a modification too, in order to tailor these funds more effectively to the conditions, in Poland in this case, but the same applies to the other candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Just to compare: Poland has EUR 168 million available to it in SAPARD funds. The compensation payments amount to EUR 1.5 or 1.8 thousand million, are widely dispersed, and will do nothing to aid the development of these countries. It would make sense if we were to fulfil Poland’s demands for us to increase these structural funds now, and if we were to adapt our instruments and also begin to incorporate the compensation payments into the structural funds, at the next agricultural reform, which will take place earlier, by my reckoning – or at least the planning stage will – than the accession of these countries. We would then share a common goal with these countries in the common agricultural policy, and it would also enable this agricultural matter to be settled once and for all by speaking to Joschka Fischer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall therefore confine myself to the subject of Cyprus. My congratulations to Mr Poos on such a thorough and objective report.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Poos brings a European vision to bear on the subject of Cyprus. I think that the Poos report will set a precedent for the European Parliament and I am sure that the House will support it unanimously. When Cyprus was still a British colony, a poet wrote, “Masters you have changed many, hearts you have not”. Cyprus’s heart has always beaten in time with Europe. Cyprus is Europe, it is part of its history and it is time the island came into the European fold. Cyprus has close links with the people of the eastern Mediterranean and integrating the island will heighten the Union’s profile in this vital area. Cyprus will be a sort of bridge with the countries in the area. I have no need to raise the economic dimension, it is covered thoroughly and dynamically in the Poos report and the reports by the other institutions of the European Union. I would merely remind the House that, of all the candidate countries, Cyprus comes first as regards meeting the economic criteria and qualifies for immediate membership of EMU. Cyprus will have no trouble adjusting to the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. The Poos report notes that the State operates smoothly, respect for human rights and freedoms form the cornerstone of the social and cultural tradition of the island and the country’s social structures are, first and foremost, humane structures.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still, of course, the question of the partition of the two communities. However, I am sure that, with good will and the help of the European Union, a solution can be found which will allow the two communities to live together peaceably and prosper, as they have done for centuries. The Poos report rightly stresses that both communities will enjoy the benefits of membership of the European Union. The Greek-Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots have nothing to divide them. It is foreign intervention which is to blame for the partition of the island. Let us hope that the island will soon reunite within the extended family of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As a member of the Maltese delegation and, coming as I do from one of the most peripheral islands in Europe, I support the country's application for membership. From an EU perspective, Malta's admission will bear further testimony to the goals, ideals and aspirations of the European Union's founding fathers. Malta's application for membership, after a disruptive start, is now fully back on course and in my view meets the Copenhagen criteria for membership. It has considerably more work to do in meeting the requirements of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. Nevertheless the speed with which Malta has addressed the enlargement requirements is a positive indication of its commitment to European integration and its desire to be a full partner in the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the view of the rapporteur that Malta should be admitted to membership in the first tranche of enlargement and that negotiations should be completed by the end of 2001.</p>

In other words, a great many issues are based on subsidiarity, and that is how it should stay. Accordingly, we have confined ourselves to a handful of issues and I only intend to pick out two particular aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">The audiovisual sector is very important. We have established that the candidate countries have simply not made enough effort on the legislative front, and the legal provisions governing the audiovisual media fall a long way short of meeting the requirements of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. That was my first point.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that there has also been precious little effort made to approximate the legal provisions on the intellectual property front, i.e. with regard to copyright.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also addressed the issue of minorities, because the integration of these minorities – including their linguistic integration – in these countries, is also of significance. We have included a number of comments concerning the Russians in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and concerning the Roma in the other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Criticism and questions aside though, I would also like to highlight a positive development. In fact we have some positive feedback for you on the educational and cultural front. For years now, we have had links with these countries through the Tempus programme, and likewise, for a year and a half now, they have been entitled to participate fully in the educational, cultural and exchange programmes for young people. I believe we have been truly successful in building bridges here. We must not concentrate on economic matters alone, for it is in the very areas I have mentioned that we must find common ground and build on it. Indeed it is already there.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make the honourable members aware of how unsatisfactory it is that the exchange under the Socrates programme always involves people from Eastern Europe visiting Western Europe, and that we must encourage our young people to visit the countries of Central and Eastern Europe instead. Only then will we truly find common ground in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He could not have said a truer word! There has been no communication, it is still not happening, and I believe it is absolutely essential to have this discussion with the people. The politicians should really take this message to heart, and show they have understood it, not just through words but also through deeds.</p>
<p class="contents">We recently completed a study in my country, Austria – which, in point of fact, shares its borders with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia – according to which, the idea of enlargement meets with far greater approval in the border areas, where discussions are being held and there are initiatives and investments in place, than in other regions left untouched by these activities. It is for us to determine a communication strategy for enlargement, through words and deeds.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the second form of communication we need is that between the Member States and the candidate countries, in order to convey what it is that is important from the European Union’s perspective. It is certainly not just about having general objectives, or simply being present, because the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> is also very important. I sometimes hear our neighbouring countries asking why we are so bothered about the acquis, when all that matters to them is having it confirmed that they are ready for accession. But the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> is the yardstick we use when assessing whether a country is ready for accession or not, and that is very important to my mind.</p>
<p class="contents">The third form of communication I wanted to discuss is that within the candidate countries. It is often the case there that the government and the opposition, or the government and the public, are unwilling to talk to each other, and so this is also something that needs to be better organised. The social partners must become involved, as must all social groupings, so as to be able to convey to the candidate countries’ own citizens what enlargement is really all about. It will be a difficult journey, and one that will undoubtedly claim victims, but, at the end of the day, it will surely take us to where we want to be. With that in mind, I believe we parliamentarians should do our bit to ensure that there is better communication and dialogue in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, these sentiments have had to yield to technical arguments in the course of the negotiations. The requirement for becoming an EU Member State is that of complying with the basic Copenhagen criteria. Negotiations must, in the first place, be aimed at easing the way to accession by the candidate countries. Naturally, they must comply with EU legislation, but I think it is sometimes rather hard to say that these countries must do this from day one. There are Member States of the European Union which have not in actual fact complied with everything, in spite of their having been Member States from the beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate has been going on in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. It is being said in certain quarters that a country must meet the requirements before it becomes a Member State. I think it is important to note that the condition of the environment will not improve as a result of these countries staying outside a little longer. Instead, we ought to try to help them as much as possible and as early as possible, as well as perhaps opting to accept rules that specify rather longer transitional periods.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it is a question of rousing public opinion in favour of enlargement. We cannot afford to lose more of the momentum that existed at the beginning of the Nineties. We have already lost quite a lot of this. I believe it is a matter of urgency that those of us in this Chamber, in the Commission and in positions of national leadership should take responsibility. We must no longer hide behind democratic considerations and say that we must listen to public opinion. It is time to lead European opinion in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">It has more to do with political objectives and political will than with technical solutions. We must explain this to people in the candidate countries and especially in our own Member States if the enlargement process is to be successful. And there is no time to waste. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has been remarkable progress in several areas, but one of the aspects which was not covered in the report was equal opportunities. We heard about the benefits of enlargement, and this is one of the issues where we can learn from Lithuania. 17.5% of the members of Lithuania's parliament are women, which is well above the average of the applicant countries and also better than many current Member States. Lithuania has appointed an ombudsman to ensure equal opportunities, to which it does not just pay lip service – it actually enforces it.</p>

The Lithuanian government has committed itself to the closure of unit one, albeit later than originally scheduled. This has been a difficult issue, but there is no doubt that the plant must close, and further delays are unacceptable. In addition to the financial support being given by the EU for the closure programme, we must also provide support to develop a genuinely sustainable energy strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The talks do not need to reach a conclusion at the end of 2002 simply for the sake of political ambition, if the problems are not solved by then. We must keep political urgency at bay.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest problem is the different level of development of the countries. The best illustration of that is the reunification of Germany. In Germany the economic, social and cultural differences have not been as great as those among the present Member States and many of the applicant countries but the process has nonetheless come to cost EUR 600 billion. Where will we find the money for still much greater sums, to reduce the much greater differences in levels of development?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Verheugen’s idea of a referendum on enlargement was heavily criticised, and the reason is obvious: those who have to pay cannot be let to decide on the matter. I propose that the model for enlargement be the same that was implemented in connection with the previous round of enlargement. The applicant countries first should join the European Economic Area, where they can harmonise their economies with that of the EU, without political commitments or coercion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that Romania has embraced the challenge of a transition to an open democratic market economy. It has successfully embraced reforms which are essential to secure a more prosperous and safer future. As both the Commission report and Baroness Nicholson's report acknowledges, some progress has been made in improving conditions for some minorities. Romania has ratified major human rights conventions such as the European Convention on Human Rights and the revised European Social Charter. But ratification is not enough. What matters most is implementation of the rights contained in those conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the Commission wrongly defines minority rights solely in terms of the Roma and Hungarian communities. The rights of these minorities are essential to a free, open, democratic and European Romania, but I am also particularly concerned about the rights of other minorities such as the groups listed in Article 13 of the TEU: those who suffer from discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religious belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. Laws do not in themselves solve the problems. Indeed, the Romanian Upper House refuses to act on removing homosexuality from the penal code. This is nothing short of scandalous.</p>
<p class="contents">Blatant discrimination occurs in other countries such as Poland and Malta. In Poland recently, the former President, Lech Walensa, told a campaign rally, 'I believe these people (gays) need medical treatment. Imagine if they were all like that! We would not have any descendants.' That is as ignorant as it is misinformed and we must make every effort to ensure that when we look at the accession countries human rights and the treatment of the minorities are at the top of the agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even though they contain the odd contradiction, this range of texts gives us the opportunity to draw up a detailed and customised progress report on the negotiations. At the same time, they enable us to gauge the extent of the work accomplished by the Commission and its departments in the context of screening and the negotiations. We now, Commissioner, impatiently await your own progress report on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Cyprus and Malta, provides us with a historic opportunity to unite all the nations of Europe on the basis of shared ideals, and to make the whole continent a more stable place.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the delegation to the EU-Latvia Joint Parliamentary Committee, I should also like to briefly mention this specific case, by way of example. Significant steps have been taken in Latvia towards meeting the political criteria. Admittedly, some progress still has to be made in other areas, such as, to mention just one area which the rapporteur, Mrs Schroedter, did not raise, the modernisation of legal procedures and infrastructures. Nonetheless the political authorities in Latvia are unquestionably determined to bring the process of reform to a successful conclusion, and this bodes well for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of the twofold challenge of both the enlargement, which must enable Europe to come to terms with itself, and the institutional reform, which must increase democracy and efficiency within the institutions, the European Union now, as it often does, stands at an important turning point in its history.</p>

Unfortunately, I am still at a loss as to how to find my way out of the maze of garages by the shortest route.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address a problem that is largely to be found in the Baltic States, in particular Latvia and Estonia. It concerns the existence of a relatively large Russian-speaking ethnic group, supplemented by people from Ruthenia and the Ukraine. The vast majority of these people are there as a result of a decade of occupation, which is why they keep themselves very much to themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the last few years, it has been possible to bring about a distinct improvement in the situation, due in no small part to the influence of the European Institutions. I would remind you that only a few years ago, the language law contributed to the negative assessment. I would also ask you to cast your minds back to the great difficulties attending the nationality law, which had to be amended and tailored to European standards.</p>
<p class="contents">These legal hurdles have now been overcome, as a result of which, many Russian-speaking citizens are now prepared to recognise the citizens’ rights and duties, both in Latvia and Estonia, which are the countries worst affected. It is a process that is having very mixed success, but it still inspires great hope, because it will mean that these citizens will also become citizens of the Union in the future, and will therefore be called upon, in a special way, to establish ties with their homeland, where their forefathers come from. I have a shrewd idea that these citizens will become agents of cross-border cooperation in a future enlarged European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Respect for the cultural identity of a community, even if that community constitutes a minority, increases the self-respect of those who belong to that community, and that self-respect is needed if they want to take their own self-development seriously. This wish for emancipation and self-realisation then motivates people to give something back to the community. This is the philosophy one should adopt when looking at minorities – that would be far more positive. In many enlargement countries, these minorities are labelled as problems. This is the case for the Roma people and others. This is also true of Slovakia.</p>
<p class="contents">The report – and I am referring to that by Mr Wiersma now – considers a fundamental change of attitude with regard to the Roma to be essential. This says something about the long road ahead, but the Hungarian minority also fears that, despite the 1999 Law on the Use of Minority Languages, it will remain curtailed in its social, cultural and economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from Belgium, a country where language laws have been unable to solve the problems between the peoples; it takes more than that, education from the top down, including universities. This required more autonomy. I am only referring to this to illustrate that simple solutions do not generally help solve complicated issues.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the diversity of cultures and peoples in Central and Eastern Europe, and in the Balkans, is, within the framework of a unified Europe, being given new opportunities, but at the same time, Europe will also need to realise that a problem such as the Roma, for example, is a problem of a nation without a country and that is our problem too. We cannot simply pass the buck to Slovakia, Romania or the other countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As shadow rapporteur for Lithuania, on behalf of my group, I would, however, like to congratulate Mrs Hoff on her report. Above all though, I would like to bring various expectations and reservations that I have, to the attention of the Council, which, I am sorry to say, is largely absent.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it seems to me, that for all the fine words and industrious opening and closing of chapters, the Council is not applying the political pressure needed to drive this enlargement process forward. There is a risk that the window of opportunity referred to by Commissioner Verheugen will simply be allowed to slam shut, because the first loyalty of the protagonists in the Council, in particular the Heads of Government, is to their national agendas, and sadly they do not have the ambition to raise their own profile for the sake of the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Helmut Kohl, Europe’s citizen of honour, stepped down from the European stage, Jean-Claude Junker is the only other Head of Government I can think of off the top of my head, for whom the European project is a matter truly dear to their heart. Nonetheless, I call upon the Council as a whole to demonstrate the political leadership we need to do justice to the size of task.</p>
<p class="contents">Put aside any thoughts of replacing the principle of ‘Each according to his/her merits’ with that of ‘Each according to his/her merits, but not until my elections are over’. This applies both to the French Presidency and to the German Bundestag elections. There is no reason to delay the conclusion of negotiations until after these elections. Those who subordinate historic decisions to petty national, or even party political considerations, will not earn their place in the history books.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge you to set a deadline in Nice by which you intend to conclude negotiations with those candidate countries – naming no names – that have made the most progress. Let us all stop asking them for things that do not fall within the scope of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. Whilst there are certain honourable members here who should heed this, the message is intended primarily for the ears of the national Council delegations attending the negotiations. The way individual governments allow particular lobbyists to manipulate and take advantage of them to a certain extent, in the course of negotiations, is sometimes unworthy of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Again I call upon the Council to show political leadership and give the candidate countries a specific deadline in Nice, which they can work towards. Incidentally, the French farmers and all their counterparts will still be there, before and after every election! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Bulgaria now has an economy which is developing at a steady rate. This is not reflected, however, in a balanced improvement in the standard of living of the whole population. Perhaps a constructive dialogue between the government, the opposition parties and social representatives could provide a positive impetus to move things in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">This dialogue would also contribute to the creation of the necessary administrative capacity for the effective management of the country, creating structures which do not currently exist and reducing cases of corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Many countries have faced similar problems at some time in their development and can advise Bulgaria in order to help it to overcome those problems it is facing at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">In Bulgaria, 20% of the active population is out of work. In addressing problems such as this, which have no easy solution, it is essential to create an environment conducive to the work of industry and to there being competitive economic structures.</p>
<p class="contents">Bulgaria also has an important geopolitical role to play in the future of the Balkans. Its cooperation with the international community during the Kosovo conflict, and its balanced role at that time, are of great importance for the whole region. In fact, Bulgaria uses its position as a bridge between Central Europe and the Balkans in a way that is fruitful for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must continue to help Bulgaria in its progress towards joining the Union and, of course, to ensure that the planning of that aid becomes even more decentralised.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, having talked about Bulgaria, I would not want to end without a more general comment. I would like to restate our support for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want the process of enlargement to take place in a serious and honest way, we will have to give a commitment to two essential issues. Firstly, that enlargement should take place hand in hand with a deepening of the Community. The Intergovernmental Conference must therefore be an effective step forward on the road to political union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Union should tackle enlargement with sufficient budgetary resources. Enlargement will thereby have credibility in the eyes of those who want to be with us in the future, and credibility in the eyes of our public from this very moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What happened in Denmark has demonstrated that, as matters stand, the EU’s grasp of democracy meets with criticism and rejection on the part of the citizens – and I would say these are citizens who take a special interest and are well informed. Malta is only to be allowed four MEPs, if the proposals tabled by Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen are anything to go by. If the Leinen proposal is adopted, then this will lead to discrimination against the small countries and against the new small parties in the smaller Member States. This will reduce the political diversity of debate.</p>
<p class="contents">If Malta is only permitted four MEPs then this will further entrench the two-party system over there, which has been founded on confrontation for decades, and it will hinder political innovation. Malta should be represented by a minimum of six MEPs, like the other smaller Member States. Democracy is not just about majorities, more than anything it is about minorities being given commensurate codecision powers.

We hope that the Slovakian parliament and the government will pursue this course resolutely and find the patience they need to overcome opposition and strengthen the Slovakian people on their way to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows from this though, that there must also be privatisation and restructuring of the economy. The banking and financial sector must be completely reformed, and fiscal consolidation must be continued. The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups within civil society, the government and parliament will play an important – and as we see it – positive part in the process. The small and medium-sized enterprises must be the main beneficiaries of economic diversification. In the long term, Slovakia should earn an ever-increasing amount of its foreign currency from economic sectors that have nothing to do with the processing of oil, or weapons production.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that there is now close cooperation between Hungary and the Slovak Republic. We are particularly delighted that Slovakia has made a start on granting the Hungarian and the other minorities rights, which are gradually approaching the standards prescribed by the Council of Europe. It is important for this condition to be fulfilled if Slovakia’s membership of the European Union is to proceed smoothly. Incidentally, the Slovakian government is making remarkable efforts to modernise the state apparatus and to bring on the peripheral regions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have noted with satisfaction that the Slovakian parliament is conscious of what needs to be done for Slovakia to be able to accede to the EU, and has set about trying to accomplish this systematically and rapidly. We are also aware that, being a transit country in Central Europe for those on their way to Western Europe, the Slovak Republic has a special duty to take a pro-active stance against trafficking in human beings, and to fight corruption and organised crime with even more determination than before, and we have noted that the executive judiciary has been further strengthened by recent changes in the law.</p>

It will inevitably lead to conflict, and even more instability caused by extremist movements. This is where we have to set to work. We must bring down the iron curtain that exists among us, as getting rid of social and educational inequality is a much more important condition than all the weight of the votes of the Commission or the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The ignorant and the excluded cannot make up the information society: they are a sure sign of its failure. I wish to warn all those who are ripping the Union in two, into an inner circle and the rest. We are just doing away with a divided Europe, and we are not going to create a new one now. The best way to simplify bureaucracy is to concentrate on those issues for which we must find a solution together. In the Member States and the local authorities it is essential to take decisions on those matters that relate to these common problems. Otherwise we will be moving towards a terrifying, controlled society, ruled by an ever-darkening core.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I suggest that the Commission give Parliament its assessment of how the internal preconditions of enlargement are developing, in the light of unemployment, exclusion and digital discrimination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The challenge in 1990 was to achieve a single currency. The challenge in the first year of this millennium is to enlarge the European Union in a way that enhances the peace and stability and prosperity of the continent and does not undermine that stability.</p>
<p class="contents">To that end enlargement now has to be the absolute priority. We should not miss the window of opportunity that Commissioner Verheugen has referred to. That does not mean that we should proceed blindly. No country has an absolutely guaranteed right to join. They have to be ready. That is why many of us were concerned about the criticisms made by the Commission of the efforts made by the Czech Republic in their last report, which indicated a certain slackening of effort. We only hope that the tremendous efforts made by the government of late will be reflected in the next Commission report. At the same time we should recognise the efforts made by countries like Lithuania to, as it were, make up for lost time. That was reflected in the last Commission report and hopefully will also be this time.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make sure that the countries are ready to join and in particular that they have the administrative capacity to deal with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. That is why some of us were concerned that the Czech Republic has delayed implementation of its civil service law and has slowed down its judicial reform whilst, on the other hand, Lithuania has made tremendous strides in that area, recognising the importance of administrative capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States could do more in their twinning arrangements to assist the applicant countries in developing their administrative capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is crucial that we sell the applicant countries to the electorate of the European Union. Too many people have a view of the applicant countries that is 10 years out of date. They are now much more modern economies, in many ways ready to take up the challenge of European Union membership, and we have to sell that idea to our citizens if they are to support enlargement in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, this allows us to dispel any fears our citizens may have that twelve countries, extending as far as Bulgaria and Romania, are to join the European Union in one fell swoop, overwhelming it in the process. At the same time, we can argue that a country has to meet a set of very clear standards before becoming a member. All this is to be found in the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, and on behalf of my group, I would like to thank her warmly for this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania did not set out on the road to Europe until a very long time after the fall of the Iron Curtain. The democratic government has only had since 1996 to catch up on all the things that other countries were able to make an early start on, and with that in mind, it has achieved a considerable amount of success these past four years. A word about how matters stand on the security front: Romania was one of those countries that gave Europe, and the Atlantic Alliance its backing during the Kosovo conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">We should therefore take this opportunity to think about sending out a signal. If Romania’s accession is not going to be for some time yet, then the Atlantic Alliance should give thought to incorporating Romania into its mechanisms earlier than originally planned. The same goes for our European security and defence policy. Since we are aware that Romania and Slovenia have already been involved in discussions on the first round of NATO enlargement, as countries applying for NATO membership, NATO must not allow its enlargement process to come to a standstill.</p>
<p class="contents">We can use Romania to lend weight to our argument when seeking to impress on our citizens that it is in our interests to stabilise Europe. After all, Romania will form part of the European Union’s external border in the future. It is an important factor in the stabilisation of the Balkans as a whole, and of the region of South Eastern Europe as a whole. That being so, it is in our interests to extend our system of rights and freedoms as far as Romania, and this is certainly an argument we can use in a critical debate with our public. If we do not give countries such as Romania and Bulgaria any hope for the future, the situation will remain unstable and that is no good to Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The reports all contain many positive points and we can now safely say, enthusiastically and without fear of exaggeration, that it is time to move on to the next stage. The reports are steeped in optimism and the grumblers need to make way. We need to look at the wood, not the tree. History and politics are marching hand in hand. Now is the time to move up a gear. Now is the time for Europe to go forward and meet its destiny and put ideological flesh on the bones of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me now to move from the general to the specific question of the last two islands in the Mediterranean which are island states, Cyprus and Malta, which have now set their cap at membership of the European Union. If any area of Europe is ready, they are, especially Cyprus. From this point of view, it is here that the logic of enlargement will be judged not only on the basis of economic or other criteria, but also on the basis of respect for more general principles which should govern our perception of the future of Europe, a Europe of peace, a Europe of the people, a Europe of states, a Europe of equality and a Europe which respects human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, I think that, if anything, it will be Cyprus on which Europe’s ability to look itself in the face politically will be judged. Cyprus and Malta will prove to Europe that it accepts enlargement on general terms, not for reasons of geographical symmetry, but in order to achieve the political integration of united peoples, united cultures and united prospects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to express my gratitude, mainly to the authors of these two reports, but also to Mr Moscovici and Commissioner Verheugen, for their interventions. They managed to be both realistic and pragmatic in their analyses, without losing sight of the far-thinking objectives that give real meaning to the European project. Despite the obvious differences in points of view, we have seen broad consensus on the fundamental aspects of the issue. Amongst these, I would highlight the following: the full inclusion of each new country in the European Union means complete commitment, bringing together economic convergence and partnership in a political project. This project has various characteristics which the candidate countries and current Member States absolutely must respect, otherwise enlargement will do nothing but dilute our current strengths. Amongst the characteristics that must define the identity of the European project, the most prominent are cohesion and solidarity between Member States, democracy, the ethic of responsibility, the social dimension and equal opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, the fact that this debate is taking place at a time when Germany is celebrating the tenth anniversary of its reunification should give us food for thought. We have exorcised the ghosts of the past. Although the twentieth century was marked by the greatest possible disunity in Europe, with two terrible wars, the twenty-first century will see the peoples of Europe unite, if we want this to happen. They will unite in a common project, which is unmistakably a project of peace between Europeans and between Europe and the rest of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People do, however, rally in large numbers around one issue, namely that of enlargement. One might well wonder why. I believe that the opportunity for transforming the EU into a form of pan-European cooperation lends legitimacy to the enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">The gains are mainly to be found at the political level. It is fantastic that countries on this continent which only ten or so years ago were divided are to make joint decisions on matters of common interest in the near future. This transformation has benefits in terms of democracy and provides the opportunity to create peace and stability in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be recognised that it is about joining forces economically, but this can also give rise to major economic gains in the future as our market increases and there is increased growth in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall see benefits in terms of the environment. I myself live close to the Baltic, which matters to us all. When we devise common rules which improve the environment, we create better conditions of life for the future. That is our common task.</p>
<p class="contents">The report states that each country must accede to the EU on its own merits. It is important that this should happen and that a country should be able to become a member of the EU when it is ready to join. We now have two tasks before us: firstly, to encourage the Member States not to abandon their efforts, which is why we need to present a target date soon; and secondly to lead the debate with the people in our own countries so that this project enjoys legitimacy in the future too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe this is an important goal and all those involved must do their bit to ensure that we achieve this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">The points raised by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in the Brok report are the steps we need to take to this end, and it is essential that we take them if we are to counteract any slowing of the pace on the European environmental policy front. My group therefore supports the proposal to limit the transitional periods in the environmental sphere to a maximum of five years.</p>
<p class="contents">Our political demand is for the problem areas of water, air and waste to be made a priority. If transitional periods are to be granted, then it would be both necessary and helpful to include realistic interim goals in the accession treaty, and to regard failure to attain these interim goals as a violation of the treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must be given the information it needs to be able to assess the situation in the candidate countries. Annual reports from the Commission allow us to follow the implementation process. The issue of nuclear safety is one of the major challenges facing the enlargement process. The efforts that have already been made in this sphere demonstrate that this is another area where the enlargement process represents a golden opportunity to achieve greater security in the candidate countries, and indeed in the whole of Europe. This translates into greater security for the people in the candidate countries and greater security for all the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Nuclear power stations of first generation Soviet construction are a particular danger as far as Europe is concerned. We call upon the candidate countries to shut down those of their nuclear power stations that they cannot refit, by the date of accession at the very latest. I have three particular nuclear power stations in mind, and they are Bohunice, Ignalina and Kosloduj. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As politicians, we must give this momentous process our unequivocal support, even though there are still many aspects to be discussed and negotiated. The political vision endures. The responsibility that we parliamentarians bear at this time must enable future generations to live in peace and freedom on our continent. The standard of living will rise in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe as a result of a market-orientated economy, and underpinned by democratic forms of government. Even though it will not be easily won, we have chosen the right path.</p>
<p class="contents">We Austrians are particularly interested in and affected by enlargement in view of our geographical position. I personally remember the Iron Curtain only too well, because my farm was only a few kilometres away from it. I would still much rather face the problems that have arisen as a result of opening the borders, than have to continue living with my back to the wall of the Iron Curtain, as we had to for decades.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as giving enlargement unequivocal support, I would stress that it should take place as soon as possible. Agriculture, in particular, has an important role to play, because far more people are employed in this sector in the candidate countries than they are in the EU. We must tell the candidate countries that they must make the necessary structural changes, so as to be competitive in the future market, and they must increase the number of employment opportunities available in rural areas. The SAPARD programme provides an excellent opportunity to this end, and I welcome with open arms the fact that the Commission has already approved six programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Transitional periods and arrangements should be kept as short as possible, but one thing I would stress is that the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> must be adopted in full. Particular attention should be given to health, plant health and, above all, the environmental conditions and issues that are so important to us as consumers, and also as farmers, so as to maintain consumer confidence. The reform of the common agricultural policy must form an efficient basis for the multifunctional activities that the farmers perform in all areas. The fundamental alignment of the European agricultural model and the development of the rural area will not produce a conflict of interests between the farmers of the EU and those in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. We want to solve problems together and go forward into the future together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The environment, for example, is an area that will benefit enormously from enlargement, along with many others. Nevertheless, it will mean we will require clear rules governing the way enlargement takes place. It is vital for the environment that we have a well-defined arena for transitional measures and that it is clearly stated how to proceed during the transitional period.</p>
<p class="contents">We speak a lot about how enlargement should be financed. We have assets allocated in the budget according to the requirements of Agenda 2000, but we have to take care that the funds we need, which are required particularly in the area of the environment, are available specifically prior to membership. The funds have to be channelled more strongly to action preceding enlargement than is presently the case according to the proposals in Agenda 2000. Only in this way can we ensure that the acts will be implemented. And, in addition, we really must see to it at the same time that the proper administrative practices are in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall the costs of enlargement have been highlighted very considerably in public debate. So it was very cheering to hear Klaus Hänsch, speaking for the PSE Group, hope that he Commission would make a real appraisal of the effects of enlargement, including the economic impact if enlargement were not to take place. Just consider the costs we would incur if the divide were to continue, and what this would mean both socially and in terms of the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to add that it is also a moral duty of Western Europe: 11 years ago, the Soviet system came to an end and the countries involved turned to us in hope. We must respond to this hope with generosity and farsightedness. Certainly, we must not disregard the difficulties involved in the project. For our part, we must implement the institutional reforms and they, on their side, must carry out major internal reforms respecting the Copenhagen and other criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I would mention the amendments tabled by Mrs Oostlander to the reports on the Czech Republic and on Slovenia, calling for the issues regarding the minorities, which have not yet been resolved, to be tackled. I refer, for example, to the long drawn-out dispute involving the Italian community in Slovenia. In addition to the details and more specific issues, we must not lose sight of the historic import of this process. The debate which has been developing recently has thrown up four key issues: the date for the conclusion of negotiations, the accession date, the order in which the new countries are to join the Union and the transitional periods.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group announced its desire to see the first negotiations concluded by 2003, making accession possible by June 2004. Certainly, the debate over the order in which the countries are to join the Union remains open, partly because the state of progress of their internal reforms will have to be assessed. I would consider it wise to adopt a solution which is a good compromise between an enlargement process which is not too spread out over time, which would certainly prove traumatic for our institutions, and an enlargement process which takes into account the legitimate timetabling expectations of the countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As regard the transitional periods, I feel that we must be careful not to fall into the temptation to use them to reduce the impact of enlargement, thus detracting from the fact that the new countries belong to the European Union, in an endeavour to comply with the timetable we have set ourselves. On the other hand, it is true that these transitional periods can, if granted appropriately and in moderation, with great transparency, balance and a sense of accountability, prove to be in the general interest of all the countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berger (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, our task in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, was primarily to assess the situation in the candidate countries with regard to the internal market and the relevant legislation. But, as has been stressed repeatedly here today, since this concerns one of the key aspects of European enlargement, and the progress made here can only really be assessed with reference to detail, I would again express my regret that we are having this enlargement debate at a time when the Commission’s progress reports 2000 are as yet unavailable. Only on the basis of these could we form a just impression of the progress made in the individual States. We must therefore content ourselves with a rather sweeping assessment that probably does not give an accurate reflection of the situation in the individual States.</p>
<p class="contents">We can take it as read that considerable strides have been made, particularly since the last reports were published. As Vice-President of our joint parliamentary committee with the Czech Republic, I can vouch for the fact that this is true of the Czech Republic, but I assume the same applies to a number of other States too.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal market is a key component in the success of enlargement and it is therefore clear to me that we must tread extremely carefully when it comes to exemptions and transitional periods. However, in common with our rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, I believe that it would not be in the interests of either party to the treaty for there to be no transitional periods, and being a delegate from a border region, who, like Mrs Schierhuber, owns a farm in the vicinity of the Czech border, it is a matter of concern to me that the formation of close, common economic areas should be managed without any major problems, and lead to a positive outcome on both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to close with a comment from the report by Mr Schröder, which pleased me enormously, and which, as I see it, also captures the spirit of what Commissioner Verheugen said at the beginning of this debate. Although the following statement by Mr Schröder only relates to the Czech Republic, I believe the same applies across the board: ‘Many weaknesses that are still discernible in the Czech Republic are the legacy of decades of dictatorship. This being so, politicians from the part of Europe which after the Second World War enjoyed a happier fate, – and this is particularly true of Austria – would be well-advised to be moderate in their criticism of the countries such as the Czech Republic.’ </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is simply disgraceful that we are debating the enlargement and expansion of the European Union – which affects 100 million people – at midnight. We ought to stop and think whether it is right for our parliamentary debate on this issue to be treated as if it were a kind of afterthought. It is little wonder that the people beyond these walls do not give us the respect and attention befitting a Parliament, when that is how we behave.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now use my second minute to talk about Slovenia. I am delighted that the report has turned out to be so positive and that Slovenia – and as leader of the delegation I was able to check this out repeatedly, and in fact the Commissioner was there with me on more than one occasion – has made truly enormous efforts to fulfil the criteria. There are certainly still a few things to be done and there are still a few issues that need to be clarified. After all, the Copenhagen criteria are not just something static that countries have to achieve once and then keep to; they are to be used, or rather, applied on an ongoing basis. We in the European Union also undertake regular checks as to whether human rights are being upheld in the proper manner everywhere. In this sense, it is a process of development, which we follow attentively, but we hope that Slovenia will continue to hold this positive position and that it will be in the first group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that there has been a reunited Germany in the European Union for ten years now, bears witness to the solidarity between us. Other countries should now be given the chance to share in this, even though enlargement is not just about solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism incorporated its position on the Rack report into the Brok report. As a Social Democrat, there are three points I would like to highlight. Firstly, we need a more ambitious transport infrastructure programme for the candidate countries. That is why the Financial Perspective does not appear to us to go far enough, because there is a huge disparity between the diagnosed infrastructure requirements and the financing instruments made available by the Union, together with the candidate countries’ own means, and it will only be possible to implement public private partnership financing models to a limited extent. However, it is politically unacceptable for there to be development periods in excess of 50 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the transeuropean corridors are defined intermodally. We should make a virtue out of something that was born of necessity; i.e. there was a need to localise major trends in goods and passenger movements. In other words, we should keep the integration of modes of transport in mind right from the start. In addition the traditionally robust sector of goods transport by rail should receive the most support. In this way, we might avoid having to implement as many regeneration measures at a later stage, as we are having to do in our own countries now.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we want transitional periods for goods transport by road, which will enable there to be a gradual opening up. They could even start in the pre-accession period. It is in the interests of both sides to achieve economic and social balance during integration of the transport markets, because we are already waiting with bated breath as to the consequences of distorted competition on our roads. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think the suggestion is worth looking into.</p>
<p class="contents">The EEA Agreement is definitely no substitute for proper membership and must not leave countries in a waiting room for an eternity, from which there would be no chance of moving forward, but it could act as a sort of tool for encouraging the applicant countries, in a way that promises a reward, to implement the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire. </span>The EEA could act as a kind of hatchery, where EU embryos would mature into fully fledged members</p>
<p class="contents">If full membership is granted in the context of a brief timetable, a big cause for concern for companies in the Member States will be the long transitional periods, as competition will be distorted. On the other hand, a slow pace is also an obvious problem, leaving the candidate countries frustrated. The good sense of the EEA model was born of this tension, as it rewards the applicant at the stage of aspiring to accession. This would mean greater commitment to the implementation of EU legislation than what is required in the present convergence agreements. </p>
<p class="contents">The EEA, which contains issues relating to the first pillar, would give businesses in the applicant countries access to the Internal Market and youth and science the right to engage in exchange programmes, but, on the other hand, would not yet oblige the EU to extend their agricultural aid schemes to these countries. Thus, the EEA Agreement could act as a positive stimulus mainly to the economies of the applicant countries – they need growth to make their societies fit for accession – but also to the EU economy, as through economic growth we can reckon to cover as much as two thirds of the costs of enlargement, perhaps even more with the EEA model in place.</p>
<p class="contents">The eastern Central European markets are said to be so open as a result of the convergence agreements that western businessmen might selfishly wonder why enlargement is still required. The answer is the implementation of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire. </span>If the markets were opened up even with restrictions without the proper means of regulating them socially and ecologically, nothing would protect the citizens of an applicant country against social and ecological dumping. In the end we also need to protect ourselves from it. The good sense of the EEA model is based on the idea that efforts to implement legislation should be rewarded immediately. Benefits and responsibilities go hand in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">An EEA model, which led to membership, and, at the same time, was a reward scheme, would be productive also as far as public opinion was concerned. As the positive aspects for the economy would be highlighted already prior to membership proper, it would be a basis for justifying enlargement to the greatest possible degree. This holds good for both the citizens of the applicant countries and those of the present Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore all the more important that equal treatment for men and women should be incorporated into the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> as a fundamental human rights issue, and that establishing the necessary institutions in this sphere should be a crucial precondition to the implementation of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, equal opportunities must be accorded the same importance, and be discussed with the same level of commitment as all the other issues that feature on the agenda of the accession negotiations. The candidate countries’ legislative programmes and guidelines must include implementation mechanisms that allow for equal opportunities and clearly prohibit discrimination. We must facilitate this process through dialogue with the European Parliament and back up from experts, and through the involvement of NGOs, associations and organisations, and financial aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The public and private institutions in the candidate countries must strive for equal opportunities in all political spheres, and involve issues specific to women in all social, economic and cultural areas. It is well worth setting up public advice centres for women, which offer women on-the-spot advice, help and mediation.</p>
<p class="contents">Special attention must be given to employment policy. Equal access to education and training, and in consequence of this, the same pay for the same work, is a must. The candidate countries should also be encouraged to participate in the Community programmes for equal opportunities, and particularly those concerned with violence against women. It is statistically proven that since the détente with countries of Eastern Europe, there has been a 10% increase in violence against women there. Likewise, business is booming in the brutal trade in women. Both the EU and the candidate states should now be doing their utmost to condemn and fight these forms of violence and the trade in women.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal of progress has already been made, I am glad to say, but these countries must not direct all their efforts at economic harmonisation alone. Mutual respect, consideration for, and fair treatment of, each other, must form one of the main pillars of our European Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After two horrific world wars and fifty years of Communist oppression and dictatorship when – in the name of an oppressive class struggle – democracy, religious freedom, the environment and our Christian and universal dignity as human beings were trampled on, it is now finally time to unite our continent and our part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to address Commissioner Verheugen personally with a few comments but, before that, I wish to affirm that we Christian Democrats in Sweden have never doubted that Mr Verheugen wants to see enlargement towards the East and that the criticism that has been directed against him has been partly motivated by malice.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to comment on the following points. Firstly, allow each candidate country to negotiate on the basis of its own merits. Let it be worth a country’s while to be ambitious in achieving the EU objectives. Secondly, say no to the <span class="italic">big bang</span> idea of incorporating candidate countries simultaneously as a large group, since that would militate against the principle that each country should be admitted on its own merits. Thirdly, gradually devise target dates for each candidate country. Fourthly, demonstrate strong European solidarity by means of financial contributions in favour of better environmental conditions in the Eastern countries, bearing in mind the appalling environmental legacy from Communist times from which they suffer. Fifthly, and so as to be able to admit new candidate countries, make no new demands for a further intergovernmental conference and for further Treaty changes after Nice. Sixthly and lastly, ensure that existing Member States display solidarity and discernment regarding deepening cooperation so that we do not create an EU again divided into A, B and C teams.

In particular, I trust and hope that, understandable difficulties notwithstanding, the negotiated procedure with Bulgaria and Romania will proceed smoothly and without delay so that, once the necessary conditions are in place, these two Balkan countries can join the European Union, thereby consolidating progress, security and peace in south-eastern Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would especially like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Poos, and to express my satisfaction at the success of accession negotiations with Cyprus, which have advanced further than with any other candidate country, with 16 chapters already dealt with, which doubtless augurs well for an auspicious final outcome. Naturally, we all hope that the Cyprus question will be resolved in the meantime in accordance with the UN resolutions and the summit agreements, so that all the indigenous – I repeat indigenous<span class="bold"> –</span> population of the island, Greek-Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot, can enjoy the benefits of membership.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, the universally-acknowledged constructive stand of the Cypriot Government notwithstanding, this proves to be impossible due to unwavering refusal on the Turkish side, then I believe that the European Union should not allow the integration of Cyprus to be held hostage to Turkish intransigence and that, on the contrary, it should immediately accept the Republic of Cyprus as a member of the Union pending integration of the island as a whole at a later date, as happened with one of the founder members, the anniversary of the unification of which we are celebrating here today.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to endorse the thoughts and concerns of many of my fellow members regarding the need for an assiduous and long-overdue examination of the question of the borders of Europe and, consequently, of the extent of enlargement, and the need, if any, for a special report on the subject by the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, as we see it, enlargement is not merely an obligation. It is true that we are motivated by moral considerations, but we are also committed to enlargement owing to deeply held political convictions. Enlargement is a win-win situation. Both sides: the Member States of the European Union and the candidate countries, stand to benefit from enlargement once it has taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, enlargement – both the enlargement of the European Union and that of the Economic and Monetary Union – is about fulfilling criteria. There are the Copenhagen criteria to be fulfilled on the one hand, and those of Maastricht on the other. It should be made clear to all countries that accession to the European Union is not quite the same thing as accession to the Economic and Monetary Union and to the euro zone, and that there are different deadlines. It is clear that there is to be no opting out of the Economic and Monetary Union, and no bargaining during either set of negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must do our utmost to prepare the European Union for the enlargement process, by 2003, in the spirit of the splendid speech made by President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly – and it is very important to me to make this point by way of conclusion – notwithstanding the pacts that are to be fulfilled, the enlargement process is a political process. It is about people’s hopes and fears, opportunities and risks, prejudice and fact. We must accord this political process the historic importance it deserves and enter into discussion with the citizens. We need to politicise the politics of the enlargement process if we are to have the ability to engage in meaningful conversation with the citizens. The enlargement process and the Economic and Monetary Union are not just a matter for the European institutions. I call upon the Member States and all public mandate holders and media at all levels to become more actively involved in this process, because only then will we be able to do justice to public confidence in these initiatives, the objects of which are in the interests of us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
