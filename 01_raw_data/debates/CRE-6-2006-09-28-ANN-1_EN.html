<p>(FI) This answer by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>First it needs to be stressed that it is the responsibility of the Member States to develop and practise a policy to reduce youth unemployment and poverty. The Finnish Presidency will continue the processes that have already been established to compare policies in Member States whenever the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council is sitting.</p>
<p>The importance of youth employment is repeatedly highlighted in the European Employment Strategy. The following objectives and benchmarks, which particularly concern the young, have been agreed under the Lisbon Strategy and within the framework of the European Employment Strategy:</p>
<p>Firstly, every young person will be offered a new start before reaching six months of unemployment. They will be offered education, retraining, job training, a job or some other means of promoting employment.</p>
<p>Secondly, at least 85% of 22-year-olds will have completed secondary education in the EU by the year 2010.</p>
<p>Additional guidance on how these objectives could and should be achieved is given to Member States in the guidelines for employment policies 2005-2008 adopted by the Council in 2005.</p>
<p>First of all, it should be realised that all Member States had already included young people in their national reform programmes for 2005-2008, which they presented in autumn 2005. Member States, however, were asked to propose their own priority objectives, and they have chosen different ways of dealing with youth employment issues. It should also be realised that the targets set at EU level have already been achieved in some Member States.</p>
<p>The Member States are at present updating their national reform programmes, which will probably be finalised at the end of October this year. The national reform programmes and the related measures taken to improve youth employment will be examined during the Finnish presidential term: in November by the Employment Committee and again in December by the Social Affairs Council. The findings will be submitted to the Commission, which will draft its annual report based on them.</p>
<p>The Member States are also currently preparing their national action programmes for the next phase of the European Social Fund (2007-2013). The links between the ESF and the policy framework – that is, the European Employment Strategy – will be strengthened so that the ESF can have a more effective role to play in achieving targets on employment under the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Employment. It is intended to use the ESF to support efforts aimed at extending and enhancing investment in human capital, in particular by improving educational and training systems. One aim is to enhance employability among students by improving the way vocational training can be adapted to the needs of the job market. In this way, Member States can include in their programmes measures to boost the employability of young people, reduce the drop-out rate among students and support the transition from education to employment.</p>
<p>With regard to youth poverty, the mid-term evaluations of the EU’s Lisbon Strategy revealed that the young have benefited less than other age groups from policies to encourage inclusion and dynamic job market policies. The honourable Member can ask the Commission for further information on this.</p>
<p>The Council and Commission Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion 2006 stressed that action under the Open Method of Co-ordination needs to focus clearly on child and youth poverty. At the same time, the crucial importance of general education and vocational training was highlighted in aiming to break the intergenerational transmission of poverty.</p>
<p>During the Finnish Presidency, the Social Protection Committee will have the opportunity to continue the debate on this subject while the Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion 2007 is being prepared on the basis of national action programmes on social inclusion for the period 2006-2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0698"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>In connection with this, allow me to remind you of the important commitments to regional integration given at the Fourth EU-Latin America/Caribbean Summit in Vienna on 12 May 2006 and in the Council’s conclusions on the Commission communication on Latin America. The Council acknowledges that the European Parliament has done much to encourage regional integration in Latin America and to improve relations with organisations in the region.</p>
<p>Paragraph 32 of the Declaration of Vienna states: “Regional integration is a key element for stability, economic growth and investment and for increasing the importance of both regions on the world stage. We affirm the principles of co-operation and solidarity as a basis of our integration processes. In this context, we encourage and strongly support Latin American and Caribbean countries to proceed with their respective regional integration processes.”</p>
<p>Regional integration can do much to promote stability. Both are key goals of the strategic partnership between the EU and Latin America. The EU and its partner countries in Latin America have evolved comprehensive systems to promote both of these, because it requires continued and considerable effort to be able to sustain them, to implement them more effectively, to allow both sides to benefit from them, and to be able to extend them in the future. These systems go beyond commerce and cooperation. They include political dialogue aimed at trying to achieve common views, and joint action in multilateral issues in order to strengthen the EU’s capacity, and that of Latin America, to influence global questions of the greatest importance to both sides.</p>
<p>Historically, all integration processes have had their problems, and this is also true of the EU. I can justifiably say that at Vienna the EU was prominent in trying to resolve the various problems connected with the integration process in Central America, the Andean Community of Nations and Mercosur.</p>
<p>It is with particular satisfaction, then, that I can mention that at Vienna and since Vienna there is and has been adequate progress, so that now we can start the much-needed internal negotiations and take the necessary action to commence talks on Association Agreements between the EU, Central America, the Andean Community and Mercosur. The Association Agreements will complement the agreements that have already been made with Mexico and Chile and those now being negotiated with Mercosur. The European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs held a meeting to review the situation on 11 July.</p>
<p>At the same time we also discussed the possible effects of changes in the membership of the Andean Community and Mercosur due to Venezuela’s decision to go over to Mercosur. Both the current Presidency of the Andean Community, Bolivia, and its General Secretariat deserve credit for their skilful crisis management in recent weeks. Mercosur will be looking at the challenges associated with accepting a new member into its fold. This could also be discussed at the forthcoming meeting with Mercosur on political dialogue. The EU confirms that it is willing to recommence talks with Mercosur as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, may I say that, as is stated in the Council’s conclusions adopted in February 2006, it is the EU’s aim to promote integration throughout the entire region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0703"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drafted by the Presidency is not binding as such on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>The Council and Commission have been keeping a close watch for several years on the trend in roaming charges. The matter has recently become a focus of greater attention, especially since October 2005, when the Commission set up the first website aimed at providing more transparent information to users of roaming services and helping them to find the best solutions in the jungle of prices and deals.</p>
<p>As a result of the Commission’s activities, operators appear to some extent to have lowered their prices and made them more transparent. International roaming charges, however, continue to vary greatly, and customers are often still unable to understand how they are calculated. The softly-softly approach would seem to have proved insufficient, and the Council in its law-making capacity is ready to consider other ways to stamp out overcharging.</p>
<p>The Commission has submitted a proposal for a regulation that might help to put things right. The Council has only just begun to discuss the proposal, which was published on 12 July 2006. It will continue the discussion in cooperation with Parliament and aim specifically for a balanced solution, avoiding distortion of the market, needless disruption to operators’ business, and price rises in other sectors.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0705"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member knows, the plans of the Finnish Presidency regarding climate change were presented when Minister Jan-Erik Enestam spoke to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on 12 July 2006. In brief, these plans are as follows:</p>
<p>During the next few months, the EU will prepare for international negotiations to be conducted at the follow-up conference in Nairobi (6-17 November 2006). At the conference, the EU must again show that it is a strong leader in implementing the Montreal Action Plan in order to create a basis for a system for 2012 and subsequent years which is genuinely worldwide.</p>
<p>To this end, the Presidency is raising climate change issues at summits between the EU and third countries (China, India, the Republic of Korea, ASEM, Russia, Canada). Summits between the EU and China, the Republic of Korea and ASEM have already been held, and the ASEM statement on climate is already available. In order to prepare for the international negotiations, the Council and Parliament will have an opportunity to debate the new cost-benefit analysis of the emission reduction strategy which the European Council has requested from the Commission. The EU and the USA recently decided to launch a dialogue on climate change, clean technology and sustainable development. The first meeting concerning this subject will be held in Finland this autumn.</p>
<p>In addition, the EU is continuing its work to fulfil its commitments. At the proposal of the Commission, the Council and Parliament are again reviewing the European Union's emissions trading system and assessing the second stage of the European Climate Change Programme. The Second European Climate Change Programme, which was launched in October 2005, is investigating new cost-effective options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the principles of the EU's Lisbon Strategy. New working parties have been set up to consider carbon capture and sequestration, carbon dioxide emissions from light commercial vehicles, emissions from aviation and adjustment to the impact of climate change. The working party on aviation has concentrated on technical aspects concerning the extension of emissions trading to emissions from aviation. One working party has also assessed the implementation of the policies and measures of the First European Climate Change Programme in the Member States and their impact on reducing emissions.</p>
<p>Finally it may be mentioned that Finland has compensated for the emissions arising from journeys by those attending some of the meetings which it has organised during its Presidency or offers participants an easy way of adjusting their own emission levels on a voluntary basis.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0707"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly expressed its commitment to a diplomatic solution which takes account of the international concerns that exist regarding Iran's nuclear programme but at the same time affirms Iran's right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In this connection the Council welcomed the initiative by the EU's High Representative and the Foreign Ministers of France, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, the Russian Federation and the United States of America which the Secretary-General of the Council and High Representative communicated to Iran on 6 June 2006.</p>
<p>The Council has given its full support to the balanced approach contained in this initiative and encouraged Iran to opt for the positive course of action proposed to it. The proposal would pave the way for new relations with Iran based on mutual respect and greater political and economic cooperation, while assuaging the international community's concerns about the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme.</p>
<p>The Council would recall that the Board of Governors of the IAEA and the UN Security Council have repeatedly called on Iran to halt all activities pertaining to uranium enrichment and reprocessing. On 31 July the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1606 (2006), calling on Iran to halt all activities pertaining to uranium enrichment and reprocessing, which the IAEA should be allowed to inspect. If Iran did not comply with the resolution by 31 August the UN Security Council stated that it would take measures as provided for in Chapter VII, Article 41(1), of the UN Charter.</p>
<p>The Council has stated that if Iran decides to halt all its uranium enrichment activities and implements the Additional Protocol, negotiations can resume and the procedure in the Security Council be halted.</p>
<p>On 15 September 2006 the Council noted the report of 31 August 2006 by Dr ElBaradei, the Director General of the IAEA, stating that Iran had not acted as called for in UN Security Council Resolution 1696 and expressing the opinion that it would now be appropriate to consider follow-up measures to the resolution in question. The ministers were satisfied with the negotiations which the High Representative had held with Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) Secretary Ali Larijan with the aim of exploring the possibility of launching negotiations with Iran. They supported these efforts and stressed that it was important to bring about a solution quickly.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0709"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>Widespread use of broadband has been on the EU's political agenda for many years and will undoubtedly remain on it in future. Broadband services bolster the attainment of the general objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, and all the development stages of the policies relating to the matter are to be considered in conjunction with the pursuit of the two objectives of the i2010 strategy (which in themselves are compatible).</p>
<p>The first objective is to create a Single European Information Space, promoting a diverse internal market based on open, competitive and electronic communication, messages and content.</p>
<p>The second objective is to create a European information society which promotes participation, in which priority is assigned to improving public services and the quality of life and, in connection with this, reducing the digital divide between the haves and have-nots with regard to access to broadband services.</p>
<p>As the Council stated in its conclusions of 1 December 2005 on the i2010 Strategy, the Member States, Community institutions and stakeholders are jointly responsible for this strategy. The Council called on Member States '… to promote the roll-out of advanced seamless networks through the rapid implementation of national strategies, aimed at increasing broadband coverage and multiplatform access, and stimulating take-up, making use, where appropriate, of EU structural funds, in line with the Commission Guidelines'<a href="#defann_7_1" name="refann_7_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>All the national reform programmes which Member States submitted to the Commission last year after the launching of the Lisbon Strategy discussed issues relating to broadband cover and its introduction. Significant broadband programmes are mentioned in many of the national reform programmes (AT, IE, EE, FI, FR, HU, IT, LU, LT, PT, SI and ES). Although competition is regarded as the most important factor in stimulating the development of broadband communications, EU State aid rules permit Member States to provide State aid for broadband networks in regions where coverage is poor. This is permitted where State aid is used to promote the introduction of broadband and the aid is essential in order to correct a market disturbance or unreasonably high prices for broadband services.</p>
<p>The proposed strategic guidelines for the Community's cohesion policy also state that it is important that an appropriate broadband communications infrastructure should be available at a reasonable price throughout the EU. Accordingly, it has been made a special action guideline of the new cohesion policy programmes for 2007-2013 that the availability of an information and communications infrastructure and associated services should be guaranteed, particularly in peripheral and rural areas and the new Member States, if the market cannot maintain the necessary services at a reasonable price and to a sufficient extent.</p>
<p>At the ministerial meeting in Riga from 11-13 June 2006 at which information and communications technology for a participatory society was debated, a statement was adopted concerning an information society which promotes participation, stating that a large-scale EU strategy was a precondition for this. The EU ministers decided to concentrate, inter alia, on reducing the geographical imbalance in the distribution of broadband by facilitating reasonably priced access to information and communication networks and terminal equipment, content and services everywhere, particularly in remote and rural areas and areas which were in a weaker position, including small population centres, and by reducing substantially regional differences in Internet access, increasing broadband access in poorly covered areas and seeking to ensure that broadband services are available to at least 90% of the EU population by 2010.</p>
<p>The Riga statement called on the Commission to support the gathering of material, the creation of networks at all levels, including regional and local indicators, comparative assessments, exchanges of good practice and experiences gained from Europe and outside it. In addition, the Commission was asked to propose, as part of the 2007 i2010 strategy<a href="#defann_7_2" name="refann_7_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and in accordance with the Riga statement, a common approach to the 2008 information society initiative to promote European participation.</p>
<p>Finally, the ministers encouraged future Presidencies to propose appropriate initiatives and actively continue to support the Commission in developing the 2008 initiative. On this basis, promotion of broadband services in rural areas will be considered at the annual i2010 information society conference to be held in Espoo, Finland on 27 and 28 September 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to the information available to the Presidency of the Council, Ahmed Zakayev’s proposals do not have the support of the other Chechen separatist leaders.

<p>In January-February 2005, the Zapatero Socialist government in Spain made it possible for some 800 000 illegal immigrants to regularise their status. Now the new left-wing Prodi II government is similarly regularising the status of people who are in Italy illegally.</p>
<p>Because of the free movement of persons, hundreds of thousands of people who have undergone this procedure will soon be able to cross Europe's internal without hindrance.</p>

<p>(FI) This answer by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member says, policy on the legalisation of the status of illegal immigrants falls within the sphere of national competence, and so far the Council has not deliberated on the possibility of trying to reach consensus among the Member States on a coordinated approach to regularising the status of such immigrants.</p>
<p>A tangible step in this direction will be the entry into force of the Council Decision on the establishment of a mutual information procedure concerning measures taken by the Member States in the areas of asylum and immigration. The Commission will be responsible for establishing the procedure and managing it. In September 2006 the Council agreed on a general approach to the matter. Still to come is the consideration of the European Parliament’s opinion, after which the instrument can be adopted.</p>
<p>Next year the intention is to begin a study of the regularisation procedures applied by the Member States and their impact on the EU as a whole. The study will form the basis for a future joint debate on legalisation. It will be on this occasion as well that the Member States will also discuss whether there is a need for common EU legislation on the matter.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0720"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>The comprehensive approach to immigration adopted last December deals with priority measures relating to Africa and the Mediterranean region with the aim of reducing migration pressures in those regions. The purpose of the measures is to reinforce cooperation and interaction between the Member States and to increase dialogue and cooperation with African States and the whole Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>The Council is following the progress of the implementation of the comprehensive approach. In addition, the European Council has urged the Commission to report on the progress achieved by the end of 2006.</p>
<p>The Honourable Members' attention is drawn to the practical measures and initiatives listed in the joint answer given by the Council to Oral Questions <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0440_EN.html">H-0440/06</a>, <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0455_EN.html">H-0455/06</a>, <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0460_EN.html">H-0460/06</a>, <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0473_EN.html">H-0473/06</a> and <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0478_EN.html">H-0478/06</a>.</p>
<p>A European and African ministerial meeting, organised by Morocco with the active support of Spain and France, was held in Rabat on 10 and 11 July 2006 to debate immigration and development. At the meeting an action plan was adopted dealing in particular with controlling illegal immigration into the EU from Central and West Africa and the repatriation of illegal immigrants. All the States which took part in the meeting stressed their commitment to implementing the action plan as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>As far as the situation in the Canaries is concerned, the EU has already taken action on account of the arrival of groups of illegal immigrants and has supported Spain with initiatives.</p>
<p>The initiatives in question include a visit to the Canaries by a fact-finding mission from the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX) to monitor the situation on the ground. FRONTEX has also proposed that a joint support group should be set up consisting of officials from FRONTEX and national experts from the Member States and sent to the Canaries.</p>
<p>In June 2006, FRONTEX reported to the Council the findings of a feasibility study concerning the creation of a Mediterranean Coastal Patrols Network operation involving EU Member States and North African countries (the MEDSEA project). Next, there are plans for a technical feasibility study of a monitoring system completely covering the southern sea borders (BORTEC).</p>
<p>FRONTEX has also launched two operations, HERA I and HERA II, with the aim of reducing the numbers of immigrants arriving in the Canaries. HERA I was launched on 15 July and is to run for three months. Experts from the Member States are being sent to help the Spanish authorities to identify immigrants. HERA II concerns monitoring of the sea areas off Mauritania and Senegal and around Cape Verde. The operation was launched in mid-August and is continuing. Italy, Portugal and Finland have helped the Spanish authorities. Spain has signed agreements with Mauritania and Senegal permitting Spanish vessels to patrol their territorial waters. A coordination centre has been set up in Tenerife manned by representatives of certain Member States, a representative of FRONTEX and officials representing the Spanish authorities.</p>
<p>There are plans to launch a similar operation in Malta with the aim of reducing the numbers of migrants arriving there (the JASON I operation). The operation will fall into two parts: identifying and repatriating would-be illegal immigrants found at sea and joint patrols in Libya's coastal waters.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council has begun consideration of a Commission proposal for a regulation establishing a mechanism for the creation of Rapid Border Intervention Teams.</p>
<p>The Honourable Members' attention is also drawn to the fact that, in addition, the European Union is currently formulating a strategy for joint administration of the external borders. Reinforcing such joint administration is among the priorities on the working programme of the Finnish Presidency, and it is discussed in detail in the Commission's communication of July 2006 on policy priorities in the fight against illegal immigration of third-country nationals. In the communication, the Commission lists priority sectors in which measures should be implemented and/or continued, and measures which in its opinion should be adopted.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0717"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>The first part of the Honourable Member's question concerns the situation in Gaza following the attacks by the Israeli army on a base in the northern part of Kerem Shalom on 25 June 2006. In its statement of 30 June, the Presidency reminded all parties of their duty to protect the lives of civilians and that, in the military operations then underway, international law must be respected. It particularly deplored the destruction of essential infrastructure, which had caused a further deterioration in the humanitarian situation in Gaza. The Commission responded to the situation directly by sending fuel to hospitals in Gaza by means of the Temporary International Mechanism so that the hospitals could use their back-up generators. At the extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament on 29 August, the Commission representative provided committee members with extra information about the substantial aid which the EU was giving to the Palestinian people this year. At the international donors' conference in Stockholm on 1 September, the EU gave a strong commitment. At its meeting on 15 September, the Council also welcomed the expansion of the Temporary International Mechanism and agreed to extend its operation for a further three months.</p>
<p>The second part of the question deals with the revival of the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, which the Council supports. The 'form of words recognising Israel', to which the Honourable Member refers, entirely corresponds to one of the three principles of the Quartet, namely that Israel should be recognised. The other two principles are a commitment to non-violence and acceptance of earlier agreements and obligations, including the Road Map. The Council agrees with the Honourable Member that an undertaking by the Palestinian Authority to recognise Israel and a commitment on its part to the other two principles would facilitate progress in the fields mentioned in the question. The issue is central to the on-going political contacts and diplomatic efforts of the EU in this field. This was also reaffirmed at the EU Council meeting on 15 September 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0724"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>Like other significant aid donors, the European Union is fully committed to providing powerful and lasting support to democratic Afghanistan. However, merely giving substantial aid pledges does not alter the fact that the current insurgencies and the numerous illegal armed groups prevent some of the aid from reaching its intended destination in the various parts of the country.</p>
<p>The EU remains one of the leading donors who support the transition process in Afghanistan. At the conferences on Afghanistan in Tokyo (January 2002) and Berlin (March 2004), the European Union pledged USD 3.8 bn (€ 3.1 bn) in reconstruction aid for the years 2002-2006. This amount represents 30% of the total of USD 12.5 bn (€ 10 bn) worth of aid pledged by international donors in Tokyo and Berlin.</p>
<p>Afghanistan receives more aid from the EU than any other beneficiary in Asia. Since 2002 the Commission has granted € 657 m to Afghanistan in reconstruction aid. By the end of 2005 and 2006, at least € 376 m has been/will have been provided in aid, which means that the reconstruction aid provided by the Commission exceeds the pledge of € 1 bn given in 2002. These figures do not include the € 216.5 m in humanitarian aid given between 2001 and 2004. The Commission administers the aid efficiently: appropriations are committed, agreements are concluded concerning them and payments are made without delay.</p>
<p>So far, the EU has managed to fulfil the pledges it gave in London and it is confident about the future. The EU is still fully committed to supporting democracy and stability in Afghanistan in the long term. Like all the donors, the EU constantly assesses the aid it provides to Afghanistan and is fully aware that Afghanistan is still a very challenging environment in which to provide international aid. The EU hopes to be able to concentrate its aid more than hitherto on the provinces outside Kabul and to seek primarily to strengthen government structures and the rule of law in the country.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0733"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>With regard to the first and second questions, may I say that the Council welcomes the joint declaration signed in Athens on 3 September 2006. When the planned oil pipelines to which the honourable Member refers are operational, they will help diversify the supply routes of energy bound for the European Union. The European Councils held in March and June 2006 expressed their unreserved support for diversification of the energy supply routes, as this will improve the reliability of the energy supply in the European Union.</p>
<p>Joint Community funding could be used for the gas pipeline project alluded to in the second question, because the gas pipe between Turkey, Greece and Italy is considered to be a project that is of European interest in the new Decision on the trans-European Network.</p>
<p>Regarding the third question, I would like to mention that the Council and the European Parliament are actively encouraging, through the codecision procedure, only those projects which are mentioned in the new decision on the trans-European Network. These projects relate to gas and electricity networks (as mentioned before, the natural gas pipeline could receive joint Community funding). The conclusions of the March and June 2006 European Councils could be interpreted as providing a political incentive for these projects. In this connection, I should also mention the INOGATE Programme (Interstate Oil and Gas Transport Programme to Europe). The Burgas-Alexandroupolis pipeline has been designated as one priority route for crude oil pipelines under this programme. The INOGATE Programme is currently being financed out of the TACIS Programme, and in future it will receive funding under the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument.</p>
<p>Regarding the environmental considerations alluded to, the Council would like to state that these projects must comply with national environmental norms and procedures and, of course, Community environmental norms must be applied in the European Union, in addition to which the new Decision on the trans-European Network does state that projects, and especially those of European interest, must:</p>
<p>– promote sustainable development and environmental protection by, among other things, reducing the environmental risks associated with the transportation of energy,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>– comply with international environmental conventions.</p>
<p>In this respect the gas pipeline is useful, because it will help reduce the number of consignments being transported by sea in an otherwise very congested Bosphorus Strait.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0757"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>The Council, in collaboration with the European Parliament, has been developing a common energy policy by bringing in legislation packages on energy in phases. These measures help to ensure that there is a stable supply of energy to the EU. The reliability of energy supply, together with the issues of competitiveness and sustainability, also form the basis for the Strategic EU Energy Review, which the European Commission proposes to present to the Council and the European Parliament in 2007, and to which the Council intends, during the Finnish presidential term, to make its own contribution.</p>
<p>Long-term strategic agreements are an important factor in the future of ensuring the supply of energy. But we also need to take into account other contributory factors, in particular those mentioned in the Presidency’s conclusions at the European Councils held in March and June 2006 and in the document produced jointly by the Commission and the Council’s High Representative. The principles set out in these documents include the diversification of sources of energy, transparency in the energy industry and good governance, the creation of transparent and secure conditions for investment and trade in energy, and non-discriminatory transit and third-party access to the infrastructures.</p>
<p>The Council intends to employ the existing Commission structures and cooperation mechanisms to try and revive the dialogue on energy between the EU and Russia. For this reason, another meeting of the Permanent Partnership Council between the Energy Ministers of the EU and Russia is to be held during the Finnish presidential term, and there will be a good number of issues to discuss on the agenda. The best way of ensuring the security of the energy supply between the EU and Russia in the future is to stress the importance of mutual dependence and to include Russia in a binding and coherent regulatory system. The Council is encouraging Russia to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty and to bring to conclusion the talks on the Transit Protocol. Furthermore, the new agreement between the EU and Russia is to have a substantial chapter on energy, which will contain basic principles of cooperation on energy.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council would like to mention that the European Parliament and the Council recently adopted a Decision on trans-European energy networks, which will be an important step towards the diversification of energy sources and energy transportation routes, and thus a major improvement in securing the energy supply. This objective should also be realised when the Energy Community Treaty with the countries of South-East Europe is concluded and comes into force, as the agreement will extend the internal energy market model to neighbouring countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0736"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member knows, the decision on issuing the Directive on air quality will be taken by the European Parliament and the Council through the codecision procedure. While awaiting the results of the European Parliament’s first reading, the Council adopted a general approach to the Directive on 27 June 2006. The Directive’s purpose is to prevent and restrict the risks and negative environmental impact of air pollution on human health. With regard to fine particles (PM2.5), the compromise package contained a two-phase scheme which consisted of a non-binding target value for 2010 and a binding limit value to replace it in 2015. This would make it possible to gather data in Europe on concentration levels of PM2.5 particles. The limit values for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, PM10 particles, lead, benzene and carbon monoxide have not been altered. On certain stringent conditions, exemption from the obligations applying to PM10 particles, nitrogen dioxide and benzene can be requested for a limited period.</p>
<p>The Council believes that the Directive is a step forward for improved air quality, and trusts that the European Parliament will consider the matter, so that the conditions necessary for establishing the agreement might be laid down.</p>

<p>In connection with this, a major financial incentive was introduced, which was offered to the least productive sugar companies in the form of adequate restructuring aid, in order that they should end their production under quota. All companies that produce sugar, isoglucose or insulin syrup, for which a quota has been granted until 1 July 2006, are entitled to restructuring assistance, which will be paid per tonne of quota renounced, provided that they give up their quota in the marketing years 2006/2007, 2007/2008, 2008/2009 or 2009/2010.</p>
<p>The Council has taken the social aspects of factory closures into account in the regulation alluded to. To receive restructuring assistance, a factory must submit an application to the Member State in question, which should contain a restructuring proposal. The proposal should present a rationalisation proposal suggesting measures for the retraining of employees, for their transfer to new jobs, and for early retirement.

<p>Like the questioner, the Council is worried about the situation regarding ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. So far the Convention has been signed by all the Member States and seven have ratified it. It entered into force on 1 July 2004 and is at present being applied in the above-mentioned seven Member States.</p>
<p>In May 2006 the Presidency asked the other Member States to report on their ratification procedures by the end of the year.</p>
<p>On 24 February 2005 the Council also adopted a Framework Decision on attacks against information systems (2005/222/JHA). The decision states that it is necessary to complement the work performed by international organisations, in particular the Council of Europe’s work on approximating criminal law relating to high-tech crime, by providing a common EU approach in this area. Member States have to take the necessary measures to comply with the provisions of the framework decision at the latest by 16 March 2007.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0749"></a>

<p>I am deeply concerned that over 1200 children's books have not yet been cleared by Turkish customs despite having arrived in Turkey more than two weeks ago. The final destination of the books is the town of Batman in northern Kurdistan. The books are either written by Swedish children's authors or are used in Swedish schools. The books form part of a project run by the Sweden-based children's rights organisation KOMAK and are financed by SIDA through the Olof Palme International Centre. The project is part of a programme - for which the Foreign Ministry has overall responsibility - which aims to support the democratisation of Turkey. On 7 August, the books reached Istanbul, where they were detained by Turkish customs as no customs agent had undertaken to clear them despite the haulage company's prompting.</p>
<p>To be able to initiate negotiations for accession to the EU, the Copenhagen political criteria must be fulfilled. In accordance with those criteria, the country concerned must be able to guarantee democracy and the protection of human rights, including the protection of minorities. I consider that not allowing children's books in Kurdish to be imported into the country is a clear infringement of the Copenhagen criteria.

<p>(FI) This answer by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>The Council is not aware of the particular case to which the honourable Member is alluding. This is nevertheless to do with the general issue of the protection of minorities. That being so, I would like to stress yet again that the Union considers this to be an important issue. This is one of those crucial areas where we still need to make persistent efforts to ensure that Turkey promotes cultural diversity and respect for, and the protection of, minorities, in accordance with the principles endorsed in the European Convention on Human Rights and the Council of Europe’s Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, and with best practices in Member States.</p>
<p>Although some measures have been implemented, especially with regard to private local radio broadcasting in the Kurdish language, more action is needed to eliminate the obstacles that remain. We also need proper measures to encourage the study of languages other than Turkish. The negotiating framework covers these issues, and they are short-term priorities in the revised Accession Partnership. The Union will be raising them systematically at all levels as part of the process of reform underway in Turkey. It has done so at the most recent EU-Turkey Association Council meeting in Luxembourg on 12 June 2006.</p>
<p>Consequently, the honourable Member can rest assured that the EU continues to monitor developments in the field closely, in order to be able to assess Turkey’s progress towards accession. These developments naturally direct the progress of talks.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0755"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>The Council does indeed believe that a well planned energy policy can promote growth and competitiveness in the European Union. Many factors help to achieve this objective:</p>
<p>First of all, energy efficiency is one of the prime aims. In Europe there is still much scope for investing cost-effectively in energy efficiency. Progress in this field will help European undertakings, because on the one hand it will reduce their energy costs and on the other hand it will increase the competitiveness of European technology in this sector. During the current Presidency, practical steps are being taken by putting into practice a directive on ecological planning, a directive on the energy efficiency of buildings, and a directive on the efficiency of the end use of energy and energy saving. In addition, the Council expects the Commission to submit its energy efficiency action plan, recommending the necessary action to improve energy efficiency, to which the Council will respond appropriately. As regards R&amp;D, the Council draws the Honourable Member's attention to the proposal for the 7th Framework Programme, in which energy efficiency is among the principal objectives in the field of energy. It is therefore essential that cooperation between the European Parliament and the Council should be effective and productive, so that the Framework Programme can be adopted by the end of this year. In addition, mention may be made the Framework Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation, which will be approved shortly. It includes an 'intelligent energy' programme and therefore measures to promote the use of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency and competitiveness by means of integrated projects.</p>
<p>Energy efficiency is also to be regarded as an essential factor in the innovation process. This is stated in the comprehensive communication, 'An EU-wide Innovation Strategy: From Theory to Practice', which has just been published, stressing that making efficiency objectives part of environmental innovation could serve as a model for other aspects of energy.</p>
<p>Secondly, it may be said that the operation of Europe's internal energy market should be improved with the aim of liberalising it completely by permitting more competition. In this way the cost of distributing and purchasing energy would be reduced for the benefit of Europe's businesses and citizens.</p>
<p>The Council is cooperating with the Commission to attain this objective, particularly on the basis of the two Commission communications on gas and energy market directives and on the basis of research into electricity and gas.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the Council is adopting the same approach in its relations with third countries: it is seeking to improve the operation of third countries' energy sectors and to develop regulation and competition in these fields, which has an impact on Europe's economy. For example, creating a common regional energy market for electricity grids and natural gas networks in South-Eastern Europe and linking it to the wider European market is an important step to promote and maintain economic development. Promoting energy efficiency in cooperation with third countries is also an element in the Council's policy in this field. At the G8 meeting in St Petersburg, the Presidency and the Commission supported energy efficiency initiatives, whose aim is to improve energy efficiency in many fields worldwide. Energy and energy efficiency were important subjects at the ASEM meeting in Helsinki in September and also at bilateral meetings held with Russia and other countries during this Presidency. Another example of this is the recently approved renewal of the Energy Star Agreement with the United States on office equipment; the Council will consider the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion and signature of the agreement as soon as it receives it. The aim is to adopt the proposal as soon as possible, relying on good cooperation with the European Parliament over the matter. The same applies to the EU Regulation incorporating the bilateral agreement into Community law.</p>
<p>This was a brief overview of the Council's plans for bringing its influence to bear on the growth and competitiveness of Europe's economy by means of energy policy in the next few months.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0761"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>The European Council that was convened on 15 and 16 June 2006 confirmed that it would be adhering to the plan for a second generation Schengen Information System, to be up and running by April 2007. An evaluation, carried out by technical working parties, of the data supplied by Departments of the European Commission, however, leads the Presidency to believe that enlargement of the Schengen zone will be unavoidably delayed.</p>
<p>The Presidency proposes to organise a debate at the meeting of the Council in December on the general timetable for inclusion of the new Schengen countries, but the discussion first of all depends on clarification by the Commission of many of the points in the project’s plan. Secondly, an evaluation timetable needs to be drawn up for the new Schengen countries, on the basis of the plan submitted by Departments of the Commission.</p>
<p>Furthermore, new legal instruments with regard to SIS II need to be adopted. The technical specifications have to be adapted to those instruments with which the adoption of the instruments and the System’s development are interlinked. The Commission’s Departments have already said that a description of the technical specifications can only be finalised when agreement has been reached on the instruments. The Member States will need to assess the possible consequences of this setback with reference to the information available at the time of the December Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0768"></a>

In addition, at the bilateral troika meeting on 10 September the EU informed the Burmese Foreign Minister of its most serious causes of concern and condemned the fact that Aung Sun Suu Kyi remained under house arrest and other prisoners of conscience were being held in detention.

<p>According to the majority of reports from aid and advocacy agencies working in Burma and along its borders, conditions in that country have deteriorated considerably over the past year. SPDC government offensives in the Karen and Karenni States have resulted in an increased number of refugees fleeing across the border into Thailand. The use of rape as a tool of war in an attempt to destroy ethnic nationality groups across the country has been well documented. Another report has documented at least 50 cases, in 2006 alone, of Kachin women who have been trafficked from Burma into China. The women are sold as sex slaves or ‘wives’ to brothels or Chinese men. The Finnish Presidency decided to waive the visa ban on the SPDC Foreign Minister to allow him to attend the ASEM summit in Helsinki. Unsurprisingly, at the summit EU officials were once again told by the SPDC that they need ‘more time’ to implement democratic and human rights reforms.</p>

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>The European Union monitors closely the situation in Burma/Myanmar and, in that context, the situation of ethnic minorities in the country. As the Honourable Member surely knows, in May the Council severely condemned the attacks on civilians which followed the escalation of operations by the Burmese/Myanma army against the Karen National Union (KNU). The army's actions compelled a considerable number of people to move from their home area in the north of the Karen region, and in addition a substantial fresh wave of refugees fled to Thailand.</p>
<p>The EU has consistently called upon the leadership of Burma/Myanmar to cease its abuses against civilians and to put an end to refugee movements in the regions of conflict, and it urges both parties to fully respect international humanitarian law. The EU supports the regional inviolability of Burma/Myanmar but urges its government to protect the human rights of all citizens and groups, irrespective of their ethnic origin or religion.</p>
<p>At all its meetings with Burma/Myanmar, the EU urges the government to allow international organisations and NGOs unhindered access to the country, particularly to provide humanitarian aid, to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit political prisoners without supervision and to facilitate independent investigations.</p>
<p>By waiving the visa ban on U Nyan Win the EU had the opportunity, at a Troika meeting and in the presence of other Asian Foreign Ministers, to inform the Foreign Minister of Burma/Myanmar directly, in detail and unambiguously that the EU was still frustrated by the situation in Burma/Myanmar and shocked that the Government of Burma/Myanmar had not significantly promoted the democratisation of the country and improved the human rights situation. Similarly, the EU had the opportunity to express its concern about the situation of the country's ethnic minorities, particularly in the Karen region.</p>
<p>The Council also regularly raises the situation in Burma/Myanmar at political dialogue meetings with the neighbours of Burma/Myanmar, including China, and urges them continuously to use their contacts with Burma/Myanmar to bring about change in the direction of democracy, national reconciliation and sustainable development. In this way the Council also expresses its view that it would be to the advantage of neighbouring countries to support good governance and administrative capacity in Burma/Myanmar, which would make it easier to deal, for example, with trafficking in human beings and drugs and with the spread of infectious diseases.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0770"></a>

<p>The Council is well aware of the anxieties which local producers in the Member States, and especially in Poland, have been expressing about imports of frozen strawberries from China.</p>
<p>The questioner will no doubt be familiar with the general anti-dumping rules, which require the Commission to open investigations and enforce temporary measures. The Commission opened an investigation on 19 January 2006 with a view to ascertaining whether the imports concerned constitute dumping in the legal sense and are adversely affecting the economic position of frozen strawberry production. If, in the light of that investigation, the Commission concludes that temporary measures should be taken, they would have to enter into force not later than 18 October 2006 and continue to apply for at most six months.</p>
<p>If in due course the Commission ultimately concludes that definitive measures need to be taken, it will send an official proposal to the Council. The Council would then have to decide on the measures in question within a month.

<p>(EN) As rightly stated by the Honourable Member, the Commission is in the process of preparing an important initiative relating to the role of sport in Europe, with a view to the possible adoption of a White Paper on this subject.</p>
<p>Scope and aims of the intended White Paper</p>
<p>The envisaged White Paper on sport could be based on a stocktaking exercise aiming to clarify the important role which sport plays in Europe in societal and in economic terms and pointing to its potential to contribute to the Commission’s overall political objectives. It would also address the interests of sport as well as the challenges the specific organisation of sport is facing today in Europe, including in terms of public governance.</p>
<p>The envisaged White Paper would also seek to identify future actions concerning the profile of sport. The White Paper would therefore require close cooperation with different Commission services and further consultations with stakeholders.</p>
<p>Ideally, the initiative will be able to respond to expectations raised by sport stakeholders who have expressed their views within the dialogue framework “The EU &amp; Sport: Matching expectations” set up by the Commission in 2005. There are also concrete demands, including those from EU governments, to address recent developments relating to sport in Europe.</p>
<p>Cooperation with the Parliament is also crucial to the success of the initiative. The Commission therefore welcomes the timing of the planned report on “professional football” on which it stands ready to cooperate. The results of this report could feed into the envisaged White Paper.</p>
<p>Timescale</p>
<p>In terms of timing, therefore, the Commission considers that the momentum exists to launch an important initiative, such as the intended White Paper on sport, in 2007.</p>
<p>Naturally, a broad consultation process, involving governmental and non-governmental actors, has to precede the drafting and publication of such a document. The Commission has now entered an intense period of internal and external consultations which will continue until early 2007.</p>
<p>On the external side, the Commission started in June 2006 with a Consultation Conference involving the broader European Sport Movement. Five days ago the Commissioner in charge of Education, Training, Culture and Multilingualism met with the leaders of European Sport Federations to discuss sport governance in Europe. Later in the autumn an on-line consultation will give the opportunity for everybody to voice interests and concerns on some key areas of the White Paper. The Commission continues to encourage sport organisations to participate in this process.</p>
<p>The Commission is open to examining further the specific concerns of sport organisations. Their written contributions are welcome at every stage of the consultation process. In order to structure the consultation process, the Commission calls on sport organisations to make their voices heard through their European umbrella organisations. This has worked very well in the recent past and should help us accomplish this challenging exercise.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0747"></a>

<p>(EN) The European Qualifications Framework's (EQF) objective is to improve the transparency of qualifications in order to promote lifelong learning and the geographical and occupational mobility of learners and workers.</p>
<p>The draft proposal recommends that Member States use the EQF as a reference tool to facilitate comparisons between qualifications awarded under different systems. It also recommends that Member States relate their national qualifications systems to the EQF and, where appropriate, develop national qualifications frameworks. Member States are also recommended to ensure that new qualifications and “Europass” documents contain a reference to the appropriate EQF level. These recommendations, if implemented, will promote the transparency and comparability of individual qualifications where no mandatory instruments exist. In accordance with Articles 149 and 150 of the Treaty, binding Community legislation on matters such as the EQF may not be adopted.</p>
<p>The EQF will therefore benefit awarding institutions and authorities by making it easier for them to interpret the variety of qualifications awarded under different education and training systems, as well as making the qualifications which they award more transparent to others. Where Member States adopt or already have National Qualifications Frameworks, this will, of course, make the implementation of the EQF much more effective.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0772"></a>

<p>(EN) Through the Socrates and Leonardo programmes, the Commission has invested over €30 million a year in practical projects that stimulate the enthusiasm of language learners and their teachers. These include school exchanges, language assistantships and teacher training schemes under the Comenius action, and awareness raising activities and the development of innovative learning tools under the Lingua action.</p>
<p>In addition, there has been an enormous investment in mobility through the Erasmus action and the Leonardo programme, both of which include funding for linguistic preparation courses, the Youth programme and the town-twinning action. The reports the Commission receives from participants in these actions show that mobility is a key factor in motivating people to learn about their neighbours, and to learn their languages.</p>
<p>These types of activity will continue in the new Life Long Learning Programme that will run from 2007-2013, specifically via the Languages Key Activity and the Comenius, Erasmus and Leonardo sub-programmes. As the Honourable Member will know, however, in accordance with Article 149 of the Treaty, the Commission has to respect fully the responsibility of Member States for the content of teaching syllabuses, the organisation of their education system, and their cultural and linguistic diversity.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0708"></a>

<p>(FR) Immediately after the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, the Commission drew up a framework regulation on civil aviation security. The regulation was adopted in December 2002<a href="#defann_37_1" name="refann_37_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. It sets out common basic standards on aviation security measures and appropriate mechanisms for compliance monitoring, including inspections by the Commission.</p>
<p>Since it came into force, 10 implementing regulations detailing the measures and technical adaptations of common basic standards have been adopted by the Commission through the comitology procedure. With the help of the Committee on Civil Aviation Security, the Commission regularly reviews the civil aviation security measures and adjusts them if necessary.</p>
<p>Since February 2004, the Commission has also been carrying out regular inspections in Member States’ airports, to ensure they comply with common standards. The Commission has carried out over 70 inspections to date.</p>
<p>In September 2005, on the basis of its experience of implementing the framework regulation, the Commission proposed a revision of the regulation<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The aim of the revision is simplification of the current framework regulation. It will ensure greater flexibility, allowing a rapid response to new threats, implementation of the latest technological developments, and better protection of sensitive information on security standards.</p>
<p>The revised proposal for a framework regulation was presented to Parliament and the Council on 23 September 2005 and is currently at the stage of first reading by the Council. The Commission considers speedy adoption of this regulation very important.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue its unceasing efforts to ensure harmonised implementation of common aviation security measures, with the aim of preventing acts of unlawful interference in civil aviation in Europe. Moreover, the Commission, with the Committee on Civil Aviation Security, is in the process of developing an appropriate response to the new threats revealed by recent events.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) With regard to the ‘Magistrale for Europe’, the report by Mr Balázs, European coordinator for priority axis No 17 (Paris-Stuttgart-Vienna-Bratislava) indicates that the modernisation of the rail axis in question – part of the work on which is already under way – should be almost entirely completed by 2015. The French, German, Austrian and Slovakian Transport Ministers have confirmed their desire for that to be the case by signing a statement of intention on 9 June 2006.</p>
<p>As for the line between Munich and Kufstein (Austrian border), it is not a high-speed line but a conventional line. This line, which is located on the Brenner axis, has been subject to refurbishments over recent years. In the medium term, its capacity is expected to be increased within the context of the opening of the future Brenner Base Tunnel in 2016. Studies are scheduled in 2007-2008 to identify the best technical solutions. In particular, these studies will examine the Rosenheim bypass for goods trains and the cross-border section between Germany and Austria.

<p>(FR) It is true that goods transport by rail via the Brenner Pass has been decreasing for some years. This fall is largely due to the difficulties with the ‘rolling road', that is, the transport service carrying lorries by train, which has diminished since the ‘ecopoints’ system came to an end at the end of 2003. Nevertheless, the results from the first half of 2006 show that traffic on the rolling road on the Brenner route has picked up considerably.</p>
<p>Over a longer period, we should bear in mind that current rail traffic via the Brenner Pass is twice the volume that it was in 1990. Over the same period, road transport has also doubled.</p>
<p>Traffic using the Brenner axis will continue to grow strongly over the coming years. In the current circumstances, this increase would essentially be absorbed by rail traffic, which raises the serious problem of pollution in the Alpine valleys and congestion.</p>
<p>The current operating conditions for the railway line through the pass are not suited to attracting a large volume of traffic. Two to three locomotives are required to ascend to the pass and two to come back down and the maximum length and weight of the trains is too restricted.</p>
<p>The Brenner Base Tunnel project, which includes the Brenner Base Tunnel and its access routes in Austria and Italy, will make an almost flat route possible. A locomotive will be able to travel without stopping from Munich to Verona with longer and heavier trains. The elimination of additional traction locomotives to ascend to the pass and of lengthy procedures at borders will reduce operating costs considerably.</p>
<p>The Brenner Base Tunnel is one of the list of priority projects of the trans-European network established by Parliament and the Council. Within the context of the preparations for this project, a socio-economic viability study was carried out in 2004. This study, which takes account of the access routes, indicates that the work will offer a net benefit as a whole.</p>
<p>The funding structure for the project will take the form of a public-private partnership the form of which is currently under discussion. The European Coordinator, Mr Karel Van Miert, and the European Investment Bank are directly involved in these discussions. The objective of all of the partners in the project is the presentation by the bi-national promoter BBT SE, on the recommendation of an advisory consortium led by KPMG and following an international call for tenders launched at the beginning of 2006, of a definitive plan – including the legal and financial aspects – at the beginning of 2007.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to stress that this project falls within the context of a global policy on Alpine crossing. The Swiss tunnels under construction, the Montcenis Tunnel project and the Brenner Tunnel project are complementary since they respond to different flows of traffic: the Swiss tunnels will not reduce the growth in road transport via the Brenner Pass.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

This is extremely complicated, expensive or simply impossible to carry out. The maritime safety directive therefore threatens steamboat services which have operated in Swedish waters since the 19th century.

The argument that the Commission was seeking to harmonise the legislation on ticket prices and crew composition is not valid since the actual increases over the last three years have been in excess of 250%. Shipowners and the Ministry of Mercantile Marine are using the criterion of shipping companies' profits to determine the organisational structure, the routes and frequency of services of vessels, thereby creating hazardous conditions which may result in a new shipwreck similar to that of the Samina Express and putting the lives of passengers and crews at greater risk.</p>

<p>(EN) Europe can build on a strong research base in the different disciplines of the humanities. Over the last years, research projects from these communities have benefited from a steadily increasing support through the Framework Programmes.</p>
<p>Already during the Fifth Framework Programme (FP5), the EU supported projects involving researchers from the humanities, notably addressing issues of European identity and identity building (including a historical perspective) and values linked to democracy and citizenship.</p>
<p>Under FP6, the humanities were explicitly addressed in several calls and more than 10 projects are currently under way in a number of areas, notably in the field of linguistics and history:</p>

<p>5 Specific targeted research project (STREP) and 2 Coordination Actions (CA)</p></table>
<p>Information on these projects is available under http://cordis.europa.eu/citizens/home.html</p>
<p>For FP7, the idea is to strengthen further the involvement of the humanities within the overall context of Theme 8 "Socio-economic Sciences and the Humanities". For instance, the proposed text for the specific programme gives the following keywords for the humanities: cultural interactions; traditions; cultural heritage; approaches to multiple coexisting cultures, the role of language, arts and religions; attitudes and values.</p>
<p>To further increase the participation of the humanities and to encourage inter- and multidisciplinary research between the social sciences and humanities, an expert group for the humanities was established in May 2006.</p>
<p>In parallel, the Commission launched a web based consultation, inviting the research community to comment on a first draft research agenda for Theme 8.</p>
<p>Against this background, the preparation of the Work Programme for 2007-2008 for Theme 8 is under way. While at this stage it would be premature to reveal any details, it should be highlighted that research issues related to literature and the arts, as well as to cultural interactions and approaches to multiple coexisting cultures are likely to be on the agenda of the first Call for Proposals. The publication of this Call will take place very soon after FP7 comes into force.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the new proposed Culture programme (2007-2013), which will hopefully be adopted by the end of 2006, is also another financing instrument of the Commission in the field of culture. Following its adoption, Calls for Proposals will most likely be published early in 2007; a preliminary Call for Proposals for 2007 with the most important information is however foreseen for October 2006.</p>
<p>The general objective of the proposed programme is to enhance the cultural area common to Europeans through the development of cultural cooperation between the creators, cultural players and cultural institutions of the countries taking part in the programme, with a view to encouraging the emergence of European citizenship. The specific objectives of the programme are: 1) to promote the transnational mobility of people working in the cultural sector; 2) to encourage the transnational circulation of works and cultural and artistic products; and 3) to encourage intercultural dialogue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0699"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU market has to date been reacting well to the new import regime for bananas consisting of a tariff rate of €176/ton and a duty-free quota of 775.000 tons for bananas from African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP) countries, which has replaced since 1 January 2006 the previous quota regime.</p>
<p>In the light of the continuing high sensitivity of the issue which has been the subject of long-standing trade disputes, the new import regime has been subject since the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference of December 2005 to a monitoring and review mechanism under the good offices of Minister Støre of Norway. The aim is to determine the tariff rate to be consolidated at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on the basis of which any future reductions resulting from the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations would apply. In the context of the DDA negotiations, which are for the time being suspended, the Commission has also been resisting the request of a number of countries to treat bananas as a tropical product and thus to apply higher reductions to the tariff rate.</p>
<p>The Commission is monitoring very closely the operation of the new import regime and participating constructively in the Støre process with a view to reaching agreement that would provide an adequate level of protection of the EU market and hopefully at the same time put an end to the bananas dispute.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0702"></a>

<p>(EN) The main objective of the 2003 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform was to improve the competitiveness of the EU agricultural sector. The new CAP encourages farmers to make better returns from the market rather than calculate the best subsidy combination. It also promotes high standards of environmental care, animal welfare and food safety that equip EU agriculture to face the challenges of a reasonable future trade environment.</p>
<p>An ambitious outcome of the currently interrupted World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations on trade liberalisation will certainly represent a challenge for the EU agriculture, in particular the implementation of lower tariffs and the projected elimination of export refunds. At the same time, a WTO deal will open new market opportunities for EU agricultural exports, especially for high value added and quality products.</p>
<p>There is no reason, for the moment, to plan any change in the policy content of the 2003 CAP reform. A "Health Check" is foreseen in 2008 for the main instruments of the CAP. The objective is to maintain the thrust of the CAP reform – sustainability in economic, environmental and social terms – which will remain valid in the future.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member also raises the question from a budgetary point of view. By the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management the financial perspectives have been decided for the whole period 2007-2013. In December 2005 the European Council invited the Commission to make "a full wide-ranging review in 2008/2009 covering all aspects of EU spending, including the CAP, and of resources, including the United Kingdom rebate". This will therefore be a review which will address the budgetary issue raised by the Honourable Member. The Parliament will be associated with this review.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0704"></a>

<p>(EN) The final agreement on a Financial Framework for the EU 2007-2013 provides a coherent and stable framework for financing an enlarged EU over the next seven years.</p>
<p>Over the whole period, the EU will spend €74 billion on programmes and initiatives under Sub-Heading 1A, focusing directly on competitiveness and employment. In addition to this, substantial investment under other headings will help to promote growth and employment in Europe and, thus, contribute to strengthening our global competitiveness. This applies, in particular, to the €308 billion allocation under Sub-Heading 1B which target cohesion for growth and employment. The EU will thus invest €382 billion, or 44 percent of its overall budget, to stimulate growth, employment and competitiveness.</p>
<p>Expenditure devoted to competitiveness for growth and employment (sub-heading 1A) will increase by about 70% between 2006 and 2013 and those devoted to cohesion for growth and employment (sub-heading 1B) will increase by more than 20% in the same period.</p>
<p>Examples of specific programmes that will improve Europe's ability to compete on the global market include the new Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP), the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Research Framework Programme, the Lifelong Learning programme, the Galileo programme or the Trans-European Networks.</p>
<p>In addition, the recently proposed European Globalisation Fund, will contribute to tackling the social costs of the adjustment process that the EU is undergoing to promote competitiveness in the context of changing world trade patterns. This instrument will be financed using unspent funds.</p>
<p>The financial framework offers a basis for a more competitive EU over the next seven years, and EU funding can clearly play a catalyst role in this regard. This being said, promoting growth, jobs and competitiveness is very much a shared responsibility and will require similar efforts by the Member States. While the ground has been laid, the ambition and the actions at European level will have to be matched by investments and contributions by public and private actors at all levels to allow Europe fully to grow and prosper.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0710"></a>

<p>(EN) It is a basic principle of the Sixth Value Added Tax (VAT) Directive<a href="#defann_51_2" name="refann_51_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> that the VAT incurred on the costs borne by a taxable person is deductible only insofar as these costs are linked to the provision by him of taxable supplies.</p>
<p>Article 13, A, 1, (a) and B, (e), provides that the supply of public postal services and of postage stamps are exempted from VAT. When the activities of an operator are covered by this provision, goods and services supplied (as outputs) are exempted from VAT but the VAT incurred on its purchases of goods and services (as inputs) is not deductible.</p>
<p>It is however true that this VAT exemption for public postal services and postage stamps is not fully suited to the postal market as liberalised through Directive 97/67/EC. The current VAT exemption distorts competition between operators such as the former state monopolies who benefit from the exemption and other operators that do not. Disparities in the way this exemption is applied throughout the Community have already been pointed out by the Commission.</p>
<p>To deal with this situation the Commission proposed<a href="#defann_51_3" name="refann_51_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> in 2003 to remove the current VAT exemption on public postal services and postage stamps together with an option for Member States of applying a reduced VAT rate to a wide range of postal services. This latter aspect would limit the impact on prices for private customers. Member States have however been unable to reach an agreement and the proposal remains blocked in the Council.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a proper application of the VAT postal exemption throughout the Community is needed. The Commission has been obliged to launch infringement proceedings against some Member States<a href="#defann_51_4" name="refann_51_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> where the current VAT exemption is not being correctly applied. In the meantime, the Commission urges the Council to resume discussion and adopt the Commission proposal for modernising the VAT treatment of postal services. The current situation is clearly unsatisfactory for all sides including, as the Honourable Member points out, the exempt sector operators who are unable to recover VAT on much needed investment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The promotion of academic and educational exchanges is an important aspect of the EU-India Joint Action Plan agreed at the last EU-India Summit in September 2005. It is a key element of our efforts to enhance EU visibility in India and demonstrate that Europe, like India, is also about the future.</p>
<p>The Commission has allocated €33 million to the India Window of the Erasmus Programme for the period 2005-2007. This amount should allow the funding of approximately 900 scholarships over a three-year period (2005-2007).</p>
<p>Erasmus Mundus has been extremely successful in India. In the first two years of implementation of the India Window of the Programme, about half of the total amount has been used to fund more than 400 scholarships for Indian students. In the third and last year of implementation of the window (academic year 2007-2008), the Commission is expecting to fund some 500 additional scholarships.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this result, the Commission, through its Delegation in Delhi, has recently intensified efforts aimed at disseminating information about Erasmus Mundus in India. An important European Higher Education Fair, which will be held in Delhi on 24-26 November 2006, will be used to raise further awareness about the opportunities offered by the Programme.</p>
<p>Following the positive outcome of its first phase, discussions are underway within the Commission to extend the India Window of Erasmus Mundus after 2007.</p>
<p>To respond to the Honourable Member's concern, the Commission would note that more than half of the Indian students who have received scholarships under Erasmus to study in Europe intend to study science and technology.</p>
<p>The Commission and Indian authorities have not envisaged replicating the Executive Training Programme (ETP) in India because the main purpose of this programme is to provide training to European professionals in the languages of key export markets for the EU (China, Japan and Korea) in which the knowledge of European languages is not widespread. The systematic use of English in business contacts with India does not make it necessary to extend such a programme to this country.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0716"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the seriousness of the damages caused by forest fires this summer, particularly in the region of Galicia, and it would like to express its deep compassion with those who were affected.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently tendering a study to get a comprehensive overview on the causes affecting forest deterioration in the EU, including forest fires. This study, the findings of which are expected at the end of 2007, should result in concrete proposals for preventing forest deterioration at EU level. The study is part of the EU Forest Action Plan that the Commission presented in June 2006<a href="#defann_53_1" name="refann_53_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. In addition, the LIFE+ proposal<a href="#defann_53_2" name="refann_53_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> joins the existing tools to support environmental actions in a new, broader and more integrated instrument. The proposal foresees to support forest monitoring programmes and forest fire prevention, allowing for the continuation of activities implemented under the Forest Focus Regulation, which will expire at the end of 2006.</p>
<p>As for the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), substantial changes have been introduced in recent years following the 2003/2004 CAP reforms. Rural development policy promotes sustainable development of rural areas, helping to improve competitiveness of agriculture and forestry and the creation of new sources of income and employment in rural areas. The new Rural Development Regulation<a href="#defann_53_3" name="refann_53_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> for the period 2007 - 2013 includes a number of forestry measures that the Member States can implement according to their priorities, including forest fire prevention measures and restoration of forests damaged by fires.</p>
<p>As regards the Solidarity Fund, the Member State concerned has to make an application to the Commission within ten weeks of the date of the first damage. As of 26 September 2006 no such application has been received from the Spanish government. The possibility of financial assistance from the Solidarity Fund depends on whether the criteria in the Regulation<a href="#defann_53_4" name="refann_53_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> for mobilising the Fund are met. Financial assistance from the Solidarity Fund may be used for a limited number of emergency operations carried out by the public authorities, such as provisional repair of vital infrastructures, providing temporary accommodation or funding rescue services. The Fund may not compensate for private losses, including in agriculture and forestry.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The firm of Tréfimétaux, which is part of the Italian group KME and specialises in copper processing, is to relocate its French-based smelting and laminating operations to Germany and Italy, at a cost of 215 jobs. This decision makes no sense from the point of view of the firm’s competitiveness, since the German factory is less productive and labour costs there are higher. The decision taken by KME, under pressure from the finance company INTEK which requires rates of return of 18%, will drive customers into the arms of non-EU suppliers. The problem is due to unscrupulous shareholders who compromise the firm's strategy and its very existence to get a return on their short-term speculative investments.</p>

<p>(EN) Job losses due to company relocation are a concern for the Commission. However, the Honourable Member will be aware that the Treaty provides for the freedom of capital movements within the European Union, except in specified circumstances, as a condition for the smooth functioning of the Single Market. Company relocation is a normal phenomenon in economic life. It reflects a process of efficient allocation of resources across the EU economy, allowing investment to flow to those projects offering the highest rate of return and enabling the economy to restructure and diversify. Unfortunately, there are unavoidable adjustment costs in this process of resource reallocation, as capital, jobs and know-how move from projects in one location to another. However, the overall effect of company movements on the performance of the EU economy and the welfare of EU citizens remains positive. It would, therefore be counterproductive to discourage or prohibit this economic process.</p>
<p>The European Union has, however, a number of very clear rules that apply in these kinds of circumstances, and we must firmly insist that they be kept. For example, any such decision must be preceded by proper information and consultation of workers' representatives, as provided for in several Community Directives. Social dialogue is a crucial issue in this context, as the Commission systematically recalls.</p>
<p>Businesses bear considerable social responsibility for Europe, and this should be made generally apparent. The Commission does not criticise, a priori, any decision by a company that involves relocation. What it does, however, is pursue policies which place sustainable solutions above short-term benefits. This is not just a question of social responsibility, but also of achieving our industrial policy goals, an active industrial policy that keeps industry in Europe.</p>
<p>And the Commission is also putting in place a series of instruments which can help softening the social impact of change and restructuring. The Structural Funds and the European Social Fund in particular, can play a major role in this. The Commission is insisting that Member States fully integrate in their national priorities and programming the focus defined at European level on adaptation to change.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0725"></a>

<p>(EN) Vice President in charge of Justice, Freedom and Security did indeed refer to the European Unions Situation Centre – generally known as the "SitCen" - in the referred interview to the Italian newspaper l'Espresso. The Commission welcomes the contribution of SitCen to the EU's security following the reinforcement of its means and mandate in the aftermath of the Madrid terrorist attacks of 11 March 2004.</p>
<p>The expression "center of various coordinated secret services" mentioned by the Honourable Member was not used as such by Vice President in charge of Justice, Freedom and Security to describe the SitCen. That expression was actually used by l'Expresso which refers in Italian to a "centro di coordinamento dei servizi a Bruxelles". That expression may induce the reader in error regarding the activities of the SitCen which do not include coordination of any operational counter-terrorist activities but only that of relevant strategic intelligence analysis.</p>
<p>At any rate, there is nothing secretive about either the original creation of the SitCen to support the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy in the late 90's or the decision to extend its mandate to provide the Council with strategic threat assessments relevant for the fight against terrorism based on intelligence from national services taken in 2004. In fact, the European Council itself welcomed in December 2004 the revised EU action plan and additional reports presented by the Secretary-General/High Representative and the Commission on combating terrorism and the progress made since June 2004, which should lead to further concrete results as demonstrated in these contributions, notably: […/…] concerning intelligence cooperation: the links established between the Counter-Terrorism Group and the reinforced EU Situation Centre (SitCen) which, as of 1 January 2005, will provide the Council with strategic threat assessments based on intelligence from national services; and the improved exchange of information with Europol. The European Council invited the Secretary-General/High Representative to report on progress, including enhanced cooperation between police and security services, also in connection with the SitCen. These European Council conclusions are public.</p>
<p>From the institutional and administrative point of view SitCen is a service of the Secretariat General of the Council.

<p>(EN) First of all, it must be noted that car registration taxes, such as Imposto automóvel (hereinafter "IA") levied in accordance with Legislative Decrees no. 40/1993 and no. 264/1993 in Portugal, are manifestly of a fiscal nature and they are charged not by reason of a vehicle crossing the border of the Member State applying it, but because of other operative events, which includes the first-time registration of the vehicle in that State.<a href="#defann_59_1" name="refann_59_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> They must, therefore, be regarded as part of a general system of internal dues on goods and not as import duties within the meaning of Articles 23 and 25 of the EC Treaty. Consequently, Portugal does not act in breach of Community law by merely maintaining such a tax, provided there is no discrimination against imported vehicles prohibited by Article 90 of the EC Treaty. The Commission does not have any information to prove such discrimination.</p>
<p>As to the requirement to register a vehicle in Portugal and pay a tax thereof when a person has spent more than 180 days in this country, it should be noted that Council Directive 83/182/EEC on tax exemptions for temporary imported motor vehicles provides for a quantitative requirement of six months in any 12 months, during which the Member States must exempt from such taxes private vehicles registered in another Member State. When a person spends more time in a particular Member State a general rule is that the Member State concerned can levy the tax at issue. Portuguese Legislative Decree no 264/93 by establishing a quantitative criterion of 180 days for that purpose in certain cases may fall short even of five days. The Commission intends to contact Portuguese authorities on the issue.</p>
<p>As to the possibility provided by the Portuguese legislation to obtain under very strict conditions the tax exemption from car registration tax in the cases when EU citizens wish to become residents in Portugal, it must be recalled that there is no harmonization at EU level in the area of car registration taxes, therefore, Member States do not have any obligation to exempt from car registration taxes vehicles permanently imported to their territories.<a href="#defann_59_2" name="refann_59_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> Nevertheless, Portugal, on its own initiative, has chosen to exempt from IA personal vehicles imported on the occasion of an owner moving his or her residence to Portugal. The Commission, of course, welcomes this initiative but has no competence to require Portugal to modify the conditions, which were set down for that purpose.</p>
<p>With regard to high tax rates, it must be reiterated that since there is no harmonization in the area of car taxation at EU level, Member States may levy such taxes and determine their level as they see fit. The Court has ruled in Commission vs Denmark that Article 90 of the EC Treaty does not serve to censure the excessiveness of taxation levels and that, therefore, Member States are at liberty to decide on tax rates, even if they might appear to be excessively high.<a href="#defann_59_3" name="refann_59_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> Thus, Portugal by imposing high tax rates on car registration does not breach Community law, provided that they do not give rise to cross-border obstacles to trade between Member States and they respect the non discrimination principle established in the EC Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As the Commission has already said in its previous reply to Question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0022_EN.html">H-0022/06</a>, the Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) confers the competence to monitor the lawfulness of personal data processing activities performed within a Member State on the data protection authorities of the Member States. These authorities must be endowed with appropriate powers of intervention to ensure compliance with their national data protection legislation and to prevent or put an end to unlawful data processing activities, namely by means of controls or sanctions.</p>
<p>The Directive also provides that national data protection authorities shall be able to receive and examine complaints lodged by any person concerning the protection of his/her rights and freedoms with regard to the processing of personal data. Member States must ensure when implementing the Directive that the conditions laid down by the law or national administrative practices enable any person to effectively exercise this right.</p>
<p>It is therefore up to each Member State, when implementing Article 7 of the Directive, which lays down the legal grounds that make lawful the processing of personal data, to determine by law or by a decision of the data protection authorities whether an enquiry may be carried out in order to assess the use of a language by hospitals and medical services and the conditions attached.</p>
<p>As the Commission said in its previous reply, should these enquiries carried out by the services of the Generalidad de Cataluña be in conflict with Spanish data protection laws adopted to implement the Data Protection Directive, the Spanish Data Protection Authorities are required to take the appropriate measures to enforce compliance with the law.</p>
<p>The Commission has already asked the Spanish authorities for information about the facts referred to in the question to verify that the enquiry conducted by the Generalidad de Cataluña complies with the Spanish legislation implementing Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data. The Spanish authorities have informed the Commission that as a result of the enquiries and inspections carried out to verify the lawfulness of the enquiries carried out by the services of the Generalidad de Cataluña, several proceedings have been opened which could lead to a finding of infringement of Spanish data protection legal provisions. These proceedings, which are still pending, could give rise to sanctions or other measures adopted by the data protection authorities in order to ensure compliance with Spanish data protection legal provisions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Directive 2002/58/EC - the e-Privacy Directive - uses the term "unsolicited commercial communications" for what is commonly known as "spam". Article 13 of this Directive requires Member States to prohibit the sending of unsolicited commercial e-mail or other electronic messaging systems such as SMS and Multi media Messaging services unless the prior consent of the subscriber to such services has been obtained. This protection applies to subscribers who are natural persons. Member States can either choose to extend this regime to include legal persons or choose an opt-out system for unsolicited communications addressed to legal persons.</p>
<p>In addition, where Member States permit unsolicited commercial communications to legal persons by e-mail, Directive 2000/31 on electronic commerce requires clear and unambiguous identification of such communications (Article 7.1).</p>
<p>Charges relating to the sending of (large amounts of) unsolicited e-mails would penalise unfairly those companies that conduct legitimate marketing practices in compliance with national spam provisions. With regard to those companies that break spam laws, decisive enforcement action is what is needed to deter such behaviour.</p>
<p>The Commission is planning to adopt a Communication on spam, spyware and malware before the end of 2006. The Communication will take stock of the efforts made so far to raise public awareness on the problems posed by spam, spyware and malicious software and actions taken by the EU, industry and Member States to address these issues. Building on the results so far the Communication will identify further actions that need to be taken by the relevant stakeholders. The Commission is looking forward to hearing the views from Parliament and Council on this Communication.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0743"></a>

<p>(EN) Substantial investments are necessary both in the EU and in transit countries to upgrade aging energy infrastructure and to establish new, alternative supply routes. As it was set out in the Green paper ‘A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy’, one of the priorities is building oil pipelines which would facilitate Caspian oil supplies to the EU.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that several pipeline projects are considered with the aim of delivering crude oil from the Black Sea to European markets. In addition to enhancing our security of supply, these projects have a potential to reduce the maritime transport of oil in the congested Turkish Straits, thereby reducing serious risks to the environment and local population. The Commission is supportive to each well grounded project which can contribute to these objectives. Accordingly, the Commission welcomes the recent intergovernmental agreement on the Burgas−Alexandroupolis pipeline and hopes that it will lead to the eventual realization of this project.</p>
<p>The Commission provided financial support of €1.9 million for the feasibility studies of this project in the framework of the Structural Funds 1994-1999 through the Community Initiative INTERREG II ‘External Borders’. (The total public financing of the project amounted to €2.7 million). No financial contribution is envisaged in the present financial perspective covering 2000-2006, neither from the Structural Funds nor from the financial instruments of the foreign policy.</p>

<p>(EN) Spending under the current Structural Funds period will continue until the end of 2008 and it is only then that a final evaluation will be possible. This is especially true in the new Member States, where programming only started in 2004 and most of the impacts lie in the future.</p>
<p>However, it is noteworthy that, in terms of Gross Domestic Product growth, all of the new countries except Malta have recently outperformed the old EU15 Member States. For example, in 2005, Estonia and Latvia both grew by about 10% and the Czech Republic and Slovakia by about 6%, as against an estimated EU average of 1.6%.</p>
<p>EU funding contributes to the creation of growth and jobs in the new Member States. In many of the new Member States, EU assistance is focused on strengthening the competitiveness of the business sector, on improving employment and job opportunities, and on correcting deficiencies in environmental and transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>Concerning the absorption capacity, it is also too early to draw conclusions on interim payments since in 2004 and 2005 mainly advances were paid.</p>
<p>Finally, early evaluation results show that the new Member States have made significant progress in building the necessary administrative capacity, despite the relatively short period and limited previous experience in managing such programmes. The Structural Funds management framework has been successfully established, managing and paying authorities, monitoring committees, and implementing bodies have been set up, and management and audit systems are in place.</p>
<p>The Commission is confident therefore, that as more data comes in it will confirm the effectiveness of the Structural Funds in boosting growth, competitiveness and jobs in the new Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0773"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission has been informed that Aromanians are not considered in Romania as a national minority. This means that they benefit from the same rights as any other Romanian.</p>
<p>However, the Commission attaches great importance to the protection of minorities in Romania and has therefore continuously monitored the situation of the minorities in Romania, ever since it began to publish regular reports on the country. It is our assessment that over the years, the general situation with regard to the protection of minorities has improved.</p>
<p>The Commission cannot of course indicate concrete solutions for the settlement of minority-majority relations in Romania. This is for the Romanian authorities to decide. The Commission is ready to welcome any positive solution on which the parties can agree.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member knows, the Romanian Parliament is currently debating a draft law on national minorities. The Commission believes that a negotiated solution in the context of the Venice Commission recommendations would be a positive development, while it keeps underlining the importance of the domestic appropriation of any such solution.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0778"></a>

<p>There is currently no annual limit on direct payments for farms. As a result, the largest farms, which could manage on their own, receive a disproportionately large share of payments. This is in keeping with neither the goals and principles of the CAP nor the spirit of the Lisbon Strategy. Would the Commission support the introduction of an annual direct payments ceiling set at, for example, € 50 000 per farm? Such a ceiling would affect only two per cent of farmers and would generate an annual saving of approximately € 8 million.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The possibility of introducing individual farmer ceilings, or capping, in order to improve the distribution of direct payments between farmers, was first considered at the time direct payments for farmers were established in 1992.</p>
<p>At the time of the discussions on the Agenda 2000 and the Mid-Term Review in 2002, this reflexion was extended and concrete capping measures were proposed by the Commission but finally these proposals did not form part of the final agreement.</p>
<p>In the context of the general discussions on the full wide-ranging review of the EU budget and on the "Health Check" for the Common Agricultural Policy (ACP) that will occur during the 2007-2009 period, capping will be re-examined by the Commission.</p>
<p>Indicative figures for financial year 2004 on the distribution of direct aids paid to the producers according to Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 and an accompanying report have been published on 4 June 2006.</p>
<p>From these data, it may be calculated that there are 83.060 beneficiaries receiving more than €50.000 representing 1.7% of EU farmers. In total, these farmers received €8.157 billion for the financial year 2004. Had a capping mechanism with such an individual ceiling been applied for this financial year, the budget expenditure would have been €4.153 billion, that is a difference of €4.004 billion.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that such a pure budgetary calculation takes no account of possible structural changes in response to such a measure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
