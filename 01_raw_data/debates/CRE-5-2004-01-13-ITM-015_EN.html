<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bébéar (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, or NEPAD, is a political initiative which was adopted in October 2001 by five African Heads of State, President Mbeki of South Africa, President Bouteflika of Algeria, President Mubarak of Egypt, President Obasanjo of Nigeria and President Wade of Senegal. Those five countries now form the Steering Committee of NEPAD.</p>
<p class="contents">NEPAD is actually part of an ambitious project known as the ‘African Renaissance’. This partnership aims to enable Africa to become the master of its own destiny. What is original about the partnership is the desire to create an intra-African dynamic based on role models. Countries which are members of NEPAD commit themselves to respect for human rights, to the prevention and resolution of conflicts and to the principles of democracy and good governance, but also – and this is a cultural revolution – to the campaign against corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">In brief, what we have here is African regional integration which will create optimum conditions for encouraging private investors to take part in the economic and social development of these African countries. At last we see a credible African initiative based on the principle that the participation of the private sector is a vital complement to public assistance in meeting the enormous needs of the African continent.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is based on two vital central themes, the prevention and resolving of conflicts on the one hand and good governance on the other. Peace and stability are the prerequisites for any development. This is true in the case of public investment, but even more true in the case of private investment. After a conflict, the authorities can start to invest again fairly quickly, but the same is not true of private investors, who first of all have to regain confidence. From this point of view, the conflict in the Ivory Coast runs the risk of having negative consequences on the economy of the region for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">Good governance is just as vital as stability. Democracy and respect for the rule of law are conditions which are essential to economic and human development. In the case of NEPAD, it is Africans themselves who are ensuring that these principles are met and who are making strong commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">NEPAD consists of ten priority themes, the most important of which are good public governance, good governance of the private sector, infrastructure – and we know how important that is – education and health too of course, agriculture, the environment, energy, and, finally, access to markets in the developed countries, something which is difficult at present.</p>
<p class="contents">NEPAD has received very favourable responses from the industrialised countries, particularly from the European Union and the G8, as we saw last year at Evian, although the resulting aid has not always fulfilled the expectations of the instigating countries. Generally speaking, the Commission’s report welcomes the NEPAD initiative and requests that it be implemented promptly. It highlights certain areas where there is a need for improvement, and warns against potential risks. The report notes the criticisms of many people who are involved in African civil society, and encourages member states of the African Union, and especially those countries which promoted it, to allow active and democratic participation by all sectors of civil society, including NGOs, trade unions, employers’ organisations and churches.</p>
<p class="contents">This report also reminds us that NEPAD is a social and economic programme of the African Union for the development of Africa, and not an independent institution. It reiterates the firm belief that the role of providing the impetus for and exercising parliamentary control over NEPAD naturally falls to the pan-African parliaments which will be set up between now and the end of the year, and that duplication of effort and expenditure and institutional proliferation and overlapping should be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this report attaches the greatest importance to the implementation and democratic parliamentary control of the African Peer Review Mechanism. Finally, this report is balanced. It represents the essence of this Parliament’s political sensitivities. I hope that it will be adopted as it is, without any amendments, apart from a few oral amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The new pan-African reality born with NEPAD and the African Union deserves our special attention and full support. We must not lose the momentum created by recent major changes in Africa, whose leaders took the initiative to extricate the continent from poverty and marginalisation, with ownership as a guiding principle. In fact, those whom I often call the heroes of NEPAD could be said to have demonstrated that ownership is something you take; it is not something you are given. This has been the real inspiration of the entire initiative. The Commission is committed to supporting pan-African initiatives. We are in the process of building structured relations with the African Union and NEPAD institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission remains strongly committed to supporting NEPAD and the priorities and objectives of the African Union. The presence of President Prodi at the African Union Summit in Maputo in July 2003 and the development of the dialogue between our Commission and new pan-African structures demonstrate that stance. The fact that their administrative and executive arm is called the African Commission is a pleasing comment on what we represent in Europe, and certainly we are in the business of launching assistance for initiatives at continental level to demonstrate this close working relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">Numerous political contacts to date between the European Commission and the African Union Commission have been preparing the ground for launching a strategic, structured dialogue between the two bodies. In tandem, a regular dialogue is being developed with the NEPAD Secretariat. The establishment of other pan-African institutions, including the Peace and Security Council and the Pan-African Parliament, affords new prospects for dialogue between the European Union and Africa as a whole. The other week the process of ratifying the Peace and Security Council Protocol in African Union Member States reached the point where this institution is now being formally launched. We look forward to the same development very soon as regards the Pan-African Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the European Community is providing tangible support for pan-African initiatives. Peace and security is of special importance here: it is a prerequisite for all development. The establishment of a peace facility to back African-owned and African-led peace-building actions will mark a breakthrough. Leadership by the African Union in this area has been essential and still is.</p>
<p class="contents">I will dwell a little on the establishment of the peace facility. Following the request by the African Heads of State in Maputo in July 2003 that part of their national allocations be 'shaved off' to establish a peace facility, the Commission proceeded quickly. After intensive discussions with the EU Council and our ACP partners, they both gave the go-ahead for the facility. We are now entering a more operational phase in which we are preparing a specific financing proposal for 250 million euros; it is planned to be submitted to the next meeting of the EDF Committee. This is therefore moving forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Three fundamental principles underpin the philosophy of the peace facility. Firstly, ownership is to strengthen the capacity of the African people to deal with African conflicts. We hope the facility will provide the necessary financial 'muscle' to accompany the political resolve of the African Union and consolidate the continental architecture it has designed with the Peace and Security Council as its key institution. Secondly, there is to be solidarity through financial contributions from all African countries. Thirdly, there is development, it being acknowledged that without peace and stability there can be no development in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to develop an appropriate response to the new pan-African context. We – the European Union – still face the challenge of treating Africa as one entity. Our assistance to the continent as a whole should be set in a coherent framework. This calls, inter alia, for action to ensure that our national and regional cooperation programmes are consistent with NEPAD and African Union priorities and objectives. This process is in the hands of our African partners, and the Commission will make sure in the months ahead that it is reflected in our 'mid-term reviews' under the Cotonou Agreement and with regard to the other country strategies relevant for the rest of Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission put forward concrete proposals in its communication on EU-Africa dialogue last July to build bridges between the various agreements linking the European Union and Africa. That communication aimed to promote a substantive discussion on the most promising avenues and future practical arrangements for EU-Africa dialogue and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by saying that Mr Bébéar's report and the debate here today are welcome contributions to this discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">NEPAD is a vision, a concept in the minds of African heads of state, covering the whole African continent, and sets out a strategic framework for Africa's renewal. This vision must include a democratic voice via a parliament and the involvement of civil society. It is, however, the African Union that should be the main instigator of policies laid down under NEPAD, based on regional integration. The objectives and principles are everything that we in Europe would ask for and insist on, including eradication of poverty, raising the status of Africa on the world scene, making good governance a basic requirement, building a peaceful, secure and stable continent able to energise its economies to take advantage of world trade, and trying to ensure that the millennium development goals in the area of health and education are met.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe we are already assisting with all these objectives. We must continue to support and encourage the NEPAD vision, but action would speak louder than words. It will take very large sums of money to achieve these goals. One can only hope that the oil-rich states will contribute. With peace and stability, there are huge natural reserves that could also help them achieve their vision. With a peer review body, one hopes that the heads of African states will now take responsibility for their own destiny and that the problems of instability and poverty will be eradicated, with human rights being a top priority, especially for women and children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fulfilling the promises will not be easy and Africa and, indeed, outsiders such as ourselves, will have to be in this for the long haul.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report points out, NEPAD was initially and consistently intellectually scarred by inadequate consultation, particularly at grassroots level – it was leader-led. We hope that we will ensure that, as far as the African Union in its future work is concerned, there will be far more consultation at grassroots level with civil society. Perhaps the result of this, as far as NEPAD is concerned, for instance in relation to our last debate, is the modest reference in NEPAD to any kind of social sector issue. There is hardly any mention of HIV/AIDS at all, and this has to be a very glaring and serious contradiction in NEPAD's proposals for action.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner said, we now move on to working with the African Union, which will now be given the task of working through the policies and implementing them. How will the Commission support efforts to build the kind of coherence that will be necessary now between NEPAD and the AU's strategy? Is it of concern for instance that the peer group review mechanism is somehow now being increasingly institutionalised and separated off as a kind of separate secretariat? Should this not be of some concern to us?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner talked quite rightly about the importance of the peace facility. Does the Commission intend to offer commensurate funds for the other work – the self-led development work – of the AU on democracy, human rights and good governance? Will we be offering similar support for that work, which has to go hand in hand with the work that will need to take place on conflict resolution and peace-building?</p>

The Greens are perhaps the only ones who doubt it. Of course we support the human-rights aspect of NEPAD, though we regret the fact that it is often merely theoretical. We shall not linger here on the contempt, on the part of the authors of NEPAD, for any prior consultation of the people regarding the drawing up of the plan, and we would point out that repression of political opponents and journalists is still happening in Africa, even in Senegal.</p>
<p class="contents">In economic terms, NEPAD promises the same liberalism as was created by the World Bank and the IMF, the liberalism of structural adjustment plans, the same liberalism which brought Argentina to its knees and which grapples with public services, health services, water-distribution services and education services, the liberalism which, in the final analysis, increases inequalities and poverty, in particular as they affect women.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to carry out an evaluation of the impact of earlier commercial liberalisation policies on social and economic development and on the protection of the environment. NEPAD is not short of freedoms, be it freedom of capital, free movement of goods or freedom to provide services. Yet what has happened to the free movement of workers within the Community of African States? What has happened to the freedom of peoples to choose their own future?</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I should like to draw your attention to the gradual regionalisation for which NEPAD makes provision. There is a problem in that the European Union supports such zones, which are now tending to resemble scenarios in which the NEPAD instigating countries take neighbouring African countries under their political and economic wing. Nor will NEPAD be able to claim to be a viable solution while at the same time ignoring what is at stake as a result of the terrible burden of debt borne by the countries of Africa. Thus provision is made for reducing the debt only in the case of countries which have followed neo-liberal principles. The European Union should seek and apply the total and unconditional cancellation of the debt.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting sustainable development in Africa does not mean throwing that continent to the mercy of the multinationals and of foreign investments. It does not mean encouraging the exploitation of its resources by foreign powers. For example, the agricultural and mining sectors to which NEPAD gives priority will be totally dependent on prices that are fixed by the countries of the North. Africa is not for sale. Africa must be constructed by and for Africans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) is an ambitious programme, and we should congratulate our African partners on it, for it is indeed a programme developed by Africans for Africans.</p>
<p class="contents">This concept has now been in existence for more than two years, and following the successful establishment of the African Union and the scheduling of the first session of the Pan-African Parliament for the third week in March, the time has come for the proposed mechanisms to be put in effect.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus especially on the African Peer Review Mechanism and explore this in more detail. Yet I have the impression that some of its architects are a little scared by their own courage. The Commissioner has just mentioned the heroes of NEPAD, but they must be the cowards of NEPAD, for adopting principles such as good governance and human rights means implementing them as well – and implementation means effective control and evaluation of the commitments undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it is apparent that those who are responsible for the worst excesses in Africa, notably Mr Mugabe in Zimbabwe, are naturally not subscribing to this mechanism in the first place. In all, just sixteen out of more than fifty states have joined the mechanism so far. I believe this is exactly where we should take a positive role, be it through the EU or indeed G8. After all, G8 committed itself to an Africa Action Plan back in 2002. We should be targeting our support specifically to those who are genuinely improving their standards and are complying with the mechanism in practice. This is the only way to ensure that we treat Africa individually and not as an entity, which was the Commissioner’s complaint earlier. For this purpose, the EU but also G8 should draw up a specific timetable to fulfil the commitments which they have undertaken in abstract. Positive outcomes could then be anticipated in Africa as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This offers the Commission the opportunity to support the NEPAD initiative on the basis of partnership through its cooperation with the ACP. It also offers the European Parliament the opportunity, through the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, to engage in regular dialogue with the relevant countries about their needs and, indeed, the successes achieved. The new parliamentary committees established by the ACP Assembly offer an excellent forum for this process, enabling problems to be addressed on the basis of critical solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Through their initiative, the NEPAD countries have undoubtedly laid the foundation stone for successful development based on individual responsibility. The task now is to establish a sound basis for fruitful cooperation and create a pan-African house in which every individual finds a home worthy of human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">Achieving peace in crisis regions is a basic prerequisite for improving living conditions in large parts of Africa. In order to achieve long-term successes, especially in combating poverty, lasting political stability is essential. This can only be achieved on a reliable basis if those who bear political responsibility secure the support of civil society. That means that there must be active, democratic and pluralist participation by the key groups from civil society: the non-government organisations as well as the political bodies and associations, the trade unions as well as employers’ organisations, and the churches as well as cultural associations and education bodies, to cite just a few examples.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a particular need for women’s equal participation in designing projects and strategies for development, for they are the key figures who organise daily life, and they are often responsible for ensuring their families’ survival as well.</p>

Even if our fellow-Member’s report is positive – and we can endorse it on the whole – recent experience still leads us to have some doubts.</p>
<p class="contents">The NEPAD story was the response of the African leaders to the globalisation of the world economy. This is understandable, because Africa is, in many ways, at risk of becoming the continent that is losing out while everyone else uses it to stock up on supplies. It bears witness to vision, but it also has the disadvantage of being a big plan that has not been developed from the bottom up.</p>
<p class="contents">A major fear is that NEPAD will eventually lead to the enrichment of those who are already rich and the challenge is to see the NEPAD story not as contravening the millennium objectives, such as halving the number of poor who have to survive on less than 1 dollar. This is an issue that cannot be solved with large trade flows, because trade has never guaranteed truly fair distribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand the developed countries undertook to provide billions of dollars in new resources, but, for their part, the African governments committed themselves to good governance, democracy and human rights and the rule of law. One fact is certain: without good governance in Africa, increased aid will be of only marginal value.</p>
<p class="contents">I note the Commission's estimate, quoted by Mr Bébéar, that illegally acquired funds deposited in mostly foreign banks amount to more than half of African's external debt. I wonder what proportion of this stolen money belongs to Mr Mugabe and his associates. After all, it is Mr Mugabe and his ZANU-PF cronies who have systematically pillaged and brutalised the once prosperous country of Zimbabwe, brought lawlessness and starvation on its people and forced so many of them to live in fear and desperation. I hear of terrible new cases every day.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, many of Zimbabwe's neighbours not only have encouraged the Mugabe regime, but also have allowed Mugabe to dictate the terms of Africa's relationship with us. Conditions in Zimbabwe are now spiralling out of control. This House has called for effective action by the Council on six separate occasions. To date, the Council has failed to heed these calls. On Thursday we shall insist yet again that we want effective action now! This means not just the renewal of the EU's targeted sanctions when they expire on 18 February, but also the introduction of tough new measures.</p>
<p class="contents">South Africa, in particular, needs to exercise some real moral and political leadership. After all, South Africa is specifically responsible for the good governance aspects of NEPAD. I say to President Mbeki that quiet diplomacy does not work. It did not work in getting rid of apartheid and it will not work with Mugabe. He has to get tough. I implore the African Union and the African countries to use all the resources at their disposal to persuade Mugabe and his clique to step aside. We need to set the people of Zimbabwe free. Let us be under no illusions: Zimbabwe is the test case for NEPAD. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important because it is a home-grown initiative. It comes from the African nations. Even if there are reservations, that point is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">On our own continent, it was when we realised that poverty, unemployment, dictatorship and war led nowhere that we were able to form the European Union and then move ahead. Now that Africa makes that political decision, hopefully it too can move ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">In post-war Europe we could not do it on our own. We needed help from outside. The rapporteur talks about the Marshall Plan in his conclusions to the report. The Marshall Plan was worth USD 13.4 billion over four years in 1948. That was a lot of money. Aid has to be properly spent, but proper aid has to be there in the first place, alongside better free trade and the untying of aid to African countries so that money is spent on what is needed, not on the things that we would like to see it spent on.</p>
<p class="contents">We can do a lot more in the EU to support this important initiative. I hope that the Commission will play its role in making sure that we work alongside the African leaders, who want this kind of change, and in making sure that it happens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report by my friend and colleague, Mr Bébéar, is an excellent one. However, I should like to highlight that if, as he says, all these objectives were to be fulfilled, it would cost EUR 64 billion per annum. I do not believe that kind of money will be forthcoming.</p>
<p class="contents">As the last speaker said, whilst there is corruption, mismanagement, fraud and bad governance, we have to tackle the problem of poverty in Africa. If NEPAD is a solution put forward by African governments, then there may be a chance. We have examples of bad management and fraud: we have only to look to the news a week ago when Parmalat lost EUR 10 billion in Italy – a sophisticated, modern, western country! So it is not surprising that there will be difficulties in Africa. I do not condone them; I have always objected to and stamped on corruption wherever it is, especially in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to encourage NEPAD, especially the conception, growth and sustenance of small- and medium-sized enterprises in Africa, owned and run by Africans using the natural resources of their countries and employing their own people, with the appropriate training and help that we can give them. That is the engine for NEPAD – the economic engine that can bring about development. First, it must be formed in their countries, support the regional economy and then go beyond to EU and world markets. That is what NEPAD was conceived to be. The roof may be the African Union, the walls may be the pan-African Parliament, but the foundation of economic growth and the eradication of poverty in Africa has to be something like NEPAD. We ought to support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not spend similar amounts of money on all the other things: we spend much more. What is new about the peace facility is that we are creating a basis for spending money on things we were never able to spend money on before. Funding the implementation of the peace operations decided by Africa and implemented in an African context is a new thing. We should make sure that we only use that money for things that cannot be funded through the regular systems already in place.</p>
<p class="contents">I liked Mr Corrie's remark about oil-rich African states which could do more. We should come back to this. I also see that it would be very meaningful in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly to discuss the performance of oil-exporting economies and other similar extraction industries in Africa. This discussion is just starting up, but that is in many cases where the big money should be found for social purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">The fantastic things about NEPAD were its timing and character, and the ambition of accepting exposure and measurement as regards the global criteria relating to democracy. These African countries are saying that they want to be judged on these same principles, echoing what we had all agreed on in the Cotonou framework. They wanted this to be taken up. They did it up against the G8, which attracted much attention globally and, in that sense, raised the stakes in the process of democratisation in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">NEPAD, and democracy in Africa, are still very new. The best performers have had only two – at the most three – reasonably fair elections. We tend to forget that: the best performers have experienced two acceptable democratic elections. There is not much more than a big handful of those best cases. However, things are moving in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">This peer review is a fantastic, very daring endeavour. Of course they had to institutionalise. It was a wise move to set it into the context of African Union as soon as possible, because, as Mr Van Orden correctly pointed out, what would they have done with Zimbabwe and a large number of other cases if the original five heroes of NEPAD had handled that? They would have run out of political authority. It would have been perceived as a kind of ganging-up – showing the others how to do things. Instead, it was wisely embedded – if I may use that word with reference to that continent – into the African Union, which took it up.</p>
<p class="contents">This work is continuing. It is quite fantastic that they are lining up standards to get through this screening in the peer review process. I told them in one discussion that it looks as if it is more difficult to get good marks in the peer review process than it is to fulfil the criteria we have defined in order to become a member of the European Union. It is very ambitious. I can only recommend that everybody interested in Africa studies how they are setting the mark there. I have warned them that it may be too ambitious, but they want this to be a global standard for governance. They know it is not going to be easy.</p>
<p class="contents">Institutionally, we look forward very much to a systematic, close, well-organised collaboration with the emerging Commission in Addis Ababa. I hope that we will get back on track and be able to manage the difficulties – also with reference to Zimbabwe. I hope that 2004 will be a positive turning-point, enabling us at full speed to resume the EU-Africa dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
