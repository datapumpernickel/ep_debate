Difficult though it is to pass on to the agenda, our topic is ‘health care and care for the elderly’, and it is a very important one.</p>
<p class="contents">In all probability, this report will receive very broad support in the House today – the result of excellent cooperation between Members belonging to all the political groupings, for which I would like to extend the warmest of thanks to all of them, but especially to Mr Mantovani. I might add that my report follows on from his own, which he presented a year ago, and the things we called for then are every bit as relevant today as they were at the time; indeed, the problems have become even more pressing. Let me only cite the length of time people have to wait for treatment, the worsening staffing bottlenecks and the alarming reports of conditions in care homes, some of which are degrading.</p>
<p class="contents">Governments, too, have now realised how important it actually is to organise a structured exchange of information both in the health sector and in the sphere of care for the elderly. Whilst the results of the high-level reflection process speak for themselves, we now have no more time to lose, and so we strongly urge the European Council to adopt at last the principle of application of the open coordination method and a detailed timetable. The common objectives and indicators should be agreed by early 2006. After all, the Convention did, in its draft treaty, specify open coordination for health policy – with, of course, this House participating as it should.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Member States want to guarantee the future accessibility, quality and financial viability of health systems and care for the elderly, then what is needed most of all is more prevention and transparency. At both European and national levels, prevention and health promotion must receive the same attention as curative medicine. If they do not, we really will soon be unable to cope with the growing burden of patients.</p>
<p class="contents">Transparency, though, is an indispensable requirement if quality is to be maintained and if the best possible use is to be made of the resources that health systems possess. Far more than has formerly been the case, the quality of medical services must be demonstrable. We must no longer spend a lot of money and get poor quality in return. Patients’ organisations have a very important part to play in this, and must, in future, be more involved in all decisions on matters of health policy.</p>
<p class="contents">All Member States should also adopt a patients’ law or patients’ charter, but, in order to secure greater legal security for people who become ill and have to be treated abroad, we also need common European standards for patients’ rights. It would indeed be a major breakthrough if a European patients’ charter were to be adopted, and so we urge the Commission and the Member States to devise shared criteria for one. A large number of questions, though, still remain open after the European Court of Justice’s rulings on the reimbursement of treatment costs incurred in another Member State, and so what we expect from the Commission is proposals, not only as to how patients can have greater legal certainty, but also as to how the national health services can be protected from the potentially adverse effects of the internal market rules. The effects of European rules should be monitored by a standing committee of experts, which would submit reports on a regular basis. The fact is that health is not an economic commodity; our health services are founded on solidarity, and that must be defended.</p>
<p class="contents">All the Member States also face major challenges as regards long-term care and care for the elderly. We should join together in seeking strategies for integrating health provision and care more effectively with each other, for better care at home and for the provision of sufficient care homes. There is also a need for clear standards of care, not only in people’s own homes but also in institutions, and, above all, for regular and independent quality controls.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, then, much to be done if our European model of a health policy founded upon solidarity is to be maintained in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mrs Jöns, we particularly value your report’s support for the application of the open coordination method in order to improve health care for the elderly in the countries of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends shortly to adopt a communication with a proposal to apply this open coordination method in relation to health care issues. We will base this on previous experience because we believe it is essential to provide assistance in this area, which is key both in order to confront the problems of demographic ageing in our countries and in order to maintain high and appropriate levels of social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The first condition for implementing this open coordination method is that the Member States adopt a series of common objectives which allow us to establish a useful framework for the process of reforming issues relating to health.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the conclusions of the joint report presented last year to the spring European Council, we will focus on three areas: health care, accessibility and quality and financial viability.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also have to consider the second aspect which you have referred to: monitoring. Monitoring which must be carried out by means of appropriate comparable indicators. Without such indicators it is very difficult to assess the application of the different measures by the different Member States and to see whether this learning process, which we are undergoing jointly, is achieving the intended objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also going to produce detailed working proposals up until 2006, when we hope to begin a new simplified process for coordinating policies which deals with health care, pensions and social inclusion. If we want to establish this working plan, it is essential to exploit synergies, the inter-relationships in the current public health strategy and the Community action plan which is linked to it.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve the best results, it is essential that indicators receive strong support from this working programme. Otherwise we will not have the necessary references to understand the situation of each country.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the Council will debate the Commission's proposals during this year and we believe that, in this regard, the report you are presenting to us today is extremely timely and useful, and will make a fundamental contribution to this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also carefully examined the conclusions of the process of high-level reflection on the mobility of patients and will shortly present a communication on its monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">Your report, Mrs Jöns, deals with a wide range of issues relating to social protection, public health, the free movement of people and services within the internal market. They are all important instruments for defining a global policy within the framework of our internal market competences in relation to free movement within the public health programme and the open coordination method applied to these issues. The Commission must pay special attention to these different instruments so that they are coherent and consistent amongst themselves. The fact that they are all of differing legal natures does not mean that we do not have to maintain complete consistency between all of them and the Commission will spare no effort in order to progress in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We will always remember – and this is an essential point – that primary responsibility on these issues falls to the Member States, particularly in relation to health and care for the chronically ill. Our work on the specific points is to support the work carried out by our Member States as much as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much for your contributions, which will undoubtedly be extremely useful to the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As shadow rapporteur for our group, Mr Mantovani – who as long ago as January 2003 was the author of the report that opened the debate in the European Parliament on the future of health systems and care for the elderly – has confirmed the key importance of the fundamental challenges concerning, in particular, provision, quality, content and cover in the field of health care expenditure in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner has also confirmed, the ageing of the population, progress in medicine, greater life expectancy and the increasing demand for health services, linked with unprecedented mobility and information, together contribute to a substantial widespread increase in the costs of the health system, which at times has proven to be unsustainable for the current economic climate and above all for public administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">According to figures contained in the European Commission’s latest report on the health situation, the number of elderly people over the age of 75 will rise to 27% by 2010. In the next 15 years, the number of the very elderly, that is, over the age of 80, will increase by almost 50%. At the same time, in this context the level of dependence of the elderly is also set to increase. Changes in the over 80-year olds age group will be greater and quicker than those in any other age group.</p>
<p class="contents">This trend will also generally hold true for the ten new countries that will soon join the current Member States. Indeed, with the exception of Poland, the Slovak Republic and Cyprus – where the active population continues to grow, even if somewhat slowly – the ageing of the population in all of the other countries is a phenomenon that has already taken root and is tending to increase. A lot will depend on the effectiveness of the strategies implemented in the health area and on the political choices made at European, national and local level. Changes in this area are not only necessary but also more of a priority than ever before. Even though the provision of health care and care in general currently remains essentially the competence of the Member States, we realise that a similar trend with significant and complex implications cannot be dealt with effectively and thoroughly at national level alone.</p>
<p class="contents">In January 2003, when the Mantovani report on health systems in Europe was adopted, there was broad consensus in this Parliament in favour of developing Community cooperation to improve health systems, which, in my opinion, is the only way to deal with the ageing of the population in particular. This trend means that European society must adapt and citizens must change their behaviour and habits. In the decisions of the Court of Justice, these various issues – which concern different policies that compete both on an international and a national level for total subsidiarity, and I am thinking of patient mobility, the completion of the internal market and consumer policy – must be considered to be increasingly crucial and there must be a new context within which European cooperation is stepped up in order to be able to achieve tangible results as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a requirement for more extensive cooperation and for common standards to be drawn up in terms of quality and quantity. The European Union’s objective, set at Lisbon four years ago, was to become the most competitive economy in the world by 2010. Today, attaining this objective has become particularly difficult as a result of low growth and the unfavourable economic climate and will therefore not be attained unless we approach it seriously and in the same way as the other challenges that await us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The way in which we respond to older people’s needs and fears is also a cultural issue. In care homes, human dignity and the right to personal freedom are of the utmost importance. There is a desire to live and to strive to live innate in every person, and this mental elemental force must be cultivated. It is, above all, strength of will that makes life significantly easier for old people themselves and also for those who care for them. That is why it is so important that training in all health care professions – from carer to physician – should be developed. Psychological knowledge, empathy and sensitivity are even more difficult to acquire, understand and develop than professional expertise and practical skills.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only training, though, that must take greater account of increased life expectancy. Research, too, must commit itself more to gerontology and to the support of programmes in palliative medical care and develop its own Europe-wide networks. More research, and hence greater safety, is needed to better underpin preventive measures. Only if there is interaction between these two will we have a guarantee of being able to keep an eye on costs in health care.</p>
<p class="contents">In presenting us with the issues and problems of ageing, this own-initiative report highlights one of the major social issues for Europe and calls us to ongoing work on health policy.

Our health is, quite rightly, the responsibility of the Member States and I would not like to see a change in that practice. I would like to see more exchange of best practice at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that all but one of my amendments were accepted in committee, but I would like to point out that the text in recital K is not quite correct. My amendment talked about long-term care, not long-term intensive care. I have taken it up with the services and they said that the mistake could be rectified at plenary. I hope that is going to be the case, because long-term care is not the same as long-term intensive care. I still think there is a problem in the last sentence, but I am sure the services can also rectify that.</p>
<p class="contents">I was particularly pleased also that my amendment regarding the use of cage beds in psychiatric institutions and social care homes was passed, and that it was recognised that this was in contravention of all international standards regarding the care of people with mental health problems and/or intellectual disabilities. Let us hope now that this practice can be discontinued completely, across the EU and in the accession countries. There has been improvement since the Mental Disability Advocacy Centre report on this subject last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Another of my amendments that was accepted – which I was pleased about –concerned the need to undertake more research projects at European level on various conditions that affect European citizens and, perhaps more importantly, for any information to be disseminated across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Commission might now look at the possibility of helping in that exchange of information, especially if the research has been funded by the EU, in fields such as age-related macular degeneration, for instance, which is the main cause of loss of sight in the elderly in the EU. There is much good work taking place, but no clear system set up to exchange research information. I have talked to the Commission already about the possibility of publishing results on the Internet, but I am sure the Commission could come up with some other ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">I have only touched on a couple of issues of concern to me because of time constraints; Mrs Jöns' report has gone into many other areas. On behalf of the ELDR Group, I congratulate her on her work and commend the report to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Above all, we welcome the way in which it makes it clear that health care must be provided close to the patients in their local environments, because family, friends and colleagues mean such a lot in terms of rehabilitation and the quality of care.</p>
<p class="contents">Right now, it seems, however, as if the trend is in completely the opposite direction. Health care is to be part of the internal market. This very day, as we are having this debate, the Competition Council is sitting and discussing matters in Brussels, where Mr Bolkestein will propose a radical step towards the commercialisation of care, and other, services. The basic principle is to be that every producer who is an approved operator in one Member State must freely be able to establish operations in any other Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">This will quickly break down the public health care systems and prepare the way for extensive privatisation. Instead of care provided close to patients in local environments, we shall have large multinational health care companies, medicine-producing industrial groups and health insurance companies as the large and powerful actors in a market where it is large-scale production and the profit motive that govern activities. I have even read a report dealing with the way in which the sick, or what are termed mobile patients, are to be moved around in this large market.</p>
<p class="contents">These developments are a threat to patients’ rights, and we in the European Parliament must do all we can to stop them. We must get the Commission to stop and give us more time for responsible debate. There are many services that can operate very well in the internal market, but there are also services – and health care is one such – that are of a different character and are not at all suited to market principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Cross-border cooperation is required when it comes to health care services too. This can and should, however, be developed between Member States and border regions on the basis of more practical needs instead of in accordance with the abstract principle of the organisation of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission successfully carries out its offensive in terms of subjecting what were previously public services to the principles of the internal market, popular resistance to the EU project will, in general, rise to unguessed-at levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Where Mrs Jöns’ report is concerned, the House must reject paragraph 23, which is about health care being subject to the principles of the internal market. If it does not reject it, at least the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left will not be able to vote in favour of the report in the final vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Last week, I was astonished at the statements by the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr Verhofstadt, who stated that families need to be given more financial incentives to care for their elderly parents at home. According to him, this idea should be the topic of a national debate in Belgium.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the time, I like the idea of national debates, but in this case, the question arises whether the need for this debate is not simply as a result of the embarrassment with the issue of growing older. By means of fine policy proposals and election rhetoric, we try to address the problems of the elderly in health care. That, however, cannot conceal the fact that we are at a loss when it comes to this issue. After all, we ourselves hope to grow old in good health and not to have to rely on care for as long as possible, but we have no control over this.</p>
<p class="contents">I can remember that we discussed Mr Mantovani's report here last year, on 14 January to be precise. I then expressly stated that the discussion on care of the elderly and health care must not be bogged down in good intentions. It has to pay off for those who work in that sector. Sharing working practices and treatment methods should lead to an improvement in care. In addition, it must be made clear that health care and care of the elderly should not be considered from the perspective of economic costs alone. The elderly and patients are more than a debit entry. That is why I endorse the amendment tabled by Mrs Lambert about the change to paragraph 23.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the internal market is not to attain financial gain on the back of the distress of patients. Equal access to care in all Member States is desirable, but mobility of patients does not appear desirable to me on account of the costs involved. In my view, paragraph 37 should not be deleted. Indeed, I can identify well with the conclusion that the rules of the internal market impact not only positively on health care.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to return briefly to the statements by Mr Verhofstadt. Things can get worse still. In my country, a television station recently presented a docu-drama on the reception of poor Dutch elderly people in an African country where the care is more efficient because wages in the care sector are lower. Many viewers did not notice until later on that this programme was played by actors and the minister was even getting prepared for questions in parliament – but the fact that it was only fiction does not remove the impression that there is little room, if any, for voluntary care of family relations. Both the fine policy intentions and mocking satire are trying to give us a message. This is food for thought. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The internal market is not the only starting point for today’s debate. Demographic changes, affecting the whole of Europe and our entire continent, represent the greatest challenge to our policies – be they on the labour market, the economy, social affairs, health, or the Budget. If we want to build up the internal market, create mobility and flexibility as well as social security, whilst at the same time facing up together to the great challenges to our policies on civil society, we will not be able to reduce them to a matter of national borders.</p>
<p class="contents">In my capacity as President of the Austrian Aid Organisation, I face these challenges on a daily basis. What we have to do, I believe, is to review the public sector’s effectively statutory functions and the consequent transfer of public tasks carried out by the non-statutory sector to private non-profit service providers at national, regional and local level. The person being cared for must have a choice in where they stay and are cared for if they are to enjoy the right to self-determination. Even when they are in need of care, most people want to stay in their own homes. They can often be better looked after by mobile care services, which adjust more flexibly to the patient’s actual needs, and this also represents a much more economic use of the resources available. What this requires, though, is firstly that the quality of the care service be regulated not merely at the national level, but also across borders, with as much standardisation as possible, and at least in a coordinated way; that the training of care workers be organised as far as possible to a national standard and coordinated throughout Europe; that service providers be assessed in a transparent and objective way; and that funding be secured by way of long-term contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">Mobile services and the ancillary services on which they depend need to be upgraded and extended. They need to be integrated, with better management of the interface between nursing homes and the mobile services, and the promotion of an overarching and patient-oriented case management<span class="italic">.</span> Let me conclude by saying that there is a need for more resources within reach of family members and more support and assistance for them; both the state and Europe must create the regulatory environment that is needed if that is to happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has compiled an excellent report, with a pertinent appeal for more European cooperation in health care and care of the elderly. This cooperation should not be restricted to public health, the quantitative and preventive aspects, but should also pertain to the cost-conscious and effective handling of provisions and the reinforcement of the financial basis for the health costs and the costs resulting from an ageing population. The Directorate-General for social affairs and employment should play an active role in this.</p>
<p class="contents">I have mainly focused on the aspects of financing and supporting the national care systems, and have tabled a number of amendments to that effect which relate to the internal market, <span class="italic">inter alia</span> an amendment to paragraph 37 which, to my disappointment, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wishes to delete. Decisions by the Court of Justice about the internal market already affect the national health systems. The funding of care is no longer a purely national matter. Many fellow MEPs from different Member States fail to understand why I make this into such an important issue. They continue to stress that health care must be protected from the market forces, that it is of general interest and, consequently, it has nothing to do with the rules on competition and free movement. I would like to say to them – and to Mr Herman Schmid in particular – that this has not been the case for a long time. We cannot be blind to private commercial parties within the health market operating according to free-market logistics. That is why we must provide a solid counterweight against market forces.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Netherlands, there is currently a discussion about the review of the public health cost system, in respect of which it is planned to hand this over completely to private health cost insurers. I see this as a risky strategy as long as there is no framework provided for it. I have nothing against private insurance companies, as Mr Karas can attest, but the government should be able to put sufficient conditions in place. It should not be possible, for example, for sick people to be turned down, for people with a high health risk to have to pay a higher premium, or for insurance cover to be more expensive for women because they can fall pregnant.</p>
<p class="contents">The Dutch Cabinet takes little account of the fact that the European agreements about the internal market could thwart its plans. If, in due course, insurance companies feel too restricted by the government, they can head to the European Court and refer to the European rules. This will be at the expense of the weakest groups. The national governments will then blame Europe. I should like to prevent that from happening and that is why we must try to achieve better coordination at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">One last remark: I am pleased with Mr Solbes' announcement that a progress report will soon follow for the high-level reflection process. I am really looking forward to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very comprehensive report. Her description of the situation, of the problems and of what is at stake is particularly exhaustive, and the rapporteur’s analyses are completely relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very pleased, particularly with the fact that the report calls upon the Member States to do away with inequalities in the area of health, especially those linked to socio-economic factors, gender or age. We support the criticism that patients have to bear an ever greater portion of the cost of health care, which penalises people on low incomes. We support the call for a detailed charter of patients’ rights, designed to bring about a high-quality health system in the short, medium and long term, based on solidarity. Like the rapporteur, we request special measures for the new Member States which, for the most part, experience situations more critical than those in the Fifteen. Finally, I am, like the members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, hostile to any further privatisation of health care.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned, I wish, by way of summary, to say some very simple things. Where health is concerned, it is perhaps necessary, in a number of sectors, to spend better by spending differently. That is something I do not deny. If, however, the desire is to treat and cure serious illnesses that are rapidly becoming more widespread, particularly cancer; to deal much better too with rare, orphan diseases, as they are termed; to confront the needs arising from the ageing of our societies’ populations; to provide better psychological and human support to patients; and to be better at developing all public research, including research into surplus embryonic stem cells, which raises new hopes, particularly in connection with illnesses linked to ageing; then, yes, if the desire is to attain all these objectives, more budgetary resources are needed. It is a need no doubt opposed to other state and European priorities and, above all, to the rigour of the monetary stability criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would draw attention to the fact that the poor in our societies, who are too often excluded from care, must never be forgotten. Nor must we forget the poor countries of the world, which do not even have the minimum of health care and whose people, as a consequence, have much shorter life expectancies than ourselves. I shall conclude with a saying that, familiar though its sentiments undoubtedly are, needs constantly to be recalled if it is to be put into practice. If I remember rightly, it is to the effect that quality, not length, of life is what really matters in the end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report on health care and care for the elderly is timely. According to the 2001 census, 18.61% of the population in Scotland are over pension age and, even more interesting, 19.54% – almost 20% – of carers are over pension age. The ageing population presents us with huge challenges, not just in Scotland but across the whole EU. That is why sharing best practice between countries throughout the EU is so vital.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to look at simple solutions focused on individual persons. Older adults can often have multiple medical problems. That is why a holistic approach, involving a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, dieticians and social workers, along with the person's family, is so important. Although more doctors are being trained in geriatric care, which is a growing area of interest, there still needs to be more investment in this expanding specialism.</p>
<p class="contents">For the older person, there are other issues to consider. It is a popular misbelief that a large percentage of older adults live in some form of care home. In fact, a large proportion of older adults live independently, with family or social support. My great aunt Agnes, at 91 years of age, is one of them. Sometimes when an older patient is ill and recovering in hospital what is important to them is to be able to return home and cope at home. For some older patients this can be more important than the treatment of their medical condition itself.</p>
<p class="contents">With people living longer, and an increasing proportion of the population over 65, it is also interesting that a lot of medical trials do not include elderly patients, although this matter is beginning to be addressed. We have a responsibility to the older population within the EU. After all, one day we too will be part of the older population, since none of us is getting any younger. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Elderly people have the right to live in dignity, to have access to health care and other forms of care, irrespective of their social or financial situation. This is being called into question in a number of countries, such as mine, Portugal, because of a neo-liberalism that is trying to impose itself in a wide variety of areas, including health, by prioritising competition and competitiveness, thus jeopardising quality public services and showing no respect for people or their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the majority of the elderly in the European Union are women – over 63% of people aged between 75 and 84, and 72% of those over 85 are women – means that they in particular will be the ones most affected by problems in health care systems and long-term care, either as carers themselves or as people in receipt of care.</p>
<p class="contents">The persistence of inequalities in women’s wages and retirement makes them especially vulnerable to the consequences of dismantling public health services and to the shortage of care for the elderly. It should be noted that women form the majority of the 55 million people at risk of poverty in the current 15-Member European Union and of the many millions in the enlargement countries. That is why we are so strongly critical of the fact that the Member States are increasing the proportion of health costs to be borne by patients, both for prevention and for treatments, drugs, and palliative or other care. This situation is jeopardising the principle of solidarity in health systems and contributing to the growth in social exclusion of the less favoured groups in society, who are finding it increasingly difficult to access appropriate, high-quality health care.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, although I believe the report has its positive aspects, I cannot agree with the insistence on creating an internal market in health services and products, since this will only benefit private organisations, particularly insurance companies, and jeopardise a high-quality, universal public service. What is needed is greater public investment in facilities and equipment and in the training of the technical and specialist workers needed, better provision of quality care and assistance for the elderly, specifically in the health services, and the setting-up of home care services, ensuring that all citizens have access to these services in all the countries of the European Union. Hence the proposals that we tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">What is also needed is greater participation by user organisations, the health and care services themselves and their workers in the preparation and implementation of measures, so as to ensure greater democracy in the operation of these services, which must be quality services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The title is significant: 'Health care and care for the elderly: Supporting national strategies for ensuring a high level of social protection'. We should all want to see a high level of social protection and learn from each other via the exchange of best practice at European level but, ultimately, it is national strategies that have to deliver. Certainly, in the United Kingdom, there is still much to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Two weeks ago, Age Concern England held an important debate in London called 'Creating opportunity – is Europe working for older people?'. It was a privilege to be on the panel together with three other colleagues from this House. We agreed about many things, particularly the need to move such issues sharply up the agenda. We like to think of the United Kingdom as a rich country, but one in five pensioners are in low-income households; the incomes of those over 75 are lower still. Women pensioners are the worst off of all; fully 25% of women pensioners in the United Kingdom today live in poverty. Their healthcare needs are proportionately greater and therefore need addressing with greater urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">As the number of elderly people grows, the requirement for good healthcare and care services grows also. I was told recently that in the United Kingdom there are some 40 000 fewer places available in care homes today than ten years ago. If this is true, it is not a statistic of which any country can be proud. It is a reminder in each of our countries that excessive regulation, which may well have been intended to provide greater social protection, can often destroy what it wishes to promote. This is a lesson for our committee on other dossiers too.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, may I record a brief message to Commissioner Diamantopoulou, whose successor has just been announced by the Greek Government. The role of Employment and Social Affairs Commissioner can never be easy, especially when it involves dealing with such difficult United Kingdom MEPs as Mr Hughes and myself. I believe she has left without having to declare who has been the more difficult, but I am sure that both of us, and hopefully all of us in the committee and this House, would wish her well in her new life back home. If colleagues agree, I would like to ask Commissioner Solbes to pass that message on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Meijer (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, it is generally assumed that all EU care systems are based on the principles of solidarity, justice and universality. These entail that every person, in the case of illness or need for care, is entitled to the appropriate high-quality care without any distinction according to income, means or age. The European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was compiled in 2000 and is to form part of the European Constitution, guarantees for the elderly a dignified and independent life and for each person the right to access to health care and medical treatment. Moreover, the draft constitution provides for the pursuit of a high level of social protection. Everyone can therefore rest assured, because on paper, everything is regulated down to the last detail. However, in practice, economies of scale mean that there are increasing complaints about the unacceptably long travelling distances between home and hospital, about waiting lists for hospital admission, about a shortage of accommodation for the elderly who need care, a shortage of medical and care staff, a reduction in medicines available and the need to go abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">For some people, the shortage of care leads to premature death and for others, it leads to such a poor quality of life that they choose to die by means of voluntary euthanasia long before they have reached the natural stage of dying. Needless to say, there are all kinds of excuses for these wrongs. On average, people tend to live longer, they have fewer children than before, and those children – men and women – are completely absorbed by the ever more binding obligation to work. Help from neighbours and children is less and less available. In those circumstances, it is irresponsible to reduce taxes and premiums on the basis of the argument that we need less. Since this is done anyway, there is ever more public doubt as to the affordability of health care, care for the elderly and pensions in an ageing society. Additionally, staff for care tasks are increasingly scarce, since, in times of economic growth, those people are drained away to production sectors that are, for a time more profitable and offer a higher salary. As soon as they lose their jobs as a result of an economic crisis, they are not suitably trained to be able to deal with care tasks effectively. The drain of personnel from countries with a lower standard of living exacerbates the problems over there. In one candidate Member State, Romania, a large proportion of the population is now no longer insured, so they rely on the goodwill of doctors. If insurance cover and care tasks are entrusted to private companies that claim to make a profit despite charging less, then accessibility, quality and equal treatment are further eroded. The European Union should discourage this development rather than encourage it. If we want to realise all the fine intentions that have been made on paper, a collective approach will be needed on a larger scale than is possible the basis of voluntary work by family members. In that case, the necessary funding should also be made available, which means that a larger proportion of our national income should be spent on public services in the care sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We live in a world undergoing a process of ageing. At first glance, this sentence may seem negative, but it also has a positive side, which is that people’s lives are getting longer. Both aspects should be considered objectively. Naturally, the right of elderly people to lead a life of dignity and independence and to participate in social and cultural life is objective, and is provided for in Article 25 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, this article falls within the framework of the second chapter, entitled ‘Equality’ – perhaps as an extension or a specification of the principle of equality: ‘Everyone is equal before the law’, as stated in Article 20 and, at the same time, of the prohibition of all discrimination, including discrimination on the grounds of age, as stated in Article 21 – and not within the fourth chapter of the Charter, entitled ‘Solidarity’, as one would logically assume, though this fourth chapter does include the right to preventive health care and to benefit from medical treatment under the conditions established by national legislations and practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the three great objectives we need to achieve are: universal accessibility regardless of the economic situation of each person, high-quality health care and the long-term sustainability of health care systems. In a Europe whose principles and objectives include the free movement of persons, national strategies must include promoting modernisation and coordination, both in order to prevent any possible social exclusion, and in order to promote our going back to a society of experience, wisdom and knowledge of the elderly.</p>
<p class="contents">Worthy of additional consideration are very old people, as a sector of this demographic group is described the report; since their care is going to require a large workforce, it is going to be a source of employment which, in any event, is going to require the professionals of this sector, the services, training and specialist care sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by talking about the need to become aware of the problems. Increasing awareness within society as a whole often prevents problems from arising in the future. A typical example of this is the rules on building or the removal of architectural boundaries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that issues of enormous interest have been raised, which we will try to consider as far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make just two comments. Firstly, the use of the open coordination method is going to provide us with a new dynamic in relation to the specific field of health. Naturally, the diffusion of best practices will allow for greater efficiency, which will undoubtedly benefit both national health systems and users and service providers. This use of the open coordination method will also allow us to enhance the social policy aspects of the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I have noted the concern amongst certain speakers about the inter-relationship between the internal market and health. Nevertheless, I believe there is a broad consensus on the three fundamental objectives: accessibility, quality and sustainability. This demonstrates that the approach does not focus solely and exclusively on the internal market, but that the provision of adequate health services is also fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also reflected in the communication initially adopted by the Commission, which, as well as insisting on the need to make progress on the internal market, also stresses the need for appropriate provision of services for all patients and, naturally, the public funding necessary for these services to be provided. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
