I would like to begin by congratulating the European Parliament on its initiatives aimed at drawing the attention of the States of the Union – which we should not forget are the European protagonists in the space sector – but drawing the attention of those States to the need to take courageous and significant decisions in a sector in crisis, as the space sector currently is.</p>
<p class="contents">The broad debate arising from the Commission’s Green Paper on European space policy highlights several points. Firstly, I would mention the need to go ahead with a restructuring of the launcher sector in order to guarantee Europe access to space.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like, together with the whole of the Commission, to re-affirm how urgent it is to reach an agreement within the European Space Agency on Galileo. I would like to say, ladies and gentlemen, that I believe it essential that there be an agreement within the European Space Agency since we have been waiting too long. First it was certain countries, and now it is others. In any event, at Community level, we reached an agreement a whole year ago during the Spanish Presidency. Unfortunately, an agreement is still to be reached within the Space Agency where I would remind the honourable Members that the intergovernmental system operates.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Galileo issue, I would like to point out that this is one of the great essential projects if we are to maintain our space sector, and that, furthermore, if we do not establish the joint undertaking very quickly, which must move this project ahead, we risk facing difficulties when it comes to continuing to maintain the adjudication of frequencies which we achieved having overcome every type of obstacle in 2000. I would therefore like once again to insist on the European interest, on the need for an agreement to be reached on this point as soon as possible and that national differences be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission supports the work of the Convention aimed at including space as a shared competence in the Union Treaty in the future. The initial approaches emerging from the process of consultation on the Green Paper are converging in favour of the definition of a space policy for the European Union, as well as its application by means of an ambitious space programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I finish, however, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that the existence of a common policy in the defence sector at least, in the arms sector, would also assist enormously the work and activity of the space sector. We know, ladies and gentlemen, that, for our most direct competitors, the most significant support for this sector comes from precisely that source of funding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution is a response to a growing concern: when we discuss the Green Paper with a view to the drawing up of a White Paper – in other words, of a more organic Commission proposal – we would not want to find ourselves in a situation where our goals are jeopardised by the severe crisis affecting the entire European space industry and, in particular, the new version of Ariane; nor would we want – and I believe this is one of the Commission’s concerns – the<span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">impasse</span><span class="bold"> </span>in connection with<span class="bold"> </span>the Galileo project ultimately to jeopardise a highly ambitious project which has required extraordinary cooperation from the whole of European industry.</p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced that space is a key sector for Europe and that this decision, formalised by the establishment of the European Space Agency, must be confirmed and consolidated. The Space Agency is an asset which we must not waste, and it is no coincidence that it is cited, not least in the recent action plan to increase research, as one of the major technological platforms to be considered if we are to respond to the need to make the European economy competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">The space industry is currently experiencing a period of crisis. However, we must remember that, although the resources which have been available to it are infinitely inferior to those at the disposal of the parallel United States industry, it has succeeded in winning a sizeable share of the market and has managed to compete in those fields in which it was operating in parallel with the US initiative too, reducing Europe’s dependency on US technology in industry sectors where both were active and, not least, finding the means to cooperate positively with North American industry.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that this presence, this initiative must be confirmed, and it would appear from the Commission’s response – although expressed in what, as I have said, is an unplanned debate arising from the concern not to find ourselves in a situation where our plans are jeopardised and pending a more organic, comprehensive assessment – that it agrees with us.</p>
<p class="contents">We must acknowledge that the development of the space sector is extremely important in terms of making the knowledge-based economy a practical reality, that public funding and coordination of defence policies is essential and that it can be supplemented by private investment but only in some links in the space industry value chain.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that these observations, which express our agreement with the Commission, will be heeded by the Council when it meets on 27 May to take decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Savary (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs de Palacio for her speech this Monday night at the beginning of the Parliamentary session on a matter that is highly topical, since, in fact, our speeches are not so much addressed to Commissioner Busquin or to Mrs de Palacio herself as to the ministerial meeting of the European Space Agency, which is due to take place in a few days’ time. We have high expectations of its outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is worth saying that this is a topical initiative. It is not intended to replace reports or the debate on the Green Paper, or the Galileo debate. It has simply become clear at various meetings that this is a critical time for the European space sector – perhaps more critical than we realise – due to the problems of Arianespace, which affect not only launchers but the entire satellite industry as well.</p>
<p class="contents">A question mark is therefore now hanging over the skills and expertise we have acquired, which are extremely valuable at a time when new space powers are emerging all over the world, at a time when we can see that the market studies carried out in the 1990s are no longer being acted on, in particular in the field of satellite constellations.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to examine the question of what Europe is doing, given that this is a European project. Of course, the French are particularly concerned, since they instigated the conquest of space a few years ago, but, today, it is no longer possible for one isolated country to maintain its space capacity at world level.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, therefore, I am not speaking as a Frenchman, Commissioner, but as a European who would like us to consider Airbus and what that remarkable achievement involved. We should make that clear to those who might say that if the European space sector does not measure up they will buy elsewhere. We could also have purchased planes elsewhere. Sadly, however, this would compromise European skills, technology and expertise, and, in particular, civil applications in all fields, including medicine, information technology and aeronautics. This is therefore a strategic project, not just in the military sense, but also quite simply in terms of what is Europe’s most valuable asset, in other words its technological progress.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as you can, we would like you to convey to the Member States, who are also members of the ESA, our desire to see an emergency plan implemented to restructure the launcher sector, and also our desire to see the Galileo crisis resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">You have certainly done more than your duty in this field. For the first time, Europe is sending out a strong signal, it possesses a space programme, and we know that programmes are essential, but we can see that the ESA is suffering one crisis after another.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we believe it is very important, on the one hand, to succeed in overcoming this crisis at the next ministerial meeting of the ESA, and, on the other, if we do not succeed, to ask the Commission to take matters firmly in hand. I know this is difficult, I know that Germany and France in particular are not necessarily cooperative with regard to establishing an executive director. I would like to see an end to minor skirmishes in this field. What we are asking, however, is that the Commission compensate for the failings of the ESA, if failings it must have.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we would like to send a message to the Convention on the future of the Union, calling for space to be an area of shared competence in future, since, once again, we believe this would be in keeping with its strategic nature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union’s common space policy is important. The European Space Agency is an essential part of European integration. Most of the members of the European Space Agency are members of the EU, and most of the members of the EU are also members of the European Space Agency. Space technology is a very important area for policy on research and industry. At present more than 40 000 people work in the space industry and the sector indirectly creates employment for as many as 250 000. Space research is traditionally at the forefront of all research. Many of the discoveries made there are later on applied in the circumstances of everyday life, to become of service to the whole public.</p>
<p class="contents">By far the largest and most important of the projects jointly engaged in by the European Union and the ESA is the Galileo Satellite Navigation Programme. It is a system based on satellites and ground stations, which is intended to be introduced in 2008. It will enable receivers to locate their whereabouts and determine what time it is, with extreme accuracy, anywhere on earth. The European system differs from the American GPS and the Russian Glonas systems in that it is the most modern system, and its operation would not be adversely affected in times of crisis. The last war in Iraq showed just how important this is. The Galileo system would secure the non-dependence of the EU and the ESA on the other systems, whose management would be none of their business.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s involvement is mainly restricted to developing the Galileo system, which should be completed in 2005. This phase will cost at least EUR 1.1 billion, of which the EU has undertaken to pay half and the ESA the other half. In addition, the private sector should be involved in the project, contributing around EUR 200 million. The Galileo system is vital for the development of European research and technology. The EU and the ESA countries should be at the global forefront of space technology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ainardi (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, we are indeed facing a very unusual situation and I am glad this debate is being held tonight, even though, sadly, very few Members are present in the Chamber. In the face of the international competition that has developed in the field of launchers, and considerable funding problems, the European space industry is undergoing a very serious, even unprecedented, crisis, and we therefore urgently need to overcome this situation which threatens the very existence of Arianespace and find solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise the fact that access to space is not just an industrial priority – it is also a requirement in terms of European identity and autonomy in a field in which we have acquired substantial competence. Space is all about research and highly important civil applications. We often consider it to mean the conquest of space, but I personally would say that space is mainly what we call useful space – telecommunications, observation satellites, medicine and disaster prevention. It is an area of excellence and competence and also an important source of skilled employment, providing 35 000 direct jobs in Europe, with a significant research sector.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, I would like to emphasise the need for the space sector to serve mainly peaceful objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I would join other Members in welcoming the fact that the development of the European space policy has been deemed a priority for the Sixth Community Framework-Programme for research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also pleased to note that the future of the European Space Agency is on the agenda for our part-session. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Space Agency is an effective intergovernmental coordination body that has contributed to the development of space applications in Europe and throughout the world. I therefore consider it necessary to establish a genuine European space policy with greater involvement of European Union competences in this field. I also believe that this is not incompatible with maintaining the autonomy of the Agency. The Union therefore needs to make a genuine commitment for the Agency to continue to develop as a coordinator and programme manager.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I would like to reiterate what other Members have said. In order to establish an autonomous European policy we urgently need to overcome the impasse on the Galileo dossier and, at last – as we have endlessly repeated – ensure that the Member States overcome their differences to enact this programme and move towards its rapid implementation, relaunching the European launcher.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, Commissioner – and I do not know whether this is a possibility – like the Commission to carry out a study on distortions in competition between Ariane and launchers from other countries on the civil commercial market. Although I share the concern and desire to make space a European project and concentrate on the necessary restructuring of the sector, I nevertheless have a few questions on the industrial restructuring that is currently underway, coming as I do from the Toulouse area. Under what conditions and for what purpose are they being carried out?</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that the European space sector suffers from increased competence. Quite the opposite. This would be to take a short-term view rather than an ambitious, long-term view. I believe that continuing to develop technological and human competence in the sector, rather than losing them, would be the real goal for Europe if, as stated, it is to possess an autonomous, competitive competence in this field. I too believe it is important to send a strong signal to the forthcoming Council of Ministers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first discussion within the competent committee, the ITRE committee, will take place on 21 May and the report will be discussed in plenary in November.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the problems you have highlighted, Commissioner, I would like, if I may, to speak on behalf of the ITRE Committee and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to remind us all of the timetable for implementing Galileo: autumn 2002, the Galileo Joint Undertaking becomes operative; end of 2002, Commission report to the Council on the integration of the EGNOS programme into the Galileo programme and the concession model; December 2002, Council decision on the services provided by Galileo and the frequency service plan; July 2003, World Radiocommunications Conference; summer 2003, Commission proposal to the Council on the creation of the future security body; autumn 2003, Commission report to the Council on the preselection of the future concessionaire; end of 2004, launch of the first experimental satellite.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to adhere to this timetable, we now urgently need to overcome the impasse that has arisen within the ESA, where the Member States are divided over the importance each has in the programme. It is understandable that the Member States concerned want to have their say, but it is rather a nuisance, since, for the sake of 1% or 2% of their participation, we are in danger of considerably delaying the implementation of this project, which genuinely has a European dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware of the need for technology that is equivalent to or better than GPS. As we saw with Commissioner Busquin, substantial research has been carried out with a view to achieving extraordinary technology, which will be even better than GPS technology. It will comprise environmental applications, which will also be essential. We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance feel strongly that the project should be transparent, and we do not want it to be carried out in haste because of a delay. We are extremely concerned that the Galileo project should have civil, rather than military, applications. We therefore consider that it should be implemented swiftly. More than 200 Members of Parliament signed a motion in April against a delay and in favour of speeding up the implementation of the project.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be grateful, Commissioner, if you could do all you can to ensure that progress is made in this direction and to overcome the impasse as swiftly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Piétrasanta, I am glad that you have referred to the amendment that we all joined in signing, for that really does show our relative helplessness. On the other hand, though, we also want discussion of these topics to continue. I was pleased, Mr Savary, when you said that you were speaking as a European, as that means that you were not doing so as an expert or as a Frenchman. Here too, what is really at stake is again becoming apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that what we are discussing this evening is nothing less than one of the key issues for twenty-first century Europe. Faced with the crisis in the European economy as a whole, and in particular in the sector we are discussing this evening, a self-supporting and independent Europe must want to energetically promote branches of business, and that will involve reflection on its original strengths. Not merely is it no help, it is also an enormous waste of public funds if, over a period of decades, all the Member States pursue an expenditure policy that, rather than introducing new angles, aims to maintain things they acquired long ago, so that their eyes remain closed to the economic realities.</p>
<p class="contents">As everyone has stressed this evening, what we quite simply need is modern approaches to Europe’s future, in both the economy and technology. Today, therefore, I would like to go in to bat for a Europe that is more involved in space. The fact is that Europe must not miss the boat in a forward-looking high technology sector in which important jobs can be created, and already have been. So what we need, quite simply, is greater commitment and more support for a policy on space travel. What is called for here is strategic thinking over and above national frontiers, rather than the short-term and short-sighted activity for its own sake that we unfortunately see at present, not least in my homeland.</p>
<p class="contents">Why space, one might ask. Why should Europe get involved in the far reaches of outer space? Would it not make more sense to invest money on earth? Do we have the money in the first place? My answer is that mastery and exploitation of outer space is the key to success in the world of modern technology. Let me show this by way of some examples. Whether the systems we are working with have to do with communications, navigation or surveillance, satellites have a crucial part to play in it. As we have just heard, entire sectors depend, even today, on the use of satellite technology, and we are already so accustomed to this that we give it no further thought. Money, when invested in such areas of science as meteorology, cartography, transport, medicine, and so on, gives much more by way of a return – something of which Galileo is another example.</p>
<p class="contents">If, though, there is not constant updating, if we do not do research, if innovations are not constantly being introduced, if financial support is not also made available, the European space sector will languish or disappear altogether. What we need, then, is a new chapter in European space policy, and I very much welcome the positive approaches contained in the Green Paper on the subject. A coherent space policy strategy and precise action lines are indispensable if Europe’s efforts in space are to gain new impetus rather than disappear into a black hole. That, though, is why we decided that now was the time to formulate today’s resolution by Parliament. We must not wait until Europe’s last rocket has had lift-off. If we do, we will no longer be able to keep up with the competition from third countries, and that would be the worst thing that could happen to us.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a challenge for the ESA Member States; Galileo is on the testbed, and we must get this topic actually incorporated into the treaty that the Convention is working on. That is the greatest and most important challenge. In that sense, I hope that we will, tomorrow, come up with a joint resolution and a joint text that will then, on Thursday, be supported by Parliament as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It shows the widespread support. We want a consolidated European space policy. We do not want continuous, ad hoc structures. We need a permanent solution. This must be made clear at the ESA ministerial meeting. The reasons are obvious. There is considerable European added value in working together. There is an existing <span class="italic">acquis </span>which must be built upon. We must have independence within this part of the world in this very important sector. It allows us to have links with third countries such as the United States - why not - and also Russia and countries further afield such as South Africa and some of the applicant countries. It allows us to retain our scientists and our technologists. Otherwise we will lose them. It allows us to recruit the new generation of scientists and technologists. We cannot do that unless there are projects that capture the imagination of our talented young people.</p>
<p class="contents">It allows us, of course, to have spin-offs in a variety of sectors which have already been mentioned and which will enhance the SME sector. It allows us to be much more efficient in carrying out our EU objectives and policies on climate change, agriculture, security and development in the developing countries. We are playing uphill on a very sloping playing field against the United States. They use cross-subsidy to the tune of 31.8 billion of public money - and rising fast - compared to our EUR 6 billion - and falling. They use public procurement, without blushing, to encourage their space sector. They use R&amp;D. They use a monopoly on certain electronic equipment to keep us from exploiting the high-tech space sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already heard about launchers and satellites. Clearly the problems of the telecoms sector have been difficult for satellites in the European Union. But there is no reason, with an up-turn, that we should not, with public procurement and public funds, be launching far more satellites in the future for public, citizen benefit. As far as Galileo is concerned, Mr President, you know more than anyone else in this House what is needed. I am delighted that Mr Prodi is prepared to be proactive. He will have the support of many people in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let us not forget astronomy and space exploration. I would like to hear a bit more about the European southern laboratory.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us have space policy in the Convention. It is an ideal area for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now that would be a nice contribution from the Commission. The discussions surrounding the financing of Galileo are starting – within the European Space Agency, at any rate – to resemble a bad soap opera. At every turn, another Member State emerges from the wings to block this agreement. Now it seems that Spain is the culprit once more. This is hard to understand, since, after all, Galileo is important to maritime safety. The <span class="italic">Prestige</span> environmental disaster is evidently not a sufficiently convincing argument for Mr Aznar’s government. It is time that our Parliament blew the whistle to bring an end to this little game.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a very great commitment, and it is perhaps precisely for that reason that some countries are under pressure to shelve this strategic project. That is why I am one of the co-signatories to this resolution. Galileo is of strategic importance to the Union, because – whatever happens – we have to keep pace with technology. We want independence when it comes to information on positioning, and we do not want a ‘brain drain’ or ‘job drain’ to the United States. The decision to proceed with Galileo was not taken lightly. After all, there are many arguments for and against it. I support the arguments in favour of Galileo. Here in this Chamber, I want to lend my support to the realisation of this network. We must not dawdle on this, however. The scenario is simple: if Galileo is not realised as soon as possible, the transport sector will delve deeper and deeper into GPS applications, and Galileo will remain unused. In the short term, therefore, Galileo has to constitute a valuable alternative to GPS for the European transport sector. This sector needs a strong signal from the Commission, the ESA and the Galileo Consortium, and quickly, otherwise future users will not put their trust in the applications; and Galileo is too expensive to remain unused.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to go on to emphasise its civilian nature. That is something that is very important to us. Only Galileo can offer users a guarantee that the plug will not be pulled when the United States once more feels compelled to take unilateral action somewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, the Commission itself, in its communication, speaks about the consequences of the war in Iraq for the energy and transport sector. We must not, therefore, lose this project; national interests must defer to the interests of the Union in this respect. In my country there is a pop song about Satellite Suzy. I hope that Satellite Suzy, too, passes overhead one day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, I shall merely raise the problems relating to the Galileo programme.</p>
<p class="contents">More than a year has passed since the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism adopted this European satellite navigation programme in March 2002, and it has so far proved impossible to reach an agreement within the European Space Agency with regard to funding this programme. Galileo came into existence after marked opposition from certain countries. Today, it cannot be implemented, first of all, because of the strong competition between those who would like to lead the project, and, secondly, for reasons concerning levels of funding. The European space industry, as we have all said, is currently undergoing a considerable crisis. It employs 30 000 highly-skilled workers in Europe and we must do all we can to protect the extraordinary technological and human potential represented by this industry. Galileo is one of the programmes that will be able to make the greatest contribution. It will also, moreover, provide the European Union with strategic independence.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament wanted companies to participate financially in the joint undertaking. These companies have taken the appropriate action and we now need to support the swift implementation of the project. Our credibility is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another key element in favour of implementing the programme as a matter of urgency. As you said, Commissioner, unless we send a signal at the appropriate time, we shall not be able to use the frequencies reserved for Galileo and the related functions. The European Space Agency must take a decision rapidly and this concern is shared by many of us, both as Members of the European and national parliaments, who drew up and disseminated the document ‘<span class="italic">Galileo: il est temps d'agir</span>’ [‘Galileo: time to act!’], addressed to the Heads of State and Government of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Galileo programme shows us the limits of the current European space policy. We must learn lessons from this concerning the discussions held which will lead to the adoption, between now and the end of the year, of a White Paper on the subject. The Galileo programme must be successful and send out a positive signal from Europe concerning an ambitious space policy. This House must provide its full support so that the joint undertaking can be implemented rapidly and so that the European Commission, as represented by you, Commissioner, shares this concern of our ‘Sky and Space’ intergroup in the European Parliament. Furthermore, in his letter of 30 April last, President Prodi informed the members of this intergroup, through the intermediary of its chair, Mr Savary, of the possibility considered by the Commission of implementing the joint undertaking unilaterally, should an agreement from the ESA not be forthcoming in the next few days.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also call on all the Member States to put an end to their differences concerning funding for the programme at the meeting of the European Space Agency on 27 May next, so that we can, at last, move forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the only technology capable of ensuring the emergence of new worldwide rules to genuinely allow the European industry to access new markets and new technological developments. The space sector to a large extent represents one of the frontiers of pioneering technology. Europe must not therefore fail to be involved in this extremely important sector. We must implement a new policy which integrates all European actions.</p>
<p class="contents">A moment ago, Mrs McNally spoke of the importance and European added value of the space sector. And in this regard I proposed earlier the inclusion of space policy within the field of Community competences within the context of the review of the Treaties which is currently taking place in the Convention and therefore the drawing up of a future constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect: space at the service of Community policies, a key objective in relation to the White Paper; it should therefore be included in applications such as agriculture, fisheries, education, the environment, which several speakers have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Space Agency will be able to act to stimulate programmes if the view is taken that space is currently of strategic importance; and the Agency can take an approach which overcomes the current restrictions of the intergovernmental approach.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the launcher sector, the Commission is preparing a report for September on this strategic sector, which is unquestionably one of the sectors with the greatest difficulties at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will comment on the Galileo programme, which, like all these issues – I would repeat – are the responsibility of my colleague Mr Busquin, who is doing tremendous work together with the whole team in the Directorate-General for Research and Technological Development.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, since I took on my responsibilities as Commissioner, I have dedicated every effort to Galileo, and not only effort, but also political impetus, in accordance with my capacities and very willingly. It was a project which was far from being able to be realised when I arrived here. Such a significant project was being dealt with by just two officials for the whole project (one of them is here today – no longer in the Directorate-General Transport – and I would like to congratulate Mr Tytgat on his will, because at the end of the day, we are often able to build Europe thanks to specific people who have the courage to move forward promoting their ideas), a project which was very far from maturity. I have given my personal impetus to this project since I began to work here. And I am going to say one thing to you: it has been paralysed for more than a year. The agreement within the Community was reached more than a year ago during the Spanish Presidency, which dedicated much effort to this project.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to the honourable Members that the Community aspect has worked, though more slowly than I would have liked. What has failed has been the intergovernmental aspect which takes the form of the European Space Agency. On occasions, in the course of one year, two countries have blocked the decisions of the European Space Agency. And I understand that over the last month another two have caused problems - in particular one which I know very well.</p>
<p class="contents">I have always called upon all of them to resolve these differences as soon as possible and not to block the project. I have heard ministers in the Council of Ministers haggling over the project, saying that it could not be done by means of an agency, as was proposed at the outset, because we wanted a fully commercial project, with commercial criteria, approached purely from the point of view of economics and economic efficiency, and now I cannot believe that the haggling within the European Space Agency relates to whether the headquarters is in one country or another or whether the Presidency is of one nationality or another. This entirely contradicts what I have heard, not from these ministers but from their transport colleagues, during a series of Councils in which we have had very tough debates.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with my responsibilities, I have proposed to the monitoring committee, in which all the States are represented, the name of a director for the joint undertaking, to implement the joint undertaking solely with Community funds, without making use of the funds of the European Space Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the Member States who have blocked the proposal I have made in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">So let me make it very clear, ladies and gentlemen: within the Community field, the problems have been resolved. It is within the European Space Agency that the problems are still to be resolved and that some Member States – sometimes certain Member States and sometimes others, it does not matter – are blocking a project which is absolutely strategic for the development not just of the space sector, but for the technological development of Europe, and so that it does not get left behind in relation to a series of essential and key applications.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to clearly express my great concern at the repeated delays – I said this a year and a half ago, in December 2001 – of the project in the Council of Ministers, which jeopardises any real possibility of its being implemented, particularly if we are saying that we want the whole system to operate according to strict market rules. We must choose. If we want hard and fast market rules, it makes no sense that we have been wasting our time for more than a year in the European Space Agency arguing about which country or city the headquarters will be in, whether the President of Galileo Industries is to be this person or that person, or whether they come from this or that country of the European Union. What we need to do is seek the best options. We must seek the most efficient location and headquarters. That is what we must seek.</p>
