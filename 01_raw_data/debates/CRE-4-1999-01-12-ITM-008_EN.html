<p class="contents">Question No 29 by <span class="bold">Jaime Valdivielso de Cué </span>(H−1188/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Electronic commerce</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is completing a draft directive on promoting the development of electronic commerce. This type of commerce requires the exchange of confidential data, including personal information relating to the parties, such as credit card numbers; credit cards are habitually used as a means of payment in Internet transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission state what measures are to be taken to ensure the confidentiality of such data and prevent their improper use?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Monti has the floor.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (IT)</span> I return your good wishes, Mr President, and I thank you for your kindness in grouping together these two questions. Beginning with the first, the honourable Member raises the sensitive question of personal data protection in commercial transactions conducted electronically; he refers in particular to credit card numbers, in that credit cards are habitually used as a means of payment over the Internet. The main instrument used to protect privacy and avoid the risks associated with various forms of IT piracy is encryption, as indicated by the Commission in its communication on digital signatures and encryption.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to supporting research and development on instruments to guarantee the secure transmission of credit card data, the Commission is promoting the improvement of technologies serving to minimise the use of personal data in electronic transactions. For example, from a technical point of view, I would recall that the common action programme on research and technological development has funded various instruments designed to guarantee the secure transmission of credit card data, such as the SET standard, an open standard for secure electronic transmission, developed by Visa and MasterCard, which has now become C‐SET and allows for the use of smart‐cards.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also undertaken research into general aspects of telematic security, for example under the Infosec programme; as regards electronic commerce in particular, the Esprit programme has funded various specific projects in this field. The Commission is moreover supporting the development of technical instruments for electronic commerce and security under the fifth RTD framework programme, which will focus in particular on the development of technologies to ensure greater protection of privacy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would stress that the protection of personal data in Internet communications falls within the ad hoc legal framework governing the processing of personal data established by Directives 95/46/EC and 97/66/EC, which entered into force on 25 October 1998.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 30 by <span class="bold">Gary Titley </span>(H−1177/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: EEA and enlargement</span></p>
<p class="contents">Article 128 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Area states that any European state becoming a member of the Community shall apply to become a member of the EEA. What are the institutional implications of this?</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, if EU membership automatically requires new members to join the EEA how are EFTA EEA states to be involved in decisions leading to enlargement of the EU?</p>
<p class="contents">Would there need to be two rounds of ratification, one for enlargement of the EU and one for enlargement of the EEA?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van den Broek, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (NL)</span> The question by the honourable Member concerns the relationship between membership of the European Economic Area and the states which will shortly be joining the Union and which at the time of their accession must of course adopt the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire, </span> pursuant to the provisions of the accession agreements when negotiated. A part of the negotiated <span class="italic">acquis</span> will be the agreement concerning the European Economic Area and to what extent Union membership automatically implies membership of the European Economic Area. Article 128 of the EEA Agreement provides for a procedural mechanism for the accession of new states to the EEA. There are three parts to this article. Firstly, it stipulates that a new member must submit its application to the EEA Council. Secondly, it stipulates that the conditions for participation are the subject of an agreement between the contracting parties to the EEA Agreement and the applicant country. Thirdly, it stipulates that the agreement must be ratified by all contracting parties. It is up to the applicant countries to decide when to apply for EEA membership, but it must be before accession to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission regularly informs the EFTA/EEA countries of progress on enlargement, by way of a joint committee to which it submits briefings. The Council will have to consider to what extent the comments of the EFTA/EEA countries can be taken into account, since the enlargement negotiations take place in the framework of an intergovernmental conference. As the EEA agreement is also part of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire, </span> in ratifying the accession treaty the Member States will also be ratifying EEA extension. The EFTA/EEA partners must also ratify the participation of applicant countries in the EEA. These decisions must be made in parallel so that the applicant countries also become full partners in the EEA on the date they join the Union. My apologies for the fact that this is a rather complicated explanation, but I hope that it is now clear to the honourable Member.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Titley </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – I should like to thank the Commissioner for a thorough answer although he has not actually answered the last part of my question, namely, do there need to be two ratifications – one for EU membership and one for EEA membership? Every country that is part of the EEA had to ratify the EEA agreement, so does the United Kingdom, for example, have to ratify both EU membership for Poland and EEA membership for Poland?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, can he confirm that applicant countries have to apply to join the EEA – i.e. that this is compulsory, that they are required to apply. Also, what happens if a derogation is negotiated within the accession negotiations which the EFTA/EEA countries are not happy with?

Do I summarise it well if I formulate the question as follows: Could there be different conditions which apply to entry to the EU and to participation in the EEA? As the EEA acquis will be for the candidate countries identical to the EC acquis it would be unthinkable for the candidates to have transitional periods as members of the EEA which were different from those agreed in the accession negotiations as. There should be clear parallelism.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as ratification is concerned, I tried to make clear in my first reply that since the EEA agreement is part of the Community acquis, ratification by the Member States of the Accession Treaty implies equally the ratification of the EEA extension. I hope that clarifies my position.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Article 128, if you read the text literally they have to apply, but in fact the Council will remind them that this official act has to be carried out anyhow before accession, which also in fact includes participating in the EEA. This formality has to be completed.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission undertook a thorough revision of the Community school‐milk programme in 1993 and, as it is no doubt aware, the Treaty of Amsterdam now commits the Community to pursue action in the field of public health aimed at improving public health, preventing human illness and diseases and obviating sources of danger to human health.</p>

<p class="contents">We see no reason why we should in any way change these objectives at this time. So there are at present no plans for any revision. But of course we must also wait and see what the Agenda 2000 negotiations produce. In the light of that it may of course prove necessary to make certain changes and adjustments.</p>

<p class="contents">My personal – and I stress personal – view with regard to school milk is that in the light of reform it is worth considering even at this stage how to make this system, which is at present rather entangled in red tape, a little less bureaucratic. Quite apart from that, on principle it must surely be in the interest of the dairy industry itself to do all it can to draw its products to the attention of the future consumers rather than just leaving it to the public administration to encourage children to consume more dairy products by subsidising them. Here I could well imagine a combination of private‐sector and Community measures, in order to achieve the best results.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 34 by <span class="bold">Joan Vallvé </span>(H−1191/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Catalan national sports teams</span></p>
<p class="contents">Article 129 of the EC Treaty states that the Community shall contribute to the flowering of cultures while respecting their diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, competitive sports events are among the most widely disseminated of cultural manifestations. In the interests of affirming the plurality of the Union's peoples, does the Commission consider the draft law now under discussion by the Catalan Parliament which would, inter alia, create a framework that would allow Catalan national teams to compete on a similar basis to that already applying to Scottish and Welsh national teams to be in line with the existing criteria for cultural events?</p>

Therefore, it is not for the Commission to rule on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Initially, it falls to each Member State and to the appropriate sporting authorities to set up and run national teams. In the case of Spain, relevant Spanish legislation on the issue should be borne in mind, in particular, the Sports Act of 15 October 1990, and Royal Decree No 2075 of 20 July 1982 concerning representation at international events and other sporting activities.</p>

<p class="contents">I merely wished to put forward the views of a significant proportion of the citizens of Catalonia who would like to see the creation of sports teams along the lines of those that currently exist in Scotland and Wales, and which could in future be set up in other areas, such as Flanders. Such teams would allow the citizens to make their identity felt in these competitions.</p>

It was a Scotsman who wrote the book <span class="italic">Homage to Catalonia, </span> so we have a very strong feeling of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Sport was a fairly late‐comer to the scope of the Treaty. Would the Commissioner agree that perhaps the Commission should look at further enlarging that scope because, of all games, there is no doubt that football seems to arouse the strongest passions?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oreja</span> <span class="bold">. </span>‐ <span class="italic">(ES)</span> We have indeed considered this matter, especially in view of certain recent developments, notably a declaration in the Treaty. Some Member States were of the opinion that the issue of sport should be included in the Treaty. However, it did not figure amongst the articles or the protocols, but it was included in a declaration. As the honourable Member is well aware, it is often the case that what is initially a declaration later becomes incorporated into the Treaty. It could well be that this is a first stage and that sport will be included following future reviews of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say that last December the Vienna European Council dealt with sport from two points of view. On the one hand, the social function of sport was recognised, and on the other, the need to adopt appropriate measures on doping was emphasised. As regards doping, we should not be seeking an individual response from each of the Member States, but some sort of coordination amongst them. In this connection, I should like to say that I encouraged the Austrian Presidency to hold a three‐way ministerial meeting involving the German, British and Austrian Sports Ministers, with Austria in the chair and Commission representation. I myself was present in Salzburg where we exchanged ideas on the possible way forward for sport within the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the International Olympic Committee has called a meeting in Lausanne on 3 and 4 February to discuss doping. In my view, the European Union should be adequately briefed for the meeting. I have therefore approached all the sports ministers suggesting we meet before the meeting arranged by the International Olympic Committee in order to establish the European Union"s position. It would not seem to make much sense for us to attend and then for each minister to speak for himself without us having reached any prior agreement. Consequently, we shall be meeting on 19 January to prepare for the meeting on 3 and 4 February in Lausanne.</p>
<p class="contents">It must now be clear to the honourable Member that sport is starting to make its presence felt. There is a suggestion that sport should be included in Article 128 of the Treaty. This would mean that sport would feature in the cultural area envisaged in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the College of Commissioners has not yet given its opinion on the matter, I should make it clear that I myself am in favour of such an approach. Whilst subsidiarity must, of course, be respected, I do believe it is right to start working towards the inclusion of sport in the Treaty.</p>

I cannot therefore go beyond the scope of the Treaty, because one of the Commission"s many responsibilities is that of guardian of the Treaty. What I can talk about is what could be envisaged for the future in terms of including the issue of sport, but that is another matter. I cannot give you any other answer at the moment.

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oreja, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (ES)</span> As is widely known, Euronews is an independent television broadcasting company. It began as a collaborative venture between several public channels. Some of these still have capital invested in it, but Euronews is now controlled by ITN, an independent channel.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the European nature of its programmes, its ability to broadcast in five Community languages and its transnational broadcasting network, the European Commission, with Parliament"s support, has been cooperating with this company for a number of years. In particular, it makes an annual contribution towards the financing of the company.</p>
<p class="contents">At Parliament"s suggestion, a different arrangement was arrived at last year. The aim was to ensure greater transparency in the relationship between the European Union and the station, and to link the Community"s financial contribution to the production and broadcasting of specific programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1998, therefore, the Commission, with the approval of the budgetary authority, negotiated a three‐year memorandum of understanding with this company. The agreement provides for the joint production and broadcasting of programmes for the general public on a range of contemporary European issues. A list of activities and the terms of their funding is agreed annually. Progress is monitored through a monthly meeting between the broadcasting company and the Commission, at which a representative of Parliament"s services is also present. As joint producer of the programmes, the Union benefits from production and broadcasting rights concerning the programmes. And this means that the Union can broadcast them for free on its own networks, notably through its EBS satellite system, which means the arrangement is particularly favourable.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond these joint productions, the European Commission has no special involvement with the company regarding, for instance, editorial policy or management. In this way, the arrangement provides a more transparent basis for cooperation restricted to products the public can easily identify and it also respects the channel"s independence.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement signed in 1998 involved a sum of ECU 3 250 million and the production and broadcasting of 42 five‐minute news programmes with on‐the‐spot reports, 168 two‐minute educational cartoons and 222 three and a half‐minute news items.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1999 agreement is currently under negotiation. A decision on the future of our cooperation will be taken in the light of the assessment due prior to the expiry of the three‐year period laid down in the memorandum of understanding. To date, the Commission has been pleased with the arrangement. It has resulted in the production of many programmes and has provided good coverage of events.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is worth mentioning that Parliament"s services recently informed my own services that the presentation of information in programmes produced jointly with Euronews had changed, resulting in more balanced coverage of the work of the various institutions. This is all I can say to the honourable Member on the subject of Euronews at the moment.</p>

I understand from your reply that Euronews is no longer a channel owned by national broadcasting corporations, and, although you did not say so, I deduced that it is privately owned. I would therefore like to ask whether the Commission has arranged for other satellite channel companies to compete for the production of the television programme, and if not, why not? Then I would respectfully ask the Commissioner to provide me, if possible, with the memorandum that spells out the rules that relate to Euronews.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oreja</span> <span class="bold">.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> I should like to tell Mr Seppänen that I personally am a great fan of Euronews and have done all in my power to bolster it.</p>
<p class="contents">Initially, I was confronted with a situation in which the Community was directly involved in Euronews. It was involved in the management of the company and was therefore also affected by the implications of everything put out by Euronews. I visited Euronews in 1997, and the situation seemed to be far from ideal. It seemed preferable for the Community and Euronews to reach an agreement whereby the Community would not be involved in the management of the company. The agreement would refer instead to specific programmes. The Community would specify the programmes it was interested in, aiming at very short programmes to be produced over a long period of time, rather than at television spots. This would ensure maximum coverage of issues related to the work of the institutions for as long as possible and with as much repetition as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">This was therefore the type of arrangement reached. As the honourable Member is probably aware, I have maintained my involvement within the framework of the coordination that exists between Parliament and the Commission. A meeting is held every six weeks or two months. Mr Anatassopoulos leads Parliament"s delegation, and I lead the Commission"s. Four or five Members of Parliament attend together with four or five Commissioners, and we review all issues related to news output, giving particular attention to those concerning Euronews. This enables us to keep a close check on the way the arrangement with Euronews is developing.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the specific issue raised, one of the reasons why I proposed pulling out of the previous direct involvement in Euronews was that Euronews had ceased to be part of the national television networks and was essentially an independent channel. This does not mean that it no longer has links with national channels, as the latter retain their investment in Euronews. At present, however, ITN – an independent channel – is the main owner.</p>
<p class="contents">You will be aware that Euronews has undergone many changes of ownership throughout its history, but it is a matter of regret for me that public channels do not have a greater involvement in it. I did approach several public channels. In fact, I approached the Spanish and Italian public channels, and others who were already involved in some way. I suggested they become more involved and really make their presence felt in Euronews. Unfortunately, they were very reluctant to do so.</p>

Well, I was concerned about Euronews. At great personal inconvenience and considerable expense I paid the cable television company which has a monopoly on the service in my area to instal cable television so I could sit and spend happy hours in the evening listening and watching Euronews. You will be interested to know, Commissioner, with your interest and support for Euronews, that after a period of six months, the cable company wrote to me and told me that Euronews was being withdrawn and that I have no further access to it by any means at all. It is a sad little story but I knew you would be interested to hear it.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 36 by <span class="bold">María Izquierdo Rojo </span>(H−1225/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: European City of Culture candidates</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 30 October 1997, on the request of Parliament and the Council, the Commission submitted a proposal for a decision on the European City of Culture<a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> . Parliament adopted this at first reading on 30 April 1998<a href="#def_1_3" name="ref_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> , and the Council adopted a common position on 24 July 1998<a href="#def_1_4" name="ref_1_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> . As the Commission is aware, the Council's common position diverges sharply from the Commission proposal; in addition, by proposing a distribution by country for the period 2005‐2019, it represents a major departure not only from the spirit of the proposal but from the primary objective of the initiative, namely the ‘communitarisation' of the European City of Culture phenomenon. Can the Community explain why it did not withdraw its proposal following the Council's adoption of its common position? What line does the Commission intend to take on the common position? Does the Commission not consider that it is somewhat premature as of now to begin the process of adoption of a Community initiative which will not come into operation until 2005?</p>
<p class="contents">I give the floor to the Commissioner to answer Mrs Izquierdo Rojo's question.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" width="16"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="buttondocwin"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><a href="#top" title="Top"><img src="/doceo/data/img/navi_top.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0" alt="" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></table>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oreja, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (ES)</span> I am grateful to Mrs Izquierdo Rojo for the question she has raised. This issue was debated in Parliament this very afternoon. Mrs Izquierdo Rojo is aware that it is a matter of great concern to me, and I trust a satisfactory solution can be reached.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has made its view on the common position abundantly clear. At the appropriate time, the Commission put forward a proposal, which we believed to be reasonable. And we believed it was a reasonable proposal because it provided for the choice of the European City of Culture to be devolved to the Community as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not sure whether, of all the cultural events that take place and that have a Community‐wide impact, the European City of Culture is the most significant, but it certainly receives the most publicity. I do think, however, that we can do better than we are doing at present. This very promising scheme was launched by Mrs Mercouri in 1985. It has run from then until now. As you will be aware, Weimar is the European City of Culture for 1999. It seemed to us however, and particularly to me, that there was scope for improving the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">How could the procedure be improved? It could be improved by firstly ensuring that this was not just an event for the city, the region or the country concerned, and investing it with a truly European nature. That is why the Commission suggested in its proposal that the Member States should nominate the city or cities they wanted to see as European City of Culture, outlining at the same time the genuinely European action they proposed to undertake during the year in question. The Commission would then consult with Parliament and with a contact group that could define the criteria involved. In the light of the criteria and Parliament"s report, the Commission would come to a decision and put its proposal to the Council. The Council would then take a majority decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The main problem that tended to arise, particularly in 1997 and 1998, was that the Council found it difficult to reach agreement when a unanimous decision was required. A single country, under pressure from a single city, could make it impossible for agreement to be reached.</p>
<p class="contents">So, we believed that this consultative approach was a good one. All interested parties would be involved, the Commission would put a proposal to Council and the Council would then take a majority decision. In the event, this approach did not meet with Council approval. The Council therefore unanimously adopted a common position. I was unsure as to whether the latter did or did not modify the Commission"s proposal. As a result, I referred the matter to the Legal Service. The Legal Service stated that strictly speaking no such modification was involved, and that the procedure could therefore go ahead. This is the situation in which we now find ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">So what else has happened? Parliament today gave its declaration of intended rejection of the common position, which was debated along with Mr Monfils" proposal. I was in Bonn yesterday, at the meeting between the Commission and the German Government, and met with the President‐in‐Office responsible for culture, the German Minister for Culture. The honourable Member must be aware that this is an event in itself, because never before has there been a minister for culture in Germany. The Länder had them, but there were none in the government of the Federal Republic. My exchanges with Mr Naumann focused almost entirely on this issue, and I urged him to promote a three‐way dialogue between Parliament, the Council and the Commission in an attempt to resolve this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I well understand Parliament"s anger, indeed I share it, particularly as I had proposed a totally different method. However, I would be sorry to see Community‐wide involvement disappear completely, and not just be reduced, if no agreement were reached. There is a great temptation for governments to say: ‘Why do we not just carry on as we have been with a purely intergovernmental method?" This is how things stand at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I have urged the Council and now urge Parliament to arrive at a compromise solution that would allow Parliament to table amendments at second reading. I will try to take over as many of those amendments as I can. Perhaps we will then be able to find a way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Izquierdo Rojo can rest assured that I would never have accepted the proposal if it had not been a case of unanimity. Given that it was, there was no other option, as she must certainly be aware. In such cases, the Council"s position takes precedence over the Commission"s.</p>

I now have only one minute in which to ask him something we do not yet know: does the Commissioner intend, in the days and weeks to come, to carry on washing his hands, taking notes and expressing his regret? Or will he perhaps find it in himself to finally adopt a more responsible attitude? So far, all we know is that the minister could not have done a worse job with Granada, and that through this lunatic method of theirs of giving everyone a turn, the ministers for culture have turned something that used to be important into a farce. We already knew all of this, Commissioner, but we expect you to adopt a position more in keeping with your post and with the Commission"s responsibilities regarding such an important manifestation of European culture for which it is responsible.</p>

Though you were well aware of it, other Members of the House may not have been. I therefore explained the sequence of events.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot invent the Treaty. The Treaty exists and I am bound by it. I cannot do more than has already been done. If the Council takes a unanimous decision, I can only act as I have. What I can do – and this is certainly something new, as it only happened yesterday – is to talk to the President‐in‐Office, tell him that this is a matter of the greatest importance and ask him to call an urgent meeting to try to reach some sort of compromise whereby we will perhaps be able to move forward and come to an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">You may ask what other course of action is open to me. But my powers are limited. Bear in mind that there is a serious danger here, though you can be quite sure that I shall guard against it. I shall not take any action that might lead to the demise of the European Cities of Culture. Further, I shall do all in my power to provide the scheme with more of a Community spirit. There is of course the risk that, at a particular juncture, the Council may not agree, and that it would then take a backward step and act simply through intergovernmental agreement. This is what it did between 1985 and 1999, and it can continue to do so between 2000 and 2019, or for as long as it wishes.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the only course of action open to me at the moment is to try and persuade Parliament and the Council to reach an agreement.</p>

I have in mind the Hanover International Exhibition, the European Cities of Culture for the year 2000, and the 50th anniversary of the Robert Schuman Declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards millennium initiatives we are informed of by operators in the Member States, I have instructed my services to make provision for awarding specific European sponsorship to projects conveying the spirit of the construction of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I also intend to propose to Parliament, the Commission, and the Council that the European institutions should send out a joint political message to the citizens on the theme of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, the essential process of collaboration with the Member States was launched on 30 June, when DG X called a meeting in Brussels of those responsible for national millennium celebrations. It was gratifying to hear that all 15 Member States were represented and to realise that they were eager to collaborate amongst themselves and with the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should however stress that the principle of subsidiarity will be strictly observed in any actions undertaken by the Commission. The Commission will not merely hand out subsidies to all and sundry. On the contrary, it will concentrate on the type of projects I mentioned earlier, namely long‐term projects that respond to the citizens" wishes.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to dialogue between Muslims, Jews and Christians, the Commission has no plans for a specific project of this nature.</p>

I wanted to ask you whether there are plans only for general festivities or also for genuine cultural events.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I asked specifically about the Christian‐Islamic‐Jewish dialogue. After all, the year 2000 refers back specifically to the birth of Christ, which is when our calendar begins, and I therefore think we should include a dialogue with our neighbours, the Muslims and Jews, as this is increasingly becoming a domestic policy issue in our countries. That is why I ask whether there are any plans to that effect.</p>

We do have certain programmes we will endeavour to carry out. A cultural framework programme is scheduled for 2000 to 2005. We are experiencing a very serious problem with this at the moment as one Member State has reduced its contribution to such an extent that it can hardly be termed a cultural programme any longer. Fourteen Member States have accepted the Commission"s proposal, but a single Member State is opposed to it. In the light of that opposition, and given the need for unanimity, it will not be possible to implement that particular framework programme for the time being.</p>
<p class="contents">This apart, many other programmes are planned to celebrate the millennium. Large‐scale projects are to be undertaken by all the Member States. Nevertheless, from a Community standpoint, we shall concentrate on the three major events.</p>
<p class="contents">The other ideas put forward were all very interesting, but there are no plans to include in the Commission"s programme any activities other than the three I mentioned.

Because of the increase in the number and intensity of such incidents in several places, inside and outside the European Union, in recent times, the issue is now considered to be a priority for attention within the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the European Civil Aviation Conference(ECAC).</p>
<p class="contents">Both organisations are addressing the problem of unruly passengers as a general matter of aviation security. They are making an assessment of current legal provisions and, in addition, collecting relevant information on the nature and the number of in‐flight incidents involving unruly passengers. Consideration is being given, amongst other things, to the need to adapt existing legislation so that prompt, effective and consistent action can be taken at a destination airport against passengers whose behaviour during the flight has been offensive.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECAC working group on security will discuss the relevant issues at its next meeting, which is in February, and the organisation is also arranging a workshop on these matters to be held in March.</p>
<p class="contents">Following these events, and taking into account the work of ECAC and ICAO, the Commission will consider what form of action may be appropriate in the Community or, alternatively, as part of wider international initiatives.</p>

I am encouraged by his remarks and by the action the Commission is taking.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have concerns as to how his action can be squared with the pressure to drink that is exerted on passengers by cabin crew – the ones who are very often the victims. They, in turn, are pressured by their employers – the companies – to sell alcohol to make money. We know that 99 % of bad behaviour is linked to alcohol. If the suggested changes to the rules on duty‐free mean that people will be encouraged to consume the duty free alcohol they have bought on the planes during the flight, this could further exacerbate the problem. I am concerned to know how the Commission will actually enforce the legislation that I am delighted it is bringing forward.</p>

There is one very preliminary conclusion that can be drawn from the studies that have already partly taken place, and that is the extraordinary fact that, apparently, smoking bans on aircraft have partly the effect of creating an extra appetite for drink. How reliable that evidence is we are not yet in a position to say. I do not think that any one would suggest as an answer to it that smoking is reintroduced on airlines.</p>

Action should be taken. The volume of traffic and number of passengers travelling through Stansted Airport, which for the most part is very welcome within my constituency of North Essex and South Suffolk, is increasing and obviously passengers want to know that their safety is a paramount consideration. Would the Commission consider encouraging Member States to liaise to prevent passengers, who are in the severely intoxicated state to which Mr Evans referred, from travelling.

That is an obvious course we will be glad to take. It is difficult to say exactly what proposals we would want to make in respect of legislation until we have a complete analysis. I am sure she would support that point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">If however the analysis pointed towards a productive effect of trying to introduce Community legislation, the basis on which we would seek to do this is the Treaty provision which gives us competence in the area of transport safety and passenger safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The gap in the current legal provision that is set down in the ICAO Convention which governs globally the conduct of passengers and the powers of aircraft commanders is that the aircraft commander has the duty of deciding whether an offence committed on board an aircraft is serious or less serious.</p>
<p class="contents">That is an invidious choice for an aircraft commander to have to make. When the conclusion is that it is serious all states that are participants in ICAO have the power to arrest and detain those who are accused of unruly or abusive behaviour. It is not so easy when the aircraft commander cannot conclude that their conduct has been very serious or grave, in which case states may choose not to exercise their powers of custody.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in order to refine these definitions and close that gap which can cause difficulties for everyone involved, with the exception of the culprit, that work is now being done on the current incidence of in‐flight unruly behaviour and its consequences for crews and passengers.</p>

<p class="contents">I have a practical question which is of paramount importance for me. Can you not obtain from the Commission or some other body a ruling that passengers should not take two pieces of luggage on board.

I do, however, have people within my acquaintance who have been known to drink a great deal of bad wine simply because after the fifth or sixth glass they cannot taste it in any case. So serving bad wines is not really a safeguard against unruly conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of luggage is a slightly different one and I am sure that from time to time all of us have contravened the general rules in order to add to our convenience. I would say that as long as the second piece of luggage does not consist of several bottles of booze, then it may be possible for the crew of an aircraft to manage to accommodate it. In general it is not sensible either for personal security or the security of aircraft for people to try to take too many pieces of luggage. Many airlines effectively enforce that rule.</p>

The objective also applies to people with mobility handicaps. All decisions to build transport infrastructure projects, including the selection of technical standards, are of course primarily the responsibility of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently preparing a White Paper, which will be published this summer, setting out the approach to the future development of TENs policy and preparing for a revision of the guidelines. In that context one possibility under discussion is the development of criteria relating to service levels, which could also include reference to access to the network for people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">In preparing the White Paper the Commission has launched a broad consultation process and naturally we welcome the views of this House and of all interested parties, including disability organisations with which we enjoy very good and frequent contacts.</p>

The progress that is being made there is very good evidence of that. I support and encourage him to further consider the proposals about service levels and access for disabled people.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would ask him to go further. Can he look, when he talks about inter‐operability, at linkages. For example, it is no good having an accessible train if people cannot get into the station. It is no good having a road network if the parking spaces are not there for disabled people. Could he look at that issue and at information for disabled people so that blind people through use of braille, deaf people through use of textphone and other visual displays have full access to the information on the trans‐European networks?</p>
<p class="contents">And although he said in his answer that it is the responsibility of the Member States to implement, is there anything in the White Paper that can push the Member States a bit further to make sure they do just that?</p>

<p class="contents">In the case of connections between modes and within modes, on the issue of the design of vehicles – for instance, low‐floor in which, as he says, the Commission research services and other services have played a very significant part – and in respect of the provision of clear and accessible information to travellers with disability handicaps, we can demonstrate that we are active in all those areas. In the case of many Member States we are pushing at an open door. The standard of responsiveness was far from perfect but has increased very significantly in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">He may be interested to know about the work that we are doing in connection with the European high‐speed rail system where we have given a mandate to the European Association for the Inter‐operability of Railways to assess criteria for inter‐operability of rail‐related infrastructure, for instance, platforms. This highlights the very point that he made in his supplementary question.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the association has been asked by us to use as an example of law relating to the access of disabled people the public transport legislation, civil rights legislation relating to disabled people, that has recently become law in the United Kingdom.

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bonino, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (IT)</span> The question being asked by Mrs Banotti was raised last year by Mrs McNally and answered by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware that one of Mrs McNally's constituents, for example, has created a pressure group in the UK to campaign against supplements for single travellers. The Commission would however point out that the only Community provision relating to the question raised by the honourable Member is the directive on package travel, package holidays and package tours. Article 2(4) of this directive, which has been adopted by the Council, defines the consumer as ‘the person who takes or agrees to take the package'. As the honourable Member no doubt knows, the directive also defines as a ‘transferee' any person on whose behalf the principal contractor agrees to purchase the package – such persons being defined as ‘other beneficiaries' – or any person to whom the principal contractor or any of the other beneficiaries transfers the package. That is the position, Madam, as I am sure you know.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that single‐person supplements derive from a commercial principle – higher prices for single travellers – a principle generally accepted by the market, in that these travellers generate higher accommodation costs which must obviously be reflected in prices. Therefore the Commission does not deem single‐person supplements to be contrary to Community law. Without entering into the realms of subsidiarity or other such matters, the fact remains, in the Commission's opinion, that market forces are operating here: there can be no doubt that a single traveller creates higher costs, be it only in terms of room occupancy.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, travellers are normally made aware of the increased price, in that all advertising literature generally indicates the basic price and the supplement; so nor can the directive on unfair contract terms be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as the Commission knows, these single‐person supplements are fairly reasonable on the whole. Above all they are made known, and therefore the directive on unfair contract terms cannot be invoked.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to know if there is any indication that markets themselves are responding to what is an increasing number of single people perhaps just looking for ‘the blessed peace of the single bed", to quote George Bernard Shaw. I am surprised that they continue to charge supplements to single people who sometimes simply find it difficult to afford this. I have also come across and been approached by constituents about a situation where special offers are offered, for example in the UK, which are not available to somebody coming, for example, from Ireland to pick up the tour in the UK. Is this also a situation which is governed by market forces or is there, in fact, a problem with its legality?</p>

We have certainly noted an upsurge in special offers for which there is no single‐person supplement, precisely because agencies have grasped the fact that the number of single travellers is growing constantly. The market is therefore responding very rapidly with special offers.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second question, relating to special offers intended for a particular target group or nationality, I would prefer to ask the Legal Service whether these might be discriminatory. Before saying anything which could disrupt the market, I believe that it is only right to seek a legal opinion: the Commission will certainly do so, Madam, and will reply to you in writing.</p>

<p class="contents">At the last EU‐Canada summit held in Vienna, following an initiative from Commissioner Brittan, the Canadian Foreign Minister agreed that a joint EU‐Canada committee of experts would undertake a detailed study of Canadian Fisheries Bill C−27, in order to determine whether it is compatible with international law.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bonino, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (IT)</span> I believe that here Mr Varela, who questions me on Canada once every two months on average, is just as determined as the Commission, which for its part misses no opportunity – and I shall mention three very recent dates – of pointing out to its Canadian counterpart that Bill C−27 is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The matter has been raised on three recent occasions: on 22 October, when Sir Leon Brittan met the Canadian Foreign Minister; on 7 December, at a meeting of senior fisheries officials in Ottawa; and finally on 17 December, at the EU‐Canada summit.</p>
<p class="contents">What I think emerged very clearly on the last occasion was that the Canadians have no intention of amending Bill C−27. They have said so repeatedly. The new element, however – and the Commission is pursuing this possible solution – is Canada's apparent readiness to contemplate an interpretative statement making clear that Bill C−27 relates only to the application of the United Nations agreement. This interpretative statement, if it did materialise, would be a worthwhile move on Canada's part.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would add two further considerations. Firstly, due to unfortunate timing, the discussion between the fisheries officials took place immediately after the International Court of Justice ruling in the proceedings brought by Spain against Canada for its detention in 1995 of the fishing vessel ‘Styke'. Even though the Court merely declared that it had no legal competence over that case, its declaration was taken in Canada as a decision on the substance of the dispute; this therefore made the Canadian authorities somewhat more unforthcoming.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I am utterly convinced that – quite apart from unilateral Canadian statements along the lines of ‘yes' or ‘no', and we shall have to examine their content – the only way of averting disputes lies in accelerating the ratification of the UN Convention on straddling stocks. As you know, an entire section of this Convention provides for binding dispute settlement, which would obviously prevent Canada from refusing to recognise the Court's jurisdiction, as it did in 1994/95.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, above and beyond the negotiations, and as well as keeping events under daily – or monthly – review, the Commission is absolutely convinced that early ratification of the UN Convention is the most effective strategy available to us.</p>

As you must be aware, I have as much interest in this issue as the Commission. It is of key importance to fishing operations in international waters and, therefore, for international legislation. A state that does not accept the jurisdiction of an international court of justice, that passes internal laws contrary to international legislation, that enforces these laws by seizing vessels, and that cannot then be tried by anyone represents a serious threat to fishing on an international level, and is a poor example to others.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do not agree with you, Madam Commissioner, on what I believe to be a very important issue. I have to emphasise this, as things are not going well for us. They are not going well for me and they are not going well for the Commission either. We are likely to go on discussing this matter here every two months, probably every month, as Canada is putting forward all the arguments it can think of against our case. I differ inasmuch as I believe, as does the European Parliament, that ratifying the convention could give rise to long‐term disputes if it is interpreted differently from the New York Convention. The approach currently espoused by NAFO could lead to a solution. The best course of action would therefore be to decide not to ratify the convention, especially as it is in Canada"s interest that we do ratify it. This, therefore, is where we differ. I urge you to give careful consideration to the matter. We may be called upon to show Canada the extent to which it has become a thorn in the flesh of its relationship with the European Union. In conclusion, we must persevere, and perhaps not ratify the convention Canada is so anxious to see in place so that it can then apply it to suit itself.</p>

It is because we find that differing interpretations of the UN Convention are an undoubted source of contention, and could increasingly become so, that – and I would stress this point – ratification is desirable, above all in respect of the pillar of the Convention relating to a binding dispute settlement mechanism. Please bear in mind that we have no other means of solving potential disputes, and not only in Canadian waters or NAFO waters.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Convention were not ratified we would have no instruments at all; what if, for example, some other coastal state were to have a different interpretation? As you said, others might follow the precedent, and we would then find ourselves without any binding instruments for the settlement of disputes. This, it seems to me, is the part of the Convention which we should surely exploit. Indeed, as you will remember, Mr Varela, what happened in the last episode, in 1995, is that Canada refused to recognise the competence of the Court of Justice, which has now in fact ruled that it is not competent. So I fear that, unless a binding dispute settlement mechanism is established, Canada's example will be followed by others.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also up to the Member States to address themselves to this matter. I am however keen to stress that the absence of a binding dispute settlement mechanism is certainly not to our advantage.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 46 by <span class="bold">Ian White </span>(H−1222/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Puerto Morazan‐Hurricane Mitch</span></p>

<p class="contents">Would the Commission advise how much construction help, in the form of road and bridge repair teams and equipment, it has sent to Nicaragua and Honduras?</p>
<p class="contents"></p>
<p class="contents">Question No 48 by <span class="bold">Glenys Kinnock </span>(H−1239/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Response to natural disasters</span></p>
<p class="contents">ECHO has had to respond, during this financial year, to a number of tragic and costly emergencies and natural disasters. Does ECHO have sufficient funding to deal with any new crisis which may occur?</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to reply jointly to these questions by Mr White, Mrs Oddy and Mrs Kinnock in the two minutes which we have left before 7 p.m.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bonino, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (IT)</span> I shall also say a word in response to Mrs Kinnock's question, since it relates to the same subject.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the Commission can make available to the honourable Members, should they so desire, the recently approved overall plan for Central America; the plan contains all the detailed figures, and I can leave it with you now. Very briefly, however, I can say that the first allocation – ECU 6.8 million – was approved on 4 November, in other words while the hurricane was still raging; a further package of ECU 9.5 m was approved in November, as soon as I returned from my visit; thereafter the Commission diverted or redirected for this disaster ECU 3 m which had previously been earmarked for other projects.</p>
<p class="contents">All these projects are implemented through NGOs, a list of which I have here and can leave with you. The two plans have been approved by the Humanitarian Committee, to which all the Member States belong. Directorate General 1B, headed by Mr Marín, recently released ECU 8.2 m in preparation for the overall reconstruction plan which, as the honourable Member knows, is to be presented to the Donors' Conference in Stockholm.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the other question, I would point out that one of the problems confronting us is that ECHO's ordinary budget is exhausted by half way through the year, and a whole series of unforeseen disasters compels us to engage in very lengthy and cumbersome procedures to mobilise the reserve. That is precisely why, from this year onwards, we are seeing some improvement since now, at the start of the year, we have a more substantial allocation; this enables us to plan in a more orderly fashion, especially for crises which persist from one year to the next, drawing on the reserve only in truly unexpected crises which defy planning. This is a budgetary matter which we are attempting to clarify with Mr Liikanen – some progress has already been made – so as to avoid the considerable difficulties which usually occur each July.</p>

With the recent plan of ECU 10m, we have slightly enlarged the list of the NGOs. One of the problems at the beginning was transport and how to reach a population where the bridges had all collapsed and there were no roads. Finally, we had some success with helicopters but helicopters cannot carry large quantities of food.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that some of the governments were not exactly happy about working through NGOs but during my visit I made it very clear to the governments that, like it or not, the rules are that I cannot give money directly to a government but that we have to work through the Red Cross or the NGOs. Finally they accepted this, even if some political tensions remain.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are doing now is concentrating mostly on Honduras and the north of Nicaragua. We want to focus on drinking water in order to prevent epidemics. There is no major need for food except for vulnerable groups. The real major need is for drinking water in order to prevent epidemics. The new plan is mostly concentrated on basic health care, the rehabilitation of pumps, and drinking water.</p>

What we have discovered over the past year is the major impact of recurring natural catastrophes. Overall, in the action plan for 1999, we want to strengthen our natural disaster preparedness. We even thought of having a disaster preparedness or natural catastrophe fund. We are still considering whether it is wise, possible or viable to have a fund which can be more easily used to react to, prevent, or prepare for natural catastrophes. This thinking requires a change in the Financial Regulation. I do not know whether the political mood is to have more flexibility in spending. We are still discussing what is the best way.</p>
