<p class="contents">Thanks to this fund, numerous countries of the European Union have had the opportunity to try to lessen the distance between themselves and the wealthier countries, and the results have been spectacular but insufficient. The income per capita has increased from two thirds to three quarters of the Community average and the participation of the European funds in the growth of each of these four countries stood at an average of 0.5% per year. However, we should point out two problems for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the incorporation of new countries, which means that the countries which currently benefit from the Cohesion Fund may find that they will no longer be in receipt of those Funds before they have achieved the objectives of real convergence.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we should consider a series of programmes for the future which will allow the new Members to achieve convergence with the European Union while, at the same time, the four countries which receive Cohesion funds should continue to receive them so that they can achieve the true objectives of convergence, growth and the generation of full employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, another problem is the temptation of some wealthier countries to penalise those countries which, since they receive Cohesion Funds, have achieved nominal convergence on the basis of serious, responsible, sympathetic and rigorous structural and economic policies, but clearly still without achieving true convergence, by eliminating them, in this case, from the Cohesion Fund, which could give rise to two possible situations. Firstly, they may opt for less rigorous and more inflationist policies in order not to lose those funds. Secondly, growth and convergence with the other countries of the European Union may come to a halt in some countries. It would therefore be good to distinguish, Commissioner, between true convergence and nominal convergence.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to take up a series of recommendations regarding the Cohesion Fund. Firstly, we should make greater investment in the railways, ports and maritime transport. Secondly, transport aimed at the integration of peripheral regions, islands and outlying areas should become a priority. Thirdly, we should pay greater attention to sustainable means of transport. Fourthly, we need to take more action in the field of reforestation and land reclamation. Fifthly, we must tackle the problem of the treatment of residues and solid waste. Lastly, as we pointed out previously, we need more investment in urban centres.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that, tomorrow, four amendments will be presented, two of them approved in committee as well as two new ones which are before the House. My position – the reasons for which I have explained in committee – is not to accept them, since in general terms they simply propose new criteria. We are talking about the Cohesion Fund and the 1998 audit, on which there is a regulation and criteria which have already been approved for 2000-2006 and we do not believe that this is the moment to change the criteria with regard to eligibility and the distribution of those funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since I live in an area which benefits from the Fund, I can assure you that every one of my fellow countrymen is also aware of and acknowledges these results, not only because of the information and publicity campaigns, but mainly because the projects which have received funding belong to basic sectors which affect his quality of life, which he can see is improving. We would therefore like to commend the Commission for its actions so far in implementing the objectives of the fund and we urge it to continue its efforts to ensure that the Fund is used properly and helps improve its efficiency in the new programme period still further. </p>
<p class="contents">We must, of course, stress that the environmental aid granted continues to concentrate on the water sector, despite the need in many other cases for other measures to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment and the rational utilization of natural resources as laid down in Article 174 of the Treaty, which refers to reafforestation, land reclamation, etc. Considerable investment is still required in order to deal with the serious problem of treating solid waste and refuse, although we still need to adopt incentives for using the most modern, environmentally-friendly and efficient technology. It is also worth our supporting the promotion of further investment in environmentally-friendly transport infrastructures and we insist on the need to continue developing joint transport systems. </p>
<p class="contents">In view of forthcoming enlargement, which presents a great challenge, I consider it essential that we take prompt action to ensure that funding under the Cohesion Fund continues, given that it intervenes in two sectors which are very important in helping to achieve the objective of economic and social cohesion in the European Union, which is the Fund’s very <span class="italic">raison d’être</span>. The fact that it has so far worked highly effectively should be enough to convince us of the need to continue funding to recipient countries, provided they need continuing support and depending, aside from the nominal convergence of the economies of Member States, on real convergence of both the incomes and, more generally, the quality of life of European citizens in their regions. </p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close by thanking the rapporteur for his sterling work and his willingness to cooperate during the procedure to examine and supplement his report in committee and I should like to pass on to you this succinct and, to my mind, rather dramatic appeal by a farmer in my region. As he said so very simply yet so very forcefully on hearing of the achievements of our Union: “Europe yes, but a Europe for all the Europeans of the Union”.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased with developments, which tend towards increased investment in the railway sector, ports and marine transport. Unfortunately, there is still quite a large imbalance in relation to the roads sector. We have therefore tabled an amendment to the effect that investment in the roads sector should not represent more than a quarter of all investments in transport sector infrastructure so that it will be possible to comply with the guidelines for budget item B5-7, which deals with trans-European networks. This is something which, in our view, is very important. </p>
<p class="contents">We should like, on the whole, to see a more balanced investment policy, aimed at increasing diversification and investment in the environment and, at the same time, reducing investment in the roads sector. </p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the fact that the Committee accepted our proposal, which is now point 9, requiring that it should also be possible to use resources available for environmental projects for financing projects designed both to preserve and to carry out assessments of biological diversity. </p>
<p class="contents">Investment in methods of dealing with waste in as environmentally friendly ways as possible is discussed well enough in point 8. We would nonetheless add something in the form of Amendment 3, which makes it clear that priority ought to be given to efforts to promote recycling and re-use. Naturally, the amount of waste ought also to be reduced. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these environment-related amendments, we also have an amendment about the need to comply with the additionality principle. We would ask the Commission to submit a report on the extent to which the additionality principle is respected when resources are obtained from the Cohesion Fund. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report now before us reveals some very positive results. There is a clear trend towards real convergence without this having adversely affected the rigour of the budget policy. Even when measured strictly the Cohesion Fund has clearly played an important socio­economic role in infrastructures with development potential. We therefore expect a more refined evaluation by the Commission of the application of the funds.</p>
<p class="contents">We are delighted to note the increase in employment, the absence of fraud, the greatly increased monitoring and the proper implementation of the programmes. However, certain issues must be raised. I would draw the Commissioner’s attention to the need for greater coordination of European funds with the objectives of sustainable development within the EU and real balance between the regions. These objectives require the promotion, as already mentioned, of alternative means of transport such as the railways, the sea and cabotage which will reduce congestion on the roads and stimulate the ports. These objectives also require the role played by the Cohesion Fund to be integrated into a regional development strategy which aims to establish industries in small and medium-sized towns and in the rural areas which form four-fifths of the EU. They also require integrated support from the Structural and Cohesion Funds for structures allowing technology to be distributed democratically, particularly by following the process decided in Lisbon and promoting investment leading to new businesses and jobs. Finally, these objectives also require a civil and social dialogue and the participation of research bodies subordinated to this strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of cohesion considered in the Treaty must not come under threat during enlargement. The Cohesion Fund must be reworked bearing in mind the positive results with the new socio-economic indicators which are expected to ensure that this experience of the cohesion countries is not lost either for current beneficiaries or for future ones. I would ask the Commissioner to give his opinion in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But if we look back over the last ten years, including the year cited in this report, 1998, I would say to the Members here and to all those listening to us that the four countries that were the furthest behind, Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal, have gained ten points in ten years in relation to the Community average gross domestic product. If there is one policy – and fortunately there are others – whose efficacy can be shown, it is the cohesion policy. I would like to say this at a time when citizens and taxpayers sometimes wonder about the importance and usefulness or efficacy of the European Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">So the subject dealt with by Mr Ripoll y Martinez de Bedoya in his report is an extremely important one. I would like to thank him for his clear-sightedness, precision and competence. Furthermore, several speakers from all parties have thanked him. The form of the report is just as important as its content.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to content, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of the investment allocated to transport, your rapporteur argues for a better balance in favour of sustainable transport, in particular in favour of railways. He may be sure that the Commissioner for Regional Policy, who was once Minister for the Environment in his own country, is extremely supportive of this move and will oversee it personally, particularly in the programming of the Cohesion Fund for the next six years. I share this concern. It has also been highlighted by Mrs Schörling and Mrs Damião, and you may rest assured that I will endeavour to increase the tendency towards sustainable transport, in particular railways, that has been noted over the past few years. But this tendency is not enough: I want to emphasise it further over the next six years.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the other investments that can contribute to the objective of sustainable transport, I am referring to ports and airports, the Commission – let me be frank – wants to see a certain amount of caution concerning air transport and certain forms of maritime transport. In any case, we want to look into matters in detail and modify the rate of cofinancing to take account of the commercial nature of the activities and revenue generated, which is the least we can do. Having said this, the tendency in favour of sustainable transport is one that the Commission will support with all its might.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the environmental aspect, your rapporteur highlights the need – as Mr Mastorakis also said so emphatically – to pay more attention to the serious problem of the treatment of solid waste and household refuse. To date, the Fund has focused on three sectors which are the subject of Community directives: the treatment of drinking water, the treatment of waste water and the treatment of solid waste. The priority was to allow the Member States to respect the deadlines set in implementation of the directive on waste water, and we are well aware that the problems that I have just mentioned, in particular the matter of waste or water treatment, are problematic in the countries concerned. I have been able to see this personally in the Azores and I know that the situation is the same in the Greek islands, to use these two examples: these problems are particularly difficult in the case of remote, outermost or isolated island regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, with regard to the specific problems concerning the environment and thinking of islands in particular, I would like to express my wish to support investment in favour of renewable energy, and I have made this known to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically with regard to solid waste, 14% of the total budget appropriation was earmarked for its processing, which represents a significant increase in relation to the 1993-1997 period. However, I share your rapporteur’s wish to use the most modern environmentally-friendly technologies for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier today, Mrs Schörling expressed the satisfaction of the Group of the Greens that an amendment to paragraph 9 proposed by her group had been approved. This was not by chance, Mrs Schörling. I deliberately wanted to record the Commission’s agreement to using the Cohesion Fund in favour of biodiversity and protecting nature, not just anyhow or for just anything. This tendency has been realised in the approval of this amendment. You will also see my continuing desire, under Objectives 1 and 2 and the Cohesion Fund, for part of the loans to be used to benefit biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Having talked about content, I would like to say a word or two about form, and first of all reply to the comments of your rapporteur on the study on the socio-economic effects of the Cohesion Fund ordered by the Commission. It seems to me that these comments are based on a misunderstanding, which I would like to clarify. The five years cited by your rapporteur refer to the period between the commencement of the projects evaluated and the final evaluation. The consultants chosen by the Commission first of all developed an evaluation methodology and then evaluated the projects concerned. It is not unusual for a large project and the <span class="italic">ex-post</span> evaluation of its results to take five years to complete. The Commission, which has just received this study, is currently analysing it, and in any case, it will be sent to you as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to bring up the issue of consistency between the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds as raised by your rapporteur. I am particularly interested in this issue. This is why the Structural Funds programmes currently being negotiated by the Commission with the Member States of cohesion include indicative sums for both Cohesion Fund aid and European Investment Bank aid. The information requested by Parliament is available in the individual programming documents.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I would like to emphasise that the recent restructuring of the Directorate-General for Regional Policy brings together the geographical teams and power within the same units for Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, so that Cohesion Countries, which are eligible for Structural Funds in most cases, will have the same contacts within this Directorate-General. This seems to me to be a more consistent approach for these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">But consistency between the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund also means observing the specificity of these two instruments, in accordance, moreover, with the general regulation on the Structural Funds. It would in fact be inappropriate to use the Cohesion Fund for the same purposes and in the same way as the Structural Funds. From the point of view of financial management, it is not the right time to abandon the specificity of each instrument. In any case, I am not in a position to alter the scope of the Cohesion Fund, which stems directly from the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schörling, you spoke of the matter of additionality. Allow me, so as not to waste your time, to refer back to what I said earlier on the subject of Mr Turco’s report. I clearly expressed my wish to verify additionality and what is true for Mr Turco’s report is also true for the Cohesion Fund. I even said that the reality of this additionality would be one of the points which would enable me to validate or approve programmes and projects.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that the annual report is a particularly useful tool for the analysis, assessment and reflection that regularly takes place on the implementation of regional policy. This report is even more useful in that it is comprehensive. As I agree that there are advantages in releasing the annual report as soon as possible, I can assure you that my staff will do their best to speed up publication as much as possible in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that our reflection is not only linked to these annual reports. I can also assure you that beyond our regular meetings, the report on cohesion that I shall present to you at the end of this year will respond to a lot of the questions, criticisms and proposals raised by your rapporteur with regard to the pursuit of solidarity regarding countries benefiting from the Cohesion Fund, particularly in view of the perspective that concerns us all: enlargement.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
