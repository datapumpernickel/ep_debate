<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Florenz (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>.<span class="italic"> – (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, over the past few months I have very frequently been asked why we actually need a directive. Is it the creation of a workaholic official of the EU or of a lonely Member of Parliament who is keen to have a directive on this subject, or is it not perhaps the consumption patterns of the European population, who in recent years have displayed extraordinary devotion to the purchase of electronic equipment? The reason is precisely the latter! We generate six million tonnes of electronic waste products in Europe every year. The volume of electronic waste is growing at a rate of more than 3 to 4%; indeed, I believe it has now reached the 5% mark. In about ten years’ time, we expect this electronic scrap heap to have doubled in size.</p>
<p class="contents">Electronic scrap is spirited around in Europe and left in fields, in meadows, in woodland, in ditches or wherever. It is not only an environmental hazard but also a waste of raw materials, because we all know that computers contain valuable components, which really ought to be recovered and ultimately be subject to systematic reuse and recycling targets. This is why I believe it is only right and proper that this directive should see the light of day.</p>
<p class="contents">Another reason why this is especially important is that we have already taken the first steps in this direction with the end-of-life vehicle Directive, which differs from the proposed directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment in that the recovery of electrical and electronic waste involves hundreds and thousands of manufacturers, whereas the salvaging of vehicle components concerns only 50 or 60 manufacturers. For this reason, it is very important that we reach consensus on this directive in the House and with the Commission too, because this directive will have repercussions. And if it has repercussions, it must also have a guiding influence. Environmental policy must not be an end in itself; it must have an aim – not only an environmental aim but an aim for companies too, because companies are part of our society, a fact which is just occasionally forgotten in my committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We are operating in several categories; after all, we have ten different waste streams, each with its own distinct recycling target. But let me begin with a few words about the points in my draft which the committee endorsed, for example on the date of the entry into force of this directive, which must not be delayed until 2005 or 2006. My children would ask me why I travel to Brussels to work on a directive if the results of that work are not due to be presented until the year 2006 or whenever. We said that the Member States would have to be true to their proclaimed principles and put the directive into force 30 months after the completion of the parliamentary process. After a further 30 months, companies should be working in accordance with the directive. I believe this is the right approach, and I think it likely that the Commission will go along with this line.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission was somewhat lax on the question of targets. How many kilograms do we want to collect every year? We are calling for a fundamental ban on the disposal of electrical and electronic items as unsorted waste. Some participants in this discussion, particularly those from the world of industry, claim that it is a senseless proposal. I maintain the exact opposite. We must reach a point at which it is prohibited to bin an electric shaver, because the general refuse bin is not where it belongs. Although this is stating the obvious, many people have not yet grasped the message. The law of diminishing unit costs also dictates that we must no longer have waste equipment scattered around our continent in future. We must concentrate it in order to reduce the cost of recycling. This is why we have introduced a ban on the disposal of electrical and electronic waste as general refuse and a binding annual target of six kilograms per head of population rather than subscribing to the non-binding target proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is a warranted step in the right direction. We have also devised a preferential arrangement for the retail trade. We all fully agree that a commercial outlet, if it sells an electrical appliance or an item of electronic hardware, must take it back. But we also know – or at least those who have been town councillors will know – that our shops are located in tightly confined premises in the centres of our towns and cities and do not have the capacity to build even a small shed for the storage of old television sets, not to mention the fact that such a facility would most probably have to be made explosion-proof too. We are proposing that end users should be able to surrender their old equipment absolutely free of charge. However, it need not automatically go back to the place of purchase. Although the retail trade is responsible, the consumer is free to take the used item straight to a general collection point. I believe that this is a good alternative. It is designed to protect traders, because if we impose stringent building requirements on them, they will very quickly move to greenfield sites. But that is precisely what we want to avoid, because we want to maintain the appeal of our town and city centres. This is an important point which, unfortunately, is far too often overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the responsibility of manufacturers, like the transposition of the directive into national law, should not be subject to a five-year transitional period but should take effect only 30 months after the entry into force of the directive, together with an arrangement whereby producers are allowed, on a voluntary basis, to show users the cost of collecting, treating and disposing of historical waste in an environmentally compatible way. The specialists know what historical waste is. The term refers to those items of equipment that are already in circulation, some of them unbranded or ‘orphan’ products, the origins of which are unknown. They may have come from bankrupted companies or from retail giants which put them on the market just before Christmas to make life difficult for smaller traders.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the processing of this historical waste must be collectively financed. There is no alternative. Anyone who thinks that the processing of historical waste could be individually financed is dreaming. I do believe, however, that it is right to make provision for individual financing in the case of new equipment. There can, of course, be exceptions in some domains where this is not possible. But I should very much like to reward those who make an effort and develop a product that can subsequently be recycled for the good of the environment. These are the regulatory instruments at our disposal. It is all about rewarding, not penalising. And at this point, I should like to make a plea to the Council, whose representative is sitting in front of me here: please take this idea on board and urge the Council to support an arrangement which favours individual financing.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also, of course, a few points which my honourable friends and colleagues on the committee did not accept or to which I am opposed. As far as the recycling target is concerned, I believe the committee has been somewhat over-ambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say to my honourable colleague that raising a target from 40% to 50% in Parliament is an easy game to play. It is just about the easiest thing on earth. But how are the actual waste flows to be organised, how is the market to be persuaded of their benefits, and how are companies to have access to these waste flows in a market economy? These are the really crucial questions. For this reason, the Commission’s proposed target is surely a reasonable starting point. My own view is that we should keep the Commission’s target rather than opting for the excessively high target proposed by a majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a dispute about lighting equipment. The main protagonist is discussing the matter at this very moment with other protagonists. I believe that lights should be covered by this directive, but they should not be subject to a recycling target. The fact is that we do not have a single document explaining how dismantled and dissected lamps can be recycled in such a way that their components can be reused. I should not like to set a directive in motion without being able to assess its impact. After three years, when we have some experience, we should then set a target for lights. In my opinion, the Commission has made a good proposal, which we shall be happy to adopt.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the points at issue in the House is the question of the time at which the manufacturer’s responsibility begins. The Commission has proposed – and the Council takes a similar view – that manufacturers must take back their products from the collection point and meet the cost of that operation. I support this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">One reason I support the initiative is because there are some Members of this House who take the view that we should ultimately compel manufacturers to come and collect used toothbrushes from our bathrooms. I have three children, and those children certainly have enough moral responsibility to take their equipment – computers, radios or whatever – to a prescribed place at the end of its lifetime and to dispose of it properly there. I do not believe we should be pursuing a policy that always assigns responsibility to a third party and never to ourselves as consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The end users are to be able to hand in old equipment free of charge to their retailer and even have it collected in cases where they are buying a replacement. But they have a responsibility if they only intend to dispose of the waste item. They must take it to the collection centre in their town or city. You may call me old-fashioned, but I believe there is a certain educational aspect in all of this. I recall our impassioned debates in this House about the throw-away mentality. Those who were most vociferous then are either no longer here or are no longer prepared to stand up and speak out. The throw-away mentality is an important factor which must also be taken into account when financing is discussed here.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard a host of interesting proposals on this subject. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection is a heterogeneous committee, but it renders a valuable contribution in helping to ensure that this Parliament of ours, which is not a ‘normal’ parliament, plays an increasingly large and important role as a ‘normal’ parliament. For this I should like to express my sincere thanks to all my fellow committee members and to all others who have been involved in our work.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ahern (Verts/ALE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.</span> – Mr President, waste from electronic and electrical equipment is now one of the fastest growing waste streams in the European Union. It is estimated that this waste stream, which constitutes 4% of municipal waste today, will increase by at least 3-5% every year. Electronic and electrical equipment is one of the largest known sources of heavy metals and organic pollutants in the waste stream. Without proper pre-treatment, the highly toxic components can contaminate soil and groundwater, as well as pollute the air.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive can therefore be seen as one of the basic instruments for an integrated product policy, where the whole life cycle of a product will be taken into consideration and eco-design will be promoted. The need for business to adapt to a changing agenda, taking more account of environmental concerns, is widely accepted; it is also accepted that countries and industries which innovate more quickly will end up being more competitive than those which delay.</p>
<p class="contents">The guiding principle behind the directives is the Extended Producers Responsibility. The objective of this is that by making producers financially responsible for their products when they become waste, an upstream effect is created, which leads to design for the environment, considering the durability, reparability or upgrading, disassembly and recycling of the product. In addition, through the eco-design, the reuse of resources and separate collection, hazardous substances contained in the waste stream are prevented from entering the environment in an uncontrolled way.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive also applies the principle of the internalisation of external costs. The costs of disposal, – which up to now have been borne by local authorities, usually as part of waste disposal –are to be internalised and provision made for the reuse, recycling and de-manufacture of this equipment. The ultimate aim is waste prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of manufacturer responsibility for end-of-life electrical and electronic products is not disputed. Producers must be responsible for the products they bring to market. However, they can only be responsible for their individual products. We have had some debate about collective and individual systems, which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has gone into in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Committee on Industry have tabled some amendments with regard to the availability of spare parts and also to distance-selling and labelling, which we would ask the Commission to take into consideration. We are also very concerned with the health and safety of workers dealing with recovery of WEEE and this needs to be more carefully considered than previously when transposing the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the restriction of hazardous substances, some members of industry say that we should focus on large equipment and not small equipment. But the concentration of hazardous substances in small equipment is up to four times higher than in large equipment. Furthermore, small equipment definitely needs to be separately collected to prevent it from ending up in municipal waste, where hazardous chemicals are not controlled.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, the proposal to substitute lead, mercury, cadmium, etc. is welcomed. However, the Committee on Industry has asked for a structured review process, and I believe the Commission should look very closely at this. All stakeholders should have the opportunity to submit data as the basis for an early review, including environmental and consumers' associations, because it is in all our interests that this directive works effectively. I would ask the Commission to take this very much on board.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Industry has also asked for an exemption for lead in high-temperature melting solders and lead in glass and electronic components.

In this context, the directives we are discussing today are essential legislative instruments which contribute to preserving our environment by persuading businesses in the sector to internalise the cost of certain environmental impacts and to adopt a committed position without abandoning their market objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Florenz’s work is commendable and I must congratulate him on it, since he has managed to create some proposals for directives which find a balance between the interests of consumers, the environment and businesses in the sector, interests which are very difficult to combine.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention the Member States’ obligation to achieve a recovery rate of six kilos per inhabitant, since I believe we should take account of the existing differences between the Member States. It is clear that Germany, for example, does not produce the same amount of residue as other countries, such as Greece, Portugal or Spain. Furthermore, the lifespan of each piece of equipment is significantly different between Member States, which exacerbates that problem. I would like to repeat that it is appropriate to apply an implementation co-efficient to the recovery obligation in order thereby to balance and harmonise the obligation, depending on the Member State in question.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to highlight the importance of Article 7, which deals with financial responsibility. For the sake of greater fairness, individual financial responsibility seems logical, but I very much agree with the solution contained in the report of leaning towards individual responsibility without closing the door to the application of collective responsibility in certain cases.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the exceptions for lead solder, I believe that it should be maintained, because I believe that the use of substitutes could create a greater environmental problem or jeopardise consumer safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People do not ask me why we are voting on this Directive; many people ask me to do this as quickly and effectively as possible. I myself come from a country where a number of rules on this subject matter are already in place. I should explicitly like to thank the rapporteur for the sterling work he has done and for the excellent improvements he has made to the Commission proposal. The key issue in this connection, which he himself has highlighted, is the obligation to collect all electrical and electronic appliances and to establish higher and more stringent collection objectives before 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The principal goal of this Directive is enshrined in Article 1. First prevention, then re-use, then recycling and, lastly, energy recovery. It is this hierarchy which is not being respected in the Commission proposal, for prevention is being shifted to another directive and re-use of whole appliances is not being recognised. The rapporteur has also relegated a number of aspects to energy recovery instead of recycling. The best way to prevent waste is to change the eco-design of these products. That is why the instrument of individual producer responsibility, financial responsibility, is so crucial. The re-use of whole appliances is important too, not only in terms of the environment, but also from a social point of view. Indeed, it creates more employment opportunities for semi- and unskilled workers, and the products become more accessible at lower prices. Needless to say, this Directive must also guarantee that waste is not exported to third countries, except with a view to re-use, and only if it can be ensured that the same high objectives and standards will be respected in those third countries. Banning hazardous substances is the best preventive measure which we can take. Moreover, this is also important in terms of the health of workers. In fact, the Directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment forms part of the prevention objective stated in Article 1 of the Directive on discarded electrical and electronic equipment. That is why I was so keen on combining the two Directives.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also been familiar with the problem of heavy metals for a long time. Alternatives are available for most of them, whilst the Commission provides for exceptions for a number of them. I do not believe it is up to Parliament promptly to provide for exceptions over the space of a couple of days. There is also the disadvantage that decisions of this kind are sometimes too much inspired by lobbies. Let the Commission go about its business and produce an amended version of the exceptions to heavy metals in two years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should definitely like to mention the discussion on brominated flame retardants. It has become a discussion between believers, such as myself, convinced of the harmful effects on the environment and health, and non-believers. What I find important is that, for many, this discussion has led to a greater appreciation of the harmfulness of these products. A ban in 2006 is impossible. The amendment tabled by my group asks for producers to demonstrate by 2003 that these products are harmless, and I hope that this can be achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I seem to remember a publicity stunt that featured an enormous mound of bottles which were no longer going to be returned for refilling but were simply going to be dumped in a landfill site. I was twelve or thirteen at the time and that publicity and the photographs on television woke many of us up to the concerns we still have for the environment and drew our attention to the waste of resources attached to so much of our way of living and our manufacturing processes.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry that so many years later my own country is one of those which is trailing behind the countries of the rapporteur and the Commissioner in improving its recycling rate. So I am pleased that we have this European legislation, and indeed the whole waste strategy of the Commission, which is forcing individual countries like my own that are recalcitrant and bow too easily to industry pressure on their own doorstep to recognise and put into practice the principles of sustainability. These countries are very happy to talk about these principles on a wider stage but are reluctant to put them into practice on their own doorstep. The principle here that the producer should accept responsibility for the whole life of the product and ensure that the problems caused by that production are not passed on to future generations is one which we should embrace very strongly.</p>
<p class="contents">So I welcome this legislation and consider it important that industry in my country and perhaps countries elsewhere should recognise that if it does not seize the opportunity to modernise its processes and live up to the high environmental standards then it will lose out on market opportunities across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Two dilemmas have been pointed out concerning lead and brominated flame retardants. I put this one question to the Commissioner about the issue of low-cost, low-energy light bulbs: Is it better to have them recycled but to put up the cost, or is it better to keep down the cost, encourage their use and perhaps tackle the other serious environmental problem of global warming a little bit more rapidly than we might otherwise be able to do? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has got the message, which is individual financial responsibility for the manufacturers of new television sets and refrigerators. Costs must not be passed on to consumers. Only if manufacturers themselves are saddled with the extra costs for re-use and recycling will they gain the financial incentive to design their electrical and electronic products in such a way as to ensure that they can be re-used more easily and in a more environmentally-friendly manner. Parliament unanimously supports this principle of individual financial responsibility. This is how we can make the market economy more ecological. That is why I urge the Swedish Presidency to include this principle in the common position; if not, a conciliation procedure will become inevitable. I should once again like to congratulate Mr Florenz. If there were more Christian-Democrats like him, we would see black-green coalitions emerge in Europe. I only have one point of criticism, namely brominated flame retardants. The Commission, along with the majority in Parliament, only want to ban 2 of the 70 brominated flame retardants. These two are disappearing from the market anyway, but all 70 should be banned. They are toxic and non-biodegradable. In human milk, the quantity of these hazardous substances is doubled every five years, and that has been the case for the past 25 years. The incidence of these substances in people working in the recycling industry is 70 times higher. There are safe alternatives, namely aluminium hydroxides and phosphate esters. Japanese firms, such as Sony, have already decided to stop using brominated flame retardants. Politicians now need to follow suit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead of household equipment and computer parts ending up being dumped, as often happens at present, we are laying the foundations for all EU Member States being able to collect them separately and recycle them.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic idea of the recycling proposal is that the polluter must pay. It is not good enough that the cost of collecting and recycling products should not be a burden upon the consumer. The cost must be a part of the product’s overall cost and price. It is therefore important that the collection and recycling cost should be an integral part of the product’s price and not a separate, visible charge. Only when the cost is integrated is the actual environmental cost integrated into the price.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that every company should have to pay the costs of its products. Such a system does not prevent practical cooperation in connection with collection and recycling. Individual financial responsibility on the part of companies is both fairer and more efficient than collective financial responsibility. An individual system for new waste benefits those manufacturers that use the best materials and construct those products that are simplest to recycle. This will favour more environmentally-friendly products and provide a major impetus for product development.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has made efforts to try at an early stage to get the various political groups to compromise on quite a few important areas. That is something we really appreciate, and we also believe that, as the work continues, it puts Parliament in a stronger position in relation to the Council of Ministers. We obviously support the objectives of an increase in both the proportion of collected products and the proportion of the collected products which it will be possible to recycle.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the second proposal for a directive, concerning a restriction upon the use of hazardous substances in electronic equipment, we believe that the committee’s proposals could have gone further. That applies especially to the possibility of banning various flame retardants. Recently, there have been quite a few alarming reports about the way in which these substances accumulate and about the dangerous effects on health to which they can give rise.</p>
<p class="contents">We also think that it needs to be possible right now for individual countries to make tougher demands upon this type of product. The Commission has recently objected to the fact that the Swedish Government wanted to impose tougher environmental requirements regarding hazardous substances in connection with the purchase of 400 000 computers. We think it is completely unacceptable that the Commission and the EU’s purchasing regulations should at present, in this way, be preventing countries from imposing tougher environmental requirements and, by so doing, supporting product development in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means that 36 tonnes of mercury, 16 tonnes of cadmium and countless dioxins and furans end up in the environment in an uncontrolled manner. In addition, appliances which contain a lot of glass, such as television sets, produce a negative energy yield during incineration. Moreover, hazardous substances evaporate or leak when electronic waste is dumped. I therefore welcome the two European Directives that address these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that ambitious percentage levels are being established for recycling. However, in this connection, we should bear in mind that recycling is only more environmentally friendly if the waste is pre-treated. Furthermore, the success of the Directive stands or falls with the extent to which electronic waste is collected. Partly because the quantity of waste is ever increasing, we need to establish a percentage level here too as quickly as possible. The return of electronic waste free of charge will be a good incentive.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle underlying producer responsibility is of key importance. Indeed, it allows to some extent for re-use and recycling at the end of the life-cycle to be taken into consideration during the manufacture of electronic equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, I could not agree more with the rapporteur on the point that full re-use should remain possible. However, the risk of electronic waste being dumped in countries outside the European Union under the pretext of re-use is not hypothetical. That is why the Member States need to ensure that only usable electrical and electronic equipment which will actually be re-used is exported to countries outside the EU, as I have proposed in one of my amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Another amendment concerns the exceptions deleted by the rapporteur from Annex 1 to the Directive restricting hazardous substances. These exceptions need to be retained, since they not only concern the medical sector, but are also indispensable and irreplaceable for scientific research in the chemical and physics sectors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Directive that is before us today is an important Directive. Why? Because Europe is facing every larger waste streams of discarded electrical and electronic equipment. That means, therefore, that a sound, environmentally-friendly solution is very much what is needed to recycle and process this waste. I endorse the way in which Mr Florenz has combined all these interests and all these sectors in groups in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to dwell on the Directive for a moment. First of all, it is in the consumer’s interest to be able to return electronic and electrical waste free of charge. Manufacturers thus need to finance the collection from the collection point, as well as the processing, recovery and removal of the waste. I back the opinion that manufacturers need to take care of this individually as much as possible. Indeed, individual responsibility is also an incentive for manufacturers to design products which are better suited to recycling, and I also share the view that historical waste cannot be left for the individual manufacturer to deal with. This was evident in the Netherlands too. Historical waste must be financed collectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I support voluntary collection, processing and removal, with due consideration for the environment. This sends out the message to consumers, at the time when they buy new products, that the producers actually took their responsibilities seriously. A collective system has been in place in the Netherlands since 1999, with a visible contribution being made towards disposal, and it works very well. I support the increase in collection from 4 to 6 kg, for if I were not to do so, it would mean that a great deal of electrical waste would end up on the scrap heap.</p>

<p class="contents">I think we have arrived at quite a good conclusion, even though there are naturally certain points regarding which further requirements could be made. What is most important, however, is that we establish producer responsibility, something I perhaps see as the biggest environmental gain from this work. I also see it as a success for all the progressive and environmentally aware companies which are, in fact, already working in this way at present. They are being given the opportunity to continue to develop their ecodesigns and to manufacture their products in ways that are more in accordance with environmental considerations than the ways used by many other companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Both Mr de Roo and Mr Sjöstedt have spoken about hazardous substances, but I nonetheless wanted to mention brominated flame retardants. It is rather annoying that we have not succeeded in making further progress on that issue. It is scientifically proven that these substances are dangerous, and there is scientific evidence of the health aspects. Flame retardants and their residues can be found in mother’s milk in places as far away as Greenland, among the Inuit, where the levels are more often than not much higher than those recommended by the WHO. It is odd that we are so hesitant and so afraid of doing anything about the problem that we confine ourselves to dealing with just two flame retardants. We know that the substances are hazardous. We know that they affect children’s concentration. We also know that people can experience other types of disorder, such as weight loss, as a result of ingesting these substances and in spite of never having asked to have them in their bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on hazardous substances is based on Article 95, and the directive on waste consisting wholly or partly of electrical or electronic products is based on Article 175. That is something I cannot understand. When we discussed a similar directive on end-of-life vehicles, most people saw that directive as a model for future work on the subject, but memories are clearly quite short. I think that this fits in extremely badly with what we are to be discussing this afternoon, that is to say sustainable development. In this area, it is again the internal market which is setting the framework for what we are to achieve in the environmental sphere, and countries are punished for taking the lead. I think that that is wrong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Member States that have devised systems which are now working should be able to retain those systems, in my view. I am pleased that that is possible. I think it is important in the region that I come from, too. I therefore consider that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has produced a sound compromise, thanks to the constructive obstinacy on the part of our rapporteur, as well as a number of other people. I regret – indeed, not everyone can be 100% satisfied with a compromise – that the visible removal contribution has to go. We are asking consumers to behave in a responsible manner, and that is why they need to receive backing. I have tabled an amendment concerning re-use, which I think is an excellent idea, except if there are new products which, on environmental balance, score more points. I therefore hope that I can count on the support of this Chamber for this amendment. In addition, recycling centres, which I also welcome with open arms, and which receive subsidies for their work – with good reason – should not only be allowed to cherry-pick, but should also ensure that recycling establishments do not only get the dregs.

He could actually be called Mr Producer Responsibility, as this was the second historical directive, the second historical achievement, in which the producer’s responsibility will be significantly incorporated in the European Union’s environment and product legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way we are also moving towards a new phase in environmental policy, which is one of already taking account of the demands of the environment at the product design stage. I have found that, as a result of this directive, large companies are now discussing how, for example, GSM telephones could be lighter - although they are certainly light already - how they could be easier to dismantle, and how all the harmful substances could be removed and then responsibly sent off as treatable waste.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to return to these harmful, hazardous substances. Our group would have liked to see rather more determined action to try to get rid of especially hazardous chemical substances. I will mention one example. Much has been said about product safety, which is a very important issue, and fire safety particularly so. There has been discussion on whether halogenated flame retardants should be banned in future. In our opinion, it is quite obvious that they are toxic, as they have, for example, led to a situation where mother’s milk contains double the amount of these halogenated chromium compounds every five years. There are alternatives to them, and we would like to see them banned more quickly and companies in this way being encouraged to start using harmless alternatives without, however, compromises being made with regard to product safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have here a well-balanced, excellent report on a subject which, together with the directive on scrap cars and vans drafted earlier by Mr Florenz, will from now on serve as a model for other similar legislation. For that reason, the decisions we now have to take are particularly important.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased that the committee adopted my amendments, which clarify the meaning of producer responsibility. This will have an immense impact on the quantity and quality of electrical and electronic waste being generated, greater than any other possible decision Parliament could make with regard to scrap and waste. It will create incentives for more ecologically friendly design and innovations before products have even come onto the market, and will therefore lessen the environmental burden of products for their entire life cycle. This is an enormous change with regard to earlier ways of thinking, in which the focus was on the repair and prevention of environmental damage only at the stage of a product’s life when it was in fact merely waste.</p>
<p class="contents">In exactly the same way, we should examine Annex II on requirements for the treatment of waste. If the directive requires printed circuit boards to always be removed, for example, it will not create incentives for the development of materials used in printed circuit boards. Under the directive, they will have to be removed in any case. Instead, by mentioning a substance that is contained in a component that has to be removed, we will create incentives for developing components that do not have these hazardous substances in them. Only this sort of approach will act as any real incentive in eco-design. This is the intention behind Amendment No 77.</p>
<p class="contents">In a similar manner, we must create incentives for the development of alternative waste treatment methods, so that the environmental burden resulting from them is as light as possible. The amendment I tabled with this in mind had already been adopted in the Annex by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but the corresponding amendment to the Article is contained in Amendment No 76 submitted for the plenary sitting.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the European Union is making legislation that clearly shows the rest of the world that the conflict between concern for the environment and economic matters is not unavoidable but can be settled through considered legislation. Only this can provide a real chance for sustainable development, in which the EU can be a global pioneer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think they have done a really good piece of work.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the ban on hazardous substances, I am pleased that it is now being proposed that we bring forward this ban. I personally would have liked to see us have all flame retardants included from the start, but I think this is an issue that we must try to continue working on. With regard to dealing with waste, I think there are three crucial points. The first is that we must have the waste arising in these contexts separated from other unsorted waste as soon as possible. This requires a strategy plan in the individual countries, and it also very much requires us to have effective labelling so that we can identify the products in question. The second central point is naturally producer responsibility, and I can only agree with what many of the speakers have said concerning this point. It is important that we find a solution to this issue in relation to the entire life cycle of the product and that we also have provisions adopted concerning the financing of producer responsibility. As far as possible, the financing should take place on an individual basis, so that it can be used in the development of cleaner technology as a competitive parameter. I believe this may become one of the most important points of all.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by asking the Commissioner a question. I come, of course, from a country that has already implemented somewhat more restrictive rules in relation to hazardous substances. Since we are talking here about an internal market directive on hazardous substances, I would like to ask whether a country such as Denmark will be forced to rescind its more restrictive rules until the restrictive rules also enter into force in 2008 or 2006, depending on the year finally decided on for this phasing out of hazardous substances. It will naturally be very unfortunate for us if we are forced to return to poorer rules for a period, only to have the bans reintroduced at a later point in time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that he has studied, analysed and discussed no fewer than 334 densely printed pages – 70 pages on hazardous substances and 264 pages on end-of-life equipment. This is clearly a subject of great complexity, but it is also a very important one, because it affects all the people of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concern is to press ahead with waste separation and to ensure that electrical and electronic equipment is disposed of separately from household waste. This is a very important issue. We know that we currently have about two billion such items in Europe and that some 210 million of them are disposed of every year. This, when all is said and done, represents six million tonnes and generates costs of approximately EUR 40 billion. When such an amount is involved, we are duty-bound to consider who should meet the cost and in particular how that cost can be most efficiently and effectively controlled in accordance with market principles; we must ensure that the chosen strategy is the cheapest one for taxpayers and consumers and the best one for the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that there is a huge volume of historical waste. Sixty-six per cent of all these electrical appliances and items of electronic hardware are more than ten years old, while about half of them come from households. This is why compulsory collection targets are so very important. It is also the reason why we have been so firmly committed to the six-kilogram target. We want recycling to be conducted in a truly systematic manner and on a scale which ultimately makes sound economic and budgetary sense.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important to me about bans on particular substances is that we must only replace such substances with demonstrably better, sustainable and, most importantly, scientifically tested alternatives. This is an area in which the Commission must act, on the one hand to prevent damage and on the other hand to choose the best option in ecological terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this debate, I would like to outline three aspects which I believe to be of the utmost importance, namely prevention, the role of the Member States and fire safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the directive is to prevent environmental problems. It seeks to promote eco-design. Producer responsibility is the key word in this connection. Producers can do a great deal, such as providing sustainable products and ensuring that appliances can easily be repaired, for example within the space of half an hour. They could use special colours in the case of hazardous components, so that these stand out upon disposal at all times. Also, in order to make the consumer more aware of the waste issue, I would call for the introduction of a histogram that illustrates the extent to which waste can be recycled.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a great deal of discussion about the role of the Member States. This proposal outlines the salient points concerning the collection of discarded appliances and the funding of recycling. With a view to subsidiarity, Europe should not want to lay down, to the last detail, how the basic principles should be transposed. It is a different matter in the case of product standards and the use of hazardous substances. Here, it is important for us to retain the internal market. In my view, it would be unacceptable if we were to encourage all Member States to go ahead and set their own standards. The internal market forms an important basis of European cooperation. It is our task to ensure that products traded on the internal market all meet the highest standards in terms of the environment and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to spend a moment on an important issue, namely that of fire safety. It is our duty to ensure that public safety is guaranteed. Even if this involves hazardous substances, unfortunately. However, we need to reduce the harmful environmental effects of flame retardants to a minimum. If clean alternatives are available, we should use them. From an environmental point of view, I therefore call for a ban on a few brominated flame retardants. We must pull out all the stops, where possible, to develop and use environmentally-friendly alternatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we are working towards is the environmentally-friendly disposal of old electrical appliances and, if possible, material recycling. Parliament attaches the utmost importance to the polluter-pays principle, which comes across very clearly in this report. I do believe, however – and here too, the Florenz report strikes the right tone – that great care must always be taken to establish precisely how these principles can be applied in each specific sector of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the collection of appliances or small components requires the use of energy and can in itself be harmful to the environment. It is therefore important that we provide for derogations in the case of components which contain no hazardous substances, such as light bulbs, that we always look at the whole ecological balance and then consider whether it is appropriate to collect these things separately and use them for recycling or whether such action is perhaps not justified on environmental grounds. For this reason I believe that Amendment No 65 takes us in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We must apply the polluter-pays principle correctly. I see a problem in this respect at one or two points because, in the case of historical waste in particular, we are not talking about the polluter-pays principle when we say that all those who are operating in the market at the present time have to foot the bill for those who were perhaps manufacturing some product twenty years ago. Great care must be taken here, since not every segment of this market is transparent. We became aware of this in the committee. To illustrate the problem, let me mention that I devoted myself particularly to household light fittings, since large numbers of them are produced in my constituency. The manufacturers say, with some justification, that it is surely not consistent with the polluter-pays principle to expect present-day manufacturers to pay for the recovery of a chandelier which has been hanging in someone’s lounge and which was produced twenty years ago by some manufacturer or other who is no longer in business. It is not the polluter who has to pay – quite the reverse. If consideration is also given to the fact that such products include many grey-market imports from companies which do not adhere to the high European environmental standards – companies in China, for example – it becomes clear that the polluter-pays principle would be turned on its head if we penalised companies for conducting their business properly and being properly registered. For these reasons I ask you to support Amendments Nos 65 and 88. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I believe that the directive is not solely intended to ensure that products are designed in such a way that they can be easily recycled and to introduce recycling quotas. Greater attention should also be paid to two other factors, namely consumers and consumer responsibility, because, when it comes to electronics and electronic waste, consumers have not yet developed the habit of using authorised recycling centres to dispose of their old equipment. Things are somewhat different with cars. Cars are taken to the scrap-yard. This, however, does not necessarily happen to electric toothbrushes or shavers. I believe we must step up our efforts in this domain. I consider it only right that the Member States should clearly emphasise the consumer’s responsibility for collecting these waste products separately and even spell out the potential penalties for non-compliance.</p>
<p class="contents">A second aspect to be considered is that we are doing something entirely new here. This legislation will create waste and material streams that have never existed before. We therefore do not know at all how things will be recycled, which material streams will be created and what will happen to them. Amendment No 56, admittedly, is only a short motion, but it serves to promote a system of monitoring which will not only indicate the targets that the Member States have set – what has to be achieved – but will also provide precise information on what is actually happening with regard to the targets and on the consequences of our proposed legislation in the real material world. We should therefore observe developments closely and take stock after a certain time in order to determine whether the material streams that have developed really do match our objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This waste is growing at up to 5% per year due to technological innovation and market expansion and contains a percentage of dangerous substances that are currently finding their way into municipal landfills, obviously posing clear environmental hazards. Hence, the need for the second proposed directive to reduce the risk of impact on human health and the environment of the production, use, treatment and disposal of WEEE.</p>
<p class="contents">The directives deal with producer responsibility, separate collection, better treatment, reuse, recycling, costs, targets, labelling, alternatives to dangerous substances such as lead, mercury, PBB, etc., while allowing some exceptions. But let us be sure, with the proper application of the much-toted precautionary principle, that the alternatives are in fact safer from a toxicity and hazard point of view, in every respect including the ability to flame retard.</p>
<p class="contents">Have we an acceptable substitute for lead solder, for example? While I endorse both directives, I have tabled an amendment to Article 15 (4) of the WEEE directive inserting a new subparagraph based on a similar clause in Article 52 of the relatively recent EC Directive 99/31 on the landfill of waste. I consider this to be as good a basis as any for taking account of the genuine and practical difficulties of certain Member States in meeting the ambitious collection and recovery targets proposed in Articles 44 and 62 respectively of the WEEE directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Important proposals such as these have to take into balanced account the significant variations in recycling infrastructure, economies of scale, demographics and geographical circumstances in certain Member States. It is unrealistic and unfair to require Member States with acknowledged deficiencies in recycling infrastructure and reprocessing capacity – for whatever reason – and which lack reliable data on WEEE arisings to achieve the same ambitious targets within specified short time frames as other Member States which already have all or most of the requisite infrastructure in place.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be borne in mind that the proposed targets are based on the state-of-the-art recycling pilot study conducted in Eindhoven in the Netherlands, which has the requisite infrastructure and population density. Ireland, Greece, Portugal, not to mention the accession countries, will have definite problems with the current proposals unless amended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are tackling the specific problem of electrical and electronic waste for the following reasons. We have heard them before, but I repeat that this is the fastest growing part of the waste stream – indeed, it is growing three times faster than other waste streams. Each of us produces on average about 14 kgs per year of such waste. By the year 2010, when this directive will be fully operational, electrical and electronic waste will account for over 8% of the entire municipal waste stream.</p>
<p class="contents">Ninety per cent of this electrical and electronic waste is currently landfilled or incinerated with no pre-treatment. This means wasted resources, both in terms of the costs of disposal and the poor use of natural resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Electrical and electronic equipment is a major source of certain hazardous substances in the waste stream. Just one example illustrates this: 40% of the lead in landfills and 50% of the lead in incineration comes from this type of equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, since Member States are already acting in this area, there is a strong case for Community coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">The main aim of the proposals for directives is to prevent electrical and electronic equipment from being landfilled or incinerated. To achieve this objective, the directive sets out a range of requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States are required to set up separate collection schemes from households; consumers have the right to dispose of their waste free of charge and producers are responsible for taking the waste from central collection points and ensuring that it is properly treated through recovery and re-use. In addition, the directive requires the substitution of certain hazardous substances, such as lead and mercury, by 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me answer some of your questions. I shall begin with the question by Mr Davies. I understood him to mean that if these light bulbs were exempted, it would mean that they would be slightly cheaper. However, there is really no contradiction in collecting these light bulbs. It is very important to include them in this kind of system. It will still be cheaper to produce an environmentally-friendly light bulb. We have not set up specific recycling targets for light bulbs, only for fluorescent lamps. I think the producers of these lamps would like to be included in this scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all concerned about brominated flame retardants. The Commission considers that there is sufficient evidence to ban the use of two categories of brominated flame retardants, PBB and PBDE – that is against the background of the risk assessments being carried out on them. We have enough evidence to be able to ban them.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree that a mechanism to ban new substances should be set up. It is of course important, and in line with the Chemicals Strategy, that we allow such a development and add on new substances. We admit that today we do not have enough risk assessments and evidence to make a complete list of all the existing flame retardants, including the risks of taking them out of some substances where they prevent fire, etc. The review should cover all potential hazardous substances.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn to Mr Lund's question on Denmark. Remember that the aim of these directives is to establish a high common level of protection. These products are marketed throughout the European Union, and that is why it is necessary to have a high level of protection in the whole of the EU. At the same time we know that Sweden, Denmark and other countries which have effective legislation have not been forced to abandon their legislation. This is what Sweden and Denmark feared, but it did not happen. It has to be looked at on a case-by-case basis. This will also have to be done for these substances. We want to establish a high level of protection for the whole of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Several Members have mentioned the 'visible fee'. The Commission thinks that this amendment is unnecessary. A 'visible fee' is possible as long as it does not create trade distortions. Nowhere is it said that producers cannot inform consumers of the costs of waste management. I think these were the most important questions raised.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we are confronted with a total number of 136 amendments: 100 on the proposal on electronic waste and 36 on the proposal on hazardous substances.</p>
<p class="contents">On the first proposal, overall, the Commission can accept 36 amendments in full, 11 in part and 22 in principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 3, 4, 10, 15, 16, 18 to 25, 27 to 29, 36, 39, 42, 43, 45, 47 to 50, 51, 52, 54, 56, 59 to 61, 64, 66 to 68.</p>
<p class="contents">Twenty-two amendments can be accepted in principle: 2, 8, 9, 30, 32, 38, 41, 44, 53, 55, 57, 58, 62, 63, 75, 77, 83 to 86, 95 and 100. In particular, as regards Amendments Nos 9 and 35, the Commission can accept that Member States take measures with a view to achieving a separate collection rate of 6 kg per person per year. Concerning Amendment No 44, it is important to leave freedom to Member States on how to organise the collection, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle. Amendment No 52 may give rise to practical difficulties, but can also be accepted in principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Eleven amendments can be accepted in part: No 6 (second part, in principle), No 11 (second part, except the terms in brackets), No 13 (the text will have to be shortened and simplified), No 17 (second and third parts, in principle), No 26 (except the term ‘consumables’), No 35 (first paragraph, second paragraph in principle, fourth paragraph, seventh paragraph in principle, eighth paragraph, ninth paragraph in principle), No 37 (except paragraph 5), No 46 (second and third parts, in principle), No 70 (except the part referring to printed circuit boards; the entry on capacitors can be accepted in principle) Nos 71 and 80 (the reference to Regulation 2037/2000 can be accepted).</p>
<p class="contents">On the second proposal, overall the Commission can accept five amendments in full, two in part and twelve in principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments acceptable in full are Nos 1, 9, 12, 13 and 17.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 4, 7, 10, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26 and 35 in principle. As regards Amendments Nos 4 and 10, the Commission agrees that the scope of the directive on restrictions on substances may be broadened on the basis of a proposal from the Commission. However, this should be done in accordance with certain principles, not least those set out in the Chemicals Strategy. The Commission can accept to advance the date of phase-out from 2008 to 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 11 can be accepted in the part which refers to consumer safety and Amendment No 23 (inclusion of category 10 in the scope). </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
