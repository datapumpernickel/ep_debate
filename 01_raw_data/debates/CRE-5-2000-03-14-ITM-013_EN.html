<p class="contents">This report sets national targets for ozone levels and proposes action plans for dealing with local problems of exceedance. To save time I am going to assume that the respiratory and other health problems associated with ozone are understood, and that every Member of this House will want to reduce them. The disputes between us will be about costs and time-scales, and perhaps also about the accuracy of the Commission's methodology and the achievability of the targets it has set in this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me deal directly with the Commission's core proposal, the setting of a target for 2010 of 120 mg per cubic metre for ozone, not to be exceeded on more than 20 days per year.</p>
<p class="contents">Commission proposals for environmental improvements need to be both ambitious and realistic. These proposals are certainly ambitious but many governments dispute whether they are politically realistic, and having just come from a difficult – albeit ultimately successful – group meeting of my own, I know that many Members have doubts. In particular, representatives of the Mediterranean countries point out problems resulting from the strong sunlight they enjoy. I point out that the Commission's methodology has taken full account of this but I look at their faces and still see a degree of scepticism. I did wonder some months ago whether to table amendments, which would suggest a less ambitious outcome, but which would perhaps be more acceptable to Member States. But the Commission's 120 mg target is in line with World Health Organisation proposals, and who am I to suggest that they should be challenged? The number of days of exceedance could easily be adjusted, but that is something to negotiate only when necessary. It is a good target and, if it is at all possible, then it should be retained.</p>
<p class="contents">The position I have taken in preparing this report is to say that those who want tougher targets than the Commission has proposed should have their views rejected. But equally it would be wrong for us to water down the draft directive. That is why I am sorry to see amendments tabled which reflect the Industry Committee's position. It seems to have been overlooked by many that these amendments, if carried, would leave the European Union in a much weaker position with regard to ozone targets than is enjoyed by the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware of growing problems of ozone across Europe, but if we are not even prepared to match the standards being set by the USA, one of our great commercial rivals, this would indeed be a great shame and a sorry reflection on our commitment to environmental improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask Parliament to support my proposals, to give its backing to the Commissioner and to let her play her part in negotiating a common position which is both ambitious and politically realistic.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is absolutely no doubt that in tightening up or adopting the ozone directive we must find a reasonable compromise between the justifiable demand for improved air quality and the possibility for European economy and society to reasonably adapt in particularly polluted regions.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, unlike the Environment Committee which has responsibility in this matter, we have not taken on board the proposals of the Commission wholesale, but have modified them. I know that the experts at the Commission will vigorously oppose this, but we think that we can propose a compromise given that the guide value of 180 µg/m3 is not disputed, nor indeed the critical value of 240, only the target value. We would like to propose for this a 30-year programme which, although based on the WHO value of 120 µg/m3, provides for a phased reduction in the number of days on which this value may be exceeded: 40 days in 2010, 20 days in 2020 (which is the Commission’s target for 2010) and no days in 2030.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a concern in particular for the warmer regions of Europe, namely coastal regions, which have to cope with a particularly high external ozone penetration. I think we have put forward a reasonable compromise here. In any case, we are prepared to compromise with the Commission, particularly as we assume that only this type of compromise will also find approval in the Council. For this reason we are venturing to re-introduce this proposal on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party, even though it was marginally defeated in the Environment Committee. We hope that you will consent to it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We in the Group of the European People’s Party consider it necessary to support the main lines set in the Commission’s proposal, especially with regard to target levels, which coincide with the guidelines of the World Health Organisation on air quality and which establish the permissible concentrations of ozone at 120 µg/m3.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it seems to us to be inadvisable to accept the amendments which make 2010 the time limit, the only one in the short term, and set 2020 as the time limit for long term objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we think it is essential to allow for greater flexibility with regard to the periods of adaptation to the said target levels, given the real difficulty of controlling ozone concentrations when setting figures purely on the basis of the existence of previous data, as is constantly seen in certain climatic conditions, especially, as has just been mentioned, in the Mediterranean countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Group therefore vigorously defends Amendments Nos 26 and 28, which establish a progressive and realistic achievement of the proposed objectives, by means of a progressive scale according to the number of days in a year the target levels can be exceeded.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we consider very positive the amendments on the countries which are candidates for accession to the European Union, so that they may participate as soon as possible in the achievement of the Union’s objectives – and we congratulate Mrs Davies on this initiative – and it also seems important to us that the action plans are of a local nature and that the possibilities for reducing ozone concentrations are studied on a case by case basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that a vote in favour of the amendments proposed by the European People’s Party is a vote for progress in the control and monitoring of one of the most serious pollutants to date, initiating, in a decisive and homogenous way, in all the Member States, actions for its elimination as a threat to the health of persons and ecosystems, without deluding ourselves as to the real possibilities of completely eradicating it in the short term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Adoption of the Commission’s proposal and of Mr Davies's report will mean a considerable improvement in air quality for Europe's citizens. I think there are two crucial points here. The first is that the WHO’s guidelines should be adhered to. I think that this would be an important step towards preventing serious illnesses and premature deaths, especially among particularly vulnerable sectors of the population, including children. The second thing I think is very important is that specific dates should be set, both for when in 2010 we are to achieve the provisional targets and for when in 2020 we are to attain the long-term objectives. I think that setting dates is very important to our also in actual fact attaining the objectives. In addition, I should like to make a couple of remarks on the amendments inspired by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and which are intended to weaken the Commission’s initiative by allowing much greater exceedances of the WHO's recommendations and by significantly delaying efforts to achieve the targets set by the WHO. The amendments would not only impair the Commission’s proposal but also constitute a deterioration and retrograde step in relation to the situation of which we are now, in fact, aware in Europe. As Mr Davies also mentioned, standards are, in actual fact, lower than those in the United States. I do not know how one can call the proposals a happy medium or compromise, as Mr Langen did a moment ago. I think they are completely incomprehensible and irresponsible. They would involve serious health and environmental consequences for the people of Europe, together with a bill for Europe’s health services to the tune of billions. I would therefore very much recommend that we support the Commission’s proposal, together with Mr Davies’ report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Back in July 1995, Strasbourg was labouring under ozone smog. On the initiative of the Green Group, the European Parliament then adopted a resolution to halve the ozone standard stipulated in the 1992 directive. The European Commission’s proposal has made a lot of headway in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Ozone smog is still on the increase. It is now even permeating the southern European skies during the winter months. It has paralysed the traffic in northern Italy over the past couple of weeks and, during the summer months, countries such as Denmark and Sweden also suffer with ozone smog. Ozone smog is now to be found everywhere in Europe. Ozone is always an aggressive substance. There are no safe ozone levels, despite what the World Health Organisation claims. </p>
<p class="contents">This is why the Green Group proposes allowing just fifteen exceedances of critical loads per annum. This number is slightly lower than the proposal made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. My group can also support the twenty exceedances proposed by the Committee. However, it cannot back the proposal made by the Christian Democrats and UNICE Employers’ Union of forty such incidents per annum. This is far too many and thirty years is a ridiculous time limit, given the fact that the problem is taking on such proportions. In order to reach this strict ozone standard, the NOx emissions from traffic, in particular, and the emission of volatile organic substances will need to go down drastically. </p>
<p class="contents">This is the topic of Mrs Myller’s report. In the case of an ozone alert, we also need to be able to take short-term action. The Dutch Government makes so many concessions to the transport lobby that it fails to realise this. For my group, the car is no sacred cow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an extremely important report, especially from a health perspective. Seen from an environmental point of view, it is also intimately linked to the next subject, namely Mrs Myller’s report. I am convinced that these two reports together provide a sound basis for positive developments in Europe in the fields of health and the environment. </p>
<p class="contents">During the short time I have in which to speak, I should like to try to scotch some of the flourishing myths which exist with regard to the ozone issue. This especially applies to the situation in southern Europe. The climate in southern Europe is often used as a reason for, or explanation of, the high levels of ozone which are often to be found in the summertime. It is true that climates with long periods of high pressure increase the presence of ozone. At the same time, research shows that the reasons why ozone affects cities such as Barcelona, Athens and Milan and many of the tourist resorts along the coast must be sought elsewhere. The reasons have to be sought in traffic levels, in industrial processes and in energy production. It is also these matters which we can influence by means of the Directives concerned. It is therefore something of a pity that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy should have such a detached attitude towards the present Directive and only see it in a perspective which favours industry. </p>
<p class="contents">Instead, we ought to see what happens when the limits set by the WHO are constantly exceeded and when people (both residents and tourists) are constantly exposed to a danger to their health. We know that the risks are greatest for people who are in the open air a great deal, especially children. We know that exceedance of ozone limits directly affects children’s lung capacity. The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy ought to consider this when the present directive is voted upon tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for their support of the Commission’s proposal and draft report. Within the European Union, we have achieved a certain amount of success when it comes to improving air quality. Nonetheless, ozone still constitutes one of the most serious environmental problems. On more than 60 days every summer in a number of locations in Central and Southern Europe, ozone levels exceed the target values set by the World Health Organisation. The Fifth Environmental Action Programme established the long-term objective of ensuring that these limits were not in fact exceeded. If we are to be able to solve this problem, we need to take measures with clearly defined subsidiary objectives. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal therefore for the first time establishes clear limits upon ozone levels which, as far as possible, are to be attained by no later than the year 2010. The target value in terms of protecting people’s health means that the WHO’s guidelines must not be exceeded on more than 20 days per year. Programmes for reducing emissions are necessary in those cases where the target values are not attained. The directive on national emission ceilings, which is the next point on the agenda, will lead to improvements in ozone levels so that the target values in question might for the most part be attained. The proposal is nonetheless a clear expression of the political will that exists to attain the long-term objectives in the directive, too. Attaining the World Health Organisation’s target values is only the first step. In reviewing the Directive in the year 2004, we must therefore analyse how and when we can achieve the long-term objective. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is able wholly to approve Amendments Nos 3, 4, 6, 7, 13, 14 and 15. Amendment No 5, section two, is also acceptable in view of the fact that the Member States have to prepare emission reduction programmes before they can implement them. With regard to Amendment No 9, the Commission is also able to approve some of the changes in their entirety and the majority of them in principle. We approve those changes relating to short-term measures which are to be implemented in each zone in which the threshold value is exceeded. We also agree that the Member States should inform the public as to whether they intend to prepare and implement short-term action plans and, if so, in what ways, and that they should also inform them as to how often such measures have been taken. We believe it is necessary for this information to be reported to the Commission. However, that issue is more at home in Article 10. We cannot, however, accept that short-term measures should only be taken at local level. Nor do we believe that the Member States should be enjoined to analyse whether short-term measures are an effective tool in each individual case and in each individual place where the threshold value has been exceeded. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is able to approve the principles behind Amendments 10 and 11. We are going to redraft subparagraph 1c in order to take account of the idea behind the last section of Amendment No 9 and Amendments Nos 10 and 11. Amendment No 12 can be approved in principle. The Commission believes that progress by the Member States ought to be presented in a form which permits direct comparisons between countries, if that is possible in practice. The principle in Amendment No 16 is also acceptable. The Commission agrees that climate changes ought to be emphasised. This ought, however, to be done in a broader perspective and not only in relation to changes in fuel consumption. Amendment No 2 advocates coordination between Member States and Applicant States. This can in principle be approved, but some rewording is required if misinterpretations are to be avoided. We cannot, however, approve Amendment No 1. Even if the Commission agrees that it is important to involve the Applicant States, there is no reason for reiterating this in a directive aimed at the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">Nor is Amendment No 8 acceptable when it comes to predictions of exceedances of information thresholds. The use of prognosis models is specified as a prerequisite of thresholds for alerting the public, something which would make the way in which the public is informed or alerted less reliable. This is an issue on which practical considerations and the possibility of practical implementation must be taken into account. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must reject the first and third sections of Amendment No 5, together with Amendments Nos 17 and 18. In the present situation, we quite simply do not have enough information available to be able to predict when the long-term objective of not exceeding the World Health Organisation’s guidelines can be attained. In addition, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 28. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
