<p class="contents">These have been five years of close and constructive collaboration between the Commission and Parliament. At times we have had our disagreements; at times our proposals have kindled heated debate in this House. This debate, however, has always been frank, open and constructive. I should therefore like to offer you my heartfelt thanks for the collaboration, the stimulus and also the criticism that I have been given.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, today, as one chapter closes, a new chapter is opening in the story of European integration: a great new chapter. We have been waiting for these days for a long time, but at last enlargement is a fact. For me, 1 May 2004 will remain the best day I have ever spent in the Commission. Indeed, enlargement is leading all the institutions into the future, and the Commission is now entering a different phase, a transitional period that will end on 1 November.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few weeks you have met the Commissioners one by one during the exchanges of views you have had with them. Today I can introduce them as a body, the first Commission of the new Europe. In this interim period we are organising the transition between the current Commission and the new 25-member Commission, which will take office in November. That is why we have taken the unprecedented step of teaming up our new Commissioners with ten Commissioners already in office without allocating portfolios, which would have adversely affected the work of the College in these last few months of its life. These Commissioners will, however, take part fully in College decisions, and their votes will have the same weight as those of all the other Commissioners. They are going to have – indeed they already have – a greater responsibility, because they are even more visibly the face of the European Union, to their fellow countrymen and women: theirs is a crucial role at a time when our new fellow citizens are becoming familiar with the Union and its workings.</p>
<p class="contents">While in a formal sense my Commission is coming towards the end of its natural life, from a practical point of view we have a full agenda in front of us. In the next few months we must achieve the strategic objectives set out in the work programme that we drew up with you and which we promised you we would observe. We have decided not to undertake any new initiatives in this transitional period but to concentrate on completing the major commitments before us.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like here to outline the main issues of these major commitments that we have already worked out with you. First, although it does not depend directly on us, is the long-awaited decision on the European Constitution. I am confident it will be adopted; this will send out a strong message for the future of the Union and will put the machinery in place for the Union to work effectively. The conditions are right for the forthcoming European Council in June to get things moving again and to bring the Intergovernmental Conference to a conclusion. The Commission will collaborate with the Presidency in every possible way in order to achieve an agreement on the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major objective is to ensure the success of enlargement. Now that these Member States have joined, we have to give due consideration to the aspirations of the other candidate countries, and so over the next few months we must carry forward the negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania, which are going well. We have already recommended starting negotiations with Croatia, and the Council is to make a decision on Turkey at the end of the year on the basis of a recommendation that the Commission has been called on to adopt in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must push ahead with the work of preparing the new financial perspective for the period after 2006. As you know, we have gone beyond thinking simply in accounting terms and have given the exercise a political basis, because we have to organise the political project of an enlarged Europe in line with the resources needed to carry it through. The political project we propose is supported on three pillars: sustainable development, European citizenship and Europe’s role in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the first pillar, sustainable development, there has been mounting concern for some time now about the health of the European economy. Our analysis of the situation is well-known, and has been supported by you all. The backbone of our action is the Lisbon/Gothenburg strategy, which marks out our path for development and growth until the end of the decade. Our project seeks to give fresh impetus to the European development model by focusing on competitiveness, employment, and solidarity between regions and across generations. Once again I must express my disappointment at the slowness of the decisions made so far: the Commission and Parliament must continue to urge the Member States to move down the path that they themselves marked out but have not followed.</p>
<p class="contents">The second pillar of the proposal is to give real substance to the concept of European citizenship. Up to now the Union has focused especially on creating an economic area in which freedom of movement and common rules apply. In future, our united Europe must become an area of security, justice and civil liberties.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the third pillar, Europe in the world, we propose that Europe should take its model for managing relations between countries out into the world. In that way we will be giving a practical response to the deteriorating international situation, which we observe with extreme concern. To the countries around us we are proposing our neighbourhood policy, which seeks to extend to the whole continent of Europe the model of peace, democracy and prosperity that is the hallmark of the Union. We will have to put some hard work into this great neighbourhood policy over the next five years.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms, then, this is the political project we are working on. In the next three months we have to prepare the implementing measures and the financial plan so that the new Commission can discharge its duties according to the timetable that has been laid down.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, these five years have seen great developments, and I want to highlight a few events that I feel have been particularly significant. The first is the euro. After years of remarkable but intangible achievements, Europe now has in its common currency an exceptional instrument for political and economic unity, and I mean both political and economic unity. The practical and symbolic significance of all this is even greater than we might have anticipated.</p>
<p class="contents">The second great event was the arrival on the world economic scene of the Asian giants, starting with China. All this is producing a whole new global balance in production and trade which we cannot ignore. It is a new reality that we have to come to terms with, and we can only cope with it if we remain united in defending our interests and our values.</p>
<p class="contents">The third event is the Convention. Although we are still awaiting the Constitution, there is no doubt that the Convention was something completely new in the way politics is done in Europe. The debate on the future of Europe involved all the main players; it took place in the full light of day; and it produced a coherent text on which the Intergovernmental Conference has been able to work effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe these great steps forward in the democratic life of the Union prepared the way for the fourth event that I want to recall, which is the emergence of a truly European public opinion. I am referring in particular to the events surrounding the conflict in Iraq since late 2002. For the first time in our history we saw a wave of opinion attracting large majorities in every country in the Union. The people of Europe demanded that, when all avenues for negotiation had been exhausted, any military intervention in defence of our security should be based on international legitimacy of the kind that the European Union embodies and champions.</p>
<p class="contents">These five years have thus seen changes that are quite out of the ordinary: the pace of our history has stepped up considerably. I see a very simple consequence in all this: in the past Euroscepticism was perhaps a luxury the Union could tolerate; today, with these changes, Euroscepticism can only bring us certain defeat.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, these years spent serving the European cause have wrought profound changes in me too. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that in the months and years to come I shall continue to fight for a decisive, passionate idea of Europe. The time of lukewarm beliefs and half-hearted commitments is over; the time of ambivalence is over. Europe needs determination, vision and courage, and I shall be throwing all the enthusiasm and strength I can muster into the fight.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, new members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, today is a solemn occasion, but it is also the day on which our work begins. On Monday, we welcomed new Members to our House, and we would have liked you, Mr President of the Commission, to have been here in Strasbourg to share our joy. You are here today, though, and we are glad that you have come to join us, along with the new and current members of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We have always regarded the Commission as a sort of government. Romano Prodi took up office as its President five years ago; some of the Member States’ governments have been fiercely critical of him, but we have always supported him, for the members of the Commission are of course politicians, albeit not tied to political parties. I wish the new Commissioners good luck and success in their work, and would like to assure them that our group will give them every conceivable support. We welcome Péter Balázs, Joe Borg, Ján Figel', Dalia Grybauskaitė Danuta Hübner, Siim Kallas, Sandra Kalniete, Markos Kyprianou, Janez Potočnik and Pavel Telička. From the Member States that belonged to the European Union even before 1 May, we give an equally warm welcome to Jacques Barrot and Joaquín Almunia, as well, of course, to Commissioner Dimas, with whom this plenary has already had dealings.</p>
<p class="contents">I see it as very important that we should get back to a consensus on what the European Commission’s role is. I know that this is a particular topic of discussion in those countries that have now joined the European Union, and I regard the talk in some of them about how the Commissioners from the new Member States are too European, as utterly mistaken. To those among the new Commissioners who face such reproaches at home, I would like to say that we are right alongside you if you are putting the well-being of the European Union first, for that is the role you have to perform under the constitution, so to speak. You represent the European Union as a whole, and in your work Europe’s interest must come first; you can always rely on the support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. If you have opposition to contend with in your own countries, we will be there to defend you!</p>
<p class="contents">I hope you will not mind my saying, by way of a recommendation, that you do of course have an important role in relation to your own countries, one that you share with the Members of this House, as, so to speak, communicators of the European ideal to the states from which we come. So I hope that the members of the Commission from the new Member States will, together with Members of the European Parliament, be successful in explaining to their countries the need for European policies and in getting the message across that those who consider only their national interests are actually damaging them. Only if you ally your own nation’s interests to those of Europe as a whole will you be able to advance its cause; there will be no allies in Europe for those who are blind to all but their own country, and so they will be unable to do anything for it. That is why interests have to be represented at local, regional, national and European level simultaneously, and I wish the new members of the Commission much success as they go about doing that.</p>
<p class="contents">A few moments ago, I described the members of the Commission as politicians but not party politicians. Mr President of the Commission, I cannot spare you the serious request that you devote the remaining months of your Presidency to continuing to preside over the Commission in a truly effective manner and to concentrate on your work there rather than on domestic political disputes in Italy, your own country.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union Summit is to be held on 17-18 June, and so, Mr President, it might well be advisable for us to hold another Conference of Presidents on the afternoon of Thursday 17 June and discuss how to organise the proceedings as a whole. I say this as a suggestion, so that we can, together, give some thought to that.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say, by way of conclusion, that the Commission and the European Parliament are allies. With this in mind, our group will be alongside the new Commission, ensuring that we succeed in the joint enterprise of shaping this European Union, with the Commission playing a decisive role, possessing as it does the power of initiative. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be supportive, and what we want to see from the Commission is close cooperation. If we get it, then we will, together, do great things for our European Union. With that in mind, I wish the new members of the Commission every success. We are right behind you.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that 1 May was a day on which – as a leader article in a German newspaper put it – we emerged from the long shadow cast by Hitler and Stalin. Now, though, we have to start trudging across the flatlands of day-to-day life. That, above all, is what the Commission is there for, but not in the sense that we need to be led by technocrats or bureaucrats. Far from it; what we need is politically-minded people, Commissioners of flesh and blood who are not in thrall to party policy. On that, Mr Poettering and I agree. However, Mr Poettering, I would congratulate you if you were to say that to certain other members of the Commission, from all of whom – and its Vice-President in particular – we have heard or read comments that do not exactly testify to the Commission’s neutrality.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is members of the Commission who have a vision for Europe and the capacity to make policy, something that I regard as crucial, and so we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists have something to ask of you. First, we ask you to make it abundantly clear that you possess those things; in the hearings, some of you were rather reticent. It may be that you still feel shy, or perhaps you were more anxious than you probably will be after some time has passed – although you should always be a little bit afraid! What is most important, though, is something else, namely the European social model, which we want to make a reality. There are those, including within this House, who would perhaps prefer its foundations to be swept away by a neoliberal storm. We prefer the spring wind, which may perhaps be a bit lukewarm, but it does refresh Europe with new blossoms and new leaves, without destroying the trees that grow here.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to reduce a lot of Europe’s deficits. For these, you bear a great deal of responsibility – and not just for the budget deficits. There are others; there are, for example, too few jobs. Europe is suffering from deficits in employment policy. As the President of the Commission has said, our competitors are in America, in China, and now in India. I warn against competing only among ourselves, with the lowest possible tax rates, in order to push each other out of the market, and then, as a matter of policy, relocating jobs from one part of the continent to others. Instead, we want to join together in creating jobs in this continent of ours.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to take the Lisbon strategy seriously, and then even more seriously; that much is evident to me from seeing what is going on in some countries as regards investments in education, training, research and development, as well as infrastructure. Thinking of transport policy, for example, the infrastructure in the new Member States is very poor and underdeveloped. What I would like to see, not only from these countries, but also from the European Budget, is more money for education, research, for development, and also for infrastructure. There is no doubt that there is a link between this and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking Kyoto as our slogan, the second example is the legislation on chemicals. In these areas, too, we in Europe must be pioneers, but, above all where external economic policy is concerned, we must ensure that we are not alone in implementing Kyoto and adopting stringent laws on chemicals. Instead, we must avail ourselves of every opportunity to urge others, America, Russia, China, and Japan among them, to abide by these agreements. Otherwise – and this is where I agree with the Vice-President, not where her comments on the Spanish Government are concerned – we will end up in serious difficulties as regards competition and our competitive position, with consequent heavy demands being made of external economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Hübner, thank God, answered that question in the affirmative. External economic policy, too, must become a means whereby we defend our European social model, for example where public services are concerned. It is not acceptable for the Commission to keep on defying a vote of this House by attempting to put the liberalisation and eventual privatisation of water, local public transport, health and education on the agenda. Our group, too, is in favour of opening up markets, and we have, together with the Commission, taken positive action in this respect; I, for example, did so in relation to railways. There are areas, though, that are of the very essence of what we understand as being a national or European social model, so that should be accepted accordingly and they should continue as such.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already said, we want a political Commission, with Commissioners of flesh and blood who speak their political minds in this House. We want a Commission with which we can argue. There are several I can see here, with whom I have been more than happy to argue, for they too were emotional, because there was sometimes rage and anger underlying their actions. Under such circumstances, we can argue with you, and you should argue with us, but be frank with us, be honest with us, without evading the issues! If your arguments with us are characterised by frankness and honesty, then we will support you for the sake of Europe as a whole, in which, of course, we all have a very great political interest.</p>

We welcome the political balance that is found among the ten, as well as the presence of three women. My Group will be giving its support to the enlarged Commission when we vote at noon today.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs a strong, legitimate and accountable Commission, capable of providing political vision and leadership. Our leaders must reflect this in the Constitutional Treaty and in their nominations for the next Commission President – but we cannot have a strong Commission until this House takes more seriously its role as the third branch of European government.</p>
<p class="contents">Once in every five years this Parliament is the Union's personnel officer. We are there to take the proper measure of those appointed to the Commission or its presidency. To date our hearings of Commissioners have been handicapped by too much partisanship and too little sustained, in-depth questioning. So all of the Commissioners nominated in November can expect tough questioning from MEPs of the political centre, the kind of questioning that was too little in evidence at last month's hearings.</p>
<p class="contents">This Commission is the first for a new enlarged Europe and the imperative for Liberals in this House is to ensure that it is effective, committed and competent. It is also important that we restate and establish once and for all the long-standing principle of individual responsibility of Commissioners to Parliament for their policies and their departments. It is inevitable that the work of this Commission will bind that of the next, just as the work of this Parliament will not be undone on 14 June.</p>
<p class="contents">Like any executive, the Commission aims to provide continuity in the management of Europe's business. Much of this business has political import, yet there should be no suggestion that business cannot be done simply because the Commission is approaching the end of its term. That argument not only impugns the professionalism of the Commission and its officials, but it parades a tenuous grasp of the European agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's mandate is for the running of the European Union and yet there seem to be some in this House who would have it closed down for the summer. Do they not envisage that the settlement of the European Union's budget for the next seven years or the question of Turkish membership might make some demands on the Commission's attention between now and November? <span class="italic">Liebe deutsche Freunde, das müsst ihr ernst nehmen!</span> To close down the Commission's right of initiative at this point would not only be wildly impractical, it would be downright irresponsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us read between the lines here. My Group will not be party to efforts to paint the Prodi Commission as a lame duck. Nor will we be a part of attempts to manufacture that lameness now by restraining the Commission's powers. European Commissioners are bound to leave their politics at the water's edge. This House should show a similar maturity. The treaties require a degree of impartiality from Commissioners that would be difficult to counterfeit and that is why, for all their posturing, the critics of Mr Prodi have yet to provide any evidence that his other interests have negatively affected his work in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">European Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House have had their share of criticism of some of the Commission's policies but we have always recognised its individual talents and its collective commitment. This week we need only think of the extraordinary work of Commissioner Verheugen in helping secure a successful European enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Commission will begin its term with one thing in its favour. Many familiar faces are likely to be there again in November. This continuity can and should be an asset. Likewise the Commission must have the necessary latitude over the next five months to prepare the ground and to maintain the momentum necessary to make it a success. Indeed, to insist on anything else – especially just to pay party political dues – is risible.</p>

<p class="contents">Hailing, as I do, from a cross-border region, Lorraine, which suffered greatly during conflicts with neighbours and in the aftermath of those conflicts, I am fully aware both of the need henceforth to unite our voices and our strength and of the challenges involved in doing so, yet I am also aware of what we all stand to gain from so doing. This enlarged European Union, this united Europe, or reunited as some would have it, with its rights and a political design finally restored in line with its geography, must establish a new European spirit that is free from the rancour of the past and from the yoke of nationalism.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the new Commission team towards just such a shared spirit of solidarity, and of common responsibilities and common interests. Today, and most importantly, I would also urge your new executive – which is, of course, still in its infancy in terms of its composition – towards a completely democratic spirit, and towards ensuring that the citizens’ voices in our European Community are listened to and respected.</p>
<p class="contents">It could scarcely be a worse omen or a worse baptism for your college that policies that are disconnected or far removed from what the peoples of our Union are saying and thinking are being proposed, because a shared spirit and a European public have been formed, and expression has been given to them within our European space. The Iraq crisis revealed this in sharp relief when political Europe once again shot itself in the foot through political calculations or strategies adopted in certain cabinet offices. Events, however, proved the European public right.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Mr Prodi, I should like to thank you most sincerely for recalling the major policy guidelines, which, as you said, Parliament had a share in deciding, and which it often encouraged. I should like to thank you for having again put sustainable development at the heart of the European project, because these political decisions were taken by all of the Heads of State, in agreement with the Commission. I refer to decisions such as those taken in Lisbon and Gothenburg, which must be complied with and enforced. The social environment and the economy are intrinsically linked and our proposals must be geared towards them.</p>
<p class="contents">Hopefully your new Commission will not miss any further opportunities to speak on behalf of the citizens of our Community. The issue that most concerns them today, in the field of food safety and GMOs, must determine the European executive’s position and the precautions it takes. In successive surveys, the consumers of Europe have become stronger and more determined in their shared defiance and hostility towards genetically modified and scientifically dubious produce. In successive meetings, the Council of Ministers has failed to achieve a qualified majority on this public health requirement. I would therefore strongly urge you not to allow the Council to dump these genetically hazardous experiments onto your Commission, in its current interim period, thereby forcing it to take decisions endorsing such produce. There is no room for any wild scientific notions or leniency towards companies when the destiny and health of hundreds and hundreds of millions of European consumers are at stake, particularly since these consumers have never expressed any desire for this new generation of foodstuffs, the consequences of which are unknown.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the Commissioners, including the new ones, not to authorise genetically modified maize during your short term in office. Today, you have given the unified Europe new faces. When major concerns or convictions mobilise the opinions of your constituents, from Dublin to Nicosia, from Tallinn to Lisbon, please ensure that you reflect them as faithfully as possible. The more democratic our European institutions, the greater will be the respect for our Union on the international scene.</p>

What we are debating today is the natural legal consequence of the expansion of the European Union. Each of the new countries will have its own Commissioner in a new Commission for a new Europe. This is an outward sign that all Member States are dealt with fairly in the treaties on which the Union is based. We also advocate that each country should continue to have its own Commissioner on the European Commission in future. We feel this is a corollary of the principle of equality and respect for each and every country of the European Union, including the smallest. I wish the new Commissioners well in their work, and hope it will be fruitful for all the citizens of the European Union and for all the countries of Europe. I should now like to make two specific appeals.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I call on the new Commissioners representing the ten countries joining the European Union to devote special attention to ensuring European solidarity has real meaning. Through no fault of their own, these new countries lag behind the countries of the old European Union in terms of economic development. I must reiterate that this is through no fault of their own. I hope that under the leadership of Romano Prodi, the Commission, together with the new Commissioners, will do everything possible to bridge this gap in economic development between the countries of old and new Europe as soon as possible. It is in the interest of both old and new Member States of the European Union to do away with this divide.</p>
<p class="contents">My second appeal is as follows. We believe the European Union must be based on justice and respect for everyone of its members. We hope the new expanded European Commission will ensure all countries receive equal treatment. We cannot allow some to be more equal than others in the new Europe. We cannot allow situations to arise where weaker countries are unable to make progress, while politically stronger countries are able to evade even the most stringent of criteria. We hope that the European Commission will safeguard this equality to ensure every citizen of every country in the European Union feels he or she is being dealt with fairly, regardless of the size of the particular country’s population.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on behalf of the Polish UEN delegation, I would like to state that we shall support the composition of the entire Commission, and will be voting for it. Despite the reservations on the Polish nominee we expressed in our national parliament, we shall endorse this Commission today. We believe we must place our trust in it and wish it all the best in this difficult work on behalf of all the nations of Europe and of Europe itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For us Dutch people, it is a symbolic day, because each year on 5 May, we commemorate and celebrate the end of the Second World War, a war which ended sadly, with a divided Europe. Now, 59 years later, there is true healing, and Europe is free. We hope that the Commission will be able to continue Europe's healing process in full throttle.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, we voted on the motion of no-confidence, which we supported and had had a part in submitting. You may well expect us to be sour-faced today. Nothing could be further from the truth. These are all qualified candidates and we will give them our backing. However, we do have an urgent piece of advice for the new members. Do not adopt the usual tactics of certain Commissioners. Do not hide behind your officials, or Member States for that matter, and do not get bogged down in woolly statements, but provide concrete replies. Be clear and precise in your promises and honour them. European democracy only stands to benefit from this. In short, make sure that you are verifiable. This is something we, along with the electorate, greatly appreciate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, complete your mandate fully and do not resign prematurely. The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities regrets that the area of policy of budgetary control has not been assigned separately to one of the new Commissioners, of whom there are many, and so this could have easily been done. Past experience has taught us that it is impossible for one Commissioner to be responsible for the budget and budgetary control at the same time. That leads to a conflict of interest in the fight against fraud. My group has given the new Commissioners a motto that will hopefully inspire them: do not step down, but act. We wish you God's blessing in your responsible work.</p>

You speak fine words to the people, but your deeds are directed against them. You act to their disadvantage. You say you are on the side of the poor, but in your actions you help liberals and the globalists at the expense of the poor. Most Members of this House are liberals with social-democratic roots. You are aware of the poverty, corruption, and immorality that are tearing Europe apart, yet you turn a blind eye to the poverty affecting hundreds of millions of people in the European Union. It is time to introduce a European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">You must know that our countries have adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. These are the most important of all international instruments. Nonetheless, citizens’ rights and children’s rights are being infringed in our countries. Allow me to remind you of part of Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: ‘Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care …’</p>
<p class="contents">Are these to remain empty words? Are we not bound to implement them? It is high time the European Union introduced a social market economy in accordance with the social teachings of various religious groupings. This would be neither Communism nor capitalism. Rather, it would be an entirely new approach to the socio-economic development of the European Union. We must work together to find a way out of this difficult socio-economic situation for the well-being of the citizens of the European Union. I wish all the citizens of the European Union wisdom and perseverance in the struggle for a dignified life for the working people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be borne in mind that on the one hand, they act as a type of government for the European Union. On the other hand, each Member State is entitled to propose a Commissioner. This means that a Commissioner is simultaneously a representative of his or her country. At any given time, it is difficult to reconcile the interests of the whole with the interests of one’s country. I therefore believe Commissioners must be guided by the basic principles of the European Union. The principle of solidarity is the most important of these. I call on the Commissioners to make a statement in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wanted to take this opportunity to thank the President for attending the ceremonies that took place in Poland on 3 May, Poland’s national holiday. I am sure I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Members too. We are most grateful to Mr Cox for his participation in the solemn ceremony connected with the building of the Church of the Divine Providence, which is the votive offering of the Polish people in thanksgiving for regaining their independence.

In the simplest terms, I would say that the background they depart from is their own country, while the purpose they arrive at is our common interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like, on this my last occasion, to make a plea on behalf of the Commissioners from small countries: small may be beautiful, but small can also be highly competent, colourful and efficient. I believe very strongly that Parliament and the Commission have been very ably served by the Commissioners from small countries – naturally, in this context I think of my own country. I would hope to see in the future – particularly as other small countries are now present and we are no longer in a minority – the continuing, full participation of Commissioners from smaller countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express, in this my final moment in Parliament, my deep appreciation to Parliament, the Commission and all the institutions, and also to my country for having given me the privilege of having a ringside seat at some of the most momentous political occasions of the last hundred years.

The team conducting these proceedings within the government of the Republic of Slovenia performed its task with distinction, naturally with the consensus of all the parliamentary parties. The proposed candidate for the new Slovenian Commissioner is undisputedly one of these people and I am therefore delighted that he has been nominated.

I hope that the new Commissioners will be more positive in their attitude towards Ukraine's aspirations.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome in particular today Mr Kyprianou's nomination as the Commissioner from Cyprus, a Commonwealth country. I call upon the new Commission to cease to vilify the Greek Cypriot people post-referendum. I too am in favour of ending the isolation of the Turkish-occupied northern community, but, before this happens, surely the handing over of EU aid money – and I call upon Mr Talat in particular – is inappropriate for as long as they are offering sanctuary to wanted fugitives from justice, particularly from the United Kingdom.

From it there has emerged a strategy which, for now, is considered a common strategy, although nobody can tell what will happen in future. It is a very clear-cut strategy: we hope to be able to conclude negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania in 2007; Croatia has started its fast-track move towards the Union; as regards Turkey we have already set the timetable, as I pointed out this morning: in October the Commission’s report, and in December the decision, the frame of reference and the Copenhagen rights; then for the other countries we make a start straight away on what is suggestively termed the ring of friends, that is to say ‘sharing everything but the institutions’. This in no way means leaving these countries out in the cold; it means beginning a period of close cooperation, giving Europe some soft security, which is vital for us, giving these countries a chance to develop, and giving all of us together a chance to cooperate, both to the east and around the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this is an extremely clear-cut political doctrine, but it will take us decades to achieve. We are starting to carry out this policy conscientiously and in earnest, but we must not keep the continent constantly wondering what our horizons or frames of reference are. We have set these together; they will guide us on our way, help us make progress and will in no way jeopardise our future.

However, you still need to win the confidence of the citizens, in the sense that many of them have great expectations of the enlargement, but also a degree of mistrust. I should like to give two reasons for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Many members of the public are still of the opinion that money is being wasted in Europe, that supervision is ineffective and transparency is in short supply. What they would like to have from this Commission is the reiterated assurance that a zero-tolerance approach will be taken to fraud. That is what Commissioner Prodi promised at the beginning of his term of office and it is on that, certainly in the current climate, that the public will judge him. Furthermore, I still see equality and equal participation of men and women as an objective. Over the past few days, I have seen a huge number of men, and few women, at the highest echelons in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to echo the desire that solidarity with Africa should not be overlooked. At a time when we are celebrating, there is war in Darfour and still no peace in Congo. I could make the list of conflicts much longer.

I can honestly say that, for the first time in the history of the European institutions, we have conducted a thorough, in-depth reform of our working methods, and here I really must thank Commissioner Kinnock. This tends to be a job that no one wants to take on, precisely because for many long years it only causes headaches and brings no benefits; nonetheless, we really have laid the foundations for zero tolerance. We now have strict rules and I hope we shall truly be able to abide by them.</p>
<p class="contents">The other two issues you raised are exceptionally important, and I should like to link them together. You will say, ‘What has Africa got to do with gender equality?’ You see, the other day the European Commission met with the African Union Commission, in which there were as many men as women. Well, I must say I felt a little ashamed, because they taught us an amazing lesson about being able to move with the times.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the Mediterranean, I would say that our Mediterranean policy is a fundamental part of what I have called the circle of friends. We must not forget that it will require substantial resources in the coming five-year term. I hope that the Mediterranean Foundation and then the Bank will also be approved straight away, for the question of peace hinges on this. The dividing line between our different cultures is precisely where tensions are running high at the moment, and this is a barrier we have to tear down. Thus, with economic dialogue through the Bank and cultural dialogue through the Foundation, there are great prospects for close relations and a ring of friends in the southern Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe another solid, genuine step forward has been achieved in recent days in our relations with Libya. It has not been achieved for the sake of demagogy but because we really have to create an area of peace in the Mediterranean. No one can understand the situation as well as you who live here in the middle of it, but it is essential for our future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

History has shown us that there were the same fears in relation to Spain, Portugal and Ireland, and you can see how they have fitted into the Union: emigration has stopped and people have even started to go back. We have no particular problems with these countries. Our main immigration problems come from the countries of Africa and Asia; they come from the poverty-stricken world around us. This is the main problem. What is more, there is also a profound contradiction: on the one hand we are closing our borders, while on the other we are starting to make overtures to the top-level workers that these countries have. We are thus operating a double standard. I tell you again, Mr Szent-Iványi: I am absolutely against these measures, not only because they are wrong but also because they are pointless.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take the opportunity offered by your maiden speech to underline the fact that our first contact with these Commissioners has confirmed what you have said: we have ten first-rate Commissioners, and that is a really comforting fact.

<p class="contents">Maybe the citizens of Europe will show similar assiduousness and wisdom in ensuring that this Parliament becomes 50-50 or maybe Parliament itself would want to take the initiative and include in its policies the improvement of gender mix in the appointment of its senior management.</p>
<p class="contents">I can inform the House meanwhile that, in its current lifetime, the Commission will hit its target of ensuring that 20% of its middle and senior managers are women.

<p class="contents">On wider policy issues, I am certain that the inheritance that the Prodi Commission would want to leave will bear a very strong mark of the priorities cherished by the President himself.

I joined the House on 19 April and I will leave on 19 July, with two months of interruption. In other words, I will have been a Member for just one month, but, over this month, I entered a Parliament with 623 Members and 15 countries and I will leave a Parliament with more than 700 Members and 25 countries. What a change I have brought to these institutions!</p>

Communication is very important and I believe that the European institutions must have a genuine communication policy. Not a propaganda policy, but a communication policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask President Prodi whether he believes that the last method he used, taking the communication of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and giving it directly to the Presidency, is the most appropriate, and whether he believes that now, with a much expanded College of Commissioners, the communication policy – always in accordance with the guidelines established by the European Parliament – should be led by the Commission in a more direct fashion, with a view to creating a genuine European spirit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Basel II is an extremely important issue, and we worked on it precisely so as to make amendments to the initial proposals, as they were devastating for small and medium-sized enterprises. We were asked by the Council to amend these proposals further and we were especially asked to look in depth at all the implications for small and medium-sized enterprises. With the Council’s agreement, we commissioned an in-depth study from PricewaterhouseCoopers; the study is now nearly done and we will hand it to the Council for further discussion in a few weeks. The subject is not closed, then; it is still open and being debated.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of communications, the experiment we carried out was so that communications could be coordinated better throughout the Commission. I believe the improvements that we made have worked, and I think you can actually see that in the more integrated way in which we have been able to function. Of course, I am not prejudging the future organisation of communications: that will depend entirely on how the new President organises the whole work of the Commission. I do see a need, however – and here I go back to what you said, Mr Vila Abelló – for much more incisive work on communications: until now, in fact, our communications have always gone through national media and so they have reached the people indirectly, and sometimes with major problems of distortion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the issues raised by President Chissano was the concern that ACP countries have about the prospect of enlargement and the impact of it on them in terms of the likelihood that there will be less resources for them. They are also concerned about the level of commitment to development cooperation which they might expect from the new countries coming into the Union. We in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and the ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly, would like reassurance that we can expect the same level of commitment from the new Commission as we have from the current Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, my question relates to the prospect for the Relex family of directorates under the new Commission. We do not want to see our development objectives and priorities subsumed by foreign policy strategies, interests and priorities. We very much want to see a Development Commissioner with a remit which covers our development work across the world. The EU is, after all, the world's major donor in this regard; it has an enormous role to play that I hope will not become secondary in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have the same impression that she expressed, because yesterday evening I was in Dakar, where I attended a meeting with the least advanced countries, and we spoke with them about enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right, Mrs Kinnock; there is a certain degree of anxiety in developing countries as regards EU enlargement. It is, indeed, one of the characteristics of developing countries that they are anxious about many things, but there is particular anxiety about enlargement. I feel that we must put it across to them that enlargement is good news for them, and we have attempted to do this with a certain number of them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good news because the enlarged EU has more weight and is potentially stronger; because the enlarged EU has opened up markets to them with 70 million new consumers, whereas, until now, those new markets had been less open to them than ours; because the enlarged EU represents a rosy future for them, especially in terms of trade. I feel that these are strong arguments. The idea nevertheless persists in many quarters outside the EU that the EU is incapable of accomplishing enlargement at the same time as attending to other matters. I believe that they are wrong, and that the past has shown this to be a fallacious viewpoint. To conclude, we have a good case, certainly as regards the developing countries, and especially the ACP countries. There are, therefore, many points on which we can reassure them.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second point, Mrs Kinnock, I am sure that the Commission as a whole will take this request and this wish on board, which will be passed on to the relevant person at the appropriate time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are very proud that they are being drawn from the Commission to fill the highest posts in the new governments of some countries. We hope, and I trust, that the new Commissioners who have arrived here will include among them some future Prime Ministers or Foreign Affairs Ministers of their countries. This is the Commission’s job: to establish a firm bond between the various countries, with the national governments seeing the Commissioners as a kind of lifeblood helping the country to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the other observation you made, Mr Berg, on the matter of relations with the Member States and the effectiveness of our actions, I would just like to emphasise one thing: the consistency of the actions and programmes we have undertaken over these last five years. We have not always been successful, and the Council has not always matched our pace, but the Commission has never deviated from its own path for a second. I would recall that, if we had been able to impose our proposals, or if our lead had been followed, the Lisbon strategy would have given our European Union some very different results.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take a moment to reply further to Mrs Kinnock. I hope that for the next term of office – indeed, this is something I am announcing here to you – there will be a specific directorate for Africa within the Development Directorate because, in the development context, Africa has to be a particular duty of ours. Africa is our responsibility. On other continents there are shared responsibilities and complex situations, but Africa is a specific task for us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to welcome and congratulate the incoming Commission. I think the incoming Commission will have to begin by tackling three main issues.</p>
<p class="contents">First, it must repair relations with other European organisations and reinforce cooperation. I give you the example of the Council of Europe, an organisation that is especially close to me. It has its headquarters nearby and is where the idea of creating an agency for migration arose. The purpose of the latter is to find a solution to one of the most pressing concerns for this continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, it must also be remembered that 22 countries remain outside the European Union. Europe has 800 million inhabitants. Of these, only 450 million are citizens of the Union. This is why it is important to create an agency for external relations. Further, it should be recalled that the Union has almost 4 000 kilometres of external borders. 1 150 kilometres of these are in my country, Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">My final comment is addressed directly to the President. I would like to ask him how he envisions the future development of the relationship between the three main integrated groupings in the world. I refer to the Union, NAFTA, which is expanding to all of Latin America, and ASEAN and APEC, the Asian groupings </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We had a very interesting discussion during our last meeting with Russia because, of course, on the table were all the problems that you, Mr Landisbergis, know only too well: the movement of labour and the movement of goods. Above all, though, we proposed that we should work together on the economic and cultural development of the city of Kaliningrad, so that it can truly become a point of reference both for Russia and for its neighbouring countries. This was a proposal, then, to move from a simple policy of good neighbours with rules in common to a strong policy of cooperation. The answer to your question, then, Mr Landisbergis, is in the affirmative: yes, and the cultural chapter is among those proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the climate of cooperation that existed at the last meeting with Russia will continue to prevail when, in a few days, in just a couple of weeks, we have the bilateral summit with that country in Moscow. I think a climate is beginning to develop in which being neighbours is not just something to sort out with border guards or legal issues or travel permits, but rather with active, mutual cooperation. This can also include commemorations of particular personalities, which must, however, be decided in the context of this true mutual collaboration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can assure you, Mr Gadzinowski, that the Commission will stand alongside Poland in every inter-regional cooperation initiative imaginable in relation to Ukraine, precisely because we believe that the bond between Ukraine and the Union is a very close one, not only economically but also culturally, as well as in the emotional roots that connect us to that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last year the Court of Justice decided that the citizens of the European Union have a right of access to healthcare in all Member States. This decision has generated a new discussion at EU level on healthcare in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to say that in December 2003 the Commission established a high-level group of health ministers of the European Union to report on that issue, following which the Commission produced its response. We are now at the stage where we have put forward a policy in response to this, which will put in place a high-level group which will guide the discussion on the appropriate response to healthcare and the delivery of healthcare at EU level. The Commission will lead the debate in conjunction with the health ministers of the Member States of the 25 EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This development has provided the kind of impetus necessary to form a bridge between the exercise of EU-level competences relating to public health, and how these relate to and impact on the delivery of healthcare – a responsibility which remains with the Member States. The contact between those two points is important and Parliament will be aware of the establishment, during this Commission, of the European Centre for Disease Control located in Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">These factors have contributed considerably to the further development of healthcare in the EU, an issue which is gradually increasing in importance for citizens. I am happy to say that the Commission, the Parliament, the Court of Justice and indeed all the institutions have shown support for this issue. This is likely to continue throughout the life of the next Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I recently met President Saakashvili and I hope to be able to visit the countries of the Caucasus as well, if possible. Relations with the European Union are essential for this area to develop towards a situation of security and democracy, which it vitally needs.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the cohesion strategy – the strategy prepared by Commissioner Barnier – it has actually been carried out by the whole Commission and is shared by the new Commissioner. This strategy has a very important aim, which is to create solidarity with the new countries without abandoning the regions in the old Member States that are still having problems adapting to the average European income. It is a complex yet harmonious strategy that we can achieve, of course, with the budgetary conditions we have proposed, which we hope will be adopted in the financial perspective for 2007-2013. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As Mr Prodi has already stated, it is to be expected that the Commissioners from the ten new Member States will also want to keep going through the next five years, but I fear that this has not really dawned on Members of this House. The turnout during the hearings was generally very low. The chairmen of the other committees share my view on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that in this connection, we need to draw the attention of the new Parliament to the fact that it should take the hearings in the autumn extremely seriously, also with regard to the ten Commissioners who are taking up office today. As first vice-chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like to give this piece of advice to the forthcoming Parliament. I myself would very much have liked to have returned to Parliament, but unfortunately, my party has not given me the opportunity to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I thank the new Commissioners who have come and who have already started work, and perhaps, on this day which has seen Parliament enlarged, I should like to single out one member of the Commission for special thanks: Mr Verheugen, who has managed this complex, wonderful process of enlargement.
