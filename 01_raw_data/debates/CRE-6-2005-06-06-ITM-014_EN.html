<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Herbert Bösch (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although this report relates specifically to the budget year 2003, it is not intended as a snapshot; rather, it seeks to analyse failings and their causes over a longer period of time, to understand trends and learn from them for the future. We in the Committee on Budgetary Control are not contemporary historians; what we want to do here in this House is to prepare documents and adopt reports that will ultimately help to improve the fight against fraud and to improve the situation for European taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this is of quite particular interest in the run up to a new financial period, a new Financial Perspective. I would also like to say to those taxpayers here today that we must clearly understand, to take only one example, that so long as we have policies like the payment of export refunds in agriculture, there will be fraud. It is an open invitation to fraud and we therefore need to put an end to these policies. We ought to think about this in connection with the forthcoming Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">The year 2003 saw a slight decline in reported irregularities and fraud compared with the previous year: EUR 922 million compared to 1.15 billion. The long-term average is around 1 billion, far too much, of course, to be ultimately acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking back over the years, we find a decline in reported irregularities in agriculture, with an almost equal rise in irregularities in the structural funds. One reason for this may be that the increased controls in agriculture are having a visible effect – often at the expense of small European farmers, and that, too, needs to be addressed here. On the other hand, it may be because the amount of structural fund payments has increased appreciably in the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">A second subject is recoveries – a truly timeless one, to judge by the European Court of Auditors’ latest report. I wonder what is the point of trying harder to prevent fraud if we have to wait decades for money that was wrongly paid out to be recovered. The Court of Auditors’ special report highlights the shocking scale of recoveries in agriculture. Between 1971 and 2004, EUR 3.1 billion of irregularities were reported in agriculture, only around one fifth of which were recovered. Some 70% of monies wrongly paid out have never found their way back to the EU budget. I believe there is reason enough for action here. The blame rests clearly with the Member States, and the European Parliament must make that clear. European money obviously ranks differently with the Member States than their own money.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point that is emphasised in this Parliamentary report on fraud is the question of combating cigarette smuggling. We learn that cigarette smuggling is causing us tremendous losses, that the Member States are not cooperating with the European Union as much as they ought and that the Member States, and their finance ministers in particular, are still clinging to an incorrect and dangerous tax policy, always increasing tobacco duties when they need to plug a gap in national tax revenues. That is an invitation to organised crime and we are all – Member States and the European budget – the losers. It will be up to us as the European Union to develop appropriate strategies to prevent it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report concentrates on the previous year. For me this has been a period of familiarisation with OLAF and the development of the European anti-fraud policy for the coming years. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bösch, for his constructive work. As I have repeatedly stated, I believe that OLAF also requires a stable and secure environment for its development.</p>
<p class="contents">Next I will address some of the issues that I would like to examine in greater detail.</p>
<p class="contents">First, in connection with the returning of payments, I welcome the responsibility of the Member States in this matter, as emphasised in the conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is grateful for comments concerning the work of the joint working group formed between OLAF and the Directorate General for Agriculture in connection with cases of the returning of funds connected with the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, where Member States have made an application before 1999 concerning possible fraud or irregularities.</p>
<p class="contents">The report notes the cooperations agreements concluded between Philip Morris International and the Swiss Confederation as successful examples. Both have been visible and tangible results in the struggle against fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful for complimentary comments and the support of the rapporteur in dealing with these cases.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the agreements concluded between Philip Morris and the Swiss Confederation, I would like to emphasise the innovative nature of these agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission finds that all of the other Member States could accede to the agreement. We hope that they will join Austria, Ireland, Malta and Poland, which have recently acceded.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that the agreement concluded with Phillip Morris will serve as an example for the conclusion of similar agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of the upcoming hearing of OLAF in Parliament, the Commission and Parliament await the Court of Auditors’ report concerning the results of the management audit performed at OLAF. The hearing will offer the possibility for serious discussions of several matters raised in the report. This primarily concerns comments about the institutional organisation of OLAF and its complicated role in communicating with Member States’ corresponding organs and European Union institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">At the hearing, which will take place in Parliament at the beginning of July, we will have the opportunity to examine the structure and organisation of OLAF in detail. I am grateful to you for organising the hearing, and I hope that the upcoming hearing will help us to find the best solutions for the development of OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will attempt to do all in its power to ensure that the implementation of the conclusions of both this and previous reports correspond to the wishes of Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Combating fraud must be considered a national and Community priority, not only of an economic but also of a cultural nature. It is a question of a general culture, over and above the question of unfair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">In this direction, policy-making and the rules for applying policy are of paramount importance. One of the financial sectors which is in the limelight is the agricultural sector. It is a complex, multidimensional sector with dispersed social characteristics. The mid-term review of the CAP and the simplification promised are a positive starting point for the application of effective control and transparent management systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the same framework, the recent agreement on a new financing regime for the CAP which, as you mentioned earlier, has already been decided by the Council of Ministers for Agriculture, appears to serve the same objectives of the simplification of procedures and the efficacy of the support provided. The application of new systems for managing the common market organisations depends on an additional effort by the Member States, who must always keep a more beneficial ratio between costs and anticipated benefits in mind. The simplification of the payment and control mechanisms must be promoted, so that there is a clear division between irregularity and fraud, especially in a complex sector such as agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the main responsibility lies with the Community institutions. Within the framework of their competences, they should act and cooperate for the benefit of the Union. The citizens' expectations are that we should have correct management of the resources of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his integrated proposal on the question of combating fraud and protecting the interests of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think, however, that it would not be right if we did not acknowledge the useful work being done in the fight against fraud, even, for example, in the new Member States where substantial progress on this matter has been noted by the national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to welcome the useful work being done by OLAF, which is instrumental in this fight, and it is good to note that, at last, we are reaping the harvest of the investment we made by establishing OLAF. I am very much afraid, however, that there are still many who are trying to hinder the work of this office. OLAF was set up under the auspices of the three institutions. There is no reason, however, why it should not evolve into a completely independent office. Indeed, if we want OLAF to be more effective, we need to allow it to work independently. To be effective, OLAF needs less interference and less political pressure when it comes both to the appointments made to it and to the investigations it conducts.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to remind the House that, in speaking about fighting fraud, we are referring not only to protecting the financial interests of the European Union or national public finances. More than anything else, we are also talking about people’s interests as tax payers who want to see the tax burden shouldered fairly and not increased on account of those who evade taxes through smuggling or by abusing European Union funds. At a time when Europe is going through a difficult period where public opinion is concerned, we must make great efforts to be more effective in the fight against fraud. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead, on behalf of Hungary, as a new Member State, and all the new Member States, I would like to emphasise the concrete significance for us, both in theoretical and practical terms, of protecting the European Union’s financial interests and fighting fraud. We, too, participate in the expenditure of EU budgetary resources by Member States; the body responsible for ensuring the lawful and efficient use of EU funds is currently being developed and consolidated. We, too, are participating in this process in a concrete way and we support its efforts to protect the EU’s financial interests and to fight fraud and corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, as a general matter of principle, the kind of example the new Member States and institutions have before them is not merely a minor issue for us. In the course of the accession negotiations, when we were preparing for membership of the European Union, particular attention was given to modernising the public administration and combating corruption. Upon accession, our situation was deemed acceptable, although it was stressed that work still needed to be done to whiten our economy and rid our public administration of corruption. Now, one year on from our accession to full membership of the EU, it is very important that, on the basis of this concrete report, the public administration and public opinion should get a sense of the level of attention given by the EU to protecting its financial interests and fighting fraud and corruption, so that this will serve as a reminder to us and a pointer for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a Dutchman, I do, of course, still have the outcome of the referendum on my mind. What general conclusion can be drawn from it? Here in Brussels or in Strasbourg, a Moloch of rules is coming into being – rules that are completely unintelligible, utterly incomprehensible, and with which we do not want to be associated in any way. When we talk about the fight against fraud, all we can do is to tighten the rules. That is the problem with this subject. How can we avoid lapsing into excessive regulation while fighting fraud effectively? That is, I think, the challenge for this Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">One of this report’s conclusions is that the number of isolated cases of fraud and irregularities in structural funds is going up. I come across more and more organisations that prefer not to use those structural funds because they are far too complex to use. You need all kinds of agencies to complete the forms. This is again an example of an inconsistency. How can the Commission solve this? Although cigarette smuggling has been an issue for a very long time, we are making progress on all kinds of fronts. When I read the report, I was reminded of the first, temporary, committee on the prevention of fraud in transit, on which I sat, and which made a whole host of recommendations, including equipping all customs offices with computers to enable information to be passed on swiftly. That report has never, as far as I am aware, been followed up. Has the Commission done anything with it? Does the Commission intend to revisit it, to inform Parliament what subsequent action has been taken, because it contained many interesting recommendations?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there will not be a European public prosecutor for the time being. This is an old idea. I belong to the group of people who regret this. Another recommendation in the report of the temporary enquiry committee was to organise as much as possible the exchange of customs officers from the different Member States with a view to them learning from each other. What is the Commission’s current position on this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are two points of particular interest to which I should like to draw your attention this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">The first one is the responsibility of the Member States, which, let us not forget, manage 80% of all European aid, which gives us every right to ask more commitment of them, meaning, above all, extra efforts in reporting possible irregularities and cases of fraud. It also means reinforcing systems for monitoring and managing the structural funds. We have a long way to go in this respect. It also means that extra efforts have to be made in the area of reimbursement of funds paid either in excess or in error, which amount to the tidy sum of EUR 3 billion. In his speech, Mr Bösch made a point of explaining how this is possible, and Member States have to be galvanised into action, for they have not taken any responsibility to date. It is in this respect disappointing that the Member States where the most significant irregularities are reported are also the very Member States with the lowest reimbursement rates.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to cigarette fraud, as Mr Mulder pointed out, Parliament is a driving force in addressing this issue, which, indeed, formed an important part of the enquiry committee on transit fraud. Every container that disappears represents a value of EUR 1.5 million of income of the Member States and the EU, in other words the taxpayer. Next Wednesday, we will be questioning the Council and the Commission about the agreement that was concluded with tobacco giant Philip Morris who, for the next 12 years, will be paying USD 1.25 billion into an EU account. I congratulate the Commission and OLAF, the anti-fraud office, on the exemplary way they have worked together to bring this about. We need more agreements of this kind with other tobacco giants.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Mulder pointed out, the past referenda taught us that people have doubts about the European Union. Issues like these, including the Philip Morris issue, demonstrate at any rate that if Parliament, the Council and the Commission join forces, organised crime and mafia networks, which are, in fact, also used for other products like drugs, can certainly be tackled adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if you, Mr Bösch, say that we should abolish export subsidies and for the reason that it is a scheme that is very susceptible to fraud, then you will know that you can rely on me as an ally. We should indeed put the issue of export subsidies on the political agenda and keep it there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU is rightly viewed as a project ever more driven by an elite. A political elite with no genuine mandate from the people rides roughshod over the public and their national institutions in ever more areas of political life. In Sweden, a scientific investigation is carried out each year into the population’s confidence in about twenty different institutions. The Commission and this House – the European Parliament – are at the bottom of the list.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many politically committed people such as ourselves who wish to rescue the European integration project from the attempts to create a European superstate. We wish to make it once again a project of cooperation between independent countries of equal value which trust one another and to limit it to areas such as the internal market and cross-border environmental problems. The attempts to push the EU towards being a United States of Europe without popular support now threatens the survival of the integration project.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not only the attempts by the political elite to push ahead with the creation of a supranational EU against the will of the people that undermines the legitimacy of the EU. It is generally apparent that the European peoples associate the EU with top-down government, bureaucracy and corruption. In this very debate in the House, it is, moreover, corruption and fraud with which we are dealing.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish greatly to commend Mr Bösch for his report. It was painstakingly prepared and contains sound proposals that I support wholeheartedly. At the same time, our work in the Committee on Budgetary Control shows how difficult it is to get on top of fraud. There is some basic systemic error we are not getting at. Money disappears year in and year out via agricultural policy and regional policy. There is barely any clear sign of improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Those officials who reveal scandals in the EU bureaucracy are routinely frozen out, dismissed or given early retirement. EU history is littered with the corpses of all these whistleblowers. A number of scandals are revealed in other ways but, normally, there is never any legal process. This cannot be allowed to continue, and it is now Commissioner Kallas’s responsibility to ensure that this development does not continue into the future and undermine the little confidence in the EU that the EU’s population still has left. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Camre, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the UEN Group.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, I am also able to give my full support to Mr Bösch’s report, which is both constructive and perceptive. Mr Bösch pointed out that we still have too much fraud, and that is a view I can only endorse. I think there may be said to be two problems. The way Mr Bösch expressed this was to say that EU money has a different value in the Member States than the Member States’ own money.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a problem that the former President of the Court of Auditors, Professor Friedmann, addressed years ago. The way he put it was to say that we cannot continue to provide aid in this form. Instead, we must give countries cheap loans, as in that way they will have to pay the money back and be careful about what they use it for. The second problem is that EU legislation and administration is still not good enough. There are still too many cases in which the money goes into the wrong pockets or in which we do not get value for money. I was talking recently with a Danish expert who works for a private firm and for the EU in the former Yugoslavia, and he reported that the aid provided by the World Bank, the EBRD and the EIB is monitored quite differently. In contrast, the EU lets things slide. When the money is used, all is well. This is something we need to have looked into so that we are as proficient as the World Bank and the other big banks in ensuring that the money is used correctly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the time, I had an equally high opinion of both OLAF and our rapporteur, Mr Bösch. Since then, both the voters and I have had to learn that neither of them are that good. OLAF is the private army of the powers in Brussels. Someone denounced <span class="italic">Stern</span> reporter Hans-Martin Tillack, claiming he had paid money for confidential documents from inside the Commission. <span class="italic">Stern</span> used the documents to publish a report about fraud in Brussels. Every word of the article was true. That was not the point, however. Tillack still has not got the confiscated documents back.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not unusual for journalists to work with confidential official information. Such information was also used in this report. Everyone who works on a newspaper knows that it is almost good form for people who are exposed to claim that money was paid for confidential documents. OLAF also asked the public prosecutors in Hamburg, where <span class="italic">Stern</span> is published, for help; they refused. No judge was found who was prepared to do his duty. These EU investigators have been gradually expanding their powers for years now. No one can stand in OLAF chief Heinz-Hermann Brüner’s way. That is what European law now says, and the thoroughness with which Brussels always sorts everything out means that the Council has always immediately adjusted criminal law accordingly. Now even fewer people in Europe are safe from Franz-Hermann Brüner! Uncovering Mr Bösch’s part in all this will have to wait for another time.

<p class="contents">On the eve of our vote, I would like to speak about the way in which the work of OLAF has been judged within the Bösch report. I felt that it was my responsibility to defend this fledgling European anti-fraud office, which up to now has never received any criticism from any judicial body, whether European or national. It is an organisation that has been the subject, however, of ruthless campaigns of slander and destabilisation, through worrying indirect attacks, in which even certain elements of this House are not uninvolved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with great regret that I am forced to state that Mr Bösch’s report also appears to be inspired by unjust, exploitative and one-sided attitudes with regard to OLAF. I believe, in particular, that it was premature and inappropriate to include the reference to a special report by the European Ombudsman against OLAF, which can only have been published in its final form with remarkably perfect timing. In addition, this reference, which I consider to be unacceptable political meddling in a delicate ongoing investigation into suspected corruption, has been brought back to the attention of Parliament by means of an oral amendment, which would seek to ignore, however, two verdicts of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice in favour of OLAF, which are by far more authoritative.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, let us leave it to the judicial bodies to pronounce on the investigations, and let us all ensure that OLAF never becomes, as some would wish, the Trojan horse of political battles and one-sided interests. For my part, I will continue to fight and to ensure that OLAF is forever an effective and impartial instrument, acting in defence of the legality and the financial interests of the European Union. I am convinced that Parliament will also become the spokesperson for such a battle. The crisis that Europe is going through today in the eyes of the citizens calls on us all to behave with the utmost responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such respect is essential for a body of democratic control such as ours.

Several speakers touched upon the subject of OLAF. As I said, and as you all know, in July we will have a broad discussion about the status of OLAF and the legal environment surrounding it. I hope we can settle some of the outstanding questions during the hearings. My desire, and that of the Commission, is to calm the turbulence surrounding OLAF, to develop a reliable, efficient organisation, where it is possible to follow a case from start to finish and deal with it in a reasonable timescale, following all necessary procedures and without intervening in matters of substance. We must create an institution that is a beacon of trust and which helps us to dispel the shadow of suspicion, which is everywhere in the European institutions, not only concerning OLAF, but all issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Bösch and other speakers that we have an extensive range of rules and programmes that may give rise to the possibility of fraud, but also offer great scope for mismanagement and weak control. No-one fully understands the origins of these programmes, rules and subsidies. Consequently, I ask Members of Parliament to support all the efforts we are now making to simplify the rules and proposals so as to make the financial system more transparent, simpler, visible and easier to follow and control. This is a major question. The Commission and Parliament have made proposals, but we need more concrete proposals. Sometimes, someone suggests that a regulation or subsidy should be abolished because of the damage it is causing. Then someone else will say that it is good enough, that we cannot change anything, that there are certain political purposes and reasons behind it, so we try instead to simplify it, with the result that little is finally achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to hear that there is a clear understanding about the responsibility of Member States in all these matters. We are preparing certain proposals to strengthen our single audit model as part of the integrated control framework. I hope that I can soon inform Members of Parliament of our proposals. So far the response to these proposals has been very positive in several Member States, but not in all. The sharing of responsibility between the Commission and Member States is crucial.</p>

The Commission has been very much in favour of the idea of a public prosecutor, but many Member States have not been very positive on this issue. The Commission did not include it in its working programme, because it saw clearly that it would meet fierce resistance from certain Member States. It was included in the ‘Hague programme’, which increases judicial cooperation between Member States. As far as I know, however, it is being withdrawn from that programme. We deeply regret this and will try to find other ways to increase cooperation between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues raised by Mr Fazakas clearly show how the lack of a proper cooperation mechanism makes it difficult to achieve effective results. In reply to his question, of course we will provide a report up to October 2005. Yet this is an issue where we can clearly see that one Member State initially made intensive efforts, with very good cooperation with OLAF, and then the case was divided up among the Member States where these operations occurred. Judiciaries in the different Member States examined these issues in very different ways, giving priority to different aspects. Therefore, some kind of model for cooperation would be very useful.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Lundgren pointed out, fighting fraud is a very systemic question. The Commission wishes to develop a systemic response to possible fiscal mismanagement. We can never avoid bad things, but the question, in a democratic society, is how we handle such cases and how we develop a systemic response capable of dealing with all possible nasty surprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
