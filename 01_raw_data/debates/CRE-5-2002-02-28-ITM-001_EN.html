<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pack (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">Rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first thing that must be said is that Socrates is a success story. Education was successful under Erasmus, but I think that, embedded in the Socrates programme, it has fared even better. That is one positive finding in this evaluation of the second stage of the European Union programme on general education. Socrates takes account of the concept of lifelong learning and supports mobility at all stages of learning, of students and teachers alike. To put it one way, Socrates is there for us from the cradle to the grave.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has taken precautions and measures, one step at a time, to improve the content of the programme. I welcome ongoing efforts to speed up procedures and cut red tape. Red tape is inevitable in a government programme at any level, but red tape should not be an obstacle to this sort of education programme and should not obstruct its objectives. The Commission has taken account of this premise on numerous counts. I shall come shortly to the areas in which it has not.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur on both the introduction of the first phase and the implementation of the current second stage of the Socrates programme, I am satisfied how well it has developed. The figures for the first half of the programme speak for themselves. In 31 countries – that is, the 15 Member States, the candidate countries and the members of the European Economic Area – 2 000 universities, 40 000 university lecturers and more than 460 000 students took part in further education exchanges under Erasmus alone. Comenius, the section for schools, funded 15 000 schools with over 2 million pupils. I think we really are reaching our citizens here and I think it really is worth our while to continue and, if possible, build up this programme even more.</p>
<p class="contents">This being so, the increase in the multiannual budget from the original figure of EUR 850 million to a current EUR 933 million – achieved by Parliament during all-night sittings – was the right thing to do. But, to be honest, it is not enough. If new candidate countries join in 2004 – the programme runs until 2007 – then this programme needs to be built up. And if the Council of Ministers refuses to do so, then all I can say is that its declarations at the summits are nothing more than hot air and I think the Commissioner should point out as much to the ministers at forthcoming Council meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I also have a few criticisms to make. Several initiatives still have room for improvement when it comes to the nitty-gritty. First, the Commission should improve and speed up cooperation with national agencies even more. Centralisation has huge advantages but requires effective information management. The Symmetry system developed by the Commission will clearly facilitate the flow of information to and from the national agencies here. But at the same time, we can – and it makes sense to – link up with the Youth and Leonardo da Vinci programmes. Symmetry therefore needs to be introduced as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would point out that an overwhelming number of national agencies gave me to understand that the Commission is helpful at all stages. But the time taken to prepare new contracts has resulted in disgraceful delays in payments, especially under Comenius. Such obstacles must be removed because hold-ups and delays are a source of frustration to committed participants. Especially in schools, where a great deal of extra effort goes into setting up projects. I know of schools where the teachers running the project are smiled upon by their colleagues. They do it in their spare time and do not get paid a penny more.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I also expect something to be done about creating joint actions, especially with the other programmes I mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I also call on the Commission to adopt the premise: the smaller the sum, the less red tape. I think we could follow the example set by the Commission with the partnership agreements, that is, to deal with applications under 20 000 differently, without the mound of paperwork needed for larger sums. I also think that the cofinancing requirement should be dropped below EUR 20 000.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental contribution of Socrates to a European education area has been applauded repeatedly and is beyond question. We should not forget that Socrates is the heartbeat of a European society of knowledge and learning and what worries me is that transnational, that is, intergovernmental cooperation on education might displace the Community approach. However, the Bologna and Prague declarations were in favour of these supposedly faster methods. We must not forget that the means and ends of the so-called open method of cooperation with the Member States on education would have been more or less unthinkable without the positive experience gained from Socrates. To sacrifice Community education objectives to short-term transnational cooperation would be an unspeakable step backwards.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, we need to bear two further points in mind. First, Socrates is an important, decisive European programme, because it educates people in Europe and is the European answer to the education prospects of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the open method of intergovernmental cooperation must not be allowed to undermine the importance of the Community approach.</p>

<p class="contents">That is why it is vital for Parliament to take the Council and Commission to task during these procedures and, of course, to make its own contribution. I should therefore like to address two points on which I would be grateful for the backing of other committees, especially the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point is the question of decentralisation. It has proven its worth, but the national agencies have a counterpart in Brussels; in future, this role will be filled by the executive agencies. We will need to work with these executive agencies as well as we have worked, thankfully, with the national agencies. So I urge the Commission and the Committee on Budgetary Control to create the conditions for such cooperation during consultations concerning these executive agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is the question of financial control. We also need the support of the Committee on Budgetary Control if we really are to achieve the objective of awarding small sums in aid without incurring high administrative costs. The Commission should be given the necessary support here through Parliament in general and the Committee on Budgetary Control in particular.</p>

I should just like to point out that around 40% of the 376 million people living in the European Union are under 30 years old, making them one of the biggest target groups of the Socrates programme, as well as Grundtvig, Minerva, Media Plus and other such programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">So the programme has the chance to make its mark over coming years by promoting mobility, intercultural education and educational diversity. It is on the right track for improvement, as we can see from the second stage and as we have just heard. But the weaknesses in the system also need to be pointed out. They include delays in preparing contracts between the Commission and the national agencies, which keep addressing the problems and which keep being hampered during implementation by delays. The same applies to delays in paying out assistance, because when only small sums are involved, the beneficiaries need to receive them as quickly as possible and the pre-financing stage needs to be shortened because, in addition to doing the work, they generally have to pre-finance the projects as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Pack is also quite right to call for a so-called fast-track procedure to speed up the programme and do away with cumbersome applications and cumbersome formalities for amounts under EUR 20 000. We should also consider if we really need the extra burden of cofinancing when only small amounts are involved.</p>
<p class="contents">We must force cooperation with other Community programmes because we want programmes to run in parallel rather than in series, so that we can make use of available resources. The Commission's follow-up reports should also take account of the participants' follow-up reports. Because what is important to us is the outcome of these programmes. What impact do they have, for example, on teacher training? What positive experiences do pupils or students take away with them? All this is important if we are to be able to pursue or refine the programme. I think we have the right to expect results.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the financing, we fought hard to set it on its feet. I agree with Mrs Pack; if we enlarge in 2004, we must increase the funding, otherwise this programme will be doomed to failure.</p>

We have heard all the figures and it is impressive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socrates I Programme, which ran from 1995 until 1999, was very successful, yet also met with the necessary criticism. The students and teachers involved admitted wholeheartedly that the experience gathered had been very useful and that the programme had made a practical contribution towards European citizenship. However, the criticism mainly centred around the procedures being overly bureaucratic and insufficiently transparent, around payments being long overdue and around too little being done with the results.</p>
<p class="contents">So how are things being done this time round? The Socrates II Programme, that runs until 2006, has now been underway for more than 18 months, and although an interim evaluation report has not yet been published, there are already indications that a great deal has improved. The relationship between the Commission and the national bureaux appears to have become considerably more flexible, and the administrative procedures have been simplified in places. Nevertheless, I should like to make some observations. The procedures, certainly those for the smaller projects, still put potential participants off on account of their laboriousness. And according to my sources, contracts are sent out late on a regular basis, and payments are overdue. This is unacceptable to my group. As a result of this, projects run into financial difficulty, and that certainly does nothing to promote the EU’s credibility. Furthermore, cooperation with other European programmes still appears to be inadequate, which is also a significant shortcoming.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socrates Programme must be managed efficiently, and this also includes coordination with other European programmes. I should therefore like to urge the Commission to devote special attention to these points. The Socrates Programme is too valuable an instrument for promoting the mobility of pupils, students and teachers to be allowed to go under due to administrative and financial stumbling blocks. It is an excellent way of promoting knowledge of other European languages and cultures in order to achieve a harmonious Europe, which is something we all want.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, this programme should be given a freer rein, financially too, but, Commissioner, I am jumping the gun a little bit, given the position of my own Finance Minister. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have undoubtedly seen increased cooperation in the field of European education combined with a new commitment to life-long learning and that is heartening.</p>
<p class="contents">In Wales, my own nation, and indeed the whole of the UK, there is a problem in encouraging the acquisition of language skills across the board. ERASMUS has gone a long way to improving this and I would like to see an increase in the figure of 460 000 participating students a year.</p>
<p class="contents">Such exchanges make a distinct commitment to better linguistic skills, but also promote cultural cooperation. The Commission must continue to do its utmost to ensure that the application procedure is more user-friendly and I agree with comments by other speakers that at the moment the administrative side of the programme makes it difficult for participants. There has been a real administrative burden on the applicants throughout this programme, particularly under the COMENIUS scheme which needs to be addressed urgently.</p>
<p class="contents">Regardless of how successful this programme is, it must always be as open as possible for those wishing to participate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a tool for moulding young people and imposing a certain educational model. The basic problem of education, by which I mean a general curriculum for young people, falls outside the scope of the programme. On the contrary, its purpose is to manipulate pupils, students and teachers in order to establish the European one-way system and make it easier to subjugate young people to the policy of the European Union, to the rules of the market economy and to so-called new working conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European education area is a front for converging education systems by tailoring them to the requirements of big business and the last thing that does is to improve education overall. Even educational exchanges and the system for providing lessons operate as a lever in this direction. The first thing we need to do, if we really want to improve education systems, is to stop the European Union from interfering. In the final analysis, this is a matter for the grass-roots movement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can certainly say that the main objective of developing European citizenship and, in particular, of improving the quality of the educational systems, has been fully achieved. Evidence of this are the considerable benefits derived from the programme in terms of increased cultural awareness and the overcoming of cultural prejudice and stereotypical concepts and, following on from this, the language skills acquired by those receiving Socrates grants. Despite that, the analysis revealed a number of weak points such as the integration of the Socrates programme with the Comenius, Lingua and Leonardo da Vinci programmes, which will require considerable adjustment and greater coordination and consolidation.</p>
<p class="contents">Something which I feel demands a great deal of reflection is the financial support given to the successful applicants for Socrates grants: the appropriation is insufficient to support the students because of a quantitative grant distribution requirement that has resulted in the available sums being too small. Indeed, the situations in the Member States differ widely in the face of a global reduction in the size of the grants allocated to each student, while the parental contribution is tending to increase. As the report has already pointed out, this trend clearly generates the danger of growing inequalities between students. In this regard, the basic resources provided need to be sufficient to enable students to be independent and live without relying heavily on support from their families, considering that study grants should not be differentiated according to the country of residence of the students or the country which they visit under the project. This financial discrimination would make the programme available only to a group of individuals who can count on parental support.</p>
<p class="contents">A further highly negative aspect of the allocation of the grants is the bureaucratic financing procedure, which is currently seriously behind schedule. This must of necessity be rectified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have some doubts about that and I really wonder whether this is our priority in Europe. Certainly not if you look at what we spend on it. In Europe we spend EUR 2.5 billion each year on olives, we spent less than EUR 2 billion over six years on the Socrates Programme. The rapporteur even had to fight to get a separate debate on education on our agenda this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">For the single market to flourish and for Europe to flourish we need an educated and mobile workforce, confident about crossing national boundaries. The Socrates Programme is important for that and so making it more efficient as Ms Pack's report urges is really very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Linguistic skills are certainly important for labour mobility. We all know that those students who participate in the Socrates Programme benefit tremendously from it; sadly, not enough students do. For students from my own country there is always an imbalance between the number of Continental students wanting to go to the United Kingdom and the very limited number of British students prepared are willing to go to Continental countries. What is the reason for that? It is very clear – the lack of linguistic skills among students in Britain. We must send a message to the British Government that they should reverse their appalling decision of the last few weeks to allow secondary students in Britain not to learn any foreign language at all. That is certainly not the way to ensure that Europe will flourish or that Britain will get the best benefits from its membership of the European Union.</p>

We have also had some experience of it in Finland, which became involved in the programme while EU membership was still being negotiated. We on the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport hope that the current applicant countries will take full advantage of the opportunities the programme offers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Centre for International Mobility, which administers the programme in Finland, recently published a study on the experiences of foreign exchange students. We are very pleased that Finland is of interest as a destination. Every year we receive more than 3 000 foreign students. As the report may have universal applicability I will summarise it briefly. The respondents stressed the importance of study in a foreign country, above all with regard to personal and social growth. The courses of study were also reasonably successful. The exchange students completed an average of thirty-three study weeks during the academic year. Finland earned special praise for the excellent facilities in its universities and colleges, particularly computers and libraries, as well as for the study guidance provided and student halls of residence.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of the mobility of the workforce it is interesting that the students said they were now more willing to consider a possible career in Finland. This was especially true of students from Central Europe: southern Europeans were not very interested in working in a Nordic country. The report under discussion pays particular attention to the processing of applications and the flow of payments. Although there have been improvements in these areas problems still remain. The report states that unwarranted delays in the payment of grants hamper the implementation of programmes and bring Community institutions into disrepute.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this, I would, if I may, draw everyone’s attention to Parliament’s role as a provider of guidelines. While, on the one hand, we insist on greater efficiency and flexibility, we might, on the other hand, be increasing bureaucracy and making it take longer to deal with matters. For example, the Commission used to make a lump-sum payment to the Technical Assistance Office to cover payment of grants. Now it has to fill out as many as one thousand eight hundred separate payment orders. This obviously has an impact on the speed of the process. Furthermore, the implementation of the programmes in the Member States must be subjected to assessment by an external auditor. Therefore, a small rural university in Finland, for example, has to embark on a costly procedure for the sake, let us say, of two minor projects, even though, under our laws, the State Audit Office will perform the same task in any case. To prevent malpractice and error we should establish good administrative practice and not just devise ever more complicated control systems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We and those responsible, all deserve a pat on the back for this marvellous programme. Allow me to start with what has become a rather lovely tradition, that is, by scattering roses over the rapporteur; well done, Doris!</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the criticisms and I shall not enumerate them again; perhaps I should but one minute does not give me enough time. What is my brief here? Obviously to canvass for this marvellous programme. It is not a glossy brochure, it is grass-roots policy in the flesh, it is a European answer to numerous questions. But the answers which Socrates gives are not quite enough. Socrates does not resolve any fundamental problems. Socrates helps, it airs political questions and brings them to the public's attention, but does not absolve the Member States of responsibility. I would gladly hear more from our Member States on this, not just on Socrates, but on their responsibility, on what education means for Europe. I would be glad to engage in a public debate on a European area of education with the people in charge of education.</p>
<p class="contents">Do you know what we have achieved with Socrates, quite apart from the tangible results? The names of old Europeans are being used: Comenius, Erasmus, Grundtvig – these old names trip off the lips of young people as easily as the words to a rap song. We really have achieved what we set out to do. Doris Pack said that Socrates is there for us from the cradle to the grave. I would therefore like to see us start a bit earlier, not at school age, but with infants. Because, as everyone has said, learning foreign languages is so incredibly important, it is of immense importance to all of us and we know that it starts in the nursery. Perhaps our next step should be in the direction of the kindergarten.</p>

We have also heard a great many favourable comments from the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, who should not detract from her report by turning the House into a sort of football field and giving yellow cards to speakers with whom she disagrees. I think that every view<span class="bold"> </span>expressed here is useful on an issue as tricky as education in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out, first, the importance of increasing Community funding and participation, and secondly, the need to streamline the programme and heed the views of those who take part in it. With Erasmus in particular, there is a risk, while it is good to give children a chance to study abroad, of disrupting undergraduate syllabuses. When asked, many of the children who have taken part will say, it was a good experience but there are a lot of unanswered questions in undergraduate education overall.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to point out that this programme is by its very nature a programme of freedom, freedom of movement of students and freedom of movement of ideas and knowledge. We need to see a large question mark here, because it also extends to countries outside the European Union, especially Turkey; a large question mark because there are tens of thousands of children and young people, like the children in schools who cannot study in their mother tongue, Kurdish. We must not forget this, we must not turn a blind eye, we need to make this programme a programme of overall freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament has proved a committed partner throughout this common enterprise of establishing educational programmes and setting the Europe of education on track. Its support has been invaluable. We would not be where we are now if Parliament had not lent a hand. Thank you all again.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Pack, I should also like to thank you and the other Members who have taken the floor today for your positive assessment of the youth programmes. They exemplify the kind of Europe we are aspiring to, a Europe where authority is not exercised from the top down but from the bottom up. This is actually starting to happen. Hundreds of thousands of young people have been able to study in another country. Hundreds of thousands of teaching groups are working with teaching groups in another country, and hundreds of thousands of teachers are on the road. That is great! I fully agree with those who believe that, apart from occasional minor problems, this splendid programme is working very well and should be developed further. I also agree with those who maintain that there are financial risks involved, and that the grants are too small. I have to tell you that I often meet Erasmus students. I have not yet come across a single unhappy one. They all say that given a second chance, they would do it all again. However, they also tell me that the grants are too small. We are aware of this and very much hope that the Finance Ministers will increase the resources available, so we can pass the increase on to students. It would then be possible to bridge the gap between social classes able to pay for travel and those unable to do so. I am entirely on your side. Consequently I trust you will support me in the future, as we press for increased financial resources for these programmes, particularly in the context of enlargement of the Union. As the House must be aware, we are already working with potential new Member States to ensure they are fully integrated into our educational programmes. Nonetheless, costs are bound to increase dramatically once these states become part of the Union. Additional resources will therefore be required if the awards are not to become even smaller. We shall have to fight for these, and I am confident Parliament will be on my side.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to the issues that the speakers have raised.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament does recognise that improvements have taken place as regards monitoring and evaluation. We are currently implementing a programme to evaluate Socrates II, and the results will be used as a basis for the Commission’s proposals for new initiatives to replace Socrates. I can assure the Chairman that the committee will be kept abreast of research and its assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the issue of the relationship between the Commission and national agencies, that is, decentralisation. You will be aware that we have striven to put the links between the Commission and these agencies on a sound footing, and efforts to bring about an improvement are ongoing. All those involved have referred to administrative burdens. We have endeavoured to simplify the administration of the programme and make it more democratic, as you have also recognised. We have adjusted the Erasmus institutional contract to reduce by about 50% the number of contracts that beneficiaries have to sign. My services are also considering the feasibility of amending Socrates decisions, as Mrs Pack suggests. The aim is to avoid increasing the bureaucratic burden, particularly for schools involved in small projects. This will be achieved, Mrs Pack, with Parliament’s help of course. Once again, I appeal to Members to lend us a hand because progress is much faster once the House takes these issues to heart.</p>
<p class="contents">There is only one minor area where I am unable to respond positively. You have suggested doing away with cofinancing for small projects. I would very much like to, but integral financing would contravene the Community financial rules adopted recently and endorsed by Parliament. A radical reform of these rules would be required before going any further. Parliament would have to give an opinion as to whether it wished to go down that road.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the payment contract delays, things are now much better. We have not yet cleared the backlog, but the year 2001 will be an improvement on 2000, and 2002 will in turn be an improvement on 2001. The new procedures are now in place. We have brought committee meetings forward and simplified the legal base to finance the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say a few words on Symmetry. An effective data management system is urgently required and we are making progress, despite the problems experienced at the outset. Following a call to tender, a contractor was appointed in 2001. Symmetry will be developed in 2002 and 2003. Delivery is planned for August 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there are the Joint Actions. You are quite right, ladies and gentlemen, it is important to have plenty of these. 2001 was an introductory year involving a limited number of issues of common interest to Socrates, Leonardo and Youth. The 2002 call for proposals will take place in April and the topics chosen are social integration of target groups, active citizenship amongst the young, local guidance networks, formal and informal training. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you will appreciate that we are taking Parliament’s proposals very much to heart. This is not just to keep Members happy, but quite simply because the House is right. Parliament is quite properly inspired by its wish to improve the citizens’ Europe, a Europe whose young people are the cornerstone in the building of the new continent we are all engaged in constructing – a Europe where it is good to be alive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
