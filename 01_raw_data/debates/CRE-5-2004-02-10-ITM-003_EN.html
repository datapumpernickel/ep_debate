<p class="contents">Incomes are in fact the barometer of the viability of farms. Without sufficient incomes, farmers disappear and production moves away from the most fragile areas. But if farmers are eliminated and concentration accelerates, we risk moving away from the European model we advocate, which involves the presence of farmers on all territories. The analysis of incomes is therefore of obvious interest. The relevant findings for the period 1995 to 2002 are as follows. Firstly, the average agricultural income in the Europe of the 15 rose by 7% with large national variations, for example +32% in Portugal and –30% in the United Kingdom. Secondly, public support accounts for more than 50% of this figure, but its distribution is debatable. Twenty percent of farms receive 73% of aids for 59% of areas and 25% of employment. Thirdly, producer prices fell by 1.1% while consumer prices rose 11%. Fourthly, the slight improvement in this average income comes from the fact that the cake is shared between fewer and fewer farmers since the number of people working in this sector fell by 15.7% over the same period. We must therefore ask ourselves whether the phenomenon can be allowed to continue without jeopardising our European model of agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">This question is all the more serious because the application of multifunctionality is going to result in higher production costs even though public support is set to decline for farmers of the 15 Member States between now and 2013, chiefly because of the rise in Community support for agriculture in the ten new countries. The European Union cannot remain indifferent to this situation. We need to give some thought to the direction of future changes to the CAP to make it consistent with the two objectives of multifunctionality and competitiveness which we have set for farms.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, the market must tend to reward the act of agricultural production. As for public support, it must increasingly go to pay for the non-market services that agriculture performs for society.</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent CAP reform includes positive steps forward in this direction, especially with the conditionality and modulation of aids. With decoupling, though, the CAP is establishing historically acquired rights that will have the effect of preventing remuneration for multifunctionality for all farms on all territories. It is therefore absolutely essential to get away from these historical rights, something that will be possible gradually if modulation is substantially increased.</p>
<p class="contents">On the matter of market-generated income, I recommend restoring priority to pricing and market policy, taking the view that progress in product quality, necessary as it is, is only the passport giving access to those markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Several directions will therefore have to be opened up or reaffirmed so that the market can play its part without prices collapsing and taking incomes with them. I will quote them: ‘flexible, production-based regulation of supply; the introduction of production-based safety nets; Community encouragement of sectoral policies for a better distribution of added value; our imports should be subject to the same standards as those of the Union’.</p>
<p class="contents">From this report, Members will all understand that there is still a tremendous amount to be done if the CAP is to achieve its objectives. Our European agricultural model was legitimate in its conception. It must become so in reality again. That is why I regret the Commissioner’s absence from this debate all the more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Speaking personally, I want to thank him especially for his frank and constructive cooperation in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States are currently engaged in implementing as part of their national policies the Luxembourg Conclusions on reform of the common agricultural policy. Our starting point is that, in accordance with the Brussels Conclusions, the agricultural budget was capped. The funds available must from now on be shared out among farmers in the EU of 25 rather than only in the EU of 15, and moreover, must in future be more discriminatingly applied than was previously the case, so that funds from the first pillar – direct payments, in other words – are to be moved to the second pillar, to rural development. This is something that all of us in this House have always demanded.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Garot’s report represents an outstanding assessment of the situation in that it analyses, in the light of enlargement, the factors on which agricultural incomes are currently dependent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats takes the view that there are fundamental objectives to be achieved by means of the common agricultural policy. They are as follows: firstly, to guarantee a fair level of income for those who work in agriculture. Secondly, by stabilising incomes, it must maintain agricultural activity throughout the whole area of the European Union. It is for that reason that we believe, firstly, that the retention of the level of public subsidies for agriculture is justified, in particular to reward the multifunctional services it renders to society and to ensure that farmers remain present in all regions, as is provided for in the first pillar. Secondly, we believe there is justification for the Community Budget guaranteeing employment, especially in less-favoured rural areas, and for farms to be rewarded for adaptation to society’s new demands, which is what we understand by the second pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">In the hope of turning these principles into reality, we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have tabled, in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, a number of amendments, to which – as I mentioned at the start of my speech – we have been able to secure the rapporteur’s agreement. For example, our specific proposals include the introduction of a system of disaster payments, which is already the practice in other great agricultural nations. We specifically demand that a large proportion of the funds available remain, insofar as possible, in the hands of farmers. It necessarily follows that we are in favour of the norm laid down in the Luxembourg Conclusions – in other words, the single farm payment – being applied when they are implemented at national level. Our final demand is that no major distortions of competition within European agriculture should be allowed to result in the event of the exemption under Article 58 being chosen.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that we have to bear in mind that competitiveness and multifunctionality must, again and again, be subjected to scrutiny and assessed, and that due regard must be paid to development. Without an adequate income, no farmer will be able to perform his tasks in producing food and in caring for the Garden of Eden that we still – thank heaven! – have here in Europe, in a professional manner and in line with good practice. We must therefore take the funds available in the agriculture budget and apply them, in a Europe of 25 Member States, in such a way that the competitiveness of working farmers in the market is supported. We must never lose sight of the need to guarantee young farmers a start and to offer them good prospects. These, more than ever, are the challenges we must take up. The common agricultural policy adopted in June 2003 opens up interesting ways of doing this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Discussion of farmers’ incomes is long overdue; the fact is that they are far too low.</p>
<p class="contents">The various underlying causes I will illustrate by reference to the example of Germany. One of the most important is that farmers are still unable to command on the market the prices that they need for their products and which would be quite justified. The causes of this state of affairs can be traced back to the fierce competition between the six or seven food concerns that dominate the market, a turf war fought out to the detriment of farmers. These concerns see farmers as nothing more than suppliers of cheap raw materials. I might add that the same is true of many dairies.</p>
<p class="contents">To that can be added the fact that consumers, that is, most people, do not know anything about this and, indeed to some extent, do not want to. The fact is that high-quality food, for example that produced in accordance with high standards of protection for the environment and for animals, comes at a price; it is not to be had for free. Even the <span class="italic">Deutscher Bauernverband</span>, the German Farmers’ Union, which represents the interests of most German farmers, has had its hand in this, for – in my opinion – it has for far too long not merely blocked or delayed important reforms, but has positively prevented some of them. Its unending lamentations, which have been its stock-in-trade for decades, about how badly-off farmers have now virtually made the public deaf to farmers’ legitimate demands and needs. Let me add that many farmers tell me these things at events once the <span class="italic">Verband</span>’s functionaries have gone.</p>
<p class="contents">The reforms adopted over the past year are thus all the more important to farmers; they should have been adopted years ago. The decoupling of payments from production was long overdue. Here, in this House, we have done our bit; it is now for the Member States to properly implement these conclusions and to do away once and for all with the unfair treatment of different types of farming, such as, for example, dairy cattle and arable farming. Let me quote you some figures. Up to now, 20% of the farms with 59% of the land and 25% of the jobs have been getting 73% of the direct grants, and, let it be noted, relatively little was to be seen or heard of those who are now so loudly indignant about the injustice that is allegedly going to result from the agricultural reform.</p>
<p class="contents">We Social Democrats support compensatory payments for farmers because they have to be rewarded appropriately for the services that they perform in the general interest within a multifunctional system and which the prices paid do not cover. This must, however, be done in accordance with transparent, open, and comprehensible rules. None of us can evade the question of what high-quality foodstuffs are actually worth to us. For the engine in our cars we buy only the best and most expensive petrol, but when it comes to the body, which is our own engine, without which we cannot exist and which is meant to work for at least 100 years without spluttering, most of us are completely indifferent to what we put into it. All that matters is that there should be a lot of it and that it should be cheap. That is not on. Even though this may be wishful thinking at present, we do believe that it would be for the best if farmers were to be able to have a good living from the prices paid for their produce. That is what we Social Democrats are working for. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Garot is a committed politician on agricultural matters. He is well informed and takes a positive view of agriculture. I have to say that, as a Swede, I am rather envious. We could have done with a few Social Democrats of that kind in the Swedish Government. It would have been very useful for us.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to address a number of points I think are important. Mr Garot states that agriculture should be carried on throughout the whole area of the EU. That is very important to remember, especially when the parts of the EU concerned are those such as I myself come from, that is to say Sweden or Finland.</p>
<p class="contents">He also addresses another very important matter, namely the difference between cost development and price development. A discrepancy arises that can be resolved with the help of rationalisation, but not to an unlimited degree. It must be ensured that this discrepancy does not become too large. We have seen how it has increased in my own country following the latter’s accession to the EU. It is now far too large, and production is in decline.</p>
<p class="contents">We have defended the agricultural reform. That has been decided upon. It is not, however, good for it to be implemented at different speeds in different countries. This is important, something that is also pointed out in the report. When the agricultural reform is implemented at different speeds, there is a danger of making further changes to competitiveness or of creating an uneven playing field in the different countries where competitiveness is concerned. It is now a matter of extreme urgency to do as much as is humanly possible in terms of environmental aid and aid for rural development. As Mr Garot says in his report, there is a danger of this being undermined if the Member States are to cofinance it. This is an area I am concerned about.</p>
<p class="contents">I must, however, address a number of aspects of this report that I do not think are as good. It is rather anti-reform, if I may say so. The desire is to keep as many people as possible in agriculture. I do not believe that this is realistic in the long term. I do not believe it is realistic to retain far-reaching market regulation or prices set by politicians, nor to have a regulated supply of the type we have involving quotas. We must seek to reduce border protection in order to cope with world trade. Now that we are carrying out this disengagement, it would have been better if we could have done it completely from the beginning and, in fact, throughout the EU in the one go. As a result of these considerations, I and many others in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will unfortunately abstain from voting. We cannot vote in favour of this report but, in view of all the plus points I mentioned at the beginning, we cannot vote against it, either. We shall no doubt abstain from voting in the final vote, because it is only a single vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If I am right in my understanding of what the rapporteur said, then it is only if that is the case that one can talk of there being such a thing as social European Union. The report rightly points out that yields vary widely across the European Union, even though Europe’s climate and other natural conditions are favourable to almost all crops.</p>
<p class="contents">The principal causes of the changes in costs over recent years are well-known. My expectation of future reforms is that the Commission will take more account of their ability to influence the cost structure. I also expect openings to be created for more investments, and I hope that a greater diversity of programmes will result in simplification and clarity of vision.</p>
<p class="contents">As in other reports, reference is made to the fact that direct payments to farmers, being factored in as sources of income, cannot simply be cut out without the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs, and I believe, with regret, that there are those who want that to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">More and more people in Europe’s rural areas are doing more than one job, and so every euro that is not spent on structural planning and development in rural areas – I am talking in terms of billions – is always associated with the loss of income and jobs. This makes it important to assess whether the work and the way the European agricultural model is applied tend towards appropriate rewards for European farmers, and what is meant by that. About this, the rapporteur is rather reticent, the reason being that there is a lack of data. My expectation, though, is that, as the market organisation develops further, we will be able to answer the question of what an appropriate income for farmers actually is.</p>
<p class="contents">In Germany, farmers’ incomes have dropped dramatically, by 6.1% and 19.8% in the last two financial years. That amounts to an overall economic crash. This bleak state of affairs has come about for two reasons; one is flooding and drought, but – as has already been said in this debate – it has far more to do with the price war in food retailing, in which farmers are generally on the losing side.</p>
<p class="contents">How are the location of production, and hence employment and income, affected by the decoupling of payments and their being linked to environmental requirements – an attempt at riding two horses, in giving the market a greater role in determining farmers’ incomes while rewarding with public funds services that are no longer in demand? Will it ensure extensive agricultural land use? Far from it; it is far more to be feared that it will lead to the onset of predatory competition and that we will be facing structural changes that will leave local areas worse off. That is something I do not want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Decoupling has facilitated the removal of the twofold price distortions brought about by payments, which tended to keep prices down and thus gave customers the opportunity to get their hands on cheap raw materials, in that the linking of grants to production – which was itself unequally distributed – meant that between 75% and 80% of this State aid was claimed by between 20% and 25% of farms. Now, even though decoupling is in place – and it was the right step to take – it does not automatically follow that different power relations have come into being; rather, what matters is that prices should be actively negotiated. This is not just about the distributing chains, but also about the cooperatives, some of them managed by farmers, which pursue their price and market policies in decision-making bodies, and it is about better payments for raw materials – agricultural raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">You have also made it clear that we now have to talk about modulation and about different ways of distributing these funds. Modulation must link the practice of some large and rationalised farming enterprises receiving from the state a premium amounting to EUR 100 000 per worker, to the number of employees and also to the type of production. From this, quality criteria must be developed, in order that state funds do not contribute to the accumulation of assets and give the wrong stimuli to production, but instead, enable the continuation of rural production methods in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recent hearing on farm income must surely have alerted all of us to the challenges facing EU farmers. It is easy to understand their frustration as they see their purchasing power eroded and their general quality of life under attack on many fronts.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Garot succeeds in his report in focusing our minds on the basics of the common agricultural policy and what it is all about. We have a treaty basis for ensuring that farmers and their families are guaranteed a decent standard of living. We also have an obligation to maintain the European model of agriculture, which is based on family farm units and keeping a vibrant rural community.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who seek to undermine the common agricultural policy sometimes forget these basics. They forget that there is a socio-economic dimension to farming and that it is not just a business like any other sector. Mr Garot presents these facts very clearly. The fact that between 1995 and 2002 farm incomes in the European Union rose by an average of 7% highlights the very large disparities between countries, between crops and between producers. It also hides the fact that during the same period income levels have been maintained largely by a fall of 15.7% in the number of farms within the European Union. Here, surely, lies one of the most serious challenges facing the continuity of European agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Frequently farms have been able to revert to short-term measures such as foregoing necessary capital investment on farms. There has also been huge growth in part-time farming and off-farm employment. When we compare agricultural to industrial or service wages we can see that there is a continuing widening gap.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, this report highlights important challenges that we legislators and policy-makers have to face up to. It is now essential that agricultural policy should still be used to protect and improve the incomes of as many householders as possible within the European Union and to guarantee a secure future for our farmers and their families. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mathieu (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, this report is a good initiative and I congratulate its author. In fact, it brings us up to date on agricultural incomes just before the application of CAP reform and the enlargement of the European Union. It will therefore serve us as a reference document in a few years’ time, when, I hope, we shall be meeting together in this Assembly again to consider the consequences of the reform for our farmers’ incomes. Will the accession of ten new countries that are themselves highly agricultural and the alignment of European agricultural prices with world prices bring us a better future? I do not want to be a prophet of doom, but unfortunately I doubt it.</p>
<p class="contents">This report underlines some important facts, in particular the 7% increase in European agricultural incomes over seven years, which hides many disparities between regions and sectors and is rooted in a degradation of the European agricultural model, as the rapporteur pointed out in his address. In ten years, one quarter of Europe’s farmers have vanished, farms have become larger and production has intensified.</p>
<p class="contents">Some French small farmers have such low incomes that the French Government gives them access to the ‘integration minimum income’, a system of social support reserved for the most deprived. I come from the Vosges, a rural <span class="italic">département</span> not far from here. Between 1988 and 2000, the number of farms there fell by 40% and the number of dairy farms halved. At the same time, farm areas increased 65% and the number of cows per farm 30%. This concentration in agriculture is damaging to the European family agricultural model, as the Parliamentary report very clearly shows.</p>
<p class="contents">Decoupled aids are not a viable solution for the farmer. According to the Nantes INRA study, in 2008 partial decoupling could result in as much as a 32% drop in simulated income for an intensive dairy farmer because the decoupled aids will not compensate for the 20% fall in the price of milk envisaged for 2006-2008.</p>
<p class="contents">The drafting of this report gave an opportunity to consult a number of experts on the subject. They all underlined this intrinsic paradox of the latest common agricultural policy reform. How indeed can we think of pushing up costs through multifunctionality while at the same time wanting agricultural prices to fall by bringing European prices into line with world prices? What solution is there for farmers trapped between rising production costs and falling prices. No expert has been able to tell us that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the report explains a risk that is of particular concern to me, namely the eco-conditionality of aids for small farms, since their income is going to depend increasingly on aids, especially with decoupling. A small farmer who failed to comply with one of a very large number of directives, including the Loiseau directive, would have his aids, and therefore his income, cut off. The incomes of farmers who are already fragile and who have little capacity to invest will be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">This report puts its finger on the painful points of the common agricultural policy and its latest reform, and I can only welcome these facts being brought out into the open. However, some parts of the report remain ambiguous and I cannot support them. I cannot ask the Member States, and I quote: ‘to ensure that partial decoupling is actually applied’, because I have always opposed any form of decoupling, be it partial or total. Likewise, I am not in favour of, and I quote: ‘ensuring a readjustment in favour of the second pillar’. The first pillar, which allows farmers to maintain a lucrative price for agricultural products, cannot be weakened in order to subsidise the second.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliamentary report has the merit of clearly presenting some important and sometimes painful realities of the common agricultural policy. However, it includes an ambiguous support for key aspects of the CAP reform, against which my group has spoken out, and that is why I will find it very difficult to support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its starting point is beyond dispute. We can use whatever fine words we want about the European agricultural model – multifunctional, kind to the environment and animal welfare, guaranteeing food safety, covering all our territories – but if the players are not there to implement it, that is farmers with enough income to do what they have to do, to live from their activities and attract the next generation, then the model will remain a utopia, a mirage, semantics, a lie.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem the report describes is indeed the one we are going to have to face in the years ahead. If the average income of the Community farmer – an abstract and therefore artificial statistical concept – has not already collapsed further despite the policy of systematically cutting prices, it has been at the price of very severe restructurings characterised by a dramatic reduction in the number of people working on farms and a very rapid increase in the concentration of farms together with the intensification of production. But if we want to maintain the greatest number of farmers on all the territory of the Member States in future, we will no longer be able to have this trilogy of disappearance, concentration and intensiveness. Europe can no longer count on those types of adjustment to maintain its agriculture and develop its agricultural model. Neither can it count any longer on an increase in the agricultural budget to cover the extra costs that the new standards concerning multifunctionality demanded by society will entail. Quite the contrary, that budget is set to decline over the next ten years, with no prospect of a reversal of that trend in sight.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike the rapporteur, I believe that the June 2003 reform, which was inspired primarily by non-agricultural considerations – the desire to reach a general agreement in the WTO and a desire to make budget savings – offers little prospect of a solution to the problem. On the contrary, with decoupling it is more likely to accelerate concentration, intensification and land speculation, all trends which will have the effect of deterring young people from taking up farming and accelerating the monetarisation of the sector. If we want to avoid all this, we must redefine the concept of Community preferences and we cannot put off doing so indefinitely. When there are emergent countries with structural production conditions that utterly destroy the competitiveness of European agriculture, it is irresponsible to believe that only a policy of product quality or niche products will produce sufficient incomes to enable our farmers to continue occupying all our territories while providing society with the products and production conditions it wants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is one of the Members of this House whom I hold in very high esteem. However, if I read his report, my criticism in this case is that the Socialist dimension is far too prevailing. Too much attention has been paid to the premiums while too little consideration has been given to the competitiveness of agriculture and horticulture. It is generally the case that the European debate on incomes in agriculture is too much dominated by the question as to the level of premiums rather than what the market problems are.</p>
<p class="contents">Starting with the premiums, the Netherlands receives far too small a share of the European budget. The Netherlands accounts for 7% of agricultural production in the European Union, yet only receives 2.1% of the agricultural budget and 1% of the rural development budget. This is out of all proportion. Of course, there is a reason for this. The negotiations in Berlin in 1999 were conducted by Mr Kok and Mr Zalm, neither of whom had any affinity with agriculture and horticulture. That is not only the reason why the Dutch countryside does not receive what it is entitled to; it is also the real reason why the Dutch net contribution to the European Union is so high. This excessive contribution is best remedied by giving the Netherlands a substantially higher amount for agriculture and rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also another point that is given too little consideration in the development of agricultural incomes, namely the position of the so-called free products. The high European requirements in terms of environment, food safety and animal welfare have a knock-on effect on the cost price of – for example – meat, vegetables and potatoes, and put European agriculture at a worldwide disadvantage in terms of cost price. That is the real reason underlying a number of crises, including the current one in pig farming. My proposal is that in the case of new European legislative proposals affecting agriculture and horticulture, an income assessment should be done in order to check the true repercussions of this legislation on the workers in the fields. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, Mr Garot’s rigorous analysis provides data confirming our concern at the danger posed by the reform of the CAP if its negative impact on agricultural incomes is not neutralised. I very much regret the seriously misguided and inconsistent way in which certain Members, on the one hand, heap great praise on the report because it is good, but, on the other, say that they are not going to support it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the fundamental objective of the CAP is to guarantee a fair standard of living for the agricultural population. Europe needs multifunctional and viable agriculture, but this means that we must protect the European model, create a system of crisis management, guarantee employment and increase the resources dedicated to the second pillar. All of this is proposed by Mr Garot in this wonderful report.</p>
<p class="contents">Especially worthy of note are paragraph 7 – which the Commission should apply – which points out that the costs of production are tending to increase while aid is tending to decrease; paragraph 17, which relates to guaranteeing employment; and paragraphs 24 and 25 relating to the second pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, the Commission must take account of the view expressed by Mr Garot in paragraph 25 on cofinancing, as a demand which may hinder rural development, with a view to making this cofinancing requirement more flexible in the reform in the CAP. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Arguments which have proven to be thoroughly disorientating and hypocritical in the past are being shamelessly used again today, precisely in order to continue the same anti-farming policy.</p>
<p class="contents">What social and multifunctional agriculture is the rapporteur talking about when, during the 1995-2002 reference period, the workforce fell by 15.7%, with a commensurate reduction in agricultural households? Behind it, this number conceals the abandonment of entire areas, especially in the Mediterranean countries, it conceals the increase in unemployment and migration to the towns, with all the consequential problems and with incalculable consequences for environmental protection, for which the European Commission would supposedly do anything. He notes that agricultural incomes rose by an average of 7% in the European Union as a whole from 1995 to 2002. However, this increase is less than 1% per annum, meaning that it is much less than the average increase in GDP in the European Union over the same period and it concerns an economic sector in whose products the European Union has a deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, no analysis is made so that we can see which holdings reported an increase in income, how many small and medium-sized farming households had a reduction and how many went bankrupt. That is because the technique of averages in a differentiated social stratum such as agriculture is the best means of muddying the waters, of hiding acute class divisions and of concealing important social problems. So exactly what social and multifunctional agriculture are we talking about when the differential between agricultural incomes per worker is over 1 to 50 and when 20% of large holdings take up 73% of direct Community aid?</p>
<p class="contents">The unfair distribution in Community subsidies at the expense of small- and medium-sized farmers has proven over time the capitalist nature of the CAP, the objective of which is to concentrate land and production in a few capitalist farm holdings. Of course, wiping out small- and medium-sized farming and concentrating land will be completed by the new reform of the CAP, which is even worse than all the previous reforms. Let me quote the typical example of the decoupling of subsidies from production, which the rapporteur welcomes, together with the conversion of intervention schemes to simple insurance networks and the exit of farmers from the market to become businessmen, to quote Mr Fischler.</p>
<p class="contents">Reality is not consistent with the contradictory and prefabricated conclusions of the report. It is so gloomy that it leaves no room even for legerdemain or for further misleading farmers. The common agricultural policy of extermination will be fought against by the small- and medium-sized farmers in my country and the European Union, who are realising more and more every day that overturning it is the only way they will survive and …</p>

It strikes at the heart of the central question facing European agriculture at this crucial juncture, namely, whether the agricultural community can expect to make a fair living from its activities.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the report's most illustrative points is that, while agricultural incomes rose by 7% in the EU between 1995 and 2002, this was at the expense of a 15% decrease in the number of farms. That means that small farms have been swallowed up by increasingly large farms and production that has become more intensive. With consumers demanding more information on the means by which their food is produced, this trend is one that must be addressed. Large farms, selling bulk commodities, with pollution risks and herd health problems represent a future that we must work to avoid. Whilst the figures may continue to suggest that incomes are growing, they hide the impact of increasingly intensive farming methods. This must be borne in mind each time the European Parliament – and more importantly, the European Commission – consider direct aid via the CAP. There is something seriously amiss with a system that continues to pump money into the pockets of some of Europe's largest and wealthiest landowners through lavish subsidies. The Duke of Westminster – Britain's richest man – receives EUR 1300 per day in agricultural subsidies, while small Welsh farmers are struggling to get by with as little as EUR 7000 per year.</p>

In his report, Mr Garot was right to point out that, in the final analysis, all these fine words are not worth the paper they are written on if we do not guarantee a reasonable income for the farmer. It is not easy to interpret the statistical income data. Mr Garot concludes that over the past few years, agricultural incomes in the Union have risen by 7%. I have checked with the researchers who supplied these figures whether this is correct. They state that these figures do not take into consideration production levies, interest payable, rent and labour costs. If one looks at the actual difference in the farmer's wallet, then between 1995 and 2001, agricultural incomes in the EU did not rise, but fell, by 6%.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution argues in favour of maintaining price and market policy and associated production control, with good reason. In this respect, extending supply does not, by definition, benefit agricultural incomes. If the milk quota is extended, the milk price continues to drop and the incomes of dairy farmers are put under pressure unnecessarily.</p>
<p class="contents">The WTO Summit in Cancun has failed. With it, a far-reaching liberalisation of trade in agricultural products has been put on hold for the time being. Agriculture is not like a bicycle shop where demand from the market can simply be accommodated. Protection remains necessary. In this respect, developing countries are better served by preferential market access to the EU than unbridled free trade. It is unfortunate that a Socialist, of all people, who, by nature, believes in a society that can be moulded to one's will, should accept the liberalisation of agriculture as a natural phenomenon. The rapporteur fears that agricultural support from the EU is losing its legitimacy in the eyes of the WTO. I do not share this fear, because as in football, it is not only about technique, but also about strategy. Otherwise, the French would never be able to take a game off the Dutch team!</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that in this resolution, Mr Garot is already working towards another reform: the reform of decoupled support to a form of rural policy. However much I applaud rural policy, it cannot replace European agricultural policy. Mr Garot is wrong to seize upon European agriculture's multifunctionality as an excuse for a new form of structural policy, one that has to pump money into an area on the basis of acreage instead of production value.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to sustain the family business and reject untrammelled economies of scale, our policy has to be in keeping with this. This entails the capping of high company allowances and a systematic protection of small- and medium-size businesses. This, at least, is something that will be of some use to the European farmer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Greek farmers in particular are anxious about their future. They are anxious about whether to continue to farm their land or to join the queues of the unemployed in the towns. However, we cannot hope for a strong Greece unless we safeguard strong regions. And strong regions mean strong farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">We must apply a policy which secures farmers a decent income so that they can be master of their own land; so that they have employment, prospects, a future, a productive horizon for their children. Regions without farmers mean a country without a future. Guaranteeing agricultural incomes at decent levels is not just an economic issue. It is, at the same time, a huge social and moral issue. We therefore need to follow an organised agricultural policy which will consistently and constantly lead to the strengthening of the agricultural sector.</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary, now, without delay, for us to fight bureaucracy, to simplify procedures to integrate new farmers into Community initiatives and to encourage the development of organic products with less paperwork and more support, with cheap certification of organic products and with undivided advisory support for farmers from the agriculturalists and veterinarians of the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to give Greek farmers the optimism which they lack today, the belief that their work has a future and that their future is close to their land, with prospects, with a serious income and with dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His absence has been the subject of criticism, and it is also regrettable. The Commission is having a meeting on medium-term financial planning, and fairness requires that I, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, make it plain to the House that we think it important that Commissioner Fischler should be present at that meeting. We do, though, regret that the two commitments have overlapped, it is something that we strenuously tried to avoid, but without success. It is thus that we find ourselves in the unfortunate position of having to have this debate without Commissioner Fischler.</p>
