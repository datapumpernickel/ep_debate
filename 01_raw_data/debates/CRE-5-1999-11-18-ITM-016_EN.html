<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Newton Dunn (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span><span class="bold">.</span> – This is a very uncontentious, uncontroversial report except for just one single point, which involves everybody who is listening. The proposal is to develop a computerised image archiving system to help detect forged travel documents. I imagine that we all agree that is worth doing. So what is the single point of controversy? It is whether this decision is going to be made behind closed doors in Brussels by officials and ministers, or whether there will be parliamentary scrutiny. Fifteen national parliaments cannot do so, because it is a European proposal and this task will fall to us if to anybody.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the history of this proposal is that in January of this year, the Commission put forward the same proposal and said its purpose was to detect documents brought in by illegal immigrants. The proposal lapsed when the Amsterdam Treaty came into effect in May. It has now been retabled by the German Government, as a national government is entitled to do, under the Amsterdam Treaty. However, the problem is that the German Government says its purpose is to deal with I quote 'crime' and leaves out the word immigration. Why? Because under the Amsterdam Treaty, immigration questions are transferred from the third pillar to the first pillar and become the responsibility, for the first time, of Parliament. However, criminal matters remain in the third pillar and we have no area of scrutiny, no responsibility at all. Therefore, the German Government in my submission is seeking to avoid parliamentary scrutiny of its proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee did not like that. The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms invited the Finnish Presidency and the German Government to come and answer our questions about the proposal. The Finnish Presidency replied in a letter to the committee that it would not come, it would not answer our questions. However, it did say that we could ask put questions in plenary. Well, here we are in the plenary – where is the Council of Ministers? Everybody can see that the seats are empty except for one charming lady in grey who is an official and is not allowed to speak. But I hope she will take away this message. The fact that the German Government has sought to avoid parliamentary scrutiny altogether by keeping this under the third pillar and the fact that the Finnish Presidency has not even turned up to answer our questions either in committee or in plenary is, I am sorry to say, a great stain on the reputation of the Finns, who previously had a wonderful reputation for openness and democracy. I am also very sorry that they are not here to answer my accusation.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the committee has voted to change the legal base so that this matter comes back under the first pillar, because this proposal is primarily about detecting forged documents carried by illegal immigrants. I am asking everyone who is here to vote tomorrow morning to support the committee, to establish parliamentary control over this new area of policy, which is our remit under the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>

In his request to speak he referred to an important field, that is the institutional field and everything concerned with it.</p>
<p class="contents">What I should like to do is to refer to the opportunities that this system offers us. The paper deals with combating the counterfeiting of travel documents. It is a system for registration and comparison and thus an instrument that also helps to combat illegal entry and illegal immigration or the committing of criminal acts under a false identity. That means that in order to be able to combat this phenomenon, which is partly a phenomenon of organised crime, we need new and very effective instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">One instrument is the system discussed here to combat the counterfeiting of travel documents. After all, it should also help us to combat the crime of smuggling, which is on the increase. If the figures are correct, then we have in the meantime learned that almost the same criminal earnings are obtained from smuggling as from drug crime and with considerably less risk than with drug-related crime. I have been given access to figures that show that of the 400,000 to 500,000 illegal immigrants who come to the European Union every year, at least 200,000 are brought into the European Union by smugglers. These counterfeit documents are very often used in smuggling cases.</p>
<p class="contents">In other areas too, where there is asylum abuse, there is counterfeiting of documents that are passed on from one person to another. Unfortunately this has become part of a system. In this regard, the system that Mr Newton Dunn described should be welcomed and supported.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, however, like to mention one point with which we are not happy. That is the fact that in parallel we have developed the FADO system that allows us to compare original documents and counterfeit documents pictorially. In reality, we therefore have two systems that should be amalgamated in one system. Because rather than coming across counterfeit documents it is of course better if we have previously compared original and counterfeit documents via the FADO system. That means that the aim should not be to run two parallel systems side by side, but to unite both of them in one system in the interests of efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall this action to combat counterfeit documents by comparing information that is not person-related is to be welcomed. But we should try to be more efficient so that two systems do not run in parallel but are associated with each other so that something is achieved: so that with the Schengen information system and the EURODAC information system together we can contribute to a safer Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This exchange of information is of great importance for the protection and security of people in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs a legal area in which its citizens feel at home and protected. An essential contribution to this is the cross-border regulations and protection systems that make life difficult for criminals. The German initiative endeavours to achieve such a system.</p>
<p class="contents">By exchanging information on counterfeit documents the counterfeiting itself is contained. That is an essential contribution to combating smuggling and other crimes and – I think this is very important – all other kinds of crime. So it is quite sensibly in the proposal for a Council Decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur wants to amend paragraph 3 of the preamble and limit the crimes to the offence of illegal immigration. He implies that illegal immigration is the greatest crime that we have to combat. My dear colleague, where do you actually live? Have you never heard anything about drug dealers and the couriers of the money launderers with suitcases full of bank notes? Do I really have to make you a list of travellers’ crimes?</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 6 is a disgrace! It mocks our citizens who expect protection and security from the European Union. We must vote by a large majority against this amendment. We cannot allow ourselves the intellectual freedom to be afraid of a few poor creatures who sneak in with forged documents and at the same time guarantee serious criminals the freedom to travel. The Legal Committee that has dealt with this matter was also unanimous and, I repeat, unanimous, in this opinion with all the other Groups after an in-depth examination and, as I said just now, I want this measure to apply to all crime. That is the reason why my Group will vote against all these amendments in the vote tomorrow morning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Recently my country, the United Kingdom, has been subject to an enormous rise in the inward flow of peoples and in my previous job as a Central London hospital doctor I witnessed a significant degree of illegal immigration and fraudulent abuse of our generous asylum policy. We in the UK are currently witnessing something of the order of 7,000 new applicants for asylum every month and over 80% of these eventually turn out after investigation to be bogus. This represents some 100,000 people per year including their dependants coming into my country.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally have come across a Nigerian asylum seeker being granted asylum on the strength of a false Liberian passport, an Albanian family who passed themselves off as Kosovans, another Nigerian who had loaned his British passport to his cousin who was able to enter the United Kingdom under the identity of his cousin and then commit a crime, and an Algerian who was living under the identity of a French citizen and who had bought his ID card on the Parisian black market. These are just some of the many abuses of which I have personal experience and we know that for the immigration authorities these examples are a daily occurrence.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we expect our own immigration and police authorities to be able to crack down on the systematic abuse of our system? We have a duty to remember that this constant flow of illegal immigration is posing an enormous burden, in particular in inner cities, on our national health service, social services and social security system as well as putting huge pressure on our limited housing stock. Unfortunately, there is evidence that large numbers of asylum-seekers have been waved through Continental Europe with a suggestion that they head towards our Channel ports in the knowledge that we have a permissive policy with instant rights to housing and social security benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the British Conservative Party is formally opposed in principle to commissioning under Article 63 of the Treaty of Amsterdam to the first pillar of policies on visas, immigration and asylum – and I therefore have to disagree with our rapporteur on this issue – nevertheless we welcome intergovernmental cooperation under the third pillar through Council joint action on the exchange of such information, including that relating to forged travel documents in order to crack-down on crime, particularly international crime which respects no national boundaries.</p>
<p class="contents">There is evidence that organised crime has spotted a soft and lucrative target in the illegal traffic of human beings who are often prepared to spend their life savings to gain entry to wealthy western countries in the hope of making a new life for themselves. This initiative is, therefore, in my view, a step in the right direction with the use of modern computer image digitalising technology to aid law enforcement agencies and interior ministries to cooperate throughout the Union. It is a good example in my view of the sort of European Union venture that my party in the United Kingdom can support so long as it is done on a flexible, intergovernmental basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Newton Dunn has now, on the pretext that the Parliament could not have such a strong influence under the third pillar as with his legal base, chosen the approach to amend the legal base and in doing so he has limited the target group taken into consideration to those who are affected under the first pillar within the meaning of the security policy of the European Union. That then led to a Member such as Mr Tannock giving an inflammatory speech about immigration! That goes together very well if you have the philosophy of a British Tory, which amounts to an anti-European view!</p>
<p class="contents">However, this only marginally concerns Germany’s initiative to strengthen the security structures in Europe. But it does provide pretexts for the politicians who in the meantime colour every debate on security in Europe with the subject of illegal immigration. I should just like to say something here to our colleague from London: having heard your speech, I must ask you a question in return. Is Europe now really an immigration continent or not? If you answer in the affirmative with your lively description that Europe is an immigration continent should we not finally take action and create legal structures on immigration? You would be the first to say ‘no’, I am quite sure of that! We are not a continent of immigration and we don’t need any immigration rules!</p>
<p class="contents">But what does the whole debate show us? Mr Newton Dunn has perhaps chosen a sensible approach from the viewpoint of the European Parliament in order to increase our influence. We have already seen the political effects that that has. Remaining under the third pillar does integrate more groups of people, as Mrs Gebhardt has just said, that is to say, all criminals who forge travel documents. But we have not integrated the Parliament as strongly as with the Newton Dunn legal base. Overall, that shows that neither the third pillar nor the marginal transfer of responsibilities to another pillar are sufficient to create efficient security structures in Europe. Commissioner, you must together with us make that clear to the Council. You did so in Tampere, you did it before, and you must do it again.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate here shows that not all of our efforts bear fruit, because the government cooperation is not sufficient to convert the needs resulting from the internal market structure and the associated speed of integration into new legislation on security structures in Europe and it does not operate in accordance with Amsterdam. We must draw the necessary conclusions from this, otherwise it will not work in practice. Because we are arguing here about the legal bases, we are conducting some stupid debates about illegal immigration – that is something for the Tory Party conference, but ineffective for Europe – and we are completely neglecting what we should do, that is, create effective legislation to restrict the counterfeiting of documents, both by those who illegally provide access to Europe and those who, as Mrs Gebhardt rightly said, travel thorough Europe with a suitcase full of heroin but with counterfeit documents too.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Newton Dunn, because we are of the view that in weighing up your proposal, that is a very worthy one, and the intention that the German Council Presidency had in its time, we must decide in favour of the greater target area, we shall reject your amendment, not only because of the legal base, but as a consequence of all the others, which does not alter the fact that you have undertaken a careful piece of work. You have indeed done that, but on this subject we differ greatly in our political views!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Yesterday’s newspapers, published today in press reviews across Italy, said: “Long-life gene discovered: life could be increased by a third”, or by 35% to be precise. Therefore, I think that, if at the moment I am hoping to reach 90, I will actually reach 130.</p>
<p class="contents">You will say, what does this have to do with counterfeit travel documents? I will tell you straight away. You know that I am the representative of the Pensioners’ Party, elected to Parliament from that list. The pensioners are always asking me what they are cooking up in the pot in Brussels. They are aware of the fact that in Brussels – but above all in the fifteen Member States of the Union – they take these pensioners and they throw as many of them as possible into boiling water. This is what has been happening for some time, and, with this new piece of news, I think that the pot will be heated even more so that even more pensioners can be boiled, if possible all together. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the serious harm that they know they have to suffer, there is also the fact that, unfortunately, being elderly, they more than other people are more likely to be the targets of the criminal acts which, throughout the European Community, are sadly being perpetrated by many people who illegally enter the Union and then commit them once they are in. </p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to say to my friends and fellow Members, Mr Gebhardt and Mr Schulz, that, firstly, in the amendments tabled by Mr Newton Dunn, the need to combat crime and the trade in human beings is not avoided but confirmed. I would also like to say that if these criminals do not enter illegally, then they will not commit crimes either; if, on the other hand, they are decent people and have their travel documents in order, then we are quite happy for them to enter. It is precisely for this reason that we are saying that what this measure is doing is positive – even if it reminds us of Arsène Lupin, the gentleman thief – but it would be much better to have a European electronic identity card which is the same in all the States. Above all, it would be much better for supervision at European borders to be increased, on the borders of Spain, Greece and Italy as well as Eastern Europe… It is pointless to invest money, effort and hard work for other reasons. We must prevent large numbers of people illegally entering the European Union who then go on to commit crimes. </p>

<p class="contents">I think that Parliament knows that, on this matter, it has long been the Commission’s intention that the battle against document fraud and the counterfeiting and abuse of travel documents should contribute, above all, to improving the monitoring of transit from external borders. In this sense, it is an important instrument in the battle against illegal or unauthorised immigration and against the networks that traffic in human beings. At the same time, the issue in question also falls within the scope of police cooperation and the fight against crime in general. Therefore, the choice of legal basis is an open one. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw the Chamber’s attention, however, to the fact that, in this area, the conclusions of the Tampere European Council took a certain view of the situation by appealing for the continuation of efforts seeking to implement an active common policy on visas and on combating the counterfeiting of documents in order to guarantee better management of migratory flows. In this context, I shall not hide from the Chamber the fact that the Commission would prefer a legal basis which is based on the first Pillar. This could be in accordance either with No 2, Article 62, or under Article 66 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">But, of course, the fact that we prefer a legal basis which is based upon the first Pillar does not exclude the possibility of using this instrument in the battle against cross-border crime, particularly in order to maintain police cooperation between Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the Commission would like to say that, from our point of view, we agree with the rapporteur’s analysis, according to which, in the long term, this instrument that we are discussing today will have to be integrated into a much larger system which will make the exchange of documents in general possible. I would therefore like to remind you that, at the time the FABO (Archiving and Image Exchange System) was adopted, the Commission, had already announced that it would take the necessary measures to guarantee its management. For reasons of consistency and even to save resources, the Commission intends shortly to put forward proposals to this effect, that is, proposals that will seek the integration of the exchange of counterfeit or falsified documents, the object of the present proposal, into a broader system of technical cooperation that will implement the exchange of information on all kinds of document-related fraud. </p>
<p class="contents">This more advanced system of technical cooperation will thus decisively contribute to citizens’ safety and to the fight against organised crime, improving the monitoring of our external borders in terms of migratory flows and cross-border criminal activity. And, as a consequence, it will increase confidence throughout the Union in travel documents.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In this way, we will be creating conditions which will allow us to safeguard the security of the Union’s citizens, the monitoring of illegal immigration flows and also the fight against cross-border crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
