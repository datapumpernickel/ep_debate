Stemming from the European NGOs present, the idea was supported by the European Union and the governments of Member States.</p>

<p>(EN) A wide-ranging consultation with different stakeholders on the issue of the possible scope of a directive based on Article 13 of the EC Treaty to fight discrimination on the basis of sex has been launched. Since a comprehensive legal framework in the fields of employment and occupation already exists, the consultations are aimed at exploring possible domains to be covered. These are currently being discussed at all levels with the different services of the Commission concerned by them.</p>
<p>The Commission services are equally following current work in the framework of the Convention on the future of Europe. Whether or not to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties is one of the topics for discussion and there seems to be a strong tendency favouring this incorporation. In such a case, careful attention should be paid to the legal effects of the Charter's article on equality between men and women.</p>
<p>In the light of all these elements, the best approach to follow, in particular as to the added value of a proposal in this field, will have to be decided on. Taking decisions which could be counterproductive to the overall area of equal opportunities must be avoided.</p>

<p>(EN) Since the beginning of 2001, all Member States are carrying out systematic bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) testing of bovine animals. The testing programme covers all bovine animals over 30 months of age slaughtered for human consumption, all bovine animals over 24 months of age subject to special emergency slaughter or slaughtered under specific conditions because of general disease symptoms, and all dead-on-farm bovine animals over 24 months of age. The testing programme was reviewed last year but only minor technical changes were made to the programme.</p>
<p>The objectives of the testing programme are to provide an accurate picture of the BSE situation in the Member States and to prevent bovine animals in the clinical phase of the disease from entering the food or feed chain. Those objectives were achieved in 2002. The testing programme will in itself not lead to a reduction in the number of new BSE cases. Other measures, such as destruction of specified risk material and the feed ban are in place to prevent new animals from becoming infected, thus reducing the number of BSE cases. However due to the long incubation period of the disease that reduction will only occur four to six years after the implementation of the measures.</p>
<p>Current legislation does not stipulate that the BSE testing programme shall be co-financed by the Community. The legislation does however provide for the possibility of a financial contribution of the Community, within the limits of the appropriate budget line.</p>
<p>Since 2001, the Community has participated in the costs of the test kits used in the monitoring programme. Originally the financial participation was limited to EUR 30 per test, which was reduced to EUR 15 per test after six months. The maximum financial participation was again reduced to EUR 10.5 per test in 2003. The reason for decreasing the maximum contribution per test is that the average cost per test is lower than originally estimated, around EUR 18 per test, and still decreasing.</p>
<p>The reductions in the maximum amounts allocated to each Member State for 2003 are a consequence of the reduction in the amount allocated to each test. The total number of tests being co-financed remains unchanged.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Community's actions in the sphere of culture cover an extremely wide range of fields: its education, research, employment and regional policies, as well as its external actions (to cite only some of the areas concerned), are involved by means of numerous instruments in the development of the cultural dimension in Europe.</p>
<p>For instance, the proposal for a decision establishing the Erasmus World programme constitutes a large-scale initiative for the promotion of the Union's culture through the opening-up of higher education in the Union to third countries. The extension of the Tempus programme to the southern and eastern Mediterranean countries, proposed in February 2002 and in force since June of that year, is already contributing to better mutual understanding between the cultures of a region which is of crucial importance for the Union.</p>
<p>In the context of the Community's Socrates programme for European cooperation in the field of education, the Comenius scheme proposes Community support for educational partnerships. The Socrates programme was gradually opened up to the applicant countries over its first phase (1995-1999). The decision establishing its second phase makes express reference to the participation of all the applicant countries. Educational partnerships under Comenius are open to all schools, from nursery to secondary level. The programme's objectives are: a) improving the quality of schooling and developing its European dimension; b) the learning of languages; and c) promoting the intercultural dimension of schooling in Europe. The educational partnerships, which may be either multilateral or bilateral, will enable schools to achieve those objectives thanks to financial support for transnational cooperation projects, including joint educational activities in the participating establishments combined with inter-establishment mobility for the teachers and pupils concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0003"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission has expressed its full support for the initiative of France, Germany and Belgium concerning a draft protocol amending the convention on the use of information technology for customs purposes and the creation of a customs files identification database. Such a database would certainly be a useful complement to the signalling/display database already existing under the centralised Third Pillar Customs Identification System (CIS).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Commission, which is responsible for managing the technical infrastructure of the CIS (first and third pillars), has always considered that, in the absence of additional human resources, having the CIS up and running must be a prior condition for the development by its services of any new applications, such as the customs files identification database (CFID).</p>
<p>As the CIS will be implemented as of 24 March 2003, the Commission can now envisage a feasibility study on the technical development of the CFID (third pillar), and is now also in a position to take legal measures under the first pillar to complement the initiative of the three above-mentioned Member States with a view to covering all illegal activities in the customs area.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the Commission has included in its programme of work for 2003 a legislative proposal amending Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 of 13 March 1997 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters<a href="#defann_9_1" name="refann_9_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>A further objective of this proposal for amendment is to complement the existing signalling database and the proposed identification database (both under the CIS system), in particular by introducing databases for strategic analysis (of fraudulent tendencies) and profiling-risk analysis for frauds and irregularities relating to customs. This information, with additions where relevant by OLAF, would be made available to the Member States; under certain conditions, other bodies such as Europol and Eurojust could also have access. The aim is to achieve substantially greater efficiency in customs cooperation.</p>
<p>The Commission further stresses that efficient cooperation is at present impaired by the fact that customs cooperation is split between the first and third pillars and, therefore, between two different legal frameworks. The need to operate two separate (and similar) IT applications for the first and third pillars entails an additional cost of approximately 30% to OLAF's budget for anti-fraud IT tools in the customs field.</p>
<p>The Commission hopes that the Convention on the Future of Europe will examine the possibility of more closely linking the intergovernmental and the Community modes of customs cooperation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Directorate General Health and Consumer Protection has organised the European Young Consumer Contest (EYCC) involving all Member States every school year since 1993 (except for 1997-1998), with the help of several private contractors. The objective is to encourage young people to become more aware of consumer affairs and become responsible consumers, by getting them to work on different consumer-linked themes under adult guidance. The contests have taken place around different themes (nutrition, sustainable development, the Euro, etc.).</p>
<p>Before launching the 2002-2003 contest, however, given the limited number of participating schools in 2001/2002 (less than 2000), the Commission has sought to determine whether certain elements of the contest should be modified, or whether it had to be completely revamped or possibly abandoned altogether if no alternative solutions could be found to improve the cost/efficiency ratio for the contest.</p>
<p>The overall conclusion of the internal appraisal was that the European Young Consumer Contest is an action that should be continued, provided one can improve its cost/efficiency ratio. The Commission has found, in particular, that the increase in the budget did not correspond to an equivalent increase in the number of schools participating and that the costs of personnel and administration were particularly high.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to try and increase the teachers’ interest for the competition and reduce the overall cost, the Commission has asked the European Schoolnet (EUN), a joint venture of twenty-three Ministries of Education from around Europe, to organise the 2002/2003 EYCC via the Internet. The two themes for this year are :</p>
<p>- How to make labelling more user-friendly?</p>
<p>- How to promote a healthy lifestyle through a balanced diet?</p>
<p>Potentially harmful product advertising could be considered as a possible theme for the next issue of the contest, provided of course that the interest for the contest among the tens of thousands of schools in the Union is maintained.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Infant mortality can be caused by primary immune deficiency. Knowledge within this field must be improved among healthcare workers, the general public and decision-makers throughout Europe.

<p>(EN) Although the topic of Primary Immune Deficiency was not specifically selected in the first call for the Priority 1 ‘Genomics and health’ under the 6<span class="sup">th</span> Framework programme, quite a lot of research covered by this priority will be directly beneficial to research on Primary Immune Deficiency (PID), its diagnosis and treatment. Indeed several topics covered in the work programme in different sections of this priority are directly relevant for research into PID and its treatment and will allow progress to be made. These topics certainly offer opportunities for the scientific community involved in PID research to apply for support in their field. Examples are for instance:</p>
<p>- Functional genomics approaches in animal models to study human disease of the immune system; ---- Optimised allogeneic stem cell transplantation for haematological and neoplastic diseases;</p>
<p>- Gene therapy of inherited diseases;</p>
<p>- Large epidemiological studies of X-linked syndromes;</p>
<p>- Genome-based individualised medicines;</p>
<p>- Medicines for paediatrics;</p>
<p>- Development of genetic tests allowing for harmonisation, validation and standardisation;- Development of a European databank comprising recent advances in genomics, proteomics and cell biology for immunotherapies;</p>
<p>- Co-ordination of rare disease research in Europe, with various stakeholders from research, small and medium-sized enterprises and patient organisations;</p>
<p>- Molecular markers of congenital anomalies.</p>
<p>In the course of the 6<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme the Commission will continuously re-examine all available scientific elements as a basis for the selection of priority topics for future calls under Priority 1. In that context the Commission will certainly carefully reconsider, in collaboration with the scientific Advisory Committee and the Priority 1 ‘Genomics and Biotechnology for Health Programme Committee’, the need for further research on Primary Immune Deficiency.</p>

<p>(FR) On 20 January 2003, the Commission adopted Regulation 98/2003 (EC) establishing the supply balances and Community aid for the supply of certain essential products for human consumption, for processing and as agricultural inputs and for the supply of live animals and eggs to the outermost regions.</p>
<p>The subsidies were calculated on the basis of EC Regulations 1452/2001, 1453/2001 and 1454/2001, and also on that of Implementing Regulation 20/2002 (EC).</p>
<p>They were calculated primarily by observing extra supply costs and, as regards the agricultural inputs and products intended for processing, extra costs incurred as a result of regions being insular or on the outermost borders of the EU, as well as the prices customarily charged when comparable products were exported to third countries. The Commission then identified the extra costs eligible for Community finance and determined the appropriate aid.</p>
<p>The exercise referred to above, in which the Member States involved took an active part, was lengthy and complicated. It is for that reason that it was only on 19 December 2002 that the text was submitted to the joint management committee for its opinion. The committee was nevertheless willing to give its opinion on that date, but, at the request of a delegation, the vote was deferred to 9 January 2003.</p>
<p>In order not to disrupt supplies to the outermost regions, the Commission caused Regulation 98/2003 (EC) to enter into force with effect from 1 January 2003.</p>
<p>The Commission will have to repeat this exercise in 2003 in order to determine the amounts of aid applicable with effect from 2004 onwards. It intends to bring forward the date on which the draft text of the Regulation is submitted to the competent committees; as it is not, however, in sole charge of the exercise, this presupposes close and fruitful cooperation with the authorities of the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0018"></a>

<p>The Scottish Parliament's health committee has been asked to look at the issue of alcohol adverts in children's replica football strips following the high-profile announcement of a sponsorship deal reported to be worth a total £12 million. Multinational brewers Coors will sponsor both Rangers and Celtic to wear the Carling brand on their strips in seasons 2003 to 2006. There is growing evidence of alcohol problems among Scotland's youngsters, and so the Scottish Executive's Plan for Action on Alcohol has made tackling young people's drinking a major priority. The whole thrust of this strategy is undercut if the replica shirt market produces thousands of under-18s wearing beer adverts.</p>

<p>(EN) In several Member States the problems due to the drinking of alcohol by children and adolescents are rising in recent years. Referring to this, the Council Recommendation on the drinking of alcohol by young people<a href="#defann_15_1" name="refann_15_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> proposes that Member States should encourage, in co-operation with the producers and retailers of alcoholic beverages, the establishment of effective mechanisms to ensure that alcoholic beverages are not promoted to appeal to children and adolescents, paying particular attention to avoiding the implication of sporting success linked to alcohol promotion.</p>
<p>For the time being, the accent lies on self-regulation. In recent meetings with representatives of the alcohol industry the Commission has, however, very strongly stressed the need for the industry to comply with the Council Recommendation and with the existing codes of conduct. The Commission has made it very clear that efforts by the industry to improve the functioning and the effectiveness of such codes are needed. The use of alcohol logos on children’s sized shirts could be an interesting test case.</p>
<p>The main result of a recent meeting of the Commission’s Working Group on Alcohol and Health, which included a joint session with the stakeholders, was that advertising and sponsorship, especially regarding young people, need to be monitored very closely. The Commission expects that such monitoring will be made possible through future projects under the Public Health Action Programme. The Commission also expects that the industry shows more proactive approach to self-regulation particularly by publicising their self-regulation codes and by reporting on breaches and how they are dealt with.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In adopting the Markov report, the European Parliament has endorsed a Commission proposal authorising a driving time of 56 hours a week for workers in the road transport sector and a daily driving time of 10 hours on two days in a week. Road transport trade unions are demanding a maximum working week of 45 hours, with an 80-hour maximum over two weeks, plus a daily driving time of no more than nine hours.</p>
<p>How can the Commission justify legalising so lengthy a driving time for such difficult work, particularly since road transport workers have to carry out other tasks which come on top of driving time.

<p>(EN) The current driving times within Regulation (EEC) 3820/85 which are also reflected in the current proposal as approved with amendments at first reading by the Parliament, set out a maximum driving time of 90 hours over a two consecutive week period. This means an average maximum weekly driving time of 45 hours. The proposal maintains the flexibility of the current rule where a maximum driving time of 56 hours per week must be offset by a maximum of 34 hours the following week. Moreover, unlike the current Regulation, the proposal makes the weekly driving time limit of 56 hours crystal clear. Since it is recognised that there can be fluctuations in transport activity, the Commission considers it appropriate to maintain this flexibility. However, in terms of working time, the sectoral working time Directive 2002/15/EC is considerably stricter than the general working time Directive 93/104/EC as amended, by imposing an overall weekly maximum working time of 60 hours, and excluding an ‘opt out’ clause from the average weekly working time of 48 hours.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0020"></a>

<p>(FR) On 9 January 2003, the Commercial Court at Briey imposed a court-supervised recovery scheme on the Daewoo-Orion factory at Mont-Saint-Martin, which manufactures cathode-ray tubes. The Korean group's two other sites in Lorraine, which produced microwave ovens (Villers-la-Montagne), and assembled television sets (Fameck) had already been shut down at the ends of November 2002 and December 2002 respectively.</p>
<p>According to the information supplied by the regional prefecture, which is the management authority for Structural Fund programmes, the Community subsidies may be broken down as follows:</p>
<p>Villers-la-Montagne site</p>
<p>NPCI EDP<a href="#defann_18_1" name="refann_18_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>: subsidy of FFR 4 375 000 in 1988</p>
<p>NPCI EDP: subsidy of FFR 2 000 000 in 1991</p>
<p>Objective 2: subsidy of FFR 10 480 000 in 1995</p>
<p>Mont-Saint-Martin site</p>
<p>Objective 2 94/96: subsidy of 110 000 000 francs in 1993</p>
<p>The guidelines on national regional aid<a href="#defann_18_2" name="refann_18_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, as adopted in 1998, established the principle that initial investment aid must be conditional on the maintenance of the investment in question or of jobs created over a five-year minimum period (items 4.10 and 4.14). These provisions shall apply only with effect from 1 January 2000. The Commission does not, however, exclude the possibility that aid granted before this date had been subject to similar clauses inserted by the French authorities. In such a case, it is for the Member State to establish that the recipient of aid has adhered to all the conditions subject to which such aid is granted.</p>
<p>It is stated in Article 30(4) of the new Regulation 1260/99<a href="#defann_18_3" name="refann_18_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> on the Structural Funds that ‘the Member States shall ensure that an operation retains this contribution from the Funds only if that operation does not within five years of the decision of the competent national authorities on the managing authority on the contribution of the Funds, undergo a substantial modification … resulting from … a cessation or change of location in a productive activity.’</p>
<p>The Commission regrets the fact that the Daewoo-Orion corporation has withdrawn from a region which continues to suffer the socio-economic consequences of industrial restructuring. However, taking into account the dates when decisions were taken to grant Community subsidies – from 1988 to 1995 in the case of the Villers-la-Montagne site and in 1993 in that of the Mont-Saint-Martin site – application of the rules does not lead to the conclusion that aid received for this purpose must be repaid.</p>
<p>In consultation with the regional prefecture, the Commission will closely examine these four files in order to satisfy itself that all the conditions imposed by European regulations have indeed been met.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission has closely followed the case of the 52 men arrested in the 'Queen Boat' affair to which the Honourable Member refers. The Commission was concerned by the initial use of National Security legislation with no rights of appeal for the 23 imprisoned men; and by the inflammatory language used at the original trial and in the media which undermined Egyptian claims that the men were not charged for their sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Egyptian President Mubarak subsequently ruled that all but two of the 'Queen Boat' defendants should be retried in a misdemeanour court. This is an important and potentially positive development although the Commission regrets that even those acquitted in the first trial are being retried. The retrial is not yet concluded.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that allegations of police harassment and entrapment of homosexuals continue - but it has no details concerning the two cases of apparent police entrapment mentioned in the question. However the Parliament can be assured that the Union will continue to follow the 'Queen Boat' case and other similar prosecutions. The Commission’s concerns has already been communicated to the Egyptian authorities through the normal channels on several occasions and the Commission will not hesitate to do so again if appropriate. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0026"></a>

<p>(EN) There was, prior to preparation and publication in 2001 of the Green Paper entitled ‘The future of the Common Fisheries Policy’, extensive consultation of stakeholders, including fishermen. This consultation consisted of:</p>
<p>-Extensive circulation of a questionnaire to administrations and stakeholders.</p>
<p>-Regional meetings in Member States (30 meetings in total throughout Member States of which three in Ireland) to discuss the possibilities for reform.</p>
<p>-A large meeting in Brussels following receipt of responses to the questionnaire to which all concerned were invited to further discuss the reform.</p>
<p>-Publication of the Green Paper in which it was indicated that stakeholders should contact the Commission with further comments.</p>
<p>-The usual extensive discussion and negotiation with administrations of Member States (presumably briefed by their own stakeholders) leading to adoption of a new basic regulation for the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in December 2002.</p>
<p>The Commission has never proposed closure of the Irish Sea. In proposals put forward to the Council of December 2002, the Commission indicated that fishing effort expressed as days at sea should be subject to limitation during 2003 both in the Irish Sea and in other areas inhabited by highly imperilled stocks of cod.</p>
<p>In the event, the effort control scheme was not adopted for the Irish Sea and a repetition of a closure enacted in 2002 during the spawning period of cod of the spawning grounds of cod was adopted instead.</p>
<p>The decision to put forward a days at sea scheme was made on the basis of the most recent scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) which estimated the abundance of mature cod at the start of 2003 and the expected abundance thereof at the end of 2003 under various scenarios of fishing pressure during that year. Under any scenario, the abundance of mature cod is very low compared to historical values.</p>
<p>The Commission is willing to further discuss the possibility of maintaining and augmenting the closure of an appropriate part of the Irish Sea during the period mentioned. Meetings to further discuss this possibility with industry are currently being arranged.</p>
<p>In this context, it is doubtful whether the Honourable Member really means ‘closure of all fishing grounds’. This would mean closure of fishing for Norway lobsters within the area closed to fishing for cod. This would generate considerable economic hardship and has been avoided in previous implementations of such closures.</p>
<p>The matter of severity of penalties for transgression are in the hands of Member States within their respective legal systems. The Commission does not define such penalties.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0027"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission shares Mr Ferri's view that certain mountainous areas of the Union lack sufficient services of general interest. This is, however, an area in which the Commission's role can only be that of providing incentives. In January 2001, the Commission published a communication on services of general interest, which stipulated that such services must perform their functions with ‘complete territorial coverage of essential services in remote or inaccessible areas’. The communication also states that ‘the existence of a network of services of general interest is an essential element of social cohesion’. Moreover, the new Article 16 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities explicitly acknowledges the role played by services of general economic interest in promoting economic, social, and territorial cohesion, and requires that the Community should enable them to perform their functions. The Heads of State and Government underlined the importance of these provisions on the occasion of the Lisbon Summit in March 2000.</p>
<p>The inherent problems faced by Member States' mountainous areas are also taken into account by Community policies. In the area of regional policy, 95% of the surface area covered by mountainous areas of the Union are eligible for Community aid in the period from 2000 to 2006, whether under Objective 1 or Objective 2. Interreg III's section B on ‘International Cooperation’ includes an ‘Alpine space’ programme covering the entire territory of the Alps and of the Alpine Convention, that is to say Germany, France, Italy, Austria, Liechtenstein, Slovenia and Switzerland (with the last three countries making appropriate national contributions).</p>
<p>LEADER+ offers another opportunity to encourage, in rural mountainous districts, the implementation of innovative development strategies initiated by local stakeholders. Many of the local action groups covered by the LEADER+ framework are based in mountainous regions. In addition, Regulation 1257/1999 (EC) on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)<a href="#defann_21_1" name="refann_21_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> offers a wide range of measures for mountainous regions, which relate to ‘disadvantaged areas’, to the agricultural environment, to forestry and to the development and adaptation of rural areas.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the current economic situation of the salmon farming industry in both the Community and certain other major producing countries. It is acknowledged that certain producers in the Community have faced economic difficulties recently as the result of a number of factors.</p>
<p>It has to be first mentioned that the findings of the Commission’s most recent (and still ongoing) anti-dumping / subsidy investigations, suggest that there may be no basis on which to continue or impose additional trade defence measures at present in this area. Consultations with interested par ties and with Member States are still pending.</p>
<p>Concerning the issue of minimum import prices within the framework of the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products , the Community can apply such mechanisms only if a ‘reference price’ has been fixed. Such a price has not been fixed for salmon. In addition, and in line with the Community’s international obligations, the ‘reference price’, as a minimum import price, only applies for autonomous tariff reductions (tariff suspensions, tariff quotas): The benefit of the tariff reduction can not be invoked when the import price is lower than the ‘reference price’. When this is the case (the import price is lower than the ‘reference price’), then the full, or Most Favoured Nation (MFN) duty is applied. For salmon the full MFN duty amounts to 2%.</p>
<p>Profitability in aquaculture requires a balance between demand expansion and supply growth. The farmed salmon market in particular has suffered from periodic excess supply and illustrates the dangers of rapid supply growth. In its Communication ‘A strategy for the sustainable development of European aquaculture’ the Commission has issued a strategy for the sustainable development of strategy for a sustainable and economically self-sufficient European fish farming industry</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0034"></a>

In the case of large projects, application for community financing have to be accompanied by a statement by the authorities responsible for nature conservation in the concerned Member States declaring that the procedure required under Article 6 of the Directive was followed or, alternatively, that the project is not likely to have a significant impact on any Natura 2000 sites.</p>
<p>Applications for community funding are, in some cases, done by the Member States for parts of wider projects, as was the case in the water supply system for the Western Algarve, which includes the Odelouca and Funcho dams. In general, this splitting of the wider projects occurs when parts of the global project are not yet completely defined, as was the case, for the above-mentioned system, with the Odelouca dam. This situation will change when the Directive 2001/42 ‘Strategic Environmental Assessment (policies, plans and programmes)’ will be applicable.</p>
<p>The parts of the water supply system that received community funding did not have a significant impact on Natura 2000 sites, and can be used for water originating from other sources apart from the Odelouca dam. It must also be noted that the Commission had no information, when this funding was approved, of the possible future designation of a Natura 2000 site that included a part of the Odelouca river.</p>
<p>After the approval of the community funding for those components of the project, the Portuguese authorities proposed a Natura 2000 site in Monchique and approved the project of a dam in the Odelouca river, located inside the Monchique site. Having concluded that there was a violation of Directive 92/43/EEC, the Commission opened an infringement procedure against Portugal.</p>

<p>The German Government’s draft ‘Steuervergünstigungsabbaugesetz’ discriminates against foreign-domiciled investment funds by subjecting them to capital gains tax at double the domestic-domiciled level. The proposal would impose a 15% capital gains tax on foreign funds, in contrast to a 7.5% charge on domestic funds. Does the Commission agree that this proposal makes a mockery of the key principles of the Financial Services Action Plan and the single market? Has the Commission discussed this issue with Germany?

<p>(EN) The Regulation provides that Member States may submit their final payment claims for the second Community Support Framework (CSF II)1994-1999 until the 31 March 2003 at the latest.</p>
<p>For Greece, a total amount remains to be paid of some EUR 1.5 billion for all Structural funds.</p>
<p>The Commission has to date received 30 claims for a total amount of EUR 504 million, of which EUR 204 million for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), and EUR 300 million for the European Social Fund (ESF). The Commission has reminded Member States, including Greece, that the deadline must be met for all submissions.</p>
<p>As regards the ERDF, one claim, for an Interreg programme, was received on 19 November 2001 and has been paid. Seven other claims were received on 21 November 2002 of which four are in the final stages of procedure before payment. For the three others, the Commission is requesting clarifications from the Greek authorities. Other claims are expected to be submitted in early March 2003.</p>
<p>For the operational programme ‘ Roads’, the Commission has requested by letter of the 23 December 2002, a clarification of the division of works between CSF II and the next funding period, for projects which were not completed under CSF II. It has also sought further assurances concerning the degree to which remedial works have been completed, in cases where controls by ESPEL have found serious construction faults.</p>
<p>The Commission has also requested in the same letter, a more complete description of the verification made by the Greek authorities of the conformity of contract variations with national and Community legislation, in application of the agreement reached with the Commission in the Autumn of 2002.</p>
<p>Comments relating to the Operational Programme ‘POSTS’ have been sent to the Greek authorities on 31 January 2003, and comments relating to the Operational Programmes ‘Urban Development – Metro’ and have been sent on 6 February 2003.</p>
<p>As regards the ESF, final payment claims under CSF II do not present any particular problem. So far 22 ESF final payment claims have been submitted for a total amount of EUR 300 million. Processing of 11 of the above claims concerning EUR 234 million has already started. For the remaining 11 claims, the still pending information is expected to be submitted by the Greek authorities in the immediate future.</p>
<p>A further two final payment claims – for OPs ‘Exclusion’ and ‘Health’ for which a prolongation of the implementation period was agreed by the Commission’s services as a result of the earthquake in Athens in 1999, will be submitted by 31 March 2003 at the latest.</p>
<p>No claims have been received for European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)- Guidance section or Financial Investment for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) funds so far.</p>
<p>The Commission is giving a high priority to the processing of claims already submitted as they do for all Member States.</p>
<p>Payments and closure of the operational programmes is expected to be concluded within two months after receipt of all necessary information as required by the Regulations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0044"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the concerns expressed in relation to the use of hair dyes. The Commission has - not only since the publication of the study on the use of permanent hair dyes and bladder cancer risk - considered all aspects of the use of hair dyes in cosmetic products and their impact upon consumer health. In particular, 17 substances (out of which 12 are used as permanent hair dyes) have already been banned.</p>
<p>In 18 April 2002 the 26<span class="sup">th</span> adaptation to technical progress of the Cosmetics Directive was published in the Official Journal. In this Directive, 60 hair dyes (out of which 47 are used as permanent hair dyes) are regulated, based on the scientific opinions of the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products intended for Consumers (SCCNFP). With regard to these hair dyes, the current legislation covers labelling and fixes very strict maximum concentrations for their use.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the discussion paper adopted by the SCCNFP on 27 February 2002 was placed on the web-site. Interested parties were invited to comment. On 4 June 2002 the SCCNFP adopted ‘A strategy for testing hair-dye cosmetic ingredients for their potential genotoxicity/mutagenicity.’ This was supplemented by a recent opinion of 17 December of 2002 updating ‘Basic requirements for toxicological dossiers to be evaluated by the SCCNFP’.</p>
<p>Industry is required to submit files that must conform to the above-mentioned new requirements and the ‘Notes of Guidance for testing of cosmetic ingredients for their safety evaluation’.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission is discussing with Member States and representatives of both consumers and industry the prioritisation (including timetables) of substances used in hair dye formulations to be assessed or re-assessed.</p>
<p>A particular attention is to be given to substances for which no file has been submitted for risk assessment by the SCCNFP. In this case the Commission will consider the most appropriate measures, including a possible ban on its use.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0051"></a>

<p>(EN)</p>
<p>1. The Commission has not yet received any official information or request from Greece concerning the damage to infrastructure and concerning the destruction of the agricultural production caused by extensive flooding that took place recently in Thessaly, Attica and other regions of Greece.</p>
<p>2. On the basis of the current regulatory framework, the Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member that possible Community Funds that might be necessary to overcome the specific problems of Greek urban and rural areas might be taken from the appropriations of the third Community Support Framework for Greece (2000-2006), under condition that the actions to be co-financed are in conformity with the eligibility rules and the development aims of the approved Operational Programmes. It should be emphasised that European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund intervention will be limited to the reconstitution of production potential and not to compensate income losses. For the latter, as well as for the reconstitution of production potential, assistance may be given by national funding, under the prerequisite of the notification to and approval by the Commission of such State Aid, in line with the relevant State Aid rules.</p>
<p>Within this framework, it is up to Greece and the regions affected to submit to the Commission such requests for compensation of the affected population and areas and to include proposals for the support of appropriate flood protection projects and to ensure the flood protection of the country. This responsibility falls entirely on the Member State concerned.</p>
<p>The Commission, Member States and Candidate Countries have in 2002 started comprehensive practical cooperation on the issue of flooding. Beyond the formal scope of the Water Framework Directive, exchange of information, knowledge and experience on flood prevention and flood protection will, during 2003, lead to a joint document on best practices in flood prediction, prevention and mitigation. At the same time the Commission is working on a horizontal initiative addressing environmental risks (forest fires, earthquakes, flood events, and technological risks), with a Commission Communication foreseen during the first half of 2003. Following discussion on this Communication and the collating of best practices, the Commission will consider need and scope of possible legislative frameworks.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0056"></a>

<p>(EN) The current political dialogue with Iran – referred to as the Comprehensive Dialogue – is in effect since 1998. One of its aims is, indeed, to bring about an improvement in the Human Rights situation in that country.</p>
<p>The Commission shares the concern at the lack of progress, and has therefore advocated and encouraged the establishment of an enhanced and more effective dialogue on Human Rights. To that end, a first Union-Iran Human Rights troika meeting coupled to an non governmental organizations roundtable was held in Iran 16-17 December 2002. This emerging dialogue on Human Rights held specific discussions on discrimination and prevention against torture. It took notice of the Iranian Government’s willingness to receive a number of United Nations Thematic Rapporteurs, and will continue to assess progress on the basis of concrete benchmarks.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0059"></a>
