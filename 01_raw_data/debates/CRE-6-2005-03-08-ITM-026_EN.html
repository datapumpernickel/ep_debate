<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wieland (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report that makes an appearance in this House every year is not a final report; it is both a report on work in progress and an expression of self-imposed standards for the quality control of the work we do in the Committee on Petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, I should like to say – without any of the flourish customary in this House – that we are in fact pleasingly efficient, when you compare our work with that of many committees on petitions at national level. When the ministers for foreign affairs say that Europe needs a telephone number for the world, we can safely say that the European Parliament already has a letterbox for citizens. We have done a very good job from various points of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we have some degree of overview of various national structures. Secondly, it is fully within our remit to intervene in processes implemented with varying degrees of success – Lisbon and Tampere, to name but two – which have not yet become well-established and are still in a state of flux. We are able to act on a number of abuses, with the Commission’s help, and thus also to showcase the reality of the European Union behind all the governmental channels.</p>
<p class="contents">A further reason why we are not doing so badly is that, compared with the national parliaments, we have very little obligation to follow majority or minority opinions, very little obligation to take account of protection and support for the relevant governing party.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we should be striving for improvements, very general quality criteria for our work with regard to third parties. Firstly – and this is one of the demands made in the report – there should be a substantial shortening of the deadline for action by the Commission in response to our enquiry. Secondly, the deadline for a response by the Council or an individual Member State to the Commission should also be shortened.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also very much like a representative of the relevant Presidency to participate in the work of the Committee on Petitions. In addition, we should like to see the appointment of a Presidency representative or coordinator responsible for petitions, ideally as early as six months before the start of the Presidency, to enable important petitions to be followed up in time.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must take action on the issue of the distinction between the European Ombudsman – for which we now have staffing rights – as an institution, and the Committee on Petitions as an instrument. I think that there is still a good measure of misconception in this regard. If we can be more clearly identified, we will undoubtedly be better placed to carry out our respective duties.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have to consider not only outward-looking, but also inward-looking, quality criteria. By its very nature, the Committee on Petitions is a committee that is unique in terms of the extent and range of the work that comes its way. I know that quite a few Members have certain reflexes regarding this unique committee and think that we expect to be given special treatment, but, in my opinion, it is in the interests of the European Parliament and of every single Member that we are able to deal with the petitions submitted as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I said that the work of the Committee on Petitions is good on balance, it must nevertheless be said that individual Members sometimes see the work as positively unsatisfactory. Deficiencies are present and initial actions have been identified in three areas. The first relates to the staff. In our opinion, the committee has insufficient staff to achieve continuity in its work in terms of content and procedures. Quite colloquially, I would say that the House’s administration sometimes gives the impression of seeing the role of the services of the Committee on Petitions as that of a punishment battalion. This should be changed. We also need to improve the software system that we have.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Members of the European Parliament have an intense desire for more specialisation in this work and, thirdly, the public have an interest in seeing a more rigorous approach with regard to the timescales mentioned above and also greater transparency. They are entitled to see an improvement in the way they are able to track the progress of their petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">Various initiatives are in place to do justice to the extent, range and specialisation of our work. The extent and range of the Union’s policies are growing, and specialisation sometimes involves difficult details. In view of the course of the process, we need to be able to take decisions in good time. We have therefore proposed, as a result of our deliberations, that an ad hoc committee be set up to work out further details for the next annual report. Commissioner, we invite you most warmly to participate in this working party and to monitor its work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission welcomes this report.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate represents a good opportunity to highlight why the right to petition the European Parliament is such an important way for Europeans to exercise their democratic rights. It must be said straight away that citizens’ exercise of the right to petition does not just concern the European Parliament. The petitions also represent a valuable opportunity for the Commission to get closer to citizens and their concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Although no less than 1 313 petitions were tabled in the 2003-2004 period, it is clear that many citizens remain unaware of their right to petition. Therefore I very much welcome the fact that the European Parliament is currently considering how this can be remedied and I can assure the Committee on Petitions and the rapporteur that they enjoy the total support of the Commission in that effort.</p>
<p class="contents">On that note, the Commission would like to congratulate the committee on its excellent work. It is also very satisfactory to note the rapporteur’s assessment that cooperation between the Commission and the Committee on Petitions is generally good.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, of course, always scope for improvement, and I agree with the rapporteur on the need to further strengthen the partnership between the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman, the Council and the Commission. I know this is particularly important since, due to resource constraints, the Committee on Petitions often has to rely on the resources of the Commission and the Council to give its petitions in-depth legal consideration. I can assure Parliament that the Commission is pursuing its efforts to rationalise and accelerate internal procedures in response to requests for information.</p>
<p class="contents">As underlined in the report, the draft Constitutional Treaty confirms the right to petition. In that context, the report refers to the need to establish common rules of conduct for all Community institutions and Member States. It also suggests that this could be done along the lines of the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour drawn up by the European Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can largely endorse this approach, although it draws attention to the anticipated development of the legal framework. In particular, the text of the future Constitution introduces a legal basis that will make requests to the Committee on Petitions possible on the basis of the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also calls on the Council and the Commission to review the 1989 interinstitutional agreement concluded with the European Parliament by an exchange of letters. Such a review would aim to define a stronger framework for cooperation between the three institutions. The Commission is open to that request.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should reiterate that I am committed to improving the way the European Union in general and the Commission in particular communicate with European citizens. The right of EU citizens to good administration and access to documents and their right to submit complaints to the European Ombudsman and file petitions with the European Parliament all benefit communication and, ultimately, democracy. I am available to talk to the European Parliament at any time, at the invitation of Parliament or any of its committees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, I am pleased to see you, a female Member of the Commission, here on International Women’s Day. First of all, however, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Wieland, for his excellent report. Not only does it reflect the work of the Committee on Petitions, but it is also very informative and, above all, citizen-friendly and readable – which cannot be said about all the documents in this House. My essential concern remains, however, how we can communicate to the public the Community’s nature as something founded upon the rule of law. One of the reasons for the excessively critical attitude towards the Community on the part of the public in a good few Member States is that it makes grand promises of rights and freedoms for EU citizens, but often fails to actually implement these completely, correctly and promptly. There is still a considerable discrepancy between the EU blessings heralded to citizens with great fanfare and the way the law stands in everyday life.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the options open to citizens looking to fight these abuses? One of them is their right to table petitions to the European Parliament. Anchored in the Treaties and the new Constitution, this is one of the key Union civil rights, which is all the more important given that the Community is still not comparable with a State based on the rule of law, with all the attendant possibilities for enforcement. For this reason, we need to work on building a Community with a real, lasting basis in the rule of law for individual citizens and enterprises, and also, as an initial step, on enabling EU civil rights to be enforced via the Committee on Petitions. The first precondition for this is fast procedures with tangible results, which means infringement proceedings, too, with compensation for individuals. The second is that the right of petition be made easier to use and more citizen-friendly, and the third is that all the Community institutions support it. I see that as also meaning greater Council involvement, with it being present at sessions, and also the inclusion of Member States when it comes to their transposition of Community law. Only this way can we be sure to build a Europe for citizens and with them, rather than without them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As a member of the Committee on Petitions, may I say that it is a really good example of a cross-party, consensual approach to problem-solving. However, Member States’ responses are often inadequate. Sometimes they are simply not forthcoming. The Council is rarely present in the committees. However, recognition is due to the Commission officials who regularly brief our committee for the work we are undertaking. The committee is a brilliant interface between the citizens and the institutions and it brings forward solutions to problems at both EU and Member State level. Member States’ intransigence is also highlighted. I would, at this point, also like to pay tribute to our current chairman Mr Libicki, who has carried on the good work of our previous chairman.</p>
<p class="contents">There is only one element in Mr Wieland’s report with which I could perhaps quibble, and that is his reference in paragraph 17 to a standing working group or subcommittee. This is, after all, a report on the previous year’s deliberations and we should not undermine the role or the work of the Bureau and its coordinators. But I look forward to seeing how we can address the issue of the increasing number of petitions that we have to deal with. You will not have heard this from me before, Commissioner, but in that regard we will need additional resources. Without the resources, we cannot serve our citizens. The secretariat is severely understaffed, but again I have to pay tribute to its staff. They work extremely hard and supply us with everything we need, but their job would be a lot easier if the secretariat was fully staffed. We also need additional resources to promote the right of petition, especially in the new Member States, and to ensure that, where necessary, the Commission is fully willing and able to enforce the infringement process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must never forget that the right to petition enshrined in the Treaties is an important example of the exercise of citizens’ democratic rights and their ability to hold the institutions and their Member States to account.</p>

<p class="contents">I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Wieland for his good work as rapporteur for the annual report on the Committee of Petitions. This report is the first for this Parliament and because of the new Members it provides Parliament with extra information about the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">This committee is the most direct link between voters and Parliament. It is like an ongoing dialogue, in which citizens should feel that they are being taken seriously and can have confidence in the EU. In fact petitions are a strong tool for democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wieland’s report reflects the serious need to develop the ability and capacity of the committee to deal with situations in which cooperation with the Commission does not work and/or the Commission does not take appropriate action. It must be stressed that, in developing the ability of the Committee on Petitions to deal with those situations, the committee will need the support of Parliament as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Against that background, Mr Hammerstein Mintz tabled a few amendments to the report by Mr Wieland, which he as rapporteur and the committee as a whole unanimously supported. That is very important. They point out, firstly, that under the Nice Treaty, Parliament has the right to bring action against the Commission, for example, on the grounds of lack of competence; infringement of essential procedural requirements; infringement of the EC Treaty and of any rule of law relating to its application; and misuse of powers, irrespective of whether Parliament’s prerogatives are concerned. Thus the committee is also putting forward for Parliament’s approval a statement that it is considered legitimate for Parliament to exercise its powers under Article 230 of the EC Treaty if this is necessary in order to put an end to a serious infringement of Community law that has been reviewed in the examination of a petition, and where a significant difference of interpretation persists – in spite of efforts to resolve it – between Parliament on the one hand and the Commission on the other, as regards the actions required by Community law for the protection of citizens’ rights in the case concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Libicki, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the UEN Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(PL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pity that today’s debate on this report is being held so late in the evening. It may well be the case that not all Members of the House need to hear what we have to say, but I believe it is important that the public should have the chance to do so, even though there is unfortunately no one at all in the public gallery. The reason for this is that our committee differs from all the others. It was set up with the express aim of making contact with people and with society. The fact that people nowadays often feel bewildered and further removed than ever from the European institutions makes it all the more important that this committee allows them to feel part of the European Union’s workings and its legislation, and provides them with an opportunity to resolve their problems. I would therefore repeat that I think it is a great pity that we are holding this debate so late, in an entirely empty Chamber, and that so few people are present to hear the debate on Mr Wieland’s excellent report. I should also like to thank him for this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, one point I should like to emphasise is that the number of petitions submitted to our committee has risen for the first time in the committee’s ten-year history, or in other words since 1995. After staying at more or less the same level during this ten-year period, there has recently been a sharp increase in petitions submitted. Yet despite this fact, our committee is doing a good job. This can be seen by comparing the length of time previously taken to deal with petitions with the length of time taken today. There are a number of bodies whose work helps the committee to do such a good job. These include the Bureau, comprising a chairman, a position I have the honour of occupying, and the vice-chairmen. I should like to highlight the role played Mr Cashman as the committee’s first vice-chairman, and the very positive contribution he makes to its work. Other bodies involved in the committee’s work include the coordinators, who play a key statutory role, and who perform their task very competently. The committee also has a secretariat, which does an extremely good job. I believe that this arrangement, namely a Bureau, comprising a chairman and vice-chairmen, together with coordinators and a secretariat, allows the committee to discharge adequately the duties incumbent upon it. Proof of this can be seen in the ever shorter amount of time we require to carry out our work, as well as in the fact that the length of time citizens have to wait is constantly being reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">The only other point I have to make is that we are delighted at the excellent cooperation that exists between the committee and the European Commission. I should like to inform the Commissioner, however, that if at all possible we would welcome more rapid responses in certain cases. It sometimes takes a relatively long time to receive an answer on matters that are quite straightforward. Furthermore, Commission officials sometimes provide oral answers and tell us that written answers will follow, yet we cannot give a full and binding answer to petitioners on the basis of an oral answer.</p>
<p class="contents">Many thanks, Mr President, and I should also like to thank all those who contribute to the work of our committee. I should like to thank Mr Wieland, who is an outstanding and active member of the committee, and I should also like to thank Mrs Wallström for being present. Many thanks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is up to us to ensure that citizens do not lose their trust in the institutions which we support and try to apply to the majority of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Petitions – and the rapporteur gives an excellent presentation of its work and its problems – emphasises the need for greater attention, respect and reinforcement of the services within the framework of its operation, both during preliminary work and during the processing of petitions, but is, nonetheless, important.</p>
<p class="contents">Citizens often complain about delays. There is clearly a great deal of red tape in numerous Member States, which refuse or are unable to respond to the Commission's requests that they speed up the procedures for sending the information from which the Commission will draw its conclusions and judge accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">We are disappointing the citizens. We are causing them, in this way, to disdain the institutions and functions of Parliament. We keep them away from knowledge. They lose their trust and, as time goes by, they turn their back on us.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not our role. The rapporteur proposes, denounces and clearly records the experiences of one year. I, for my part, appreciate that the Committee on Petitions and its cooperation with the ombudsman and his services needs to be galvanised into greater action, given that, according to the initial data, there has been an increase in petitions in the order of 40% compared with the previous year. There needs to be a qualitative increase in information for citizens and this will be achieved through cooperation between the competent European institutions, by which I mean between the European Parliament, the Committee on Petitions, the ombudsman and his counterparts in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The authority of the Committee on Petitions depends on the respect that we show towards the four hundred and fifty million citizens who turn to us in the knowledge that procedures and appraisals, decisions and judgments come before interests and personal conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">We always talk very highly of you, Commissioner, and I want to ask a question. How do you believe that the application of the justification of citizens is safeguarded by the Member States following the Commission's decision? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
