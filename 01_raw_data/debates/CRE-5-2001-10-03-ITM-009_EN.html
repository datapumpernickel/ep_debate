<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berès (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, before I give my comments as rapporteur, I would like to make an objection and ask you to refer it to the Conference of Presidents. In my view, it is absurd to have this debate now, when we had the debate on the Stability Pact this afternoon, and in the meantime, the Conference of Presidents thought it would be worthwhile to find time for a debate on television without frontiers. This does not help to make our work more coherent.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are about to debate has come at a crucial moment. On 21 September 2001, the European Council acknowledged the importance of the subjects we discuss and assisted us by requesting, for the first time, that the Commission prepare a recommendation on the economic situation of the euro area following the events of 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people might believe that it has been easier to organise economic policy coordination during a period of growth. This was not intentional, even though there have been many fortunate coincidences, such as tax cuts in various Member States, which we can now welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, we are faced with genuine external shocks, even though the consequences of the slowdown in the United States were already challenging us on the basis of our growth, economic policy coordination is becoming even more difficult, and even more necessary, because, at the other end of the spectrum, European policy now amounts to monetary policy and also because Mr Duisenberg, in the wake of the events of 11 September, made a commitment with his US counterpart to coordinate economic areas.</p>
<p class="contents">As the changeover to euro notes and coins draws near, we must make economic and monetary union manage on its own two feet. This is what we invited the Commission to do with its communication, which we welcome. A great deal has already been done and there is still a great deal to do. Member States must conduct their policy in a responsible and autonomous manner. Coordination, however, must help to make this policy as consistent as possible and mutually beneficial. This is what the changeover to the euro represents.</p>
<p class="contents">The report that I am commending to Parliament echoes the Commission communication and indicates a number of options, which we believe are essential. First of all, this coordination depends on the Eurogroup and its president, who, we must be able to believe, speaks on behalf of the whole group. Next, the Commission must have an essential role but it cannot approach this as if it were one of its, say, conventional areas of competence. In some ways, this role is more political, in which the Commission must display its ability to make innovative proposals, to develop medium-term prospects. And the European Parliament must be the public forum for debate on economic policy coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve this, three courses of action are needed. First of all, we need indicators, harmonised statistics and barometers for the euro area. An economic policy for the euro area is impossible unless we have good instruments to navigate by. I am also aware that some Member States are having a debate on the cost-effectiveness of the indicators. We are clearly in favour of spending a small amount of money so that the indicators can be more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, the second crucial point is the exchange of information, on which Eurogroup members have made a start. We believe it is essential to go further, to take advantage of everything that could enable peer evaluation, with the option of asking the Commission to carry out an assessment of the impact of measures proposed by a Member State as part of its budgetary, fiscal or structural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, we must improve the quality and the coherence of all aspects of the debate. Economic policy coordination in the national parliaments must be integrated. This means integrating the broad economic policy guidelines into the debate on national budgets. It also means that a national debate must be based on the stability programmes. This also means that before we discuss the broad economic policy guidelines in the European Parliament, we want to hear the views of our colleagues in the national parliaments. I shall conclude, Mr President, by saying that this also means we hope to see the President of the Eurogroup come before the relevant parliamentary committee as often as is necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Peijs (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the Commission Communication on public finances is now, some time after its publication, particularly topical. The economy is slowing down, partly of its own accord, partly through laxity on the part of major Member States, and on top of this there are the after-effects of the tragic events of 11 September. These things have again, for the first time in a while, put pressure on the public finances of the Member States. History has taught us that considerable public expenditure can lead to major inefficiency, to too high a claim on the capital market and to excessive taxation, and very rarely to higher employment. All these aspects can seriously hinder the healthy development of the private sector and consequently hamper growth in employment grounded in supply and demand.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost ten years ago, the European Heads of State and Government acknowledged this development, and agreed in Maastricht to work on a sustainable budgetary position. If Member States join together in a large monetary zone, albeit with coordination of economic policy, but without real political union, they must adhere to their agreements. Thanks to instruments made available to the ECB, the latter can influence the stability of prices and, along with this, the living conditions of people in the Euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">Further to a discussion in the Preparatory Committee, I would once again like to underline that price stability, along with controlled inflation, contributes to a sustained purchasing power at the bottom of the wage structure and to an incentive to return to work. Price stability prevents the purchasing power of those of pensionable age from being eroded. It also ensures that wage increases within the labour market actually translate into more financial scope for families in Europe, and do not merely enable people to keep up with price increases, as is the case in my own country.</p>
<p class="contents">Some countries give tax cuts with one hand and take them back, in the form of VAT hikes and higher local taxes, with the other. This instils in the public a sense of distrust in politics. And the instruction to the Central Bank to monitor prices is the most effective social measure I can remember for a good few years.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the Central Bank’s pursuit of stability, the Member States’ investment and budgetary policy is critical to the living and working conditions of Europeans and to confidence in the single currency. According to President Duisenberg, the watering down of the budgetary objectives is of huge concern. You yourself, Commissioner, called key countries including Germany, France, Italy and Portugal to account and reminded them of their duties. And in those same countries, the idea of extending the Stability Pact is being mooted.</p>
<p class="contents">Let one thing be clear, however: the financial markets are closely watching the Member States in terms of how they are dealing with their budgets in a declining economy. The countries which did nothing when it was economically possible, are now, of course, struggling the most to observe the Stability Pact. Needless to say, it is unrealistic to expect that they will now increase taxes or curb spending, but I consider an increase in spending to be an irresponsible burden in the face of an uncertain future. Our generation must pay for its own bills, rather than pass them on to the next.</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation is a test of how sound the euro system actually is, and it is patently clear to the financial market that the public budgets are the weak link in the entire euro cycle. Governments must not be allowed to think that the euro belongs to all of us but that their budgets are purely a national matter. Furthermore, nobody has managed to explain to me what the use is of a Stability Pact which only applies to buoyant times. It is precisely in an economy that is slowing down that it is important to translate agreements into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission devotes an important proportion of its communication to future demographic developments. It is a crucial component, because an ageing population will have a great impact on future budgetary positions. And an ageing population is another reason to look after the Stability Pact. It will also mean that we will be obliged to work much more on lifelong learning in order to sustain our own professional profile. What is more, people will probably need to work well beyond the age of fifty-seven and a half, as is now mostly the case, for example in the Netherlands. In my report, I am asking for an individual path to be sketched for every Member State, so that the political tendency to indulge in short-term thinking will not prejudice the just pension and care expectations of people.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in my report, it is certainly not my intention to create the impression that public investments should not be allowed, but in the Stability Pact, 60% of the GDP has already been earmarked to meet the needs for public investments. That offers ample scope for in-depth investment in education, R&amp;D and healthcare. Finally, I would like to note that I am pleased that constructive consultation with the Group of the Party of European Socialists was possible in order to come to an acceptable compromise. Tomorrow, I will ask you whether it is possible to table an oral compromise amendment during the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, it is customary for draftspeople of the opinion to congratulate the rapporteur of the committee responsible, to express their agreement and satisfaction, and to try to highlight their contributions and/or to at least expand on a few points. Unfortunately, I will not be able to continue that practice today.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Committee on Budgets, which I have the honour of representing institutionally, I must express the profound disappointment of my committee at the treatment by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of our amendments, and please do not interpret this as in any way a personal opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets adopted its opinion unanimously while I was absent through illness. I was not even there at the final moment to defend my proposals and the opinion was therefore adopted without interference. There was not a single vote against and there was therefore no distinction of a party political nature. This is in no way a party political issue for us.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, however, has rejected our amendments en masse. Unless I am mistaken, not a single one of our amendments has warranted the approval of that majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. And we in the Committee on Budgets have the feeling, Mr President, that constructive and purely institutional contributions have been thoroughly spurned and scorned. To be frank, we can find no explanation for this systematic negative vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is true that the Commission document which is the basis of our discussion focused, shall we say, on national budgets. But when the Committee on Budgets added the Community dimension, the Commission, in particular the Commissioner present, thanked us for it and expressed its appreciation of this widening of the perspective of the Communication. Well, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has refused to open its eyes to this additional dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Why? Why does the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs deny that the European Union’s meagre budget, 1.07% of Community GDP, has been applied just as rigorously as that of the Member States? By rejecting Amendment No 7, this is what they have done.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also difficult for we budgeteers in this House to understand why, two days from the first reading of the 2001 budget, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs denies, by rejecting Amendments Nos 5 and 6, the multiplier effect of Community expenditure and the fact that it frequently acts as an example for national, regional and local authorities. If that is the economic thinking of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the coherent thing for it to do would be to withdraw all the amendments it has presented to the draft budget. That would be the most logical thing for it to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, 90 days from the physical introduction of the euro, any inkling of fiscal policy in relation to the Community budget is being sidestepped. From the point of view of the Committee on Budgets, the obvious thing to do would be to gradually strengthen the European budget and go beyond mere – necessary, but mere – coordination of the economic policies of the Member States. Some day, just as we now have a ‘Mr’ CFSP, we are convinced that we will need a ‘Mrs’ Euro, perhaps Mrs Peijs herself, and a greater European budget, in exchange for a reduction of national budgets. And in the Committee on Budgets we wonder how the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs thinks economic cycles, symmetrical and asymmetrical shocks, should be confronted, each one as it comes or all of them in a coordinated and cooperative fashion, to a certain extent using the Community budget to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Committee on Budgets, which I would remind you approved the opinion unanimously, have the impression that for the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs ideological prejudices carried more weight than the objective assessment of the economic options available.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to remind you, as a teacher of public economy, Milton Freedman, said, that we are all Post-Keynesians. He forgot about that majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of this Parliament. The motion for a resolution is only Post-Keynesian in a chronological sense, but the basis of its thinking is pre-Keynesian. It takes up elements of the monetarism of the 80s and 90s without taking account of its background. When the Maastricht Treaty was signed, perhaps all politicians, and certainly the economists, knew that we should get rid of the systematic deficit, that we needed a policy of financial rationalisation, but we also knew, since the 60s, that budgetary balance is only advisable in certain circumstances and conditions and that, in general, strict budgetary balance tends to be procyclic, that is to say that it tends to aggravate the cyclic tendency of the economy. Kennedy’s advisers, if I may go back that far, illustrated, by means of the so-called budget surplus of full employment, how a balanced budget, even in certain cases of deficit, can create recession.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask you, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my committee, to take a more open perspective, as contained in our amendments, and to include them tomorrow in the text of the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karas (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Berès, Mrs Peijs, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say a few words about each of the reports, and also something about the previous speaker's comments of course. No matter what political group he or she might belong to, I would never insinuate that a fellow Member had let himself or herself be guided by anything but objective policy considerations in reaching a decision or deciding how to vote. The majorities that prevail may vary, but since I have been following its activities, the hallmark of the work of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has been a very objective atmosphere and one very much geared to the Community's economic and monetary policy, so that the suggestion that has been made here is one that I cannot agree with and would like to refute. Nevertheless, I agree with you of course that within the euro area and also as regards our common foreign and security policy we need to speak with one voice, both internally and externally. However, and this point concerns both reports, competition is becoming an increasingly global matter. The euro will come into circulation in 89 days, and it is already the second most important currency in the world. The euro coins and notes will make the importance of this single European currency on the world market very clear. This is a very important aspect, and we must at all times be very disciplined about keeping Europe's presence on the world financial stage in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Global competition does of course require that in addition to the single market and economic and monetary union the necessary coordination needs to take place within the euro area and within the European Union as a whole. What does this mean? On the one hand it means coordination so that a strong internal market is created in the euro area and Europe becomes more competitive. On the other hand, you need to understand that it also involves maintaining freedom as the basis of competition within the framework agreed between the Member States. We are, of course, not all convinced that coordination in itself is a panacea, because we also need to consider where coordination starts. What mechanisms does coordination involve, and what are the limits of coordination? Does coordination inhibit the functioning of the market or support it? This is undisputedly a debate that we need to hold, as decisions cannot simply be taken under the heading of coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are in favour of more debates on European issues in national parliaments, in favour of coordination by the Statistical Office of the European Communities and enhanced links with national statistical bodies, and in favour of mutual exchange of information as a means of achieving joint tasks. However, we naturally oppose increased bureaucracy, the setting up of new bodies and higher expenditure on bureaucracy masquerading as coordination. We need more efficiency and professionalism in the structures that already exist in order to improve what we do jointly. That does not mean reducing freedom of action and freedom of decision making in the Member States. And we also oppose the information that has leaked out about tax collection or the use of tax income, because we believe that there is no legal basis for that either.</p>
<p class="contents">I have simply highlighted two issues that we need to debate further. We will be voting for the report, but not all the details about what is meant and what mechanisms are necessary have been clarified. I would like to say one more thing to Mrs Berès: it is important that you have tackled the issue of the link between public finances and reducing inflation, and thus touched on the subject of assessing the financial markets. We need to give public finances a clean bill of health again, so that we increase the investment capital at our disposal, and I therefore call on everyone mentioned in the report to do their homework properly and not just take cosmetic measures! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In all instances where we already have sensible coordination of our economic policies in the European Union, we have chalked up enormous successes. Government budgets over the last year have for the first time in decades shown a surplus, and that still holds good, Mrs Peijs, if we exclude exceptional income from the sale of mobile telephone licences.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that we should play this down in today's debate. The success stories in the current year will not be so great. That is because growth in the European Union has slowed down, but that is no reason to start harping on about inflation. Nor is it any reason to start panicking. No one can calm down our friends in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats. No one – not in this House anyway – wants to print money. No one wants to print money as a way of solving finance policy problems. We only want to print money to provide the public with our new currency, the euro, on time, but nobody here is talking about an inadequate budgetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, you know that too. That is not what is at stake here! Essentially, it is about something quite different. You know very well that, in the past, these budget consolidation successes that I have been talking about were not achieved by increasing income but by cutting expenditure. Those expenditure cuts led to a positive result, but also had negative affects. In many areas, public infrastructure is in a state of decay. In many places social networks are under great pressure and our investment patterns both in the private sector and in the public sector have led to key strategic deficiencies in comparison with our competitors on the world scene.</p>
<p class="contents">We now find ourselves in a situation in which government receipts will decline for cyclical reasons. So the vital question is this: what should we do in that situation? Are you really seriously envisaging further global cuts in public sector income and expenditure? Do you really want to freeze budgets so that we fail to make the investment necessary for our future? Do you want the European Union to enter a further procyclical phase which will prevent us from benefiting from long-term growth overall?</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot imagine that that is what you want. Mr von Wogau asked me at lunchtime today what the Socialists really want. I can give him an answer: we want to stop these scare tactics! We want to put an end to talk that recovery in Europe is always just short-term, because if the central banks or governments are running scared, we will lose long-term opportunities. We have tabled amendments that we think are sensible. If you can agree to compromise with us, then we can find a common path. And if that is not possible, we will go our separate ways! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I feel compelled to relate this afternoon’s debate to the subjects of these reports, above all by referring to the current economic situation. It is clear that over the first few months of this year, the slow-down of the American economy has had more influence than was initially expected, and that the terrible terrorist attacks on New York and Washington have further worsened these prospects through needs for economic intervention which are truly new, urgent and no doubt justified.</p>
<p class="contents">The strain of the situation, however, should not lead us to justify greater public intervention or, as the President-in-Office of the Council has said very correctly, to abandon or lose sight of the need to continue with the structural reforms which the European economy still needs if it is really going to be competitive on an international level.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that confidence will be recovered in the economic field as soon as possible and that the current special situation will be overcome, and we will shortly find that we have the same requirements that we had three months ago, that is, to consolidate the European economy, to make it more competitive in accordance with the Lisbon criteria, to strengthen coordination and, as we have often said to Commissioner Solbes, to have a genuine economic and monetary approach and policy, as the existence of the euro and monetary union demands.</p>

The explanatory statement of Mrs Peijs' report is very interesting because it explains the background.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to beware of chasing the American economic model. One of the things that has made many people within the European Union hostile to the euro is that they have seen its introduction as linked to cuts in public expenditure. We have seen, with the American economic model, the prioritising of the private and the cutting of the public. The result has been a tremendous disparity between rich and poor and high levels of child poverty – unlike in countries which invest in social expenditure and reduce the wealth gap. We know that child poverty is linked to poorer educational attainment, poorer job prospects and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also seen in that economy a reduction of job security and longer working hours, with the introduction of a flexible contract culture. In the UK, contracting out at lower cost quite often means compensatory tax measures at the lower end of pay, a public subsidy to poor wages from poor employers. The American model also represents an unsustainable pattern of consumption, which will have an economic impact in the longer term. My group believes that Mrs Peijs' report does not look sufficiently at the quality of the contribution of public finances. So we cannot support the report in its current form. Hence the amendments we have tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that it is very difficult to measure the benefits of public expenditure in the same way we look at the balance sheet of a private health care company for example. Public expenditure is an investment in social cohesion and we are gradually coming to recognise the costs of not investing in that. Indeed, a priority for the European Union now is combating social exclusion. We count as an economic success private spending to compensate for the lack of public expenditure. Every burglar alarm bought, for example, is because we feel we are not safe.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree that we need to reduce the cost of employing people and to focus on lifting taxation costs for the poorer paid, many of whom are women. But we also need to reduce working hours as part of increasing employment opportunities. It is clear to us that a knowledge-based society which tackles social exclusion – we have to remember that Lisbon also said that – needs greater investment. And where will that come from if there is no significant public expenditure? Employers increasingly want ready-trained employees as part of the flexible contract culture. We consider that public investments can have a very positive value and can help to shift the direction of our economy, as we recognise our ecological responsibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What has caused this increase in government expenditure? Is it because public services have been improved, the number of hospitals has increased, additional hospital staff have been hired, public transport and national education have been developed, sufficient social housing has been built? No, it certainly is not! Over the past 20 years, many governments have, on the contrary, privatised services that used to be public. All these governments have pursued money-saving policies with regard to essential public services, have got rid of railway lines, local post offices or hospitals, which are not considered to be profitable.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason that government expenditure has increased is because of the extravagant sums of money given to employers on a multitude of pretexts, ranging from direct subsidies for reducing taxes and social contributions to giving all types of support – all government authorities seem to excel at making these up. Mrs Peijs cynically proposes making this policy worse by further reducing employers’ social burdens and increasing VAT. The poorest people are being made to pay in order to give money to the richest – if this is not brutal and direct class politics then it is hard to imagine what else it can be. I shall of course be voting against this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In recent months the global economic climate has been the cause of some concern. We in Europe are certainly not immune to economic downturns in the United States. The tragic events that took place in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on 11 September have undoubtedly further shaken economic confidence. In Ireland, as in all Member States, we remain committed to maintaining current budgetary levels. The reaffirmation of this commitment at Liège will allow the EU to better address cyclical fluctuations.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome also the statement by the Commissioner that governments will be able to use automatic stabilisers in the context of a slow-down in growth. Indeed, in Ireland, we continue to run a budget surplus which affords us some room for manoeuvre. The Irish stability programme is central to the budgetary process in Ireland. It is discussed in Daíl Éireann and is a key component of our annual budget. The primary objective of the Irish budget and stability programme is the continuation of sustainable economic growth, supported by moderate inflation and competitive wage developments, reflecting our national agreement with the social partners known as the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House knows, the Ecofin Council this year, on a proposal from Commissioner Solbes, issued a recommendation to Ireland stating that she did not comply with last year's EU broad economic guidelines on fiscal policy. The Irish government contends that its budgetary policy seeks to achieve economic stability by securing the continuation of social partnership and also by taking action to reduce price inflation, including indirect tax reductions. We must look to the future. Our immediate concern is the successful launch of the euro on 1 January. But the single currency is not an end in itself. It is conceived to facilitate a true single market for goods and services.</p>
<p class="contents">The grand project requires a high level of cooperation and coordination. National governments must retain the prerogative to formulate a budget which best addresses the particular and specific economic situation of their country at that time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I shall mainly confine myself to the report by Mrs Berès.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Monetary Union is accompanied by a certain level of coordination in the field of budgets. However, coordination which goes beyond what is necessary for the EMU deserves to be questioned. Further coordination can only be justified through sound reasoning, but this is lacking in both the Commission communication and in the Berès report.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, situations which require coordination. The Commission mentions resistance to shocks as an example. A recent illustration is the granting of subsidies to airline companies following the attack in the United States. This is an excellent example of decisive action on the part of the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">Coordination which goes beyond what is required will even prove counterproductive. Labour participation, company policy, taxes – these are all matters which should fall within the remit of the Member States. In substance, they give little reason for more coordination at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Coordination of economic policy should not be used as a red herring. After all, it is evident that times of economic adversity make it more difficult for the Member States to adhere to the EMU’s underlying principle: the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">The much-needed structural reforms should help meet the budgetary criteria. Member States cannot afford to postpone using this instrument in order to obtain more permanent and responsible growth. This growth is vital in order to secure the Stability Pact. The need for reform is therefore all the more pressing.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, therefore, with good reason that the report does not nominate many concrete matters for coordination. It is always useful to exchange information on economic policy decisions. More important, however, is the quality of the decisions <span class="italic">per se</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">The report does not comment on the motives for closer cooperation. This does nothing to help the case for coordination. With the EMU, the European economies should not lose their own economic policies, tailored to their specific dynamics and character. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rarely does one see such excellent reports. I wish to focus on two matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The public finances of a State in the euro area are no longer the private affairs of that State. Any budgetary imbalances in an individual State, particularly a large one, may have an impact on the stability of the entire euro area. For this reason, recent attempts to water down measures to reform state economies are worrying. Many governments in recent years have relaxed their budgetary efforts, relying mainly on cyclical receipts, such as the proceeds from mobile telecommunications system auctions. The consolidation process is still far from being complete, however. The future objective is for a ‘close to balance’ or ‘in surplus’ budgetary position. Member States must honour the commitments of the stability and convergence programmes unconditionally.</p>
<p class="contents">It will take perseverance and determination to balance public finances. It will make us susceptible to populist criticisms of thinking of the economy like an accountant or balancing the economy one-sidedly. Nevertheless, this is what we have to focus on. Politicians have to take a few blows after all, but our economy will not be able to take a left hook.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the rise in public expenditure in the last few decades has caused the governments of several of the Member States to increase taxation and social welfare contributions, which were already at an unendurably high level in Europe. Simultaneously, the potential for economic growth has been weakening throughout this period. That Last Mohican of orthodox communism, my colleague Mrs Bordes, could also stop talking about class war in this, the third millennium, and admit that the contribution of each and every European to the economy is important. For that reason, work must be financially motivating and the benefits of different social welfare schemes at such a level that they safeguard the basic necessities of a normal, decent life, but provide an incentive for becoming active in all situations. Only in this way can we achieve the ambitious aims of Lisbon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Randzio-Plath (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, the challenges of globalisation make it clear to us just how important coordination of economic policies is for Europe, and also the integration of financial, employment and social policies, because little Europe is demonstrating to the world that it is possible to make progress in a region if regional cooperation does not just mean intergovernmental cooperation and is not just a free trade area. I believe that the combination of the single market on the one hand and certain possibilities for giving political direction on the other is what makes the European Union what it is. I therefore very much welcome the Commission communication and Mrs Berès's report, as they make it very clear that we need to make further progress with the coordination process. We all know that the challenges and demands on us are now even greater than ever. ECOFIN has quite rightly made sure that more integrated approaches are now being adopted, especially in the field of capital movements.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly important that we should not just act in unison and improve the quality of coordination, but that we should also agree on guidelines. Fortunately, the Lisbon process, which was taken further in Stockholm, has given us both quantitative and qualitative objectives. Of course these still need to be extended and refined, but it enables us to demonstrate to the public that the coordination process can lead to positive outcomes. If you could not say that, who would be interested in checking if all the Member States have actually met the requirements to which they have committed themselves?</p>
<p class="contents">One aspect of the commitments that they have entered into is the consolidation of their budgets. Mr Bullmann was quite right to point out the progress made in this area. It is certainly true that there is still more to be done in reducing debt in some Member States, but we should not forget that the Stability and Growth Pact exists as an instrument to prevent us ever exceeding a deficit of 3% of GNP. That is at the heart of the convergence criteria and this deficit is intended to help us to achieve a favourable monetary policy that promotes development. I believe that coordination can be enhanced still further, and that all those policies which can mutually or reciprocally support each other should be brought into this coordination process.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that it is a particularly good thing that the European Parliament can call on the national parliaments to take part in the coordination process and I really wish to emphasise that point. We, as a committee, have attempted to constantly highlight this cooperation with national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to make one final comment. We should not see the coordination of policies as an end in itself. We, in Europe, have missed out on growth because over the last few decades coordination has been lacking. We lost out because we did not adopt a coordinated approach to the UMTS auction. We could have achieved a totally different outcome. Nor did we react jointly when the OPEC countries raised oil prices. There is no doubt that we could have achieved a more favourable starting point for economic development if we had acted in a more coordinated way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The conclusion is drawn from this that the Americans do not hinder the activities of private companies through taxation as much as Europeans do and, in accordance with low levels of public expenditure, they have not, like us, promoted action plans, introduced bureaucratic systems or tried to guide their economic operators, who have therefore been able to dedicate themselves purely to working and generating wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that this analysis does not take account of the very important fact that, over the last 30 years, levels of public investment in the European Union have been reduced to 2% of our GDP in 2000, while in the United States they have maintained a sustainable level and represent 3% of their GDP. If we add to this the fact that our per capita GDP stands at 65% of American GDP, it turns out that their average investment per citizen each year is 2.3 times greater than ours, and this is a more than notable difference which explains the differing developments of our respective economies.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the short-term solution for Europe is not to reduce taxes, but rather, while achieving balanced budgets and no deficit, we must adjust our current public expenditure and increase public investment in viable projects, modernising our infrastructures, supporting technological research and development, involving research institutes and universities in private initiative and promoting training and knowledge in our society.</p>
<p class="contents">What is completely unacceptable is the policy of the Spanish central government of Mr Aznar, which covers up its real budgetary deficit by financing it with revenue, with the monthly contributions of workers integrated into the state social security system, which compromises even further the uncertain future of pensions, and the workers who are currently contributing do not know whether they will receive those pensions on retirement. This is unacceptable and must be condemned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only because of the events in the US did I sit that day with mixed feelings, but also with a feeling of: what is this all about?</p>
<p class="contents">With the ever growing internationalisation of the economy, certainly in a country like the Netherlands, it is noticeable that at national level, there is, in fact, little room for economic manoeuvre. It is, of course, possible to place accents, and I welcome the Dutch government’s proposal to step up investment in the public sector. However, the scope remaining to make a real difference is relatively limited and is determined at entirely different levels. One feels far closer to this in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I felt completely at home as regards the way in which such a budget is prepared in the Netherlands. It is based on sound analyses and prognoses issued by what we still term the Central Planning Bureau, and broad, medium-term recommendations by the Socio-Economic Council in which independent experts, social partners and the Dutch Bank work in harmony. In this way, a government can make plans which receive broad support and which can be effective.</p>
<p class="contents">The paradox of the phase which we are at with European cooperation, is that, although the political control of the socio-economic policy has been moved onto a European plane, the instruments and procedures for this are still located at national level. Neither the European political structure, nor the European actors are prepared for this. Unfortunately, for I am convinced that Europe is in need of such sound and broad socio-economic coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore pleased with Mrs Berès’ report. She makes proposals for improved coordination within the euro countries, for greater involvement of national policy-makers and parliaments and for better harmonisation among the various actors at European level. I would particularly like to underline the role of the macro-economic dialogue which must be afforded a far higher profile, also in the preparation of the broad economic guidelines. A broader debate thereafter, also involving national parliaments, is important.</p>
<p class="contents">This concludes my comments on the Berès report. I would once again invite Mrs Peijs to deal with the amendments which we tabled so as to reach a compromise after all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think, however, that after the tragic events of 11 September the proposed measures and experiments should be implemented much sooner if we want the monetary union to fully perform the role that awaits it in fighting terrorism, maintaining economic growth and the competitiveness of Europe, and affirming a policy of peace and international cooperation that will isolate terrorism in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I refer first of all to the need to face the slow-down in economic growth by means of coordination of our economic and social policies, countering the economic cycle. This can be achieved through enhanced cooperation measures between Eurogroup members, resulting in a real government by agreement of the monetary union, able to question decisions by the European Central Bank with an authority at least as great as that shown a few weeks ago by the United States Federal Reserve.</p>
<p class="contents">I also refer to the urgent need within the monetary union above all to achieve the greatest transparency and a reciprocal information system on movements of capital, overcoming the restrictions of bank secrecy so as to be able, Mr Karas, to strike at the transfer of resources linked to terrorist funding, the laundering of dirty money from organised crime, and the offence of tax evasion.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall close, Mr President, by also mentioning an international cooperation policy which will allow long-term contracts for supplying Europe with raw materials to be drawn up also in euro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs very much. There is no doubt that what has been said this evening is going to help us in our subsequent work.</p>
<p class="contents">I will begin by commenting on the Bères report and I would like to express my satisfaction with Parliament’s motion for a resolution which supports the strengthening of economic policy coordination within the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that economic policy coordination is an obligation laid down in the Treaty. The Treaty makes it very clear that our model is based on a single monetary policy and on national, but coordinated, economic policies. This is a key element of our model.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that coordination is still going through a learning phase. It is also true that we have increasingly greater interdependence – especially in the euro area but also in the Union in general – and this requires that the content, the systems and the instruments we use are constantly being reviewed. That is why I must especially welcome the report which Parliament has produced and salute Mrs Bères and all of those members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs who have participated in her magnificent work. I believe that this work, in many respects, goes further than the Commission’s proposal, particularly with regard to one fundamental aspect, the increase in national participation in economic policy coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight two essential elements of the report – and I will comment on the various interventions in relation to them. The first is the need to strengthen coordination, the second the need to increase the democratic debate and national participation.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the content of the coordination, I think it is worth expanding on certain points. The report supports the Commission’s proposals on the production of periodic reports on the economy of the euro area. Today I can tell you that our idea – we have continued to work on this issue – is that we must have detailed economic analyses but also relevant proposals on economic policy. We must go further than specific analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">In her speech, Mrs Bères raised the need to improve statistics and the assessment of policies. It is true that we have made progress with the statistical plans for the Union’s monetary area, however, we must go further. It is partly a problem of bringing national statistics into line with new realities, it is partly a problem of money, but, in some cases, it is neither of these problems, but rather the problem of acquiring the data necessary for a good definition of economic policy more quickly. This perhaps means that in the future we will have to consider the need for our own statistical information which is not an aggregate of national statistics. This would certainly be a key element if we are to be able to act within a time frame similar to that available to other economic authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">She makes a reference in her report which I believe to be fundamental in relation to trying to achieve a common vision of the impact of economic cycles on public finances. We have held part of this debate today – I will comment later when I talk about the report by Mrs Peijs – but we believe it is essential for the ECOFIN Council to produce a methodology as soon as possible, allowing us to examine the concept of structural deficit by means of the same criteria. And we are working on this, which seems to us essential, precisely to allow these automatic stabilisers to come into play depending on the extent to which the budgetary situation of each of the Member States allow it, but applying the same criteria in all cases.</p>
<p class="contents">A further point relating to the first element I mentioned, the content of coordination, is that of prior information. This is a point which always gives rise to a degree of debate and discussion. When we talk about prior information, we are talking about two different things. We are talking firstly about the other partners of the Eurogroup knowing the broad guidelines for those essential elements of a national economic policy which may eventually have an affect on the rest. Let us take one case: the tax reduction measures adopted last year as a result of the oil crisis. There is no doubt that if we had acted as we have acted this year on the issue of insurance cover for airlines, we would have achieved a better result and a better approach from the point of view of the Union’s position.</p>
<p class="contents">The same can be said of the UMTSs. If we had debated, before taking the decision, how to deal with the possibilities and difficulties which one or other option with regard to licences for third-generation mobiles could pose, there is no doubt that we could have prevented some of the subsequent problems. We are not saying that we should all do the same. We are saying that we can hold discussions together in order to try to decide on a framework, which includes the different national decisions and allows us to take a more coherent position.</p>
<p class="contents">I said that there is a second aspect to prior information and that is that ministers should take Community elements into consideration when defining their national policy. And I relate this reference to the one made by Mrs Bères in relation to increasing national participation in the broad guidelines for economic policy. Until now, it has more or less been considered that we had two processes which did not necessarily converge. On the one hand, reaching an agreement on the broad guidelines for economic policy in Brussels, in Luxembourg; on the other, defining our national economic and budgetary policies. And each process took a different route. It was also believed that compliance with the Stability Pact was sufficient to satisfy the coherence and consistency of the system which we have implemented for economic policy coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">It is becoming increasingly clear to us that the two instruments we have, the Stability Pact and the broad guidelines for economic policy, are key elements. And the broad guidelines for economic policy, if they are actually approved by the ministers as a real commitment to be applied in each of the Member States, must reflect the budgetary policy which each minister wants and must present to their national Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this would help us enormously in terms of a better interrelationship between the decisions adopted at Community level and the decisions adopted by national Parliaments. In this respect, the Commission believes that this idea of the debate is essential and we will fully support it.</p>
<p class="contents">However – and this is a point which I also wanted to comment on – it is true that we should not overly complicate the procedures. Therefore, we are more cautious about certain ideas considered on the issue of macroeconomic dialogue. It is absolutely clear that we have to improve its efficiency on the level of political dialogue, but we believe that we also have to maintain its character of frank and confidential exchange and, in this respect, it is essential to maintain this informal framework for debate and not formalise its process too much by complicating it and making the whole process of debate relating to this point less productive.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to end my comments on this first report by pointing out that the services of the Commission are currently looking into the implementation of some of the proposals included in the resolution, I have taken note of a series of suggestions that have been made this evening and we are naturally going to pay particular attention to them when producing our final proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the report by Mrs Peijs, I would firstly also like to thank her for her suggestions and comments, but I would like to focus on just three or four points that I think are important.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I fully agree with the idea that, in the context of the introduction of the euro, the credibility of a healthy public finance policy which is compatible with the euro is essential. It is true that, in our view, public finances – we have said this clearly this evening – must be adequate for both crisis situations and for good economic situations. In your report you refer to automatic stabilisers – and I do not believe that there is any great divergence between us on the analysis of this point. We believe, like you, that they must play a fundamental role, both at times of growth and at times of slow-down of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are grateful for your reference to tax reductions. The Commission has been arguing that all tax reductions must respond to certain criteria, which are contained in your report, and which we believe are essential to maintaining the idea of quality of public finances. No doubt if we were to debate tax reductions now, elements such as the promotion of consumption would be of more importance than would have been the case a few months ago, given that that is one of the issues we are concerned about. But the idea of tax reductions can certainly be included in practice, in all cases, in the criteria contained in the document and which you support.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a comment on the sustainability of public finances in the long term. There have been other comments on the labour market, on how we must move ahead, on coherence in relation to work, pensions, etc. In my opinion, all these elements will be dealt with within a broader vision of the labour market, while the finance ministers must pay particular attention to public finances and, in this respect, to the difficulties which may arise in the funding of social security given the global budgetary deficits of all public administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea we are working with at the moment – and on the basis of your report, as you know, progress has already been made on some points – is not that reference be made by means of a short paragraph on the stability programmes, but that the stability programmes annually take up the necessary data to carry out an adequate evaluation of the evolution of public finances in relation to problems of ageing. Nevertheless, in our view, the idea of including this information in the stability programmes is not because we believe they are problems which must be resolved through annual decisions – they need more long-term decisions – but because we felt it was appropriate to introduce new processes for approaching, analysing and monitoring the evolution of public finances.</p>
<p class="contents">Our idea is that, every four or five years, in each country, a more in-depth analysis should be carried out – it may be a supplement to the documents from the stability programme – on long-term public finances with the obvious fundamental problem of the ageing of the population and from which, nevertheless, when updating the annual programmes we only take the most necessary basic information.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by thanking you all once again for your cooperation and the useful ideas you have offered us, which we will take into account as far as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mrs Van den Burg, in order to reach a workable compromise, we will agree on Amendment Nos 4 and 5. Amendment No 7 will be based on the text by Mr Bullmann to which a sentence will be added. That is the oral amendment I was referring to.

<p class="contents">I would now like to respond to Mr Colom i Naval. He has probably been waiting for this all evening. Mr Colom i Naval, I would like to make this quite clear: content was not the issue. The reason why we were unable to talk about this before we voted on the amendments is that I was firstly in the United States with the delegation – you will have noticed my absence in the committee at the time – and then I was in Rome with my group. It was a slightly hectic month.</p>
<p class="contents">It was not a matter of content. The fact is that the European Commission took the Member States as its point of departure in its communication. I did the same in my report. If, in your report, you were to write about the effects of the European budgetary policy on employment, then I would gladly vote in favour of all your amendments, but they did not feature in the framework of my report.
