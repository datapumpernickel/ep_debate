<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Evans, Jonathan (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, it might seem a little incongruous that we are today, at the beginning of 2005, discussing the European Commission's Report on Competition Policy for 2003. That is just because last year was election year, the debate as such is about very much wider issues.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an opportunity for Parliament to place on record, as we should, our enormous respect for the outgoing Commissioner, Mario Monti, who was the Competition Commissioner at the time of this report. It is inevitable that the report itself and Parliament's response draws upon the major programme for the reorganisation of competition policy for which Mr Monti has received so much praise.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a debate that had to take place with industry, and not just in relation to the modernisation of the anti-trust rules themselves. Industry had to recognise the purpose of this reform. The aim was to do away with a system that was in itself unnecessarily bureaucratic so as to redirect the resources of the Commission to cracking down properly on hard-core cartels. In addition, we have seen the reform of the Merger Regulation, reorganisation of the merger control task force and the first steps in relation to state-aid reform. I know our new Commissioner also shares this view in relation to the legacy of Mr Monti, because only recently she has been speaking at Bocconi University and making very similar remarks about Mr Monti's contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also inevitable that we would direct our attention not just to this programme of work and the lessons to be learned from it, but also to the way in which that programme of work now affects efforts to improve Europe's competitiveness. We are not trying to change the rules about competition policy for the sake of it or as a form of bureaucratic exercise. The purpose here is to act in the interests of consumers to increase Europe's competitiveness and develop growth and jobs. That is what the operation of an effective competition policy is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say a word about the new Commissioner and I hope it does not embarrass her. Many people have asked me my opinion about the change we will have now. I suppose up to four weeks ago we were all asking that, to some extent. The Commissioner has been very active in the course of the last month. On 3 February she spoke to Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and set on record her agenda in this role. I have already referred to her speech in Milan at Mario Monti's university, and on 17 February Mrs Kroes made another speech in Paris. Taken together, these speeches <span class="italic">very</span> clearly set out the progressive agenda that the European Commission intends to take forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend the Commission for being determined to clarify the rules in relation to state-aid reform. In our report we refer to this as an area where we are seeking further action on the part of the Commission. This does not mean a situation in which the Commission just sits idly by waiting to see whether somebody is going to make a complaint about uncompetitive behaviour in some part of the economy. We want to ensure that the whole way in which business operates within Europe is one that encourages free and fair competition and consequently enhances the competitiveness of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a further area for which Mr Monti deserves special praise is his work in relation to international cooperation. We can cooperate even when we are being competitive. I well remember the reaction of some people in America a few years ago to the GE-Honeywell decision that was taken by Mr Monti. Today I had the honour of being present to hear President Bush's speech and afterwards seeing him shake the hand of Alex Schaub, the Director-General of Competition at the time that decision was made. That is an example of international cooperation. I commend the outgoing Commissioner and I look forward to the tenure of the incoming Commissioner, Commissioner Kroes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is no coincidence that today's agenda started with the Commission working paper. The President of the Commission underlined how important the work programme is for this term of the Commission. Mr Frattini took the lead by explaining the priority we attach to criminal matters and justice. And now it is for me as Competition Commissioner to explain our position on what is in Mr Jonathan Evans' report.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the support of the European Parliament, and I acknowledge the support you have given in the past to the European Commission, and especially to Mr Monti, as you rightly emphasise. There is no doubt that I have inherited a great legacy from Mr Monti. The greatest tribute I can pay him is to continue his work and build on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the leadership of President Barroso, the European Commission has recently proposed a new partnership for growth and jobs. Competition policy, as Mr Evans rightly mentioned, has a crucial role to play here. Competition is the central driving-force for competitiveness and growth, and we badly need that growth. That was clearly stated this afternoon by speakers from both right and left. If we are to deliver on the fundamental social and environmental objectives which are at the heart of our European values, then economic growth is a must.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three ways competition policy can contribute to partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, later this spring we will launch a debate on reviewing the state aid rules within the overall objective of 'less and better', which here means better focused aid. Aid should be concentrated where it can add most value: for innovation, research and development, risk capital and the development of those regions lagging furthest behind.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we will maintain a fair and firm approach to enforcement and will remain tough on cartels. There is no doubt about that. That was also Mr Monti's approach. As the report highlights, it is not acceptable to let the global advantages of the single market be undermined by cartels and other unfair business practices among a handful of undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we will look at new ways of promoting competition in the internal market, by using sector investigations and competition screening to uncover and tackle the remaining, often hidden, regulatory and private barriers to free competition.</p>
<p class="contents">In taking these priorities forward, I will take account of the helpful observations presented in the report before us. I can assure you of my commitment to ensuring an ongoing and constructive dialogue on competition issues with this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to express my appreciation of Mrs Kroes’s contribution and emphasise that I am among those who look forward with high hopes to possible further contributions of hers.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we have to be aware of the fact that what, right now, is the driving force in the European Union and in the work on developing and modernising our society is competition. We have the pressure of external competition resulting from globalisation and that of internal competition, reinforced by enlargement and the internal market. Such competition releases considerable dynamism and energy into European society, and not only where development, growth and new jobs are concerned. I also believe that it is in practice the most powerful tool for European integration when it comes to the spread of ideas, goods and services across borders. That is what is happening right now, and I believe there is a danger of our underestimating it. I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner to try also to include this dimension of the effects of competition in future competition reports. It is not only a matter of economics, but also of European cooperation in its most practical sense.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we have the task of extending the basic conditions of competition to new areas. What is at issue here is the knowledge-based society, involving research, education and health care. As Mr Evans points out in his report, it is also a question of energy and telecommunications markets. I should also like to draw the Commissioner’s attention to that part of the report that deals with the importance of also creating sound conditions for European manufacturers to compete globally and with the importance of the need, when making competition assessments, to consider the whole of the internal market and not only national and local sub-markets. Companies of the future will require a large domestic market. That is what the internal market needs to be for, and it is with this in mind that competition should be developed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the spirit of cooperation that led to consensus on almost all of the amendments that I tabled as shadow rapporteur and on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">These amendments clarified a range of points, not least that competitiveness is an essential factor in fostering growth in Europe, although this is only one of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, equally as important as cohesion and the environment. The next point was that the relationship between competition policy and state aid must be clarified; the third was that the rules regarding technology exchange agreements and research and development aid, particularly in the area of small and medium-sized enterprises, must be clarified; fourthly, that the relationship between the financial instruments linked to the Kyoto Protocol impacting at company level and competition policy must be clarified; fifthly, that the new Member States must adapt quickly to competition policy; and sixthly, that close ties are welcome between competition policy and international trade policy, both at multilateral level, within the framework of the World Trade Organisation, and at bilateral level with the main partners, including China.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are some of the proposals that were accepted. Two proposed amendments did not achieve consensus: one is to be tabled by Mrs Batzeli, and the other concerns the sentence in which the rapporteur proposes, and I quote, that ‘Parliament expresses its concern at the continued failure to achieve full liberalisation in the EU gas and electricity markets’.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that liberalisation is not an end in itself. It is a means whereby in this sector, in common with other essential supplies, the consumer enjoys the best possible conditions in terms of price, quality and universality, because those consumers are citizens, first and foremost. Liberalisation must take place within a framework that guarantees the status of gas and electricity as a public good. That is the thrust of the amendment that I had the opportunity to table.</p>

As long as the state monopolies existed in public services, they mainly served the interests of the plutocracy. However, today, within the framework of capitalist restructurings, most public services have been given – and others are going to be given – to private capital, so that their profitability can also be reinforced in this way. Consequently, the European Union's main criterion for state aid is not to cover grass-roots needs and resolve grass-roots problems, but to approve it so that big business never loses out and so that there are no repercussions on its profitability.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission proposal comes within the framework of the capital restructurings promoted by the opening of the markets on which big business will derive even more profit, while the aspects of the proposal about exemption from approval of state aid by the European Union for small services of general interest, airlines and shipping companies, are insignificant. They do not under any circumstances satisfy enhanced grass-roots needs and that is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece shall vote against the proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to suggest how she could do much better than this. Our rapporteur Mr Evans notes that the competitiveness of European business is one of the key objectives of the Lisbon Agenda. Unfortunately, too often competitiveness in the EU is too often taken to mean that every nation and every company has to suffer under the same regulatory burden or the same 'level playing field'. This is not really the same as competition. Dare I extend Mr Hökmark's remarks and suggest that if the Commission is truly interested in promoting competition it should include regulatory competition.</p>
<p class="contents">This would be a much richer source of efficiency. Give nations some freedom to determine their own agricultural policies and to decide for themselves how they want to ensure their own health and safety. Allow nations to set their own rules over everything that is not directly concerned with trade or other matters of common interest. A radical suggestion maybe, but it would allow competition from the more lightly regulated economies to provide the spur for lighter regulation elsewhere and we shall all prosper.</p>
<p class="contents">For those EU regions that are struggling to converge, relief from over-regulation would surely do much more good than any amount of handouts from the diminishing pool of Structural and Cohesion Funds. Mr Barroso has made some cautious remarks about easing regulation but I fear it is unlikely to occur. If meaningful deregulation could be achieved then all the sorrow about the failure of the Lisbon Agenda could be turned to rejoicing as EU economies really begin to move out of the sick bay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The basis for measures relating to the market for goods and services is coherent action in the field of competition policy. The report on 2003 shows that good progress has been made in this respect, but that shortcomings remain. Fresh challenges are presented by the accession to the EU of ten new Member States with varying regulations on competition law. I should therefore like to take this opportunity to highlight several problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In a number of Member States, the markets for certain services have been taken over by professional associations or organisations, which create obstacles restricting competitiveness. The directive must also set out the conditions according to which financial assistance may be granted for public services or production, to ensure that such assistance does not end up amounting to long-term subsidies, as this would damage competitiveness. Finally, there should be provisions allowing public services at town or commune level to be exempt from all requirements relating to competitiveness, provided that this would mean better solutions for local problems. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To judge by the debate that took place a few hours ago, it is apparent that the European Union really is a global player in this field. It is also apparent that Mrs Kroes is acting as a stand-in as far as this work is concerned, since the report that has been tabled and is being discussed relates to the previous Commission’s work, and I should like to wish her the best of luck in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">For as long as the European Communities have existed, the successful work carried out by the Commission has played a significant part in helping to ensure that a characteristic feature of the European market has been fair competition, which has brought the benefits of quality and reasonable prices to all citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is against this background that Mr Evans’ report evaluates the work carried out by the Commission’s Competition DG in 2003, even though decisions that were taken during this period were taken under the aegis of the previous Commission. The aim of the debate on this report should therefore be to examine and evaluate the extensive amendments that have been made to European competition law and the major changes that have taken place within the European Commission in terms of their future effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no doubt that the aforementioned amendments and changes are, in principle, likely to maintain the high standard of European competition policy. As I mentioned in my question, however, I believe that there are a number of areas where improvements would be useful. These include protection for principal witnesses in competition law cases throughout Europe, the legal status of Internet publications and guaranteed protection against double prosecution under monopoly law.</p>
<p class="contents">Irrespective of these concerns, however, the report before us provides an excellent basis for carrying out future work in the usual successful manner. I wish you the best of luck in ensuring that the decisions you take over coming months stand up in court. I also hope that you will be able to follow the previous Commission’s example and to take decisions that are in the public’s interest, as trust and authority are crucial as far as competition policy is concerned. I hope that you will enjoy both. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, Mr Evans, I really wish to congratulate you in person on your work and, more specifically, on your work in this report. I should like at this point to draw your attention to the fact that, because of the cultural peculiarity of the audiovisual sector, which is such that this sector cannot be treated as a normal industry, the Commission must clarify the role which the main shareholders play on the basis of competition policy. We feel that it is important for the Commission to impose pluralism on the media, both at national and at Community level, by consistently safeguarding the free participation of everyone in the audiovisual media sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, given that the Commission emphasises that competition rules, as you state in your report, are the rules on which the resolution of the problems which derive from the creation or the strengthening of the dominant position on the market will be based in order to address priority agreements, will a policy be approved under which restrictions on the basic shareholder act as a check on the competition policy of the mass media? I should like us to receive a response so that our rapporteur, Mr Evans, can perhaps accept the amendment tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also listened, of course, to those who were more critical. Mr Evans' support for the idea and the faith expressed in his report was a great start.</p>
<p class="contents">I set out my own philosophy in my recent speeches at Bocconi and at the OECD in Paris, where all those national authorities from around the world that are active in the competition field were gathered. Those speeches and this report show, I think, that we are on the same track. We are all aware that competition is the instrument for getting our economy in better shape, something that we badly need in Europe. We have both a lack of economic growth and a lack of productivity. We badly need economic growth because we have environmental and social welfare objectives that we rightly believe are essential within our culture.</p>
<p class="contents">I found the remarks that honourable Members have made very interesting and stimulating. They mark the start of our dialogue. As I mentioned before, I would be delighted to be invited to EMAC to discuss this item.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning competition in technology transfer, there is indeed a way of developing this within our competition policy. It is not a separate item, it is all combined in one policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Mr Rutowicz's question about a market definition in merger cases, the Commission welcomes, and indeed promotes greater integration of markets. There is no doubt about that. As markets integrate, the relevant anti-trust markets will also become wider. However, for the time being many markets remain national or regional and this must be reflected in competition analysis, including market definition, so that competition and consumers do not suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Elisa Ferreira asked about gas and electricity liberalisation. I agree that it is important to improve the functioning of the energy market.</p>
<p class="contents">In close cooperation with our energy colleagues, we are investigating the current status of the market. We are investigating the conduct of incumbents in certain markets and plan to carry out sector inquiries. The sector inquires will provide important input as to how the markets function and how they can be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to differentiate between preferences for liberalisation. I could not agree more about having a positive attitude towards liberalisation. However, in some cases where liberalisation has taken place there are still activities within that market that we do not accept. When that happens, one should not say 'I am against liberalisation'. We have a duty to find out what the actual situation is and who is not acting properly and not meeting our expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rutowicz made a couple of remarks with regard to state aid reform. The conclusion of the Prodi Commission, later repeated by the European Council, was that there should be less aid but better aid. In addition, it was concluded that with enlargement we had a further reason for less and better aid for those areas that had already enjoyed the benefit of such aid. We now have to realise that within the ten new Member States there is a new territory which we have to improve, where aid could be of great help.</p>
<p class="contents">With better focus and a better use of tax-payers' money we can concentrate aid where it really generates the greatest value; where it contributes to cohesion; where it boosts innovation, research and development, and risk capital so that small- and medium-sized companies can also play a positive role as an engine of innovation in stimulating the economy. We need to ensure that they have access to risk capital because they need to take their ideas forward. Better focused state aid means better economic results and governance and ultimately, better and more secure jobs and better use of tax-payers' money. In early spring we will have a chance to present the action plan on state aid reform. That action plan will include measures to rationalise the state aid framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to reduce a lot of the red tape, a lot of the bureaucracy and I think that notification requirements for straightforward low impact aid should be one of those items we can get rid of, thus focussing resources on checking the more problematic high-impact subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ferreira said that the title was misleading. I think that the title of the report just covers what we are really focusing on.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question was about audiovisuals. Maintaining and developing media pluralism is a basic public goal of the European Union, together with the preservation of cultural diversity and freedom of access for the Union citizen to all kinds of media platforms.</p>
<p class="contents">The application of competition policy instruments in the media sector is limited to addressing the underlying market structure and economic impact of media undertakings' behaviour. Nevertheless competition policy can and does make an essential contribution to the maintenance and development of media pluralism both in traditional television and other broadcasting markets and the new media.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schwab underlined that the European Union is a global player and that therefore it is essential to look at the price, at the quality, and also at the research possibilities to fall in line with our global competitors. It would be a good idea, to focus especially on increasing efficiency and transparency and to work towards a less bureaucratic one-stop shop for leniency applications. This will be explained in the new paper I am preparing which will also support greater efficiency and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tried to answer the questions that were raised. Again, thanks for the opportunity and thanks again to Mr Evans and all those who have been involved in the preparation of this report. Today's debate is just the start. It is very important to continue the discussion and to feel that you are on the same track as us in the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
