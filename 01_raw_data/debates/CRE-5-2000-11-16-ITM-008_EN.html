That is why we were so disturbed and sad to see the slow political, economic and human ruination of this country, orchestrated by the military junta of General Gueï.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to hold on to power, General Gueï hijacked the constitution adopted by the people of Côte d'Ivoire for his sole benefit and used it as a means of excluding his political opponents. In order to hold on to power, he did not hesitate to exploit the bitter debate on Ivoirian nationality, sparking an explosion of xenophobia: hatred of others, of foreigners, whether from Burkina Faso or Mali, even though so many of them have lived and worked in the country for many years. In this way he has brought Côte d'Ivoire to the brink of civil and ethnic war.</p>
<p class="contents">But the Ivoirian people did not allow the junta to play their murderous game to the bitter end: they forced the tyrant to flee and, by electing a long-standing opponent, Laurent Gbagbo, to rule the country, they brought Côte d'Ivoire back onto the track of democracy. Now this process needs to be confirmed rapidly by the organisation of free, transparent and pluralist legislative elections in which all the political forces can take part. At least, that is what both the political leaders and the people are calling for today.</p>
<p class="contents">The political forces of Côte d’Ivoire have already shown their sense of responsibility by playing the card of appeasement, of constitutional legality and of national reconciliation for some weeks past. We must take note of this return to a democratic process that may indeed be incomplete, but that we must continue to support. I believe that will also contribute to the stability of the entire region, for West Africa is going through a highly vulnerable period from that point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must therefore accompany Côte d'Ivoire along the road it has itself chosen: the road towards a return to constitutional legality, to civil peace, to economic and social progress, while giving material and financial support to the organisation of the legislative elections scheduled for 10 December this year and, of course, ensuring that they are fair and pluralist. It must also continue to cooperate with Côte d'Ivoire, so as to help it find the most appropriate solutions to the social crisis in urban areas and to tensions related to land in rural areas. That is precisely the point of our resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The real issues and national debates were overshadowed by the spurious yet contentious debate about Ivoirian nationality. Côte d'Ivoire was driven into this widespread catastrophe because it was caught in the stranglehold of its financial commitment to lend credibility to its economic prospects and the cruel and indiscriminate fallout from international trade negotiations. That really is the antithesis of the model of true sustainable development, the policy for the future that we Greens advocate.</p>
<p class="contents">The West bears a patent and overwhelming responsibility for the current collapse of the Ivoirian system. By introducing oils and fats other than cocoa butter into the ingredients of chocolate, the European Parliament has brought about the ruin of this top international cocoa producer's entire national industry. It knocked its social and political system off balance and has even led to the mass graves of Ivoirian civilians, the ultimate but also the direct victims of this chain of decisions and consequences starting in Brussels and ending in Ypougon. The Greens firmly condemn all the acts of violence committed following the elections and lament the victims.</p>
<p class="contents">Real democracy cannot now be established in Côte d'Ivoire unless an independent commission of inquiry is set up to look into the crimes committed and unless an official undertaking is given on respect for human rights and civil peace. Similarly, this democratic process can only become more credible if a national reconciliation committee is created, together with a national electoral committee to prepare and guarantee future elections, especially the elections of 10 December. It is vital to have foreign observers at these elections to make sure they are conducted legally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Gbagbo has provisionally been recognised as president on the basis of elections from which his most important opponent was excluded. If the parliamentary elections in December do not proceed in a fair manner then the unrest will undoubtedly flare up again. After all, the violence of recent times has left the people with deep scars. If there is even the slightest political lapse their anger will take hold again. It is therefore absolutely essential that the parliamentary elections due to take place in December, proceed fairly, and needless to say, exclusion for reasons of ethnicity is absolutely out of the question. Côte d’Ivoire will only be able to regain its stability if the new rulers are prepared to engage in power-sharing. It is also impossible to envisage lasting peace in the country without religious and ethnic tolerance. The political, military and religious leaders must pull out all the stops to make national reconciliation possible. What is needed is a constitution which guarantees the rights of the citizens and the political parties and rules out abuse of power. It is also vital for relations with the neighbouring countries, especially Burkina Faso, to be restored. We as a European Union, must be prepared to continue to provide assistance, but this will only be possible if the country is run properly and democratisation really takes shape. The leaders have now been given a new chance and let us hope they seize it. Côte d’Ivoire could become a role model and take the lead in the region. But this will only be feasible if everyone takes responsibility and peace is restored for good. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sylla (GUE/NGL)</span></span>  <span class="italic">.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe the first question that arises in Côte d’Ivoire is that of democracy. Some people believe democracy is only of relative importance when it comes to Africa, that democratic procedures are a complex matter, that we have to give it time, but I personally believe that there can be no compromise with democracy and the question that arises for Côte d’Ivoire today is the same one that arises for Guinea, for example, where we now know that there are people in prison and that the system is not democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">For almost a year now, a few of us in this House, in particular most of my colleagues, have been alerted to the situation in Côte d’Ivoire, which I really believe offers a perfect example of how not to do things. Firstly, a regime was allowed to take over by force, by armed force. Nothing was said about the persecution of opponents and journalists, or about the establishment of a racist constitution based on ethnic discrimination. Everybody just let it happen, as though they had not learned any lessons from Rwanda or former Yugoslavia. And now they are surprised to see General Gueï end up rigging the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I believe the European Union should welcome the fact that the new president, Laurent Gbagbo, is setting up a national reconciliation committee. We must also welcome the organisation of legislative elections next month, but we must insist that these elections are transparent and do not exclude any political force or any candidate. Equality between the political movements must be guaranteed. And indeed that is why President Gbagbo must not dismiss the possibility of holding presidential elections, as the direct follow-up to these legislative elections.</p>
<p class="contents">But above all, we must, in my view, insist much more firmly on this racist constitution being declared null and void. The debate on nationality Ivoirian – that confused debate that tends solely towards introducing discrimination in favour of a country’s own nationality, something we are combating in our own countries, and whose logical conclusion is the practice of ethnic cleansing – must be used to totally oppose any reference or connotation to Ivoirian nationality and to have these removed from the Ivoirian constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not agree with all Mr Ouattara’s view – you need only see where I am sitting on this side of the Chamber – especially in the liberal and economic field, but I do believe that it is not acceptable, in any country whatsoever, and particularly in Côte d’Ivoire, to exclude Mr Ouattara solely because he does not have a mother and a father of Ivoirian origin. In the same way, I believe that the 14 parties that have been excluded must be reintegrated and play a full part in these elections. Otherwise it would mean that when someone like Mr Ouattara is excluded, second-class citizenship is <span class="italic">de facto</span> being introduced, and there would be two kinds of citizens and discrimination would eventually become established as a state system.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must also make sure that none of its members establishes relations with its former colonies – and let me emphasise this – that are based solely on economic interests or geostrategic location. It was on the basis of such considerations that Hubert Védrine, the head of the French diplomatic service, actually went so far as to explain that from a certain point of view these elections were legal because they were founded on a constitution. If we take that line, let me say that we should in fact have accepted apartheid, given that it was entirely constitutional. Excuse me if I go even further and say that we should consequently have established better relations with Milosevic in former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish by saying this: dictatorships come into being only because there are people who are destitute and who have no access to learning, no access to knowledge. So from that point of view I believe that it is essential that we urgently target our aid for those countries, in order to help them move towards a democratic system, at combating illiteracy, poverty and destitution. It is at that price and by giving assistance to these people that we will finally help them to set up a democratic system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is tempting, but it would be wrong, because the reality is rather more complex and the position of the new president is quite a lot more controversial. Naturally we welcome the fact that junta leader Gueï failed in his scheme to legitimise his power through sham elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, and also this Parliament, made an important contribution to this by demanding that democratic elections take place and instituting the suspension procedure. But that still does not give Laurence Gbagdo, who won the elections, the legitimacy he needs. After all, he drew the nationalist card too. He also supported the amendment to the constitution, with the intention of cutting out his most significant opponent, Watara, on the grounds that one of his parents is not an Ivoirian national.</p>
<p class="contents">This law led to the serious disruption of traditional ethnic harmony in Côte d’Ivoire. Since it came into force, people of foreign extraction, and in fact we are talking in terms of a third to half of the population, have been the object of discrimination and even of attacks. Another consequence of the law was that Watara’s supporters, particularly Muslims from the north of the country, managed to successfully boycott the elections, which meant that the turnout was no higher than 40%, i.e. too low to give the new president a credible mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">When Watara’s supporters took to the streets in order to demand new elections their protest was put down using violent means. Muslim quarters in the city were attacked. At least 170 people died and 350 were wounded. Fearing a civil war, Watara reconciled himself to the result.</p>
<p class="contents">It would not be illogical for the European Union to immediately demand new presidential elections, in which all candidates would be able to participate this time round. But I recognise that there are a number of reasons for not doing so. Firstly, it would undermine the new president’s attempts to restore national unity and reconciliation. After all, against this background, he offered his opponents various ministerial posts and declared 9 November a national day of mourning.</p>
<p class="contents">Conversely, all the parties have now declared themselves willing to help to restore the constitutional state and peace. As some delegates have already said, this must inevitably lead to the parliamentary elections on 10 December, which <span class="italic">all </span>parties must be able to take part in. I do not believe it is for Europe to add fuel to the fire and stir up tensions even more when those concerned are evidently willing to engage in reconciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">But the real test for Gbagdo will be on 10 December. All we can do is ensure that these are free and peaceful elections, and hope that the new Ivoirian government has a broad democratic basis. This is what is needed to restore ethnic harmony and help this country out of its economic morass. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the fact that this military regime was recently ousted in the elections, under difficult circumstances, says something about the democratic resolve of the people of Côte d'Ivoire. I believe there is now a chance to restore democracy and the rule of law. Here I wish the current president a good hand and a very delicate touch.</p>
<p class="contents">The unrest surrounding the elections produced a death toll of about 200, which of course places a heavy burden on the future of the new regime. But we must also say that the day of reconciliation on 9 November will send out new signals in regard to establishing democracy and the rule of law and taking seriously the demand for national reconciliation. The European Union has been asked, and has declared itself prepared, to help ensure that the elections in December, as well as the local elections in January, are conducted in a peaceful, fair, free and transparent manner. Here, too, we must keep a watchful eye and take a constructive approach to this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Much will depend on whether it really proves possible to consolidate these first cautious steps. Of course that also means amending the constitution so that ethnic origin can no longer be taken as grounds for discrimination. Very many parts of Africa comprise very many different ethnic and religious mixtures. To draw such narrow boundaries between them can only produce problems and difficulties. We know that millions of people living in Côte d'Ivoire come from one of its neighbouring countries. I will not even broach problems such as child labour – for there also there are problems. A peaceful environment needs to be created for these people as well, and they, too, must be given some political responsibility in the country and must not be excluded. In that regard, I believe that the resolution reflects Parliament's resolve to make its contribution and I hope we will also manage to succeed in doing so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But, as usual, the European countries in general and France in particular are disclaiming all responsibility for what is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">Why did the French authorities never fail to support Konan Bédié through the years, after he launched his xenophobic campaign against the large minority group of Burkinabe origin that makes up one third of the population of Côte d’Ivoire? Why did the French Government support the election rigging by Gueï, which the European Parliament resolution is set to condemn after the event? Why do the French Government, and the resolution itself, conceal the role of Gbagbo, the current president, in fomenting xenophobia?</p>
<p class="contents">The non-intervention policy which the French Government put forward to justify its guilty silence is merely a fig leaf to hide its sordid material interests.</p>
<p class="contents">For decades France supported the dictatorship of Houphouet-Boigny and his one-party regime in order to protect the enormous interests of French capitalist groups that are established in Côte d’Ivoire and dominate its economy. For the same reason, it is tolerating all the villainies of its protégés who run the Ivoirian State, provided they protect French interests in return. From Bédié to Gbagbo, not forgetting Gueï and Ouattara, all those who are vying for power in Côte d’Ivoire bear some responsibility for the rise in xenophobia and the worsening ethnic conflicts there. But the leaders of the French State also share this responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We condemn the ethnic violence and in particular the political leaders who fomented it with their demagogic rhetoric. We condemn the army and the police, many of whose members took part in the assassinations. Conversely, we refuse to associate ourselves with the representatives of political parties who were or are involved in France’s Africa policy. We declare our solidarity with the working people of all origins in Côte d’Ivoire who not only are being kept destitute but whom their leaders are trying to set one against the other.</p>

The Union has condemned General Gueï’s attempt to confiscate the election results and subsequently the army’s violent repression of the demonstrations in favour of Laurent Gbagbo and, above all, the bloody inter-ethnic massacres which have been perpetrated on the native people of the north of Côte d’Ivoire.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that in the current circumstances the priority should be for the legislative elections that are scheduled to be held on 10 December to be open and transparent. I would like to stress these two adjectives. These elections must enable the political parties that were excluded from the presidential election to be represented at national level and thereby compensate, though only partially, for the defects of that first election. These elections should make up one of the key elements of the national reconciliation that we all wish to see and are calling for. The European Community will provide financial support for these elections to be held, and we will also cooperate by providing some one hundred observers. Once these elections have taken place and depending on the way they are carried out, we will be able to consider holding in-depth discussions with the new Ivoirian authorities in order to determine the conditions in which we can re-establish our cooperation. This clearly does not exclude the consideration of emergency situations, such as providing aid for the injured and victims of the recent inter-ethnic confrontations, and ECHO has allocated EUR 300 000 in emergency aid for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recognises other priorities with regard to emergencies, which are closely related to issues such as health or education, especially in rural areas, and this is fundamental to this process being carried out in an open and democratic manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
