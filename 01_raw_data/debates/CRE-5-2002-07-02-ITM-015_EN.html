Well, they mean money for research activities, money which – let there be no mistake – comes from the public purse. It is public money, taxpayers' money that funds research activities. Invitations to tender for projects are published, applications are made and, at some point, approval is granted – or not. So what was important for us? First that, when applications are made, the invitation to tender should be clear, unequivocal and straightforward. So that clear, unequivocal and straightforward applications can be submitted. That is why we opted for the two-stage procedure that has already proven its worth in the past. The Commission agreed to this suggestion. Secondly, it is of course important to be able to carry out a quick evaluation, so that people are not left sitting around waiting to hear whether or not their project has been accepted. For us as a Parliament, it was important to include a number of criteria in addition, of course, to the criteria of excellence and innovation. I am thinking here, for example, – what a pity several lady Members have just left – of the role of women in research. It is also important to fund European added value. In other words, if we work together, the total should be greater than the sum of the parts.</p>
<p class="contents">Working together means solidarity between the Member States in the group. It also means solidarity in liability should something go wrong – not that anyone expects it to. But then again, solidarity should not go so far – as the Commission proposes – as to make all the participants jointly and severally liable. This has now been successfully introduced. Joint liability, but within certain limits. We have managed to find a good compromise between the solidarity needed and the responsibility of the individual participants.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course payment channels need to be set up so that they are flexible and payments can be tracked. And the money should be paid out in a targeted manner. To give just one example, lump sums, yes, if necessary, but only if they are based on actual additional costs from European research and can be proven, even if the proof is submitted afterwards. In other words, networks of excellence, joint European research area, yes, but not in the form of some sort of collaboration which cannot be properly quantified. Here too we have managed to move the Commission proposal in the direction suggested by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point for Parliament in the discussion was this: the Commission proposal gave us the impression – and I use the expression advisedly; we discussed this at length and eventually agreed otherwise – that the Commission actually wanted to backtrack slightly. That it simply wanted to say, there is a project coordinator, he gets the money, he is responsible for everything. That is out of the question. We cannot release our Executive from its responsibility. It is liable for the sums which it approves and it alone is directly answerable to the European Court of Auditors. Thanks to input from numerous colleagues on my ideas, we managed to turn a good proposal into an even better final text.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say a few words now about the procedure, because it is quite an unusual procedure. The first report is a full codecision report; the report on Euratom is a consultation report. But let us stay with the first report and codecision. This is a codecision procedure and we shall be adopting a text after just one reading. Why? Because we have had excellent cooperation with the Council and I should like to make a point of naming Secretary of State Marimón here. He interceded with a great deal of personal commitment in order to help us reach an agreement in the talks, in the dialogue. I must say that I also found the Commission most willing to talk. All in all, everyone was very receptive to everyone else's position and we managed to draft a text that was approved by the Council following the vote in committee. In early obedience, as it were, to the vote which, I assume, will be a large majority in favour. This sort of agreement at first reading is only possible if everyone is ready to cooperate and I am most grateful that they were.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank all my fellow Members in the other groups. The specific circumstances caused by my temporary disability – I am sure you have all seen me travelling around everywhere – gave rise to tolerance on all sides, on the part of the Commission, on the part of the Council and on the part of the honourable Members, for which my thanks once again, as well as flexibility and innovative working methods – and I wish these qualities of flexibility and innovative working methods on all the participants in the sixth framework programme and on the Commission as it starts its work handing out the money. We shall be keeping a critical but well-meaning eye on this work during the course of next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I congratulate the<span class="bold"> </span>rapporteur on her excellent report, to which I give my full support. Like the rapporteur, I agree with the approach pursued by the Commission to facilitate access to funding by simplifying legislation and by providing greater operational flexibility. I therefore welcome the new objectives that have been proposed, which are: the introduction of simple and comprehensible rules for participation, faster and slimmer administration and the protection of the Community’s financial interests.</p>
<p class="contents">As Member for one of the outermost regions, the Autonomous Region of Madeira, I should now like to focus the final part of my intervention on a point that is of direct concern to the outermost regions. Heading 9 of the compromise amendment refers to the need for the activities of the sixth framework programme to promote the participation of the most remote regions of the Community. The previous framework programme also referred to the need to address the specific features of these regions.</p>
<p class="contents">In my proposal for an amendment, I nevertheless called for us to go further, so as to follow up the heading I have just mentioned, because I think that in programmes concerning an outermost region, greater weight must be accorded to the criterion of Community added value. According greater weight in this way would be extremely important, so as to prevent the outermost regions being penalised, bearing in mind in particular that it might be difficult to find outside partners willing to enter into collaboration with institutes based in outermost regions, whatever the quality of the projects that might give rise to an application. When the complete equality of the participants and the general openness of the projects to new participants is protected, according greater weight to the criterion for Community added value would be crucial to guaranteeing access to the sixth framework programme for projects originating in those regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps this is also a sign of the new start which we are planning with the sixth research framework programme. My thanks also to the rapporteur. I do not say that merely as a courtesy because I think we have worked well together and have basically followed the rapporteur's line and I should like to make a point of thanking her for her initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as these rules of participation are concerned, I would like to say that we have put a great deal of responsibility on the Commission and demanded a great deal from it. I do not envy the Commission its task, because it will be no easy matter to implement the sixth research framework programme; you only have to think of the provision requiring the Commission to give reasons for any decision rejecting a proposal. That is one of our old demands, but with several tens of thousands of projects, it places an enormous responsibility on the Commission. If it succeeds here, my hat off to it, because this is certainly one reason why many people are still just as enthusiastic about taking part in the European research programme. But it will not be easy.</p>
<p class="contents">The main difficulty with this sixth research framework programme is that so many Member States are taking part in it – fifteen Member States, plus the countries which want to join the European Union, plus the countries in the European Economic Area, plus Israel and, in the future, Switzerland too. In other words, there are a great many participants and "managing" them, by which I mean implementing the research framework programme properly, will be no easy task. I also understand why it wants to encourage projects, networks of excellence, integrated projects etc. which are as big as possible and presumably this will also be the future of the European research programme. However, this means that other, mainly smaller projects will increasingly need to be taken over by the Member States and the regions, leading to a stricter division of labour between the European Union and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am absolutely delighted that the matter of the two-stage procedure has been described in greater detail. I expect this two-stage procedure to lighten the load somewhat, depending on how it is implemented. The Commission has a certain amount of experience here and I trust it will be able to improve on it. The faster we implement the sixth research framework programme, the more money we shall save. Parliament has made its contribution, and there is a consensus in favour. The thing now is to hand out the money as quickly as possible and I wish you every success in doing so, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Spanish Presidency has done sterling work in this area. The result is that we can now approve the rules for participation in framework programmes in one reading, allowing the sixth framework programme to be launched on time. This is good news for all researchers in Europe, but also for the research climate and innovation in the European Union. Indeed, it once again transpired recently that the European Union is progressively lagging behind where research and competitiveness are concerned. The difference between Europe and the United States in research investments has grown sharply in the past few years. In 1994, this difference was still EUR 51 million annually, and this has risen to no less than EUR 124 million in the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as national governments, industry, in particular, must make more investments. However, this requires a much better investment climate to make it attractive for companies to invest in Europe. Participation in the framework programme by the private sector should also be stimulated. It is, therefore, important that Parliament has been granted its wish with regard to liability of participants in a consortium in the framework programme. Surely it is not acceptable if one participant breaks the contract, for the other participants to be jointly and severally liable for this, as per the Commission's request? Fortunately, the Council has taken this on board, and the text has been amended accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to note that the European Commission’s handling of contracts causes many problems. Payments are usually late and the administrative pressure is high. This causes problems especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. At this rate, the Commission will have difficulty obtaining sound projects because innovative companies will no longer wish to take part. This is partly due to the projects being cancelled without any explanation. Practices of this kind do not stimulate the private sector and will not lead to higher investments in Europe, and certainly not to 3% of the national product, as the Commission would like to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, whom I should like to thank most sincerely for taking on the task and for the provisions full of common sense which she has included regarding the rules for participation, has set us on the right track. I should like to emphasise that, for the first time in the framework programme, the acceding countries will enjoy rights that are equivalent to those of the Member States, and the European scientific cooperation organisations and those of the acceding countries will be able to participate on the same footing as the bodies established in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased to see that the organisations in third countries will be able to participate fully in the projects in the framework programme. This is particularly important for our group, which wants to intensify research with developing countries and with the countries of the Mediterranean and of Latin America. Taking into account the new management provisions – provided, in particular, by the new tools – it will certainly be necessary to optimise operations during the implementation of this programme, but without, however, opting for formal conciliation procedures. With this in mind, we should like to thank the Council, as represented by Mr Marimón, who has devoted a lot of attention to this matter, for having agreed to our proposal intended to speed things up. This is why we would be happy to maintain regular contact between Parliament and the Commission, which will in fact be possible thanks to the kind competence of Mr Busquin, in particular with a view to the possible updating of the evaluations at the halfway point, in 2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should also like to thank Mr Busquin, an excellent Commissioner, who has been very skilful along with his staff in ensuring that we could get a result early in the process. Of course we all wish to thank Mr Marimón for his patience and good humour. I also thank the scientific community, which was not slow in giving us advice and in pointing out that its needs were for simplicity, faster administration and financial care.</p>
<p class="contents">These new instruments are exciting, but we have to be sure that many people are not prevented from taking part in the programmes because of their lack of familiarity. Liability looked as though it would be a big problem but, fortunately, it was overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out the importance to Parliament of Amendment No 29 and its counterpart in the Euratom programme, Amendment No 38, which add criteria which can and should be taken into account, including activities to increase the role of women in research and to look at synergies with education. Ease of access means that dissemination should be fairly easy, but Parliament considers dissemination to be an important stage in this process. You can be sure that we shall be following up very carefully the sixth framework programme, visiting projects, speaking to scientists and asking for evaluations.</p>
<p class="contents">With the adoption tomorrow of Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl's report, the final piece of the puzzle will be in place. Thanks to Mr Caudron and the rapporteurs on the specific programmes, we have worked efficiently and we now have plenty of time for our scientists to prepare, knowing our aim is to make the sixth framework programme efficient, well managed, easy to take part in and above reproach from the financial point of view. Thank you again to all concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This third element is not the least important one. In fact, the rules for participation establish the legal and financial framework which governs the implementing and financing of the research activities of the sixth framework programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank most sincerely the rapporteur, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, for the very thorough work which she has done on the proposal for these rules, in close collaboration with the intervention zones.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank the draftsmen, Mr Linkohr, Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, Mr Piétrasanta and Mr Alyssandrakis, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Industry, Mr Westendorp, for the excellent climate which they created during these discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, to emphasise that this agreement has been made possible thanks to the hard work during fruitful discussions in which everyone has been involved. Like you, I should like to emphasise the role of the Spanish Presidency, particularly in the person of Mr Marimón, and I believe that the outcome confirms our common desire to simplify and lighten the load compared with the preceding programme, at the same time retaining the necessary rigour.</p>
<p class="contents">The new model is based on the principle of greater autonomy for the consortiums, and this will be reinforced by the increased flexibility of the rules and contracts, and a substantial reduction in the administrative constraints that they face..</p>
<p class="contents">It was in fact our intention to make these rules simpler, lighter and easier to use, easier for participants to read and understand, and more flexible, without, however, ceasing to be rigorous.</p>
<p class="contents">You are also right, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, to make the point that thinking that the Commission was going to withdraw from all its prerogatives, and therefore its responsibilities, particularly as regards the assessment and selection of proposals to be financed, the selection of participants receiving Community funding, as well as the setting up of an effective programme for monitoring the funded projects and the decisions on what payments should be made, was only an impression. You emphasised that point, and it is in that context that the whole of the solidarity process should be interpreted.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, compared with the rules that prevail at present, the rules have also been adjusted to take into account new information available under the sixth framework programme, starting with the introduction of new instruments of financial support. One of the principal changes, some of which saw the light of day at Parliament’s initiative, is, in particular, the fact that participation in a research project – except for some individual cases – is open to any legal entity and not only to legal entities which have a specific research activity. Another change is that organisations in the acceding countries have been placed on an equal footing with those in the Member States of the Union as regards the conditions for their participation, which is a strong political signal at a time when we are talking about enlargement. Opening up participation and financing to include legal entities based in third countries involved in international cooperation activities also broadens the scope of the European research area. We should also mention the introduction of the opportunity of full participation for international European interest organisations, the reduction in the number of model contracts, and a new procedure for the entry into force of contracts, the simplification of the funding systems, the grant to the budget and the grant for integration for integrated projects and networks of excellence respectively, the use of audit certificates by participants in order to claim expenses, thereby giving greater financial security in conditions which involve fewer procedures, and, finally, the simplification of the rules regarding intellectual property, with the single defining principle of an overall framework and of general principles to be observed, while the detailed provisions may vary depending on the type of action.</p>
<p class="contents">On all these points, and on many others, the in-depth and sustained discussions which took place between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission enabled us to reach an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore able to accept formally the single compromise amendment which brings this agreement into being, and I believe that the Council has expressed the same sentiment.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the points of compromise to which I should like to draw your attention, I shall mention, in particular, the raising the minimum number of compulsory participants from two to three, the possible introduction of a two-stage evaluation of the proposals received, the restricting of anonymity to certain specific cases for the purposes of evaluating proposals, the reference to a greater number of criteria for evaluating proposals, both compulsory and optional criteria, such as activities, like those mentioned by Mrs McNally, intended to increase the role of women in research and to create synergy with education at all levels, the clarification of the way in which the responsibilities of the participants are exercised, the definition of the method of calculating the Community’s financial contribution to the networks of excellence – an issue which gave rise to many discussions – and the introduction of the concept of the consortium contract as an essential tool for setting up research projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to say a word about the Euratom participation rules. They are, to a great extent, similar to those laid down for the framework programme and are therefore acceptable. The only amendment not covered by the compromise provides for a rate of funding for Fusion Associations which unfortunately cannot be envisaged at this level within the limits of the planned budget allocation. The Commission cannot accept this, but we shall try to find a compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the difficulties, thanks to the efforts and the willingness of the rapporteur, the participation rules for the sixth framework programme will be adopted tomorrow, I hope, at first reading. We have every cause to be happy about this. For the scientific community and for businesses, this is an essential element in the implementation of this framework programme which is an instrument of the European research area. I believe that the scientific community has already partly understood the message. More than fifteen thousand expressions of interest have been received and will be made public. This will enable us to prepare, in optimum conditions, the implementation of the framework programme between now and the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I should like to thank Parliament for its contribution, which has been most constructive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
