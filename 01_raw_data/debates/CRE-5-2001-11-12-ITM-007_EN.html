<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Turco (NI), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, despite the importance of the initiatives before us, the European Parliament is, on this matter, only being consulted. That means that, as often happens in these cases, the decision we take with our vote will not be taken into any account by the Council. In spite of this, or rather, especially because of this, I want to focus on the need for urgent reform of Europol, in order to allow democratic and judicial control.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has been calling for this for at least five years, since the presentation of the Nassauer report in 1996. The Nassauer report sent a strong political signal to the Council. It called upon the Member States not to ratify the Europol Convention until it had been placed under the control of the Court of Justice, that is, until the Court of Justice had been given the necessary decision-making authority over its interpretation and proper implementation. Mr Nassauer’s report was exemplary in its handling of the problems encountered by Europol and the Convention, which remain the same today. Resolution of these problems does not depend on the political groups, the rapporteur or Mr Nassauer: the judicial and democratic control of Europol is an institutional matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The refusal to bind up this wound inflicted on European democracy, if we can talk about the system regulating the Union’s institutions today in these terms, implies that it would be impossible to make any tangible progress in creating an area which is genuinely an area of security, of justice and of freedom but which we feel must be first and foremost an area of democracy. Since the setting-up of Europol, the European Parliament has pointed out the need to supervise it. The plan to increase Europol’s powers to deal with the critical situation with regard to terrorism, the scandal involving a Europol senior official and the reluctance of the national police forces to transmit their data to Europol, as well as the creation of Parlopol – a group of national and European Members of Parliament upholding the importance of increasing democratic control over Europol and its decisions within the area of justice, freedom and security – have already led the Council to reflect at least on the need to introduce some reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Most importantly, the Council requested that the Commission draw up a communication on the democratic control of Europol by the end of the year. We know the opinion of Commissioner Vitorino, who has stated many times that he considers it appropriate to set up a committee composed of members of the national and European parliaments, but we hope to hear now that the timetable for this reform will be speeded up. We feel that, in a democratic framework, Europol should be subject to financial, budgetary and judicial control as well as democratic control. Financial and budgetary control are currently impossible in that Europol is funded by the national States and not by the Community budget; thus Parliament and the Commission have no power of budgetary or financial control and cannot therefore either criticise or direct the activities of that body.</p>
<p class="contents">Judicial control has also been denied. Indeed, the Court of Justice has been denied full powers of judicial control. We should also note that Europol officials benefit from immunity that is so wide-ranging that it is like a guarantee of impunity, protecting them with regard to the judicial control which can be exercised at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the problem of the gradual increase in the mandate and powers of Europol. Although Europol initially dealt with drug-related crime, the act under consideration widens the powers of Europol to what is, in essence, all types of crime. To enable the European Parliament to express its concerns and requests to the Council and the Commission at a time when they are preparing to take decisions enlarging Europol’s powers and jurisdiction, we feel that, in addition to the amendments on the two Acts proposed by Belgium and Sweden, other amendments are necessary to resolve this issue. In our opinion, the amendments tabled may perform the function of clarifying and improving the initiatives under consideration and send the Council and the Member States a clear political message criticising the current situation and proposing several fundamental guidelines for reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the combination of the factors I have mentioned and the lack of codecision powers conferred on the European Parliament with regard to justice and home affairs must prompt all those who hold dear the principles of democracy and freedom to reject the two initiatives under consideration, for I feel this would make the Council and the Member States more aware of the urgent need to reform Europol. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very proud to be the rapporteur in an extremely innovative area, which has taken on great importance following the appalling events of 11 September. It is perhaps all the more important because we are trying to implement Article 13 of the EU Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters which, although it was signed in May 2000, looks unlikely to be ratified for some time, making it vital that we have a legal framework in place as quickly as possible so that we can take these matters forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Joint investigation teams will allow two or more countries to join together for the purposes of investigating terrorism, human trafficking, drug trafficking and indeed other serious organised crime. This is an important venture which we must all support. A joint investigation team will take the talent and ability from different Member States and join them together for a purpose which is clearly defined and with a clear termination date, but in a way which will allow that expertise to work effectively and sharply in dealing with criminality and with bringing criminals to book. It will be a flexible instrument and one which we have been in need of for some time.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been concerns expressed, although not followed up in amendments, about the extent of participation in such teams. For instance, there have been references to the national criminal intelligence services of Member States. As a minister responsible in the United Kingdom for setting up our own national criminal intelligence service a few years ago, I am very confident that the make-up of these organisations in Member States is already well addressed. By giving those setting up the teams the discretion to determine their composition and to express objections when necessary, it seems to me that this point has been tackled very effectively. Although all the States concerned are signatories to our Human Rights Convention, I have nevertheless asked in this report that we draw particular attention to the need to protect and preserve human rights in the conduct of these teams.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorism is uppermost in our minds at present. But trafficking in human beings is something else we should be deeply concerned about and something which these teams could perhaps help with. Only recently it has been revealed in the United Kingdom that there are hundreds, even thousands, of young children who have been sold into the slave trade from other parts of the world and are now in Europe suffering the most appalling treatment. There has been a case of this nature in the UK, and there has also been a recent case in Italy. The operation of joint investigation teams, say between Italy and ourselves, or with the participation of the French expertise in this area, would help to bring this sort of appalling offence to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">So the report does not concern just terrorism but these other matters too. Indeed it may also be possible to make a significant impact on a whole complex of issues currently of topical interest comprising fraud, money laundering and economic crime of that kind, if the talents and abilities of specific small teams able to operate in different countries can be brought to bear under the control of a single operation.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one further point. I have made quite clear in my report that it is important that all these operations should be under the clear parliamentary control of the European Parliament. Within the annual debate on the area of freedom, security and justice, this particular debate should go forward as well. We should be sure that we consider these operations carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a lot of sensitive information may emerge as a result of this process. If something akin to a select committee were perhaps to be established to receive such confidential information, that could also help to boost confidence in the operation of these teams, which are a very important and significant development in crime prevention in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the Union’s major objectives is, therefore, to enable its citizens to live in this area of freedom, security and justice, which must be an area in which freedom goes hand in hand with a high level of security, and it is in this framework that the creation and operation of joint investigation teams are being planned. The call for the rapid creation of joint investigation teams was made at Tampere as the first stage in the fight against trafficking in human beings and drugs and against terrorism. In the wake of the appalling events of 11 September, this initiative has come to the fore as part of a framework of measures to be adopted in the fight against terrorism and seeks to secure the adoption of a framework decision that will provide a legal framework to enable us to set up joint investigation teams made up of members of the police and judges who are specially trained in the fight against terrorism and of representatives of the Provisional Judicial Cooperation (Pro-Eurojust) unit and Europol, in order to coordinate investigations undertaken in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the rapporteur, Mr Kirkhope’s, enthusiasm for this initiative and I congratulate him on the work he has carried out, which seeks to speed up the entry into force of the provisions of the Convention, still not ratified to date, that are considered to be most urgent by the Member States. I must draw your attention, however, to the need for this Convention to be ratified quickly so as to prevent the risk of any potential fragmentation of this legal mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we must also welcome the extension of Europol’s sphere of action to all serious forms of international crime, which are listed in the annex to the Convention, for this will help to make cooperation under the Europol Convention more effective. Priority areas for action must, nevertheless, be identified according to trends in crime in the Union. You will all agree that, now more than ever, we must devote particular attention to terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The momentum to implement the necessary measures has repeatedly faltered in the face of often short-sighted resistance on the part of the governments. It took the tragedy of 11 September to, at last, shake up a large number of our leaders and substantial impetus has been lent to the adoption of certain necessary measures. I fervently hope that it will not take more tragedies to set the Tampere process in motion, not least because the laws made under the emotional pressure of inhuman tragedies are not always wise ones. In these cases, we are sometimes in danger of disregarding the need to safeguard peoples’ fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to say that the three reports before us do not fall into this trap and I particularly welcome the contributions of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which tabled amendments improving the proposal. Mr Kirkhope’s report calls upon us to support the proposal of four Member States to adopt a framework decision on joint investigation teams, already provided for by the Tampere European Council and the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union, endorsed by Parliament a year ago when it adopted the Di Pietro report. Therefore, Mr Kirkhope’s report deserves the widest consensus, not least because it contains amendments improving the proposal with regard to respect for fundamental rights, parliamentary scrutiny and extending the use of joint investigation teams to combat organised crime as well as terrorism and trafficking in drugs and human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Turco’s reports, as adopted by the Committee on Citizen’s Freedoms, going against the rapporteur’s recommendation, move that we should adopt the two proposals on Europol with appropriate amendments. The first stipulates that Europol’s mandate may be extended to all serious forms of organised crime already listed in the Annex to the Convention in accordance with the priorities established by the Council upon the proposal of Europol’s management board. The Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms’ amendment on the subject moves that this decision should be a qualified majority decision adopted by the Council after it has consulted the European Parliament and obtained the opinion of Eurojust, a body which is particularly experienced in this field. I am sad to see that, although the Members of the European People’s Party voted for the motion in committee, they have now changed their minds and feel that Eurojust’s opinion should not now be taken into consideration. The opinion is certainly not binding but it is certainly very useful, and it would be absurd not to make use of it. We therefore support the first Turco report, as tabled in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The second Turco report on the transmission of personal data from Europol to third States also warrants full consensus. I would say that, irrespective of the rapporteur’s opinion which we have heard today, these proposals should be adopted en masse. However, I fully agree with what the rapporteur has said, which is also stressed in the amendments adopted in committee. They firmly reiterate the opinion, often expressed by Parliament, that it is becoming increasingly necessary to communitise the instruments of judicial cooperation and to consolidate the judicial and democratic control of these instruments, which are, in fact, quite vital. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the joint investigation teams are a positive step in the fight against all kinds of organised crime. First of all, in connection with the Turco report, which specifically deals with the two aspects of Europol’s scope, extending the mandate appears to be a rather pointless exercise if Europol is unable to carry out the mandate properly. After all, Europol’s usefulness has so far proved very limited in practice. Moreover, Europol does indeed work with police and court information but is not involved in any way in the internal security service in practice. This creates an imbalance and repressive action after the events without sufficient preventive action.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the databases, the call for a decentralised system is justified on account of manageability. It would therefore be a big step forward if every Member State were to develop such a database. These initiatives are therefore to be welcomed, but the same cracks seem to be appearing again. On the one hand, we are relying too heavily on the benevolence, or lack thereof, of the Member States, while on the other hand, there appears to be an evident lack of confidence in democracy, notably parliamentary supervision of this highly important area of policy. If we are truly concerned about the protection of civil rights and the maintenance of democracy, we must, without delay, build an adequate system based on criminal law that can meet the challenges we are now facing, and invest in a powerful preventive policy. Internal security services, in particular, have an important role to play here. The cooperation between the internal security services and the judicial services, in other words, between preventive and repressive action, must be better coordinated as a matter of urgency, with the emphasis placed firmly on the prevention of serious crimes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And Europe, which is being given wider and wider powers, powers which go beyond national laws and constitutional protection for its citizens, is being called on to play the lead role here.</p>
<p class="contents">The information collated in the Member States, the well-known files, are now common currency; joint files are being kept on potential suspects, that is, every one of us, and the distribution list for these files is getting longer and longer. Joint investigation teams basically have carte blanche, in that they are set up by however many Member States want to, for however long they want, with the involvement of any services they want and for whatever purpose they think fit. This is an orchestrated attack on grass-roots movements. They want to extinguish the personal and collective rights and democratic freedoms that workers have fought for.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, not only do the reports make no attempt to put a halt to this anti-grass roots and anti-democratic development; on the contrary, they incorporate it in an overall reform of the means available for judicial and police assistance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, this is a police cooperation tool that will be of truly strategic importance in preventing crime. It is a vital, useful tool which will help to tackle the critical terrorist situation in Europe in the wake of the severe international crisis caused by the attack on the twin towers.</p>
<p class="contents">We have all had the opportunity, although, sadly, only since the New York and Washington carnage, to reconstruct the series of preparations for terrorist attacks made on our own European territory over the years by people and organisations linked to Osama Bin Laden: the many, apparently unimportant signs actually linked by a single thread and whose connection, sadly, we did not realise until it was too late, until after 11 September, when thousands of innocent people had already died. Clearly, closer judicial and police cooperation involving more joint investigations might well have made us more effective in preventing terrorist crimes. However, it is worth noting that, in addition to helping us respond to the critical terrorist situation, joint investigation teams would also play a useful general role in helping to fight the many phenomena linked to large-scale organised crime at international level<span class="bold"> </span>such as the illegal trafficking of arms and drugs and the trafficking and exploitation of human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to end by thanking Mr Kirkhope and pointing out that the fight against crime, both terrorism-related and general, has, for years now, been the subject of the most insistent requests from European citizens, who are demanding increasing efforts from the national and European institutions fully guaranteeing the fundamental, inalienable right to safety, that precious thing which is under increasing threat. Therefore, I look forward to the greatest possible endeavours from the European Union too, making use, not least, of the tool of the joint investigation teams, precisely to restore the necessary confidence of the European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I just wanted to point out that the Council was not present at this debate and has arrived only now. I just wanted everyone to realise, to be aware of the consideration given to Parliament’s decisions and debates, the translation into 11 languages, the amendments translated into 11 languages, the speeches translated into 11 languages, which serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">We are discussing the extension of the European police coordination mandate to include the most serious crimes; indeed we are aware that the coordination of information is, in itself, an implementing power, and that the distinction between coordination powers and implementing powers is very, very fine, hazy and difficult to define; we are therefore plumbing the depths of Member States’ police and police cooperation policies. The implications for our countries and our codes of criminal procedure are huge, for, as we know, procedures vary greatly between the 15 Member States in terms of the relationship between the police and the law and the government.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, all this is taking place without Parliament being given any say whatsoever in the legislative process, the process by which laws are formed, and I would stress, none whatsoever, without any input from democratically elected assemblies. We know that President Prodi is in favour, yes, of course we do, but we also know that we are sacrificing with a single blow any balance of powers to the urgent, critical need for effectiveness in the fight against crime. The Council official blithely arrives here at the very end of the debate. Our speeches and decisions, the votes we take will serve no purpose at all, for Presidency itself has decreed that this and other debates are to be held at the same time as the meeting of the committee responsible, the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which is voting now, at this very moment. Therefore, the two Non-attached Members and the other three or four Members who are in the Chamber are missing the vote on terrorism and the European arrest warrant because of this decision which, I feel, ties in with the Council’s decision not to be present during this debate and is typical of the way the European Union legislates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, however, self-evident that, right now, there is a particularly great need for such an extension. Naturally, we need to exchange information with third countries’ police forces in order to help them combat crime, a fact that was emphasised by an as good as unanimous Parliament when we voted on the report on combating computer-related crime.</p>
<p class="contents">There are those who are anxious about Europol’s being given unduly large resources. They might like to reflect upon the consequences of Europol’s having 388 employees to cover a population larger than the United States’s, while the FBI has 27 000 employees. There is no comparison at all between the resources involved, nor between the activities concerned. Europol is not operational.</p>
<p class="contents">When information is transferred, it is incredibly important that we should continue to protect data and, as far as possible, to maintain personal privacy. The human rights we have laid down both in the European Convention and in the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights are a characteristically European feature of which we should be proud and which we should also be sure to maintain. We must nonetheless beware of creating a Big Brother society. Just as Mr Turco emphasised, it is therefore important that Parliament be there to exercise its democratic control. It is quite unreasonable that these issues should be excluded from the structures of the EU and that issues which are so very important to people should be discussed in a largely empty Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that crime statistics are being gathered is naturally welcome. There is something not quite right about the fact that the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon gathers a large quantity of statistics concerning drug addiction, while we have little in the way of statistics when it comes to the fight against crime. Europol naturally has an important role to fulfil in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the issue of whether or not Eurojust should be mentioned in this context, it has emerged that many people interpret the wording in terms of a desire to upset the balance of power between the executive and the judiciary. It should not, of course, be interpreted in that way. I do not, however, want any misunderstandings to arise concerning this matter. To avoid misunderstandings, it would therefore be better to change the Eurojust wording.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to thank Mr Turco for having dealt with the Swedish and Belgian initiative so well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a very important question, since police and judicial cooperation and, in particular, the management of analysis files that are kept by Europol, are very closely related to civil liberties. Today, since Europol is an intergovernmental body, it is controlled by the national parliaments; first and foremost, by the governments at the Council of Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs or their representatives on Europol’s management board, and lastly by a supervisory body made up of leading, independent figures.</p>
<p class="contents">The relevant parliamentary committee is proposing to completely change this system, even though it has only been in operation since 1999, and would like to entrust control of Europol solely to Community procedures, in other words, to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not think this proposal is suitable. We do not consider the European Parliament to be the appropriate institution to undertake the democratic monitoring of sovereign police operations in the Member States, which are carried out by the national services and have implications for the very territory of the Member States. It would be better to keep an open mind while Europol is just beginning to carry out its work and to give the national parliaments the chance to organise and refine their control. They are also aware of this need.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, in September, the French Parliament imposed a ban on its parliament debating the draft agreements between Europol and Eastern European countries. It then lifted this ban when it had sufficient guarantees as to the security of the transmission of personal data.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that this is a very positive approach. It is evidence that there is effective control by the national parliaments. In order to exercise this control further, the French Senate has also set up an internal specialised working group responsible for investigating issues of police and judicial cooperation. This is the example we should be following, Mr President, and we should even, without doubt, go further by improving horizontal coordination of the control carried out by the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">They should work together in setting up an interparliamentary assembly to monitor Europol and police and judicial cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Better still, the Intergovernmental Conference, which is due to meet in 2004 and which, in fact, must deal with the role of national parliaments within the European structure, should propose to develop this type of interparliamentary cooperation and turn this into a new pillar of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The initiatives we are discussing today are intended to speed up the timetable, to bring forward the time when the Member States will have a Community legal basis for establishing joint investigation teams which, if necessary, could include representatives of third countries or of international organisations, to extend Europol’s mandate to enable it to deal with a wider range of criminal activities, and also to enable Europol to transmit personal data to third countries and to other organisations effectively. This will undoubtedly be an important factor in ensuring that cooperation with these third countries and with these international organisations is reliable and functions effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the fact that the European Parliament supports the draft framework decision on joint investigation teams that Belgium, Spain, France and the United Kingdom have proposed. We hope that the time saved by allowing Member States to put together such teams will enhance the effectiveness of the fight against transnational crime. The Commission also welcomes the fact that Parliament has given a positive response to the proposal to extend Europol’s mandate and to allow the transmission of personal data to third countries and other organisations. These two initiatives will help to make Europol an organisation which is more effective in the fight against organised crime, a matter which is of increasing concern to the public of the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Turco’s report raises the issue of the democratic control of Europol with regard to the initiatives in question. In June this year, I had the opportunity to discuss this issue at the interparliamentary conference organised by the Dutch government in The Hague, which was attended by representatives of practically all national parliaments of the Member States and which Mr Turco also attended. In light of the discussion that took place on that occasion with the representatives of the national parliaments, the Commission, as provided for in its working programme for this year, is now finalising its communication on the democratic control of Europol, in which it will put forward a number of ideas designed to improve this process. As you will be aware, this democratic control cannot and must not exclude the irreplaceable role of the national parliaments, specifically with regard to control of their national Europol antennas. Indeed, it must not only enable interparliamentary cooperation with national parliaments, but also provide the added value that comes from Parliament’s commitment to democratic control so as to ensure that, in this way, through close cooperation between the European Parliament and the national parliaments, we are able to develop an overall picture of how Europol is actually working without losing any elements of the detailed work produced by national parliaments on their own actions to exercise control over Europol.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I acknowledge the importance of coordination between Europol and Eurojust and of the role Eurojust should play in relation to the judicial supervision of Europol. I do feel, however, that it would be preferable to wait for the Council’s decision, which will determine the final form Eurojust is to take, before we move ahead with solutions on coordination between police and courts at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to extending Europol's mandate, the Commission takes note of and shares the concerns expressed in the report about the decision-making structure under the Union's third pillar. This is indeed slow because priorities tend to change from one presidency to the next, and the role of Parliament itself is limited. We therefore welcome the fact that the European Parliament has emphasised the need for the situations of organised crime in each Member State to be reflected when priorities are established in the fight against organised crime at European level. Hence the importance of Member States providing Europol with sufficient, timely information so that it can produce an annual report on the situation of organised crime in the European Union of the required standard. With regard to the amendments proposed in Parliament’s report, the Commission might propose that the public version of this annual report be annexed to the report that Europol also submits annually to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with regard to the initiative on the transmission of personal data, the Commission broadly supports the amendments Parliament has proposed. It shares the opinion that the safeguards for data protection provided today under Article 7 of the 1999 Council Act on data transmitted to third countries and to international organisations, also apply to the transmission of data arising from this Swedish initiative. Since, in this case, the Swedish initiative only changes Article 5(5) of the aforementioned 1999 Council Act, Article 7, which is the article relevant to this matter, will still apply in full. Hence my doubts as to whether there is a genuine need for the proposed amendment to Article 7 of the Council Act. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
