<p class="contents">I have personally received detailed information on the activities of the mothers and wives of political prisoners from Mrs Gisela Sánchez Verdecia, the wife of Cuban prisoner Antonio Díaz Sánchez, whom I have symbolically adopted together with my colleagues, MEPs Peter Šťastný and Milan Gaľo. This heroic woman is fighting for her husband, who is serving a twenty-year sentence and is in a critical state of health as a consequence of inhumane treatment.

<p class="contents">Following nine months of work by the temporary committee on the financial perspective, the European Parliament had reached a satisfactory compromise, enabling Europe to be guaranteed an ambitious and coherent future. In contrast, Mr Blair is proposing drastic cuts and jeopardising the European Union project. He is attacking the Structural Funds, rural development, youth and culture, and is making the funding of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund downright precarious. We must reach a mature position, for the sake of European integration. Let us put a stop to national self-interest and to the anachronistic benefits enjoyed by certain Member States. The United Kingdom must re-evaluate its contribution to the budget by doing more than just implementing a cosmetic measure.</p>

<p class="contents">Last week, the French Prime Minister, Mr de Villepin, stated with strength and conviction that it was not up to the legislator to establish historical truth. He said that there was no official history in France. A few days later, the Head of State, Mr Chirac, made similar remarks by saying: ‘In the Republic, there is no official history. It is not up to the law to write history; that is a matter for historians’.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, are the French political and judicial authorities accusing Mr Gollnisch of? Of having said exactly the same thing a few months beforehand, namely that it was up to historians to study the issues relating to the Second World War, whatever the views of some of my French fellow Members, who set themselves up as the thought police, going so far as to exert unacceptable political pressure so that Mr Gollnisch’s request for defence of immunity will be rejected.</p>

<p class="contents">A 44-year-old American with a history of psychiatric illnesses was flying with his wife from Miami to Orlando. Suddenly, for reasons as yet unknown, he felt the need to leave the aeroplane. He ran off the aeroplane and was followed by a policeman, who shouted at him to stop. When the passenger failed to comply with his orders, he was executed in cold blood in the embarkation area. Eye witnesses say that they heard up to six shots.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the second execution which has taken place within a few months, following the unfortunate incident involving the Brazilian national in London. We therefore need to ask ourselves if this is the society that we wish to create, where the authorities shoot first and ask questions later. We are creating an unhealthy climate of fear for citizens which will result in unfortunate developments in the future. I therefore believe that, as a Chamber, we need to condemn such action and do our best to ensure that any legislation passed by this plenary is in favour of the citizen and not in favour of the use of violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anyone reading this list could be forgiven for thinking that we will soon live to see another heaven on earth. Yet the above-mentioned guiding principles bear no relation to the actual state of affairs, especially given the substantial cuts that have been made to the budget. This is particularly true as regards the situation in Poland, where unemployment stands at 20% and Polish people have lost their jobs as a result of the removal of obstacles to the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital. Such unemployment leads to poverty, hunger and despair, which are made all the worse by proposals to extend the transition periods. Such musings are truly paradoxical in the run-up to Christmas, particularly in view of the fact that Christian values are being rejected, along with the knowledge of the truth that sets us free. I hope that this truth will be fulfilled, and that this Christmas and New Year will be filled with hope and love. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The British group came to the conclusion that the elections in Kazakhstan were free and without coercion. Several other groups from Belgium, France, the CIS, the USA and Indonesia came to the same conclusion. The spokesman of one of the opposition candidates said after the election that the opposition had blown it by concentrating on personalities rather than policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We completely disagreed with the conclusions of the OSCE monitoring group, which produced an expensive, dismissive and academically pompous report condemning the election process. The OSCE also contradicted the previous statement of the Members of this House following last year’s parliamentary election, which concluded that the Kazakh electorate is now sophisticated and beyond coercion or intimidation. I believe the OSCE report was influenced by its internal bureaucracy on the future chairmanship of the organisation. Bureaucrats should not attempt to play politics, nor try to dictate who the chairman should be. It will bring the OSCE into disrepute, a state of affairs not desired by this House.

This pipeline will harm the economic interests of the Baltic States and the Central European countries, including Poland, yet despite protests it will bypass these countries. Instead, it will link Russia and Germany directly, thus putting the energy security of one third of the EU at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">The construction of this gas pipeline could cause an environmental disaster in the Baltic region. Stockpiles of German chemical weapons were dumped in the Baltic Sea after World War II, and these could be disturbed during work on the pipeline. The poisonous chemicals would pollute the waters of the Baltic. Even the conclusion of the agreement on this pipeline was nothing short of scandalous. According to media reports, Gerhard Schröder will head the company’s board of directors, with Matthias Warning taking the role of company chairman. Until 1990, Mr Warning was an officer in the Stasi, East Germany’s secret police, and it was during this period that he allegedly got to know Vladimir Putin, who was a KGB agent at the time. The fact that a former chancellor is to be involved in a company whose interests he defended so vociferously is suspicious in the extreme.</p>

Paragraph 27 of the Austrian federal law on the protection of animals stipulates that no wild animal species may be kept by circuses, variety shows and similar forms of entertainment or used by them in performances.</p>
<p class="contents">Far from congratulating Austria on doing something positive and taking the lead in this area, the Commission’s response was to send the Austrian Government an admonitory letter, in which it threatened to overturn the ban on circuses keeping wild animals – imposed not only by Austria but also applying to some degree in other EU Member States – on the grounds that the ban on performances by wild animals went against the free movement of services. One would have thought that the protection of animals was meant to be a value that was in the general interest and that this would be an argument justifying a restriction on the free movement of services.</p>
<p class="contents">Traditional circuses are not meant to be founded upon the use of animals; there are highly celebrated circuses that manage to draw the crowds without performances by wild animals. Priority must be given to the protection and well-being of animals, whether we are talking in terms of the keeping of wild animals by circuses or the conditions under which animals are transported, which defy description. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The political responsibilities in all of this are clear. A footballer even came on to the pitch exalting fascist symbols. I believe that all this comes down to a clear responsibility on the part of the political authorities, which increasingly tend to criminalise immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of example, I should like to mention a very serious incident that took place only two days ago: in Italy, a Moroccan citizen, who was suspected of being a dangerous terrorist and had been subjected to two trials and acquitted both times, was expelled from Italian soil because he was judged to be a threat to national security.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is a serious matter, insofar as we have no precise details about where this Moroccan citizen ended up; it would appear that he is now being held in a Moroccan prison in which human rights are notoriously overlooked.

Enough time has therefore gone by for us to have formed opinions on the way Parliament operates, and on the role and significance of the European Union. Although we have no problems passing resolutions supporting democracy and human rights in third countries, I regret to say that unfortunately we are not capable of enforcing our own rights as effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the European Union’s fundamental principles is partnership, and yet this is the principle that is most frequently overlooked. The principle of consultation was also violated during the recent scrutiny of the planned sugar market reform. Decisions were taken on this matter while the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was still drafting Parliament’s opinion. A large part of the responsibility for this dismissive treatment of Parliament and its Members lies with the main groups in the House. These latter are so embroiled in petty squabbles that they are blind to the fact that Parliament’s importance is waning. A situation has arisen in which the work carried out by Members from small or new Member States is increasingly meaningless. Members from these countries find it enormously difficult to get their names onto the list of speakers, and their proposals and amendments are more often than not rejected, either by the leading delegations within the House or by the European Commission. This gives rise to some fundamental questions, such as where we are heading and what the point of our work is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The illegal action of a major state such as the United States of America on an independent continent such as Europe and the violation of human rights are an insult to Europe, which gave birth to democracy and secured freedom, the presumption of innocence and security three centuries ago with the declaration of human rights. It is, at the same time, ironic that these discoveries coincide with the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The century we are living in has a great many achievements to show. Nonetheless, this is the first time that two of the most important rights – security and freedom – have clashed in the international arena to such an extent and intensity, crushing human rights between them.</p>
<p class="contents">Someone once said that democracy is when someone knocks on your door at dawn and you know it is the milkman.
