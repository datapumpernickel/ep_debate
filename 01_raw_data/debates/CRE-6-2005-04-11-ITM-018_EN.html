<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Markov (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the very outset, I would like – sincerely and not as a mere polite formality – to thank my comrades in arms, in particular Mr Ioannis Damis, Mr Achim Haug, and also the shadow rapporteurs who have been with me for some considerable time, from the time when we drew up Parliament’s position for first reading, and who, with me, are now taking matters further following the Council’s Common Position for second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the Commission, even though, on some points, we sometimes occupied positions at some distance from one another, and also the Council, despite the fact that the final result we have so far – with its various stages – gives me but little satisfaction. I will be considering that in more detail later on. It has to be said, though, that the Council Presidency was certainly always trying hard.</p>
<p class="contents">What should we be visualising? Here we are with what I will call, for the sake of simplicity – for the official nomenclature is very confusing – the rest and driving times regulation and the control directive. What is the point of them? What do we need them for? At the present time – one may or may not find it regrettable, but it is in any case a fact – goods are largely transported by road. At the present time, social regulations are in fact in permanent decline, and some of that decline has been set down in black and white by the Commission itself. We have set ourselves a target, of halving the number of accidental deaths by 2010, and what that boils down to is that we want road safety to have greater prominence as a major issue. That means that these two directives must help to balance road safety, social provision and equality in competition against one another, something about which our various groups have very definitely divergent views, one stressing one thing and another putting the emphasis elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The way the Committee voted did, however, show beyond any doubt that there is nevertheless a broad consensus among this House’s transport policy-makers as regards the rest and driving times regulation, which was adopted by two thirds of the votes, while the control directive received almost four fifths.</p>
<p class="contents">While all the parliamentary debates were going on, though, we were of course also stimulated by what we term the extra-parliamentary debates, strenuous and wide-ranging though some of these were, and it clearly follows that the European Trades Union Congress and the Road Hauliers’ Association necessarily have different views on the subject. I do, however, believe that their demands and aspirations can, in the final analysis, be united around a common objective, but differences of emphasis on what was excessive meant that opinions varied.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with the regulation on rest and driving times. What positive results have been achieved so far? A flexible week was proposed, and rejected. We brought the calendar week back; that has been agreed on. We have also, of course, agreed that this regulation is to be incorporated in the AETR Agreement. There was disagreement, though, as to how this is to be done, as to how much pressure we have to build up, for Parliament has stated quite unequivocally – and that, too, I see as absolutely necessary – that this regulation must be fundamental, and that all who travel on the European Union’s roads, no matter from which country they come, must comply with it, and with no delay whatsoever. That will help safety and, above all, fair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">As early as at first reading, and again now, we have been able to agree among ourselves, and I do of course hope that Wednesday’s vote will make that a matter of record. The driving time we have stipulated – 90 hours in two weeks, but no more than 56 hours in a week – is still a considerable one. By it we have guaranteed the flexibility that road transport needs. At the same time, though, we have ensured that, when considered over the space of two weeks, it can be regarded as an acceptable amount from the point of view of safety.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the Commission proposal and also to the Council, we in this House have brought in definitions that the Council and the Commission have not themselves come up with. If we are to have a regulation on rest and driving times, we must at least say what driving time actually is, and so this House has made a great effort to make up for those things that are lacking in ways that the legislator itself could have done. I can understand how there can be different viewpoints where definitions are concerned. There is no mistaking the fact that Parliament came to an agreement on them. Those who neither want nor like the proposed definitions have the opportunity to suggest others. That is a course of action more appropriate to a parliament than simply rejecting the proposal and being unwilling to accept any.</p>
<p class="contents">Where rest periods are concerned, the majority in this House is of one mind; we want 12 hours. We do, though, very much want a degree of flexibility in the way these rest periods are observed, staggered and apportioned – I might add that that is what the drivers themselves say, and if you talk to their union, you will get that confirmed. It is also feasible. The Council did come up with a proposal on break times that I thought was a good one; although it was amended by the Committee, I regard the result as a workable variant. It makes it clear that you can indeed take different views on different points and nonetheless end up with a proper result on which you can all agree, but, all the same, we are still left with a number of problems that will not be so easy to resolve, and I will now list them for the sake of clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is cause for gratitude that this House has rightly, and by a substantial majority, endorsed the incorporation of vehicles under 3.5 tonnes within the scope of this directive; rightly, in our view, for this directive is not limited to categories of vehicles by weight, which, to some extent, the Council and the Commission wanted to tell us it was. Instead, it has a purpose, one to which all vehicles operating in this field must be subject. We have put forward a compromise proposal stating that we will allow an exemption within a radius of 60 km, which means that these vehicles can operate within this radius without a digital tachograph being fitted.</p>
<p class="contents">On the assumption that I have not misunderstood what was said in our debates with the Council, working time appears to be a major problem. It often happens in the haulage business that professional drivers not only drive the vehicle on the road, but also load and unload it, and also that, when they arrive at their destinations, they have to help with stevedoring. It follows that, if you give priority to road safety and social protection, you simply have to accept checks on these things too.</p>
<p class="contents">Having failed to get its regulation on the digital tachograph finished in time, the Council had originally incorporated these leftovers – as I like to call them – into the regulation on rest and driving times. Things do indeed sometimes take a fortunate turn, for I believe that the Council has an interest in bringing that too to a successful conclusion, and so Parliament has a good chance and is also in a strong position. Where the control directive is concerned, it is unfortunate that the Council, at first reading, rejected almost everything we proposed. It simply makes no sense at all. We have no use for a directive on driving times and rest periods if we do not wish to have any means whereby these may be checked up on. A distinction has to be drawn between road-side checks and on-site checks, as the different stages have to be checked in different ways. When checking on-site, though, working times can also be checked; it is possible to look through the sickness records and the leave sheets, thus seeing what else the drivers have been doing during the period in question.</p>
<p class="contents">None of that makes any sense if there is no common definition of what serious offences are. Such a definition is indispensable if we are to be able subsequently to analyse penalties in order eventually to equalise and harmonise them across the European Union, for it is not acceptable that something should be permitted in one Member State while being prohibited in another.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to call on the Council – which is not present, but will perhaps read this later on – to get a move on; we want this regulation and we want this directive, but not at any price. Our clear and unmistakeable message to the Council must be that Parliament will not stand for that. If the political will is there, we will agree. If the political will is not there, it is not from Parliament that it is absent – on the contrary, it is present there – but from the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first concerns the rules governing the maximum number of hours behind the wheel for professional drivers and their minimum breaks and rest periods. The second lays down the rules for the implementation of social regulations relating to road transport activities.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind you that the aim of these two proposals is to encourage fair competition between transport companies throughout the European Union and to improve road safety and the working conditions of professional drivers. The European harmonisation of social legislation in the realm of road transport is under way. This discussion of ours today, of course, relates to the European legislation on working hours in road transport which entered into force on 23 March. This new legislation guarantees that drivers operating in a country other than their own must comply with minimum European standards. There is now a need to supplement this legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The application of harmonised social rules is imperative, not only for the internal market and road safety but also as a means of guaranteeing minimum social rights for workers in the road transport industries. The joint efforts of Parliament and the Council have not so far produced an agreement. I can assure you that the Commission is ready, and will remain ready, to play its role as facilitator and mediator between the two institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the issue itself, let me emphasise that the rules currently in force were laid down twenty years ago. During that period, of course, we have seen road transport services being entirely opened to competition in the Community, not only for international operations but also for domestic transport. At the same time, the European Union has experienced several waves of enlargement, the most recent of which took place last year, and road transport has become the dominant mode of transport within the Union. Competition among road transporters is fierce, which induces operators to yield to the temptation to disregard basic social rules in order to safeguard their profit margins.</p>
<p class="contents">In an area where Europe is sometimes criticised for its lack of action in the social field, we must make every effort to resolve an issue of such deep concern to workers in the road transport industries.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I should like to remind you of the three main aims of the Commission when it formulated its proposal on driving times and rest periods for professional drivers. It is in the light of what has gone before that I shall indicate the position of the European Commission on the main elements of your report, Mr Markov, which I commend for its analytical clarity and relevance.</p>
<p class="contents">The first aim is to simplify the rules. Any attempt to reintroduce special provisions or manifold derogations and exemptions will not only make the rules highly complex but will also make them impossible to enforce. This is why we shall not be able <span class="bold"></span> why I personally, at the end of the day, am unable <span class="bold"></span><span class="bold"> </span>to accept any of the amendments that would make this instrument too complex and hence difficult to apply. The public image of Europe must be characterised by clarity, simplicity and accessibility. One obvious example is the amendment designed to permit a division of the daily rest period into four distinct parts. Regardless of the dubious benefits of such an arrangement in terms of road safety, it would encourage inspectors to focus only on the main daily rest period and ignore the others. This is why we are committed to simplification.</p>
<p class="contents">Then to the second aim, namely making the rules clearer for operators, drivers and inspectors. If we take the example of the proposal that all utility vehicles below 3.5 tonnes be included, this raises two questions: will every vehicle used for commercial purposes fall within the scope of the legislation? Will it mean compulsory fitting of tachographs to scooters used to deliver pizzas and to pick-ups? Is that even technically possible? I am well aware of Parliament’s concern to avoid abuses involving circumvention of the 3.5-tonne threshold, and I understand that concern. We must take care, however, to ensure that the rules are relatively clear, and we must never lose sight of the aim of effective enforcement.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there is the need to update the rules in the light of developments in the road transport sector. Let me give you two examples. Firstly, speed limits for agricultural and forestry tractors have been standardised throughout the European Union. This harmonisation has been taken into account by your Parliament, and the Commission will support the relevant amendment. Secondly, we have to recognise that public services such as postal services and gas- and electricity-supply services have undergone considerable change. I no longer see any reason to exclude them. Those, then, are the three aims.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the dates for the introduction of the digital tachograph. In the view of the Commission, the current deadlines of 5 May 2005 for Member States being able to issue driver cards and 5 August 2005 for the requirement that new vehicles be equipped with a digital tachograph should remain in place. There is no cogent reason for any additional delay. The manufacturers of tachographs and vehicle manufacturers have already made considerable investments. All of the Member States have committed themselves in the common position of the Council to the scheduled dates and are already establishing training courses for inspectors. If we were to extend the deadlines again, this would create the utmost uncertainty, both for the Member States and for the industries concerned. I must therefore plead at this stage for adhesion to the scheduled dates for the sake of greater legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me move on now to enforcement. The Commission’s objective is to enhance the quality and intensity of the checking efforts on the part of the Member States. It has tried to develop a comprehensive verification system covering all Community social legislation in the field of road transport, including the verification of compliance with the rules governing working hours. It has encouraged action to enhance coordination between inspectorates, both within and between Member States. It has sought to develop a harmonised approach to penalties and a common definition of serious infringements.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in the light of these goals that I shall indicate the Commission’s response to the amendments proposed by the European Parliament, which seem on the whole to reflect the concerns of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is enforcement of the rules on working hours. The Commission can only support the reintroduction of this element into the draft. The approach based on verification within undertakings for which you have opted seems to me to be a logical and effective approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the common definition of several serious infringements. Yes, the Commission welcomes Parliament’s reintroduction of this provision into the draft, because we believe that a harmonised approach to verification requires a common definition of what constitutes a serious infringement.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the designation of a national supervisory authority. This body would be responsible for coordinating the checks conducted by Member States at both the national and the international level. This provision as formulated by Parliament is fully supported by the Commission. Such an authority would not dictate to the various national inspectorates but would reconcile their points of view. This would be an improvement on the Council’s common position, which provides for a national enforcement strategy and a national point of contact with the other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we come to the deadlines by which the frequency of checks is to be increased from 1% to 3% of working days. While we appreciate the aim pursued by Parliament and acknowledge that the Council’s approach suffers from a lack of ambition, the Commission calls for realism, preferring to ensure that all Member States are in a position to carry out the number of checks required by the directive and that checks meet the prescribed quality criteria. You see, ever since I took up my present office, it has been my constant concern to ensure that our decisions can be effectively enforced, and it is for this reason that, while acknowledging the benefits of progressive stringency, we prefer to be certain that we shall at least achieve our goal.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point concerns roadside checks. Here the Commission urges caution; the list of data to be collected by inspectors from drivers should not be too extensive. Such stringent checks are liable to be counterproductive, because they will be difficult to conduct in roadside conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Mr President, is what I wished to add to the rapporteur’s presentation. My services will, of course, transmit the Commission’s detailed position on each of the tabled amendments.<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> I shall now listen attentively to the debate, and I shall remain at the disposal of the House for any questions that might arise.

<p class="contents">Members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism were united in aiming for regulations that would improve both road safety and drivers’ quality of life, regulations that would be not only correct but also practical and capable of being monitored. Differences of opinion may well have arisen over this or that point of detail.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee also raised the fundamental question of whether a new directive is actually needed at all. It is, in any case, clear that it is not acceptable that those hauliers that do not comply with the minimum standards should be getting an ever-larger share of the market. This is something on which I think all groups in this House were agreed. There may be doubt about whether this aim can be achieved by way of more comprehensive legislation, but one thing is clear – and that brings me back to something on which we are all agreed – that monitoring was and remains the most important thing.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive can be as good as you like in black and white, but that alone will not achieve very much; what is needed – and here I am appealing directly to the Council – is regular checks and harmonised penalties. You can imagine what we will end up with if people can choose, from among various countries, one whose penal arrangements are ideal from their point of view. That is something we are eminently familiar with, particularly in the border region from which I come.</p>
<p class="contents">We had over 240 amendments to deal with, and some 60 of them are left, along with an additional 16 of them. The Committee on Transport and Tourism has done a good job. I do not, of course, want to discuss all the amendments right now, but I would like to stress that our proposed date for the digital tachograph is intended to achieve legal certainty with what we regard as greater stability than what might otherwise come to pass if we were perhaps, in September, October or November, to adopt a directive that ought to have been applied in August of the same year. It therefore appears to me that the proposed date of 2006/2007 makes the legal basis rather more secure, and so we have to be able to debate this date and send a clear message to the world at large.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘three and a half tonne question’ was a major issue. We regard this as a safety issue, but we also do not want what are popularly called ‘sprinters’ to interfere with mobility in urban areas. This led some of us to believe that a limit of three and a half tonnes was something we could in any case work with. Another consideration is that it would not distort competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Among other things, we were aiming at flexibility, and what has been proposed today by way of daily rest periods and ways of regulating them, are, I think, capable of being more readily monitored than what the Council proposed. The figures are quite straightforward: 4.5 hours on the road and three breaks of quarter of an hour each, to be taken at times of the driver’s choosing. That is just an example of what we were trying to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">We too have tried to be flexible, and we hope that the Council and the Commission, when they look at these amendments, will be able to follow Parliament’s thinking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, actually, all very straightforward, Commissioner: drivers who have had a good night’s sleep are very good for safety on the roads, whilst exhausted drivers are a safety risk, or, to put it very simply, excessive tiredness is fatal. It is, then, for the sake of the drivers, of road safety and of competitiveness that we need proper driving times and rest periods that are capable of being monitored. Otherwise, the whole thing makes no sense.</p>
<p class="contents">We are agreed, then, that we need rest periods totalling 12 hours a day, of which 9 are to be taken in one go. It must be possible to check records covering the past 28 days in roadside checks. In any one week, drivers must not spend more than 56 hours at the wheel, and in a fortnight, they must stop after 90. We also need a realistic date for digital tachographs. The Regulation must also include a new category covering light commercial vehicles under 3.5 tonnes. Let me add, Commissioner, that we are not talking here about the delivery of pizzas, for a pizza, if it is transported – as the Committee on Transport and Tourism has suggested – for over 60 kilometres, will be cold and inedible! So we are not talking here about pizza delivery drivers, but about light commercial vehicles, which, at present, are allowed to do anything they like, including travelling at extremely high speeds, seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day, with no ban on driving on Sundays or at night, and without being checked up on – the consequence of which is an increasing number of accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">The only figures I can quote are the German ones: between 1991 and 2001, accidents involving small vans and resulting in personal injury rose by 103%. In Germany in 2001, accidents caused by the drivers of small vans resulted in the deaths of 206 road users (an increase of 44% over 1991), serious injury to 2 548 road users (an increase of 66%) and minor injuries to 13 939. Figures provided by the road traffic police seem to indicate over-tiredness as one of the most frequent causes of such accidents, as a relatively large number of accidents involving light commercial vehicles happen in the evening or at night. The Council must stop pleading ignorance of the problem, come back down to earth and face reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me repeat that this is not about the 60-kilometre radius, or about the post and service industries. Good rules and regulations are needed to deal with this problem. If it is accepted, in principle, that over-tiredness kills and injures, then responsible rules are needed. That is what the Committee wanted, and I hope that the Commission will, sooner or later, be able to come round to its way of thinking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not, however, think that there is any point in changing the provisions as such if this leads not to better rules but only to rules that are complex in a new way, for the regulation of driving time and rest periods is complicated, and must perhaps in the nature of things be so. It is complicated because we have to find a suitable balance between, on the one hand, being able effectively to monitor compliance with the rules with a view to road safety and, on the other hand, the needs of the transport sector and of drivers being able to organise their work in a reasonably flexible way.</p>
<p class="contents">I, for my part, must sincerely thank the rapporteur, Mr Markov for the splendid and comprehensive overview he has taken of this complicated material. There are, however, a number of points on which my group disagrees with some of the conclusions contained in the report resulting from the vote in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. These include applying the rules on driving time and rest periods to vehicles under 3.5 tonnes. In our view, this would make transport unnecessarily more expensive without contributing to road safety to a degree that justified the large costs involved in this proposal. It would also be quite difficult for the police to know right away whether an ordinary van was being driven for a firm that needed to have a tachograph installed in it. The proposal to include vehicles under 3.5 tonnes would therefore make monitoring very difficult. It is proposed to exclude from the directive vehicles used in connection with a long list of public supply services, such as sewerage, electricity, water, gas etc. Whether or not this proposal makes sense is questionable, but, if it is to be implemented, the exemption should, it has to be said, apply equally in the case of a private company commissioned by the public sector to carry out a task, for example under licence or following an invitation for tenders.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to long-distance drivers, we also think it right and important for the weekly rest period to be organised more flexibly than the Council has proposed. This applies to the placing of reduced weekly rest periods and the compensatory rest periods. We have therefore tabled an amendment on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the votes in the committee were very close in a number of areas, and it is therefore exciting to see the committee here in plenary where we need to have the qualified majority mobilised. Subsequently, the issue will be one of whether we can reach a conciliation with the Council. The ALDE Group would like us to arrive at a situation in which an uninterrupted period of rest of 11 hours is obtained, but we do not, however, think that the Council is right in thinking that the interrupted rest period needs only to be three plus nine hours. That is too inflexible and shows signs of too much weight having been given to ease of supervision as a consideration. The Council adheres, of course, to the view that tachographs should be installed from this year but, as matters now stand regarding adoption of the directive and the ability to install the tachographs at the present time, it seems a bit over the top to insist on this date, and we in the ALDE Group are able to support a postponement.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much hope that, in the conciliation procedure, we shall find a solution regarding this directive that both meets the need for more effective monitoring and, at the same time, ensures that drivers have sufficient flexibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that the decision Parliament makes during the vote on Wednesday will be the right one, and that Members vote in favour of humane working conditions, road safety and fair competition – not only between the individual businesses that use the roads, but also between the various modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent years the situation in this sector has gone from bad to worse; we are witnessing social dumping of epic proportions, above all in the case of long-distance lorry drivers, not to mention coach drivers. We are faced with the fact, demonstrated by monitoring, that people are working for 38 hours without a break. No one can possibly drive for this long without using caffeine or other substances, some of which may well be illegal. It is patently obvious that this poses a risk to road safety, and the Council cannot fail to realise that this risk is presented not only by 40-tonne lorries, but also by small lorries known as ‘sprinters’ that are travelling long distances.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest findings unfortunately show that the risk to road safety from such vehicles has risen exponentially, and it is obvious that these figures do not relate only to Germany. The drivers of these vehicles are under particular pressure, as a great many of them deliver Internet orders and what are known as just-in-time services. This naturally means that they are under a great deal of pressure, and measures must be taken at EU level to protect them, just as measures must be taken to protect other road users from tired drivers.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that no one here will have forgotten the tragic tunnel disasters, the cause of which has been attributed to driver fatigue. This was only the tip of the iceberg, however, as we hear – time and time again, unfortunately – of accidents caused by tiredness at the wheel. It is a regrettable fact that the Council is quite clearly on the wrong side of the fence on this matter. I am sorry to have to be so blunt, but on occasions one could be forgiven for thinking that the Council was an ambassador for the black sheep among Europe’s business road users. In my opinion, it would be a real shame if this were to be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you to support our position, in so doing acting in the interests of road safety, increasing Europe’s social credibility and making it possible for more frequent checks to be carried out in high-risk areas, where the demands we make of road safety are higher. We should let the whole world know that the European Parliament is the social conscience of the European Union.</p>

Likewise, I would also like to thank you, Commissioner, for your thorough commentary.</p>
<p class="contents">The social rights of employees, safe road travel and corporate interests – those are the main aspects which this proposal has dealt with. I do not think, however, that the Committee on Transport and Tourism’s version is now balanced in all these aspects. We know that the new European Union Member States are also, unfortunately, peripheral states, and therefore they are already less competitive in objective terms in the business of road haulage, since they are located far from the most concentrated areas of the market. Unfortunately, the draft contains proposals which further adversely affect opportunities for these road hauliers, such as the extension of the compulsory daily rest period or even the cumulation of such periods; also, the opportunity for drivers to take reduced weekly rest periods outside the depot is being withdrawn and there is a proposal prohibiting the payment of a bonus to hauliers for distance covered even if this does not pose a threat to traffic safety. All these proposals, in my opinion, are designed not to combat so-called ‘wage dumping’, as it is expressed in the justification, or ‘social dumping’, as it is currently known, carried out by businessmen in the new Member States, but in fact in order to preserve the existing division of the market. These concerns regarding drivers’ wages and social protection may lead to drivers from the new Member States avoiding wage dumping overall, because, if they become unemployed, they will not receive any pay at all. Article 11 of the directive currently also lays down a guarantee for participants in a collective agreement between social partners already in force. Builders in Latvia and a few other new Member States, and perhaps now also hauliers, know how ‘easy’ it is to operate in such a situation, if we do not try to balance out interests when we vote for this legislation. I am also not convinced that extending the scope of this legislation to vehicles with a weight under three and a half tonnes if these are operating within a radius exceeding 60 kilometres will help to attain social objectives and traffic safety objectives. This puts an extra financial and technical burden on those vehicles which, according to the statistics, are not the most dangerous. In addition, it will create a reason for express companies to enter into agreements with self-employed drivers, which in turn will worsen social protection for these people and will in fact have only adverse consequences for safety on the roads, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There needs to be a sensible number of checks, as any legislation is futile and ineffective if its implementation is not monitored. We should therefore join forces to persuade the Council to accept the proposals contained in the Markov reports, and to ensure that a sufficient number of checks are carried out. To put it quite bluntly, our task must be to protect lorry drivers from their own managers, as it would appear that some are being forced, either directly or indirectly, to drive for excessively long periods of time. This means that they pose a danger both to themselves and to everyone else.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, the rules need to be realistic and based on common sense. I believe the Commissioner’s out-of-hand rejection of some of the proposals contained in the Markov report was somewhat over-hasty. Our proposals are a great deal more sensible and easier to implement, in particular those relating to rules on breaks and daily rest periods. These proposals should therefore be backed.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, however, share your views on the issue of lorries weighing less than 3.5 tonnes. I agree with Mr Piecyk that they too pose a risk, but we must not forget the bureaucracy and costs that would be involved if the rules on tachographs and suchlike were also to apply to these types of commercial vehicle. We should go back to the drawing board on this matter, and we must face facts, Commissioner; your average local milk float, circus caravan or tractor really has no need for a tachograph. You said that we should avoid having too many derogations, yet the derogations we have proposed are based on nothing but a desire to be realistic and to apply common sense.</p>
<p class="contents">The conciliation procedure for the legislation on tachographs will be brought to a close sometime this autumn, and there would be little point in having a regulation that cannot be applied. Based on my close contacts with industry, it is my personal belief that it is unrealistic to expect all freight forwarders to be able to install tachographs by August of this year, even if certain manufacturers are claiming that they could provide them. I would therefore ask you to go along with our proposals and to set a sensible deadline. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As for the rest of his rantings, they were as incomprehensible to me as they were to everybody else, and I notice that he has not bothered to stay for the rest of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this directive because, as the Commissioner said, the current proposals are 20 years old. A lot has changed in that time: the abolition of frontiers, the single customs document and better roads, which means you can now drive for long periods of time without any natural interruption. We have an EU of 25 Member States, covering 1.5 million square miles of territory. Therefore it is vital for road safety to have a consistent set of rules across the European Union. It is currently possible to drive for up to 8 hours and 59 minutes with only a 15-minute break. That is unacceptable: tiredness kills, and failing to modernise these proposals would be irresponsible.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is important that the legislation be workable and enforceable, not only simply, but also consistently across the EU. Therefore, I welcome Parliament’s proposals to require new vehicles to be fitted with digital tachographs at least from 2006. The Commission is wrong to insist stubbornly on its position, given that only two out of the three potential tachograph suppliers are able to test pre-production models at the moment and are not able to go into full production.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the break periods be simple and easy to understand and that a degree in mathematics is not required to apply them! It is also important to have derogation for essential services delivered in the interests of the public, no matter the nature of the body that delivers those services.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the committee’s proposals on bus and coach services, provided that we can differentiate between the leisure industry and the express-coach industry.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I still remain to be convinced that certain proposals can be enforced and understood. I recognise the problems with the express-vehicle industry but I am not sure how these proposals can be enforced. I do not think retrofitting digital tachographs is feasible at a cost that most people could afford. I also question whether it would be possible to scrutinise the application of the Working Time Directive in this directive, given that most of the records would be held back at base and not in the lorry concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present, the law of the jungle prevails. Drivers’ crude working conditions have been discussed, as have the consequences for road safety. Tired drivers in large lorries are disastrous for road safety. Quite apart from this, however, the conditions of competition are completely awry. Transport by rail or sea, which is far better in terms both of the environment and safety, has no chance, of course, in relation to road transport, which is far too cheap. We are in favour of fair competition, and road hauliers should of course pay the real price for decent transport and not simply pass all the consequences of their activities onto society. Those who are opposed to better regulation and tighter controls have become vociferous mouthpieces for the most brutal part of the transport sector. With fair pricing through sensible regulation and firm controls, there are also better chances of other forms of transport that are safe and environmentally friendly being able to develop. That is the form of competition we want to see in Europe. It must be the best form of transport that is able to carry the day, not the most brazen or the most ruthless. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why, with the help of some of my colleagues from across the political spectrum, I have submitted an amendment to have this proposal rejected in its entirety.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus my contribution to this debate on the very essence of what the proposal means to people in my constituency, which I am sure is mirrored across the whole of the European Union. At present bus services in rural areas, where many people are elderly and rely on public transport, are run by small and medium-sized companies, which the EU claims to be the backbone of the economy. Yet legislation like this will cripple their very existence. Proposals for rest hours will mean increased cost to the consumer and industry alike, reduced services and, in some cases, no service at all.</p>
<p class="contents">In the commercial sector, just-in-time delivery systems, the backbone of modern-day supply for industry, will be jeopardised. This again will mean increased cost to the consumer and industry alike. In the UK alone it is estimated that the cost of this regulation and the working time directive together will be over GBP 1 billion, and that is not my figure, it is the industry’s.</p>
<p class="contents">The argument of road safety used by many does not wash from my point of view. We must stop claiming that over-regulation means safer roads. The UK, with less regulation, probably has the safest roads in Europe. This proposal has little to do with road safety, and more to do with an ingrained anti-road agenda from the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">By their very nature, British Conservatives oppose such restrictive legislation being piled on business and the consumer, and we are not alone. This proposal takes no account of the need for flexibility in key areas of the transport sector, pays scant regard to the consumer and is contemptuous of the need for Europe’s industry to remain competitive. I therefore have no hesitation in urging this House to support our key amendment to reject the proposal in its entirety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That does mean, though, that I am dissatisfied with the position adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism in respect of the Regulation on driving times and rest periods. Road safety requires that driving times and rest periods be enforced more effectively, but a good number of proposed changes go well beyond that and cannot be implemented. Some Members have already mentioned the compulsory installation of the digital tachograph under the 3.5 tonne mark. That is, of course, unworkable in practice. Equally, it is not viable to install digital tachographs in existing vehicles, because this is often technically impossible, and therefore also undesirable.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, things have to become more practical and the administrative burden must be cut back. Eleven hours of sleep at night, instead of twelve, is more than enough. That is also the Council’s view, and I hope that Parliament adopts the same view by rejecting the first part of Amendment 62. Road checks up to 28 days do not benefit road safety and also lead to unnecessary bureaucracy. The Council proposal is better in this respect too, and I therefore hope that Mr Markov will be somewhat more obliging towards the Council in those areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if we want safer transport, we have to encourage, rather than discourage, the doubling of crew in long-distance transport. In the run-up to the plenary vote, I should like to urge you to reject the proposal on the said points, because those measures unnecessarily push up the costs for what are often small businesses. If the outcome of the vote in the plenary meeting is not considerably better than in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, it may be wise to fall back on existing legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today’s two draft reports, on social legislation relating to road transport and on the monitoring of its implementation, will play a key role in this regard. If we were to succeed in using European legislation to ensure that practices relating to driving and rest periods, which are often nothing short of scandalous, are conducted in a more orderly fashion, this would inevitably mean that the costs of employing people to work on the roads and on the railways would become more comparable, and that would be quite something.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet our aim is not and must not be to content ourselves with laws that exist only on paper. Compliance with this legislation must be monitored, and such monitoring must be made possible. The second of these two concerns can be addressed by means of digital tachographs that are less vulnerable to tampering, yet what will then be needed is for the national police forces to monitor these devices by means of systematic road-side checks. It will also be necessary to ensure compliance with driving and rest periods.</p>
<p class="contents">Important as it is to ensure that framework regulations relating to driving times in road and rail transport are brought into line, the two Markov reports pursue a further goal, namely road safety. Far too many accidents are caused by tired drivers, and measures must be taken to curb this problem. An out-of-control 40-tonne lorry is a dangerous weapon, and moving bombs of this kind must not be tolerated. The Member States must put in place effective checks to remedy this dangerous situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I am particularly concerned to see that the Presidency, or at least its ministers, is not present at today’s debate, even though it acts as the representative of the Member States. It may well be the case that Luxembourg has imposed mandatory rest periods for ministers, yet I am more inclined to think that the problem lies elsewhere. Debates in this House on legislative texts are being held at ever-later hours, and we would do well to break this habit. Perhaps the Council would then be present at debates such as the one we are holding today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new reality of Europe has a very particular effect in territories such as Spain and others, which have become peripheral given the locations of the main European markets. For these peripheral countries, the need for longer journeys is much more probable than for the central countries, which are closer to the centres of production and consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to try to relieve this situation, we believe it would be fair to establish flexibility formulae, in order to prevent adverse geography from progressively diminishing the competitiveness of transport in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In a situation such as this, legislative zeal leads to excesses, and rather than harmonisation, rigid rules can create an imbalance in the conditions faced by drivers from the peripheral States.</p>
<p class="contents">The obligation to take a further rest period after six consecutive driving periods means that long-distance drivers often cannot return to their places of origin and that they therefore have to take their weekly rests during the journey.</p>
<p class="contents">This is truly worthy of condemnation since the rest conditions often far from match those we might consider necessary for maintaining a reasonable quality of life: remaining confined and isolated in the rest area of a motorway, without accommodation or appropriate sanitary conditions, in a faraway country and, furthermore, with no possibility of leaving the vehicle out of fear of robbery. This situation is all the more horrendous given that, in theory, it is claimed that these measures are intended to guarantee adequate rest conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The concept of ‘long distance’ has been taken up in other sectors, such as deep-sea fishing. Furthermore, in the field of transport, French legislation distinguishes between short-distance and long-distance drivers. It is essential that we distinguish between each of these cases in order not to penalise long-distance drivers nor the legitimate interests of the peripheral countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Members of this House have always applauded such statements, as many of us are aware that we are faced with EU legislation that is developing imperialistic tendencies and attempting to regulate everything under the sun. Yet the irony is that whenever the relevant specialist committees, for example the Committee on Transport and Tourism, are presented with individual drafts, those very same Members unfailingly fall back into the regulatory rut by voting to increase the number of regulations for which there is no rational justification. The regulation we are currently debating, on the harmonisation of social legislation, is a clear example of this way of thinking and acting, and there are a number of points I should like to make in this regard. Firstly, I believe that there is no justification for the fact that no differentiation whatsoever has been made between aspects of road traffic legislation and of employment legislation. Different types of legislation are not mixed up in this way in other areas of public life, yet in this case no distinction has been made between employment legislation and other legislation. Secondly, the principle of subsidiarity has been grossly violated. Thirdly, and this is a crucial point, the regulations provide for an entire system of checks which amounts to nothing more than bloated machinery, and which will be practically impossible to implement. The Members of this House have made it quite clear that it would be enormously difficult to put such a system into practice. Fourthly, the level of detail in the regulations, in particular with regard to work and rest periods and how they are to be divided up and separated, is a terrifying vision of bureaucracy that leaves almost no room for manoeuvre. Given all these factors, I believe that this is exactly the kind of regulation the European Union could manage very well without. It is a perfect example of the 25% of regulations referred to by Mr Barroso. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not need to stress, Mr Markov - and some of you have emphasised this - that we do not want to legislate just for the sake of it. This is about road safety. There are still large numbers of deaths on the roads throughout Europe, and we must be very aware of that. We also need fair competition among hauliers, and we need to consider those hauliers and their working life. I am among those who believe that, when a job is performed in accordance with a certain number of rules, this also enables the worker to give his best and often to be more efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to return to a general idea shared, I think, by many of you: that it is not enough to define rights, but that we must also create the conditions within which these rights can be exercised. In other words, we must pay great attention to the enforceability of the rules. The rules need to be enforceable, because they must be enforced. That is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Our discussion has focused in particular on two subjects: vehicles weighing less than 3.5 tonnes. The Commission is prepared to examine this issue in depth. If you wish, I will suggest that we include a <span class="italic">rendez-vous</span> clause to see how we can respond, if need be, to any needs it may seem necessary to meet. I believe that, in this field, we need to act intelligently and pragmatically. If we need to go further, Mr Markov, I am not saying no <span class="italic">a priori</span>, but we do need to see the scope of these rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I have listened with attention to some of you, in particular authors of amendments such as Mr Grosch and Mr Jarzembowski, regarding the problem of tachographs. It is a problem that may give rise to debate, I realise, but I would like to give you some specific details that may help you to understand better why the Commission remains very keen for this system to be implemented rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you that Article 2 of Regulation No 2135/98, which introduces the digital tachograph, specifies that vehicles put into service for the first time more than two years after the publication of the technical specifications will have to be fitted with digital tachographs. The technical specifications were published on 5 August 2002, and the date for entry into force was set, in the normal way, at 5 August 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">As digital tachograph manufacturers were unable to supply the equipment in time, however, my predecessor, Mrs de Palacio, quite rightly introduced a moratorium laying down transitional measures for the Member States and delaying the compulsory installation of digital tachographs in new lorries until 5 August 2005. The Council insisted on confirming this date in the legal text on driving time and rest periods.</p>
<p class="contents">To the Commission, the date of 5 August 2005 already represents a delay of a year compared to the planned deadline. I think we need, and I am saying this in all sincerity, to send a clear signal to the industry and to the Member States. That is why we want to reach, as far as possible, rapid agreement on the draft directive and regulation before you today.</p>
<p class="contents">On the technical level - because we need to ensure that everything is ready in this regard too - I would like to remind you of certain facts. Type-approval certificates for digital tachographs were granted to ACTIA in June 2004, to VDO Siemens in October 2004 and to several card manufacturers. A card security system has been set up by the Commission’s Joint Research Centre. TACHOnet, a system that makes it possible to ensure that each driver has only one driver card, has been in operation since August 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">All the main vehicle manufacturers have started to test the digital tachograph in their vehicles and may be ready before the introduction deadline of August 2005. A tachograph manufacturer whom I myself met told me that he was able to supply the required number of tachographs to vehicle manufacturers between now and May 2005. Training programmes are currently being drawn up for drivers and transport operators, and the Member States are cooperating to provide similar courses for their enforcement personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add, and I would like to stress this point somewhat, that, if we agree to a delay in the introduction of digital tachographs, we leave ourselves open to legal action from those in the relevant professions who are ready. As for catalytic converters, it is true that there was not yet any final legal decision, but they were nevertheless put in place as soon as industry supplied them. In my opinion, there are times when the European Union must take the lead.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very concerned to be realistic and to respect our industries, but I sincerely believe that another delay would not be good for anyone. That is why I have been listening very carefully to your comments on this point. That is what I wanted to say, Mr President. I would like to thank Parliament and I am reminded again of how advantageous it is to be able to have a dialogue between the Council and Parliament. This, it seems to me, is how we will end up with balanced and enforceable legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
