<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McKenna (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, marine pollution, accidental and deliberate, is one of the major threats to the marine environment in western Europe. This region represents one of the most intensely industrialised areas of the world, where chemical, radioactive and hydrocarbon materials are routinely discharged into the marine environment and carried by cargo ships.</p>
<p class="contents">The region also contains one of the highest concentrations of shipping and includes several of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. There are several tragic examples of accidental pollution from tankers and from other ships carrying other forms of dangerous cargoes. The recent example of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> shows what can happen from an environmental, human and economic point of view. It is a catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">More by good fortune than good planning there has not yet been a major accident with a ship carrying radioactive materials that has resulted in a major spillage. However, it must be said that there have been a number of incidents. In 1973 a cobalt 60 source was lost in the North Sea, never to be found again. In 1984, the <span class="italic">Mont Louis</span> sank in the English Channel with 375 tonnes of uranium hexafluoride. Also, in relation to releases into the sea, in 1983 Sellafield leaked high-level waste into the sea. In 1985, there was a leak into the sea at Hinkley Point. In 1986, 135 cubic metres of radioactive water was released into the sea at Wylfa. The Commission's refusal to take on board and include explicitly radioactive materials, is not acceptable and it will have to revise its position on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Historically the marine environment has been used as the ultimate dumping ground for much of our industrial waste. Although industrial and radioactive discharges continue from a range of sources, the practice of direct dumping with little thought for the future is now widely regarded as unacceptable. However, the legacy of the years when materials were simply dumped remains and sometimes comes back to haunt us, with severe consequences. It is a lesson which shows that we cannot just throw things away: that is not possible, as they are still there in some shape or form.</p>
<p class="contents">This report acknowledges the need for establishing cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution. Furthermore, there is a need to broaden the definition of accidental marine pollution to include both operational, historical, radioactive and other harmful substances.</p>
<p class="contents">Although much attention is rightly paid to the impacts of marine accidents in terms of chronic pollution, it is the operational spills and discharges of hydrocarbons, radioactive materials and other harmful substances which, because they go largely unnoticed, are a cause of major concern. In terms of the environment, whether a substance is accidentally or deliberately discharged is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, although the direct dumping of industrial materials, including military dumping of redundant munitions, is largely a practice abandoned by Member States, the sites of such dumps continue to present a real threat to fisheries and, in some cases, to human safety. Often fishermen's lives are at risk, as is the health and welfare of the public who either visit the coast or live by the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as the sea is the ultimate sink for industrial materials from the shores and rivers, these sources should be included within the definition. The transboundary nature of the marine environment, which means that pollution in one area can impact on a wider region, leads to the need for a Community-wide framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution. Sharing information regarding hydrocarbons, radioactive substances and other harmful substances carried at sea, discharged into the sea or which have been dumped as part of historical dumping regimes, is a vital prerequisite in facilitating the preparation and coordination of any response necessary to mitigate the impact of pollution incidents on the environment and human health. Effective mitigation requires a rapid response: the longer an accident is allowed to go unchecked, the wider the impact. Hence, it is too late to start trying to get information after a serious pollution problem has occurred.</p>
<p class="contents">Knowledge about the type and extent of potential pollution problems is also a prerequisite for correct preparation in terms of techniques, personnel and equipment at appropriate locations. It is also necessary to be clear about the risks to the public and the environment and to alleviate justifiable public concern, with accurate assessment of the risks. The public's trust in the authorities is important to ensure adequate response.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the public has a right to know what preparations are being made, what types of materials are threatening and what impacts can be expected. To this end, the publication of information is a vital component as it establishes a route through which the general public can obtain information, e.g. emergency phones and contact numbers. Such information can easily be made available and updated on the Internet as well as through established channels.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, once the marine environment has been contaminated or polluted, it is impossible to fully clean up and repair the damage. The <span class="italic">Erika</span> is a good example of that. However, a rapid, efficient, adequate and effective response coordinated across national boundaries is needed to mitigate the impacts on the environment and public health in the case of pollution incidents. This is a prerequisite in the necessary information sharing with all parties.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This should prove to be an instrument of particular interest, as is perfectly illustrated by the latest marine disaster to hit the coasts of France.</p>
<p class="contents">In January, this Parliament adopted a resolution, following the oil pollution related to the sinking of the Erika. What is the situation today? Fuel oil is still leaking out of the hull, which is lying at a depth of around 100 metres, and, contrary to the statements made six months before, this oil is continuing to pollute our coasts and to poison the marine environment. Implications for the environment and for animal life have been tragic, and there are still serious threats. Serious social consequences are expected in future: fishermen, hotel owners and all the people involved in tourism are going to suffer for years from the effects of this oil slick.</p>
<p class="contents">The International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, or IOPCF, seems extremely reluctant to provide compensation for the victims and, in any case, the amounts it is prepared to release would not be at all adequate. This proves, once again, that the principle of ‘polluter pays’ is not being applied. I should like to see real cooperation being established in order to guarantee, pursuant to this principle, repair of the damage caused.</p>
<p class="contents">This framework for cooperation will, therefore, make it possible to improve existing local or national resources, particularly by creating better conditions for intervention in the event not only of accidental pollution but also of deliberate pollution. This would therefore make it possible to include illegal degassing and any other source of pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also stress the importance of research. This winter, on the Atlantic coasts of France, effective techniques to combat the oil slick in Brittany were seriously lacking. Cooperation and the exchange of know-how must be encouraged and supported in this highly technical field.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the extension of this cooperation to the countries of the Mediterranean and to the countries of central and eastern Europe as well as to TACIS programme countries, I should like to inform Mrs McKenna that I do not entirely agree with her, and this is perhaps one of the few points with which I do actually disagree. There are international conventions on the Mediterranean and the Baltic, which already fulfil this purpose. Mrs McKenna’s idea may seem perfectly generous, but the appropriations and the staff allocated to this framework for cooperation, with appropriations of EUR 7 million for a period of 7 years, seem much too little to me. On the same grounds, I do not think there is any point in providing for a management committee.</p>
<p class="contents">In its resolution on the oil slick in January, the European Parliament requested that this framework for cooperation might come into force as quickly as possible. Let me today stress the fact that the 5 compromise amendments should be adopted and that we should not delay the establishment of Community cooperation which will prove an excellent instrument, one that European citizens are awaiting impatiently, out of concern for the protection of our marine environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Enormous destruction is caused by oil spills and discharges into the sea of other substances which are damaging to health and to the environment. It is destruction which spreads far and wide. We see before our very eyes the destroyed coastal areas, birds covered in oil, and fish floating on top of the water, and we also hear the reports about the polar bears which have become hermaphrodite because of hormone-affecting substances also supplied through the sea. Sometimes, the pollution occurs by accident, sometimes through indefensible conduct and, at other times, through the deliberate actions of a variety of individuals and companies. But, however it has occurred, the damage to animal life and the environment is equally disastrous and, very often, it of course cuts across national borders. I therefore think it is important that, by means of this proposal, we create the basis for close cooperation between the Member States, with a good information and warning system and with a guarantee of mutual assistance when needed, so that harmful spillages can be prevented or combated effectively. I am able to support the report with the amendments that have been tabled, and I shall only single out a few of the latter. I think it is good that radioactive substances have been included in the report. I also think it is good that pollution due to dumping and to used ammunition has been included. Like Mrs Grôssetete, I think it is important that we establish the polluter-pays principle and, in this regard, I can support the rapporteur, as well as Mrs Grôssetete’s amendment. Finally, I think it is good that we can get the neighbouring coastal countries involved, both in the Baltic area and in the Mediterranean. I hope that, by means of the compromise amendments that have just now been tabled, we can achieve a result that can be translated into effect very quickly and so with no need for any Conciliation Committee procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The accident involving the Erika off the French coast is just one of the many accidents which have occurred involving a ship. It is also often the case that cargo goes overboard. Either way, the marine environment is polluted. </p>
<p class="contents">This directive only contributes in a small way towards cross-border cooperation in order to prevent this type of accident. A far greater contribution would be if a piece of EU legislation governing environmental liability with regard to dangerous cargo were to be laid down. Unfortunately, we still only have a communication and a White Paper, not a bill. </p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to accidents involving radioactive cargo, it is unfortunate that the Environmental Ministers did not expressly acknowledge this problem and dealt with it accordingly in the common position. According to European Commission officials, radioactive cargo is implicitly covered in the text. I would invite Commissioner Wallström to take a stand on this issue, explicitly so. Let us, as a European Parliament, have the courage to include radioactivity explicitly in the text too. </p>
<p class="contents">When the Drinking Water Directive was reviewed a couple of years ago, the European Parliament insisted on a tough limit for radioactive substances. Thanks to the European Parliament’s perseverance, this was also included in legislation.

<p class="contents">Whether deliberate or accidental, even if we cannot equate illegal degassing and the use of obsolete vessels and flags of convenience, it is still the same rationale of maximum short-term profit which is adopted by oil companies such as Total, Elf and Fina, for example. This is why we must, at every level – French, European and international – support any restrictive legislation concerning contractor liability, for either civilian or military contractors, by enforcing the principle of ‘polluter pays’. It is scandalous, moreover, than no serious penalty has yet been considered following the wreck of the Erika.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite clearly, risk prevention measures must be stepped up by improving vessel design and construction standards, one such measure being mandatory double hulls. This also requires establishing an independent system of classification societies, increasing the number of inspectors in European Union ports, and also banning oil tankers that are more than 20 years old from European waters. Naturally, tipping harmful substances from the shore must be prohibited and, of course, radioactive substances must be specifically included in the list of toxic substances.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the fact that many States tolerate over a hundred flags of convenience, offering guarantees that are more than dubious, is a serious threat to the safety, the working conditions and even the lives of many sailors. The European Union will have to take action on this issue to and work towards establishing international standards. The McKenna report represents a move in the right direction, and we shall therefore vote in favour of it. We must, however, remain vigilant to ensure that the fine resolutions adopted by the European Parliament and the Council take the form of directives and mandatory regulations in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Admittedly, the proposed Commission Decision dates from December 1998 and the wreck of the Erika took place in December 1999, yet the inconsistency of this proposal, in spite of the repeated oil slicks occurring well before the Erika disaster, testifies to an extremely disturbing lack of resolve.</p>
<p class="contents">In such a clear area of common interest, the main priority should have been to do everything possible in order to prevent the recurrence of similar disasters and to finalise, as a matter of urgency, a preventative mechanism that was effective and dissuasive. The few measures before us today, however, presented as the elements of a Community framework for cooperation, deal only with managing the effects of pollution, principally in terms of the transmission of information, and say nothing about prevention. Furthermore, the slim size of this text betrays the inflexibility and inertia of Community procedures which are incapable, while in progress, of taking account of the effects of new events as significant as the sinking of the Erika, which did, however, reveal the serious implications of the lack of transparency in the chain of operators, the lack of polluter liability, the absence of deterrent penalties and the inadequate compensation schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">The text before us does not deal with any of these key issues and continues to be inspired by a philosophy which prioritises freedom of movement above any other considerations, particularly those concerning the security of our territories, our seas, and the citizens that live there and make their living from them.</p>
<p class="contents">Six months after the Erika disaster, with the entire Atlantic coastline suffering greatly, there has been no real progress. If a disaster similar to that involving the Erika were to take place today, then everything would happen in just the same way, because nothing has changed, and this mild text is not about to provide any significant help for the victims, who are now struggling with insurmountable problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told that, by the end of the year perhaps, there will be legislative proposals. It is high time. When will the matter finally be referred to Parliament? For the time being, Mr President, there are a few amendments which attempt to introduce the principle of ‘polluter pays’ into the common position. We shall, of course, support these. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">France did not have enough anti-pollution vessels to deal with this oil slick. Fortunately, the British, Germans, Dutch and Norwegians spontaneously came to our assistance. This goes to show that it is time to establish a new regulatory framework in order to optimise this cooperation, enabling reciprocal assistance. We therefore agree with the philosophy behind this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Exchanging information and know-how between Member States will make it possible to make faster and possibly better decisions, particularly during clean-up operations, where there is a certain amount of disorder. Stress must be placed on transparency with regard to the public, particularly in the event of health risks related to the nature of the pollutant. It is inconceivable that the risk of cancer should be kept from volunteers, as was the case in the Erika disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also in favour of extending the definition of accidental marine pollution to include radioactive pollution, arms and degassing. We think that extending cooperation to neighbouring maritime countries is a good idea. The sea is our international heritage, and protecting it is a matter for international responsibility. Recognition of the principle of ‘polluter pays’ is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present time, the owner of the potentially polluting products is not held accountable for the pollution. In practice, only the carrier is accused. This is not acceptable, and our hope is that the Member States will ensure that the principle of economic responsibility extended to the owners of the cargoes will be applied. The proposed budget of EUR 7 million is, in our opinion, however, much too little to fulfil these objectives properly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Regrettably, however, this was yet another in a catalogue of marine environmental disasters which included the <span class="italic">Braer</span> spill off Shetland and the <span class="italic">Sea Empress</span> off Wales. Recently in Ireland we were fortunate to escape a similar disaster when an oil spillage some 88 miles west of the Aran Islands threatened to engulf the Irish coastline. Thankfully the danger passed.</p>
<p class="contents">An added difficulty with marine pollution is that because of the nature of the sea it can rapidly spread to the coastlines of many Member States at once. Hence the need for a coordinated, effective EU response rather than simply leaving it in the hands of the Member State initially affected.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Ms McKenna's report. I would like to pay tribute to her for her work. But the real question is how we implement the legislation and what sort of action we take. The ability to respond quickly with sufficient resources is an essential element of any strategy that must be put into place immediately in the wake of a disaster to minimise environmental damage. It is doubtful that this could be adequately provided at a national level, which is why it must be done at a Europe-wide level.</p>
<p class="contents">The most effective way of achieving this is by establishing an EU coastguard which, as well as having responsibility for pollution control, could also undertake responsibilities for policing the high seas, enforcing the common fisheries policy and also marine rescue. I believe this is an issue which should be tabled for discussion at the forthcoming IGC.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How many times have we expressed our feelings, within this chamber, regarding the implications of this disaster, and how many times have we debated the issue of the European Union and the Member States’ inability to respond quickly to the expectations of victims and to react to the ecological damage?</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament cannot today fail to respond to public opinion, which is continually urging us to issue a strong, positive message. Let us not miss the opportunity which this report affords. The problems caused six months ago by the Erika, for example, have still not been even partially solved. Apparently, nothing has yet been solved, and this is the lesson we must learn from this disaster. We are aware, moreover, that containers loaded with radioactive materials are sailing the seas from The Hague to Japan. </p>
<p class="contents">Let us not wait until a fresh disaster occurs, this time a nuclear one, before doing something, because we know how oil reacts but we do not yet know how radioactive waste reacts when it is spilt into the depths. Mrs McKenna’s report offers us an opportunity to include radioactive substances. Let us please, ladies and gentlemen, not hesitate for even a moment.

Let us recall for a moment that the central objective of the OSPAR Convention is to reduce marine pollution to close to zero and to historic levels by the year 2020. From an Irish perspective we know that marine pollution in the Irish Sea has been on the increase in recent years and this is a direct result of the go-ahead given to the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant in December 1993. Surveys carried out in the Irish Sea have clearly shown that levels of a particular nuclear product, technetium-99 have increased 15-fold in the last seven years alone.</p>
<p class="contents">To date the British Government has only given broad general outlines as to the strategies it intends to take to comply with the provisions of the OSPAR Convention. This is simply not good enough and the people of Ireland and the people of Europe have a right to receive the real answers to many questions from the British Government. For years the British Government has tried to fob off many politicians and environmental groups in Ireland with reassurances about the Sellafield and Thorp nuclear plants. They cannot do this any longer because of the startling revelations this year about the wholly inadequate safety and quality control standards in operation at these plants.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish Government has tabled a draft decision for the OSPAR meeting calling on the contracting parties to an agreed acceleration of implementation of the OSPAR strategy. This will include the cessation of nuclear reprocessing and associated activities at the Sellafield and Thorp plants. This in turn will play a key role in reducing marine pollution in the Irish Sea. If the British Government wants to comply with its legal obligations under the OSPAR Convention it should state on 26 June in Copenhagen that it will outline a time framework for the closure of the Sellafield and Thorp plants. I would like to compliment Mrs McKenna on her excellent report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. – (SV)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin by thanking the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs McKenna, for their work on this important issue of how we in the European Union can become better at combating both accidental and deliberate pollution of the sea. </p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the Commission’s proposal is to reinforce and further develop the various Community measures which have been taken in this area during the last twenty years, as well as to combine them within a solid legal framework. Since the European Parliament’s first reading of this proposal, the Erika disaster has occurred in France, which is probably the accident involving marine pollution which has caused more damage than absolutely any other. I was at the scene of the disaster myself in January and was able to see the drastic consequences for human beings, animals and the environment. I also saw the considerable efforts made by hundreds of volunteers who arrived to help with the cleaning up operation. These people, I think, deserve our special appreciation. </p>
<p class="contents">Where preventive measures are concerned, the Commission responded directly in the shape of my fellow Commissioner, Mrs De Palacio and, on 21 March, adopted a communication concerning safety when transporting oil at sea. This report proposes a range of different measures for improving the safety of marine transport. </p>
<p class="contents">Even if the best preventive measures are taken, there will never be no risk at all of accidents. We therefore also need to improve cooperation within the EU when an accident does, in fact, occur. We require an effective framework of cooperation as a way of supporting and supplementing the measures taken by the Member States and of making these measures still more effective. The Erika disaster and its consequences show that we still have a very great deal to learn when it comes to dealing with major pollution accidents. </p>
<p class="contents">Following the first reading of this proposal in Parliament, the Commission approved or reformulated 20 of the 29 amendments you proposed. The Council has included most of these amendments in its common position. These changes have meant that the text has been improved. Above all, it has been explained what type of accidental pollution is included in the decision, for instance operational spills. The need for appropriate coordination with current international conventions and agreements relating to Europe’s seas has also been made clear. Where the amendments tabled for the second reading are concerned, the Commission is able, wholly or in part, to approve seven of these. Amendment 16 acknowledges the important role played by non-governmental environmental organisations in this area. The Erika disaster has been important in this respect, too, and shown how crucial it is for these organisations to be involved, something we also saw when birds injured by the oil had to be taken care of. </p>
<p class="contents">Parts of Amendments 6, 24 and 25 make the scope of the directive clear. Parts of Amendments 17 and 19 are completely in accordance with the Commission’s proposal concerning the most appropriate committee procedure. Amendment 22 introduces an important reference to the polluter-pays principle. </p>
<p class="contents">The remaining amendments are problematic for the following reasons. Amendment 2 and parts of Amendments 6, 10 and 24 introduce a specific reference to pollution caused by radioactive substances. Naturally, radioactive substances too are included in, and covered by, the cooperation elucidated here in this proposal. The Commission nonetheless believes that there is no justification for introducing a reference to specific substances, for this is not done in other international conventions that exist to protect the Mediterranean, the Baltic and the North Sea and to which the Community is a party. An express reference to radioactive substances would also mean complicating the legal situation because of the link to the Euratom Treaty and consequently delaying adoption of the decision. The Commission cannot therefore approve these amendments. So what kind of protection is there? There are two directives and an information system used in the event of accidents involving radioactive substances. There is Directive 96/29/Euratom on the establishment of basic safety standards. It is in accordance with this Directive, which specifies what is required in terms of joint operations in the event of a radiation accident, that the Member States are to establish action plans and develop networks and forms of cooperation. The <span class="italic">Ecurie system </span>is a system for the rapid exchange of information in the event of a possible radiation accident. It is a system which operates 24 hours a day. There is also Directive 89/618/Euroatom on the provision of information to the general public about measures for protecting their health in the event of a radiation accident. We therefore already have a number of different tools and regulations which have bearing upon a possible accident involving a ship carrying radioactive materials. Including a specific reference in this proposal is not only unnecessary but would also lead to an unclear legal situation. Why delay this proposed legislation, which really ought already to have been in place? </p>
<p class="contents">Several amendments, namely 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27, deal with the question of dumped ammunition. On this issue, the Commission supported the European Parliament at first reading. The Commission nonetheless believes that the text of the common position constitutes a reasonable solution. A number of Members of the Council were not prepared to accept that reference should be made to this issue other than in a recital. It is only because I insisted on it that a reference was finally introduced in Article 1.2(b) of the common position. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 5 and 9 introduce a definition of accidental marine pollution. This question has been discussed at length in the Council, which finally came to the view that the scope of the proposed decision should not extend to include constant streams of pollution from sources on land. The Commission concurred in this, because it has never been its intention to allow this decision to embrace this type of pollution, with which we deal in various other proposals. Amendments 5 and 9 cannot, therefore, be approved. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 14 and parts of Amendment 17 are aimed at improved cooperation with those countries which participate in the PHARE, TACIS and MEDA programmes. There is already a certain degree of coordination with the countries concerned within the framework of current international agreements concerning protection of the Mediterranean and the Baltic. Enlarging the proposed framework for cooperation would unfortunately lead to a number of administrative and resource problems. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 11, 20 and 21 go far beyond the framework of the proposal and, in preference to these, the Commission supports Amendment 22 regarding the reference to the polluter-pays principle. </p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments are aimed, like Amendment 15, at increasing the participation of the bodies affected or, like Amendment 1, concern the need to take account of international conventions for protecting certain regional seas. The Commission considers that the common position constitutes an acceptable way of meeting these justified requirements. </p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, the Commission can accept Amendments 16, 19, and 22 in full and Amendments 6, 17, 24 and 25 in part. Other amendments cannot be approved. Finally, I want to thank the European Parliament for the two resolutions it adopted earlier this year in connection with the consequences of the investigations into the loss of the Erika. In these resolutions, Parliament urged that this decision be adopted swiftly. It is my hope that your contribution and support today will confirm this commitment and will lead to our being able to reach a rapid decision on this issue which is so crucial to the marine environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
