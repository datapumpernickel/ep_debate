Just as globalisation is frightening people at the moment – at any rate that is the outcome not only of the referendums in France and the Netherlands, but also of the elections in Germany, which have shown that people are somewhat afraid of reform. The particular subject of China, however, and of trade relations with China in particular, can give the European Union greater meaning and purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">We are an export-oriented economic unit, and we Europeans need the Chinese market. For that, we need as much free trade as possible, yet it is the European Union alone that will ultimately help us against unfettered globalisation and the possible loss of our own cultural identity. That is easy to demonstrate. We do need safeguards, though. Particularly where intellectual property is concerned, we Europeans are not strategic enough; we do not act decisively enough.</p>
<p class="contents">If that does not change soon, we will be sawing off the branch on which we are sitting, and that will become clear very soon, especially in the Europeans’ relationship with the Chinese. We must be even more forceful, more outspoken and more strategic in protecting intellectual property against the Chinese, and we must do that as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The enormous growth figures and the prospect of China as the world’s largest exporter should not stand in the way of a factual analysis of the European trade relations with China. After all, the opportunities of the Chinese market must be seen in the right light.</p>
<p class="contents">China is primarily geared towards taking care of the growth potential of its domestic demand itself. Above all else, Beijing wants to promote its own activity whereby it does not hesitate to stimulate price harmonisation or to dump temporary surpluses on the world market.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem in the trade relations with China is the large-scale violation of intellectual property. China acts too much in the tradition of Confucius, the Chinese philosopher, according to whom the imitation of a master is commendable. The European Union must put this problem at the top of its agenda. A climate of piracy and counterfeiting not only damages European enterprises, it also hinders the innovative character of local Chinese enterprises. The European Union must insist on the Chinese judiciary extending its specialist knowledge in the field of intellectual property.</p>
<p class="contents">I take the view that Europe must venture to compete with up-and-coming economies such as China’s, provided this is done on a level playing field. Even the world’s largest exporter has duties as well as rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as China is concerned, we have to develop a comprehensive system in the field of trading relations because if that is missing, we have to fight against the dumping of textiles today or that of shoes, cars or anything else in the future. Therefore, I would like to call attention to other aspects of the relationship between the European Union and China as well, that can help us in creating and implementing such a complex commercial reform. The amazingly rapid development of China must inevitably entail a political reform in the country. Well, we may have to wait for that for a while, and a rapid change would most probably destabilise the Far East region at this point. Nevertheless, there is no doubt about the fact that China has become a global player not only because of its size but also of its economy. Therefore I strongly urge each and every institution of the European Union not to fight against China but to assist it on the road to becoming a country where norms meeting EU requirements will be implemented in everyday practice by modifying and complying with the applicable laws. This way we give China the opportunity to reconsider everything that myself and my fellow Members have condemned within the field of environment protection, the rights of employees, counterfeiting and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier this year I had the opportunity to negotiate with several representatives of the Chinese Government and they were all very open to the idea of a comprehensive conversation. Ladies and gentlemen, as China has now started to open up to the world, if we can lend a helping hand to them politically, we will be able to shape their future in a way that meets both their expectations and our own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is incontestably a power with which all the other economic zones need to compete.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor must we forget that China is today the second biggest trade partner of the European Union after the United States of America. With its accession to the WTO in 2001 and the opening of its market to international trade, China is now a very important factor in international trade. So we are talking about an economic, historic, cultural and commercial giant which appears today to be waking up after a very long sleep.</p>
<p class="contents">However, one of the obstacles to harmonious relations between the European Union and China is the problem of passing off; the imitation of European products and brands by Chinese industries is a serious infringement of the rules of international trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore needs to take suitable measures to protect the intellectual property of European companies and to support the Chinese authorities in the fight which they have started to control the problem. The Member States, in turn, need to carry out effective controls of their internal markets in order to protect European consumers from products which do not meet the 'C' standard.</p>
<p class="contents">What measures does the Commission intend to take in this direction, Commissioner?</p>
<p class="contents">Another point I would like to comment on is the transport sector. China needs to improve connections between its transport networks and international networks, in order to facilitate the free movement of people and goods. This is also the only way to safeguard controls of exportable products.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to ask this: would it be a good idea for the Commission to create a closer partnership with the People's Republic of China by extending bilateral cooperation in several sectors, which might prove to be beneficial to both sides?</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore in the interest of the European Union to support the consolidation of democracy and the market economy and the development of China in a free and open country in which the rule of law will prevail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, when enjoying those advantages, China must comply with the WTO rules and other international norms such as human rights and social rights. The free flow of goods is important, but the free flow of thoughts is equally important. Free trade is important, but the freedom of people is just as important. Several people have recently expressed their concern about the Hungarian Prime Minister, Mr Ferenc Gyurcsány, promising that more than one billion Chinese citizens can travel to Hungary without a visa. I would like to assure you that this is not the official Hungarian position, and it is not supported either by the Fidesz or the European People’s Party. </p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I strongly appreciate that the report draws attention to the alarming situation of human rights in China, initiates the immediate elimination of child labour and hard labour and expects compliance with the fundamental social and labour norms. In this context, it is hard to interpret the statement of the Hungarian Prime Minister that the economic and social model of China should be followed in many respects. European Union membership means that countries share the same common values and these common values – like freedom and respect for human rights – shall govern the common foreign and security policy. Maintaining visa requirements in the case of China serves the safety of European citizens. These higher interests cannot be subordinated to the momentary vagaries of politicians.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At this point I should like to add our disappointment that Mr Mandelson decided not to come and also not to inform the Committee on International Trade that he was not going to attend. It would have been polite. I understand the reasons why and would have accepted them had he at least informed us.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we heard the Commissioner again trying to explain the inexplicable, claiming that his actions with regard to the reinstatement of the Chinese textile quotas were carried out diligently and transparently and that the difficulties arising from this nonsense of a compromise were caused by unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I wrote to the Commissioner in June prior to the Shanghai Agreement, asking him how his proposals would square the circle of the seemingly insatiable demand for Chinese textiles in Europe. His response was to claim that he had found a once-and-for-all agreement. I do not underestimate the scale of the tasks that the Commissioner faces with China. It is a <span class="italic">huge</span> problem and there is no easy solution. However, I believe that fudges of the kind perpetrated in June and again at the beginning of this month will not solve the underlying potential difficulties we have with our trade with China.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many aspects of the Lucas report with which I do not agree. However, in recognising that in years to come we will have the same problem with other industries that we have with the textile industry, I believe she is extremely and entirely accurate. Saying that we can move up the value-added chain will only work for so long. China is producing two million graduates a year. If you believe that these young people will continue to make cheap t-shirts and bras, then you are slightly misinformed. We should view the growth of China as an opportunity and not a threat, and we look forward to working closely with China.</p>
<p class="contents">I must add one last point: selling China arms to balance our trade deficit is not the answer. I hope the Commissioner will have an answer for that. Geopolitical concerns over Taiwan and international relations should only make short-term profits. I just wondered what your position is on the sale of arms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I can only support this report very reluctantly because the tone of it is not quite right. We have to understand that China is a great country with a population three times the size of the European Union. It became a nation state 2000 years ago and has remained one until today. China has a civilisation that is much older than most of ours and our relationship with China is a relationship of equals in which neither side really has the right to lecture the other.</p>
<p class="contents">China has its own way of doing things. We must continue to find ways of cooperating with China and if each side of the relationship tries hard enough to understand and accommodate the basic concerns of the other, by looking ahead in a proactive way, the future is bright. But if we fail, we will be plunged into damaging and acrimonious competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent crisis over textile imports should be a lesson to us all. Today the EU-China relationship is in a very active and productive phase and bilateral relationships are in a more mature, healthy and stable condition than ever. We have to develop this with diligence and sensitivity, striving always to find common ground and to minimise our inevitable differences. We need to maximise our trading synergies and work together on the big international problems of our age, including terrorism, nuclear proliferation and the fight against hunger and disease.</p>
<p class="contents">None of this will be easy but there is a very relevant proverb in China: <span class="italic">Shi Shang Wu Nan Shi, Zhi Pa You Xin Ren</span>. I will try to translate: in effect it says that there is nothing so difficult in this world that it cannot be resolved by people with high aspirations.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no doubt that there are such people on both sides of our relationship and I look forward to a bright and mutually rewarding future in cooperation with China.</p>

The debate has confirmed that China is a powerful country, with 20% of the world's population, with a rapidly growing economy and a huge volume of international trade. China is a country which plays an increasingly important role in the world economy and also in international politics.</p>
<p class="contents">All the speakers raised legitimate concerns: the shortcomings of democracy; the vulnerability and fragility of human rights, including the rights of employees; the extremely low wages and the low environmental standards which make China very competitive. I assure you that the Commission is fully aware of these problems and furthermore we are aware of the serious impact of the Chinese model on other developing countries attempting to compete with China. They are forced into a race to the bottom; they are forced to lower their social and environmental standards, if they want to be competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">In dealing with China, a country of enormous potential and stark contradictions, the European Union has two options. The first is the schoolmaster attitude: to exert pressure on China to comply. I do not think that will work. The second is to establish a partnership, to cooperate with China and make it listen to our concerns and take them on board – to engage with China and not try to isolate it. This, I believe, is a promising option.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1985 the European Communities signed the first framework agreement with China, which was limited to trade relations. We have to appreciate the enormous changes in China; the political, economic and scientific development, unprecedented in such a relatively short period of 20 years. And the changes are accelerating. China has changed, and so have our relations.</p>
<p class="contents">We have achieved a breakthrough in different fields. I refer to the customs cooperation agreement, which will and should play an important role in combating counterfeiting. I refer to the dialogue on employment and social standards; the partnership on climate change; and the working group on intellectual property rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent summit confirmed that it is time to start negotiations on a new framework agreement. The Commission is seeking a mandate from the Council to start the talks as soon as possible. The new framework agreement will be much broader in scope than the first one signed 20 years ago, because it should reflect the changes in China and in our relations. It should work as an umbrella, covering all possible fields of cooperation. It should have a substantial trade and investment component, but it should also cover energy, political dialogue, social issues, human rights and a number of other fields. Through close cooperation, through a relationship based on partnership, we can encourage China to play an active role in addressing the global challenges. All the changes we want to promote and encourage serve the interests of the international community, the European Union and its Member States, but also serve the interests of China. That makes me optimistic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe is competing with India, Russia and the USA for the Chinese market of over one billion consumers. Europe is also fighting for its own place in the world trade system, trying to deal with unfair imports and with international importers whose only aim is to make the maximum profit with no regard for the economic interests of countries and the economy as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">As we open up our markets to the cheap imported goods eagerly awaited by European consumers who make up our electorate, we should keep rising unemployment and the thousands of collapsing companies in the forefront of our minds. We have been unable to deal with the ongoing crisis in the textile industry. China does not only represent imports, but also the opportunity for investment in Europe. We should be encouraging the latter, so that jobs can be created in Europe. Within the framework of the European Union, it would be appropriate to consider possibilities for relocating the production of European companies in Member States with relatively low labour costs that were worst affected by unrestricted imports.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chinese economy and the whole of Chinese society will undergo a period of instability over the next few years. This will be due to the relaxation of the policy on work and the retraining of a large section of society that will cease to depend on farming for a living. We must also be prepared for the emergence of strong tensions within Chinese society, and the Union should help to deal with these. Europeans should be active in China, and Europe and China need to learn to work together and cease doing battle with each other. Both parties will lose out if we continue the battle, but if we learn to cooperate we shall win friends and partners.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
