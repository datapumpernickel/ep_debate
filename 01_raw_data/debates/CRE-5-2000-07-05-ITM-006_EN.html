<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Arvidsson (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (SV) </span>Mr President, there are two reasons for this report on phthalates in toys: firstly, these substances are a health risk to young children, and secondly several Member States have already adopted their own laws in this area, which is why this report is aimed at reestablishing the common market for toys. When we deal with issues relating to the health of young children, the commitment is often strong, wholehearted and sincere.</p>
<p class="contents">According to experts in the World Health Organisation, it is not possible to prove that phthalates are carcinogens. However, the WHO thinks that phthalates may cause reproductive damage and hormonal disturbances, mainly amongst young children who are exposed to large amounts of phthalates.</p>
<p class="contents">For scientific reasons, phthalates have, in common with other toxic substances, been assigned limit values which give the highest recommended exposure level based on calculated risk levels. I want to emphasise that this handling of phthalates does not deviate from toxicological routine.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment has evaluated the risks posed by a number of phthalates and has thereby unanimously established that the two phthalates that are far and away the most common in toys and articles used in childcare are in danger of causing the limit values to be exceeded in the case of young children and of causing health problems. In this scientific assessment, it is a concern for <span class="italic">young</span> children’s health that is being expressed. These are children who are at the teething stage, which is a time when they often bite and suck on all sorts of objects. I would like to caution Parliament against making decisions that go far beyond what is justified by the scientific basis for this standpoint.</p>
<p class="contents">I am all in favour of information and informed consumers who can make their own choices, but the labelling that has been proposed by the Commission does not provide information but, rather, a sharp warning. People who read this warning will not buy these toys for their children or grandchildren. In this way, the warning will constitute an indirect ban. In addition, the process of labelling toys is expensive and difficult to carry out in practice. Tradesmen and tradesmen's organisations have informed me that staff in shops have neither the time nor the knowledge to answer all the questions that customers are going to ask. Introducing this warning system on toys designed for older children is likely to be tantamount to an extended ban.</p>
<p class="contents">The Scientific Committee has identified two phthalates used in toys that may be hazardous to young children’s health. A decision in favour of a limited ban on these grounds would not primarily be based on the precautionary principle, but on the routine procedure for dealing with toxic chemical substances. To ban all of the 350 or so currently known phthalates is to proceed on the assumption that all phthalates are associated with more or less the same risks. However, there is no scientific basis for this assumption. Once these phthalates are no longer used in toys, further risk assessments and the proposed review of this directive in two years’ time ought to be sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">In this short presentation of the document, I wanted to stress the fact that decisions ought to be based on scientific grounds and should cover the high-risk group that has been identified, i.e. young children, as well as the fact that the labelling of toys is very difficult to implement. There is still no scientifically approved method for migration tests which could partly replace the proposed legislation, and no such method should therefore be alluded to in the legislative text. Speakers will also put forward their own assessments of the scientific basis. Allow me to anticipate these and state that politicians ought to listen to scientific assessments and conclusions and <span class="italic">not</span> try to make their own assessments of the scientific research material.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my hope that this report and tomorrow's decision will make the world a safer place for young children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the rapporteur, I share the concerns of the Members of Parliament in my committee. As elected politicians we clearly cannot afford to play fast and loose with children's health. We must ensure that they are not exposed to unnecessary and unacceptable health risks and acknowledge the public concern on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interests of the single market we must achieve the highest common standards for product safety. We also need legislation which cannot be undermined or discredited by legal challenges. This debate has unfortunately been clouded by confusion and uncertainty fuelled by comments in Parliament from Scientific Committee members who doubted the need for any ban on phthalates and questioned whether the health risks are serious or immediate enough to warrant a ban.</p>
<p class="contents">As politicians we need clear advice from scientific committees if we are to make rational judgements, take the necessary risk management measures and produce good legislation. In this case we have not been able to do that effectively because of the gaps in our knowledge, and so my committee understandably decided to go for a blanket ban. Nor do we have any information on substitutes to plasticisers which might have toxic or chronic effects.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this legislation shows us that we need action on a number of areas: (a) we urgently need to continue work on migration testing and research into chronic toxicity and the behaviour of children; (b) we need to review and update this legislation periodically and as gaps in knowledge are filled, where necessary add new substances to the ban in the Commission's legislation. We need to formalise and accept the permanent ban which the Commission is proposing now and we need stringent health warnings and labelling to inform our consumers of the risks.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to answer to the public on the legislation that we produce in Parliament, and we cannot afford to be complacent about risks to children's health.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, we in Parliament need to speak out regarding the desirability of a total ban on these substances.</p>
<p class="contents">Let it be clear that no one in our Group disputes the many useful applications that phthalates have, such as cable casings, and also uses in medical equipment. The snag is that phthalates are also used to soften children’s toys, many of which end up in their mouths, even if they are not intended for that purpose. </p>
<p class="contents">When, in 1998, reports emerged about the possible harmful effects on children’s health, the European Commission proposed – or tried to propose at any rate – a ban on the application of certain phthalates. Intense consultation with industry to establish a ban from within and to introduce self-regulation in the processing of these substances, came to nothing. In my opinion, and I say this on behalf of the Group, that was very much a missed opportunity. </p>
<p class="contents">It strikes me as rather odd, though, that the harmfulness of the substances has not been established beyond question. Accordingly, in response to the Commission’s action, we have met with a barrage of contradictory research studies. Consumer organisations pointed out the harmful potential, while industry tried to demonstrate that things were not all that bad. The chairman of the scientific committee too was dragged into the debate, which was certainly not an ideal situation. </p>
<p class="contents">It is now up to us to assess the proposals. I have not seen a proposal as ridiculous and complex as this one for a long time. I do not know how harmful these phthalates are, but if I do not know, then I need to at least ban a number of these phthalates in line with the precautionary principle, because, in my view, this is also what the internal market wants. </p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I hope that the plenary opts in favour of safety, in line with the precautionary principle. Research, however, should not grind to a halt, but rather come up with alternatives to these softeners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I see it, this goes no further than accepting the inevitable, and the proposal does not comply with the precautionary principle, which it is particularly important to apply when it comes to small children.</p>
<p class="contents">Until it has been proved that all phthalates are harmless, there is no place for plasticisers in toys for children under three. Children in this age group will put any toy in their mouths. They learn about the shape of toys and the materials used to make them by putting toys in their mouths, and these children should be able to suck toys like this without any risk to their health.</p>
<p class="contents">This can only be achieved by a ban on all phthalates in toys. We also need labelling for the three to six age group. This is not only because there are smaller children who play with toys produced for older children, but also because there are also children in this age group who still suck things.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we want to help parents in deciding what to buy and in sorting out what toys are unsuitable for their children. The amendments before us, which call for a review after two years, for the evaluation of new test methods and for scientific studies on the dangers of PVC products, are helpful in maximising health protection for us all in the long term, not just for small children.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up then, it is for us to decide whether to opt for the precautionary principle and a high degree of protection, or whether we intend to hide behind scientific reports, which can, however, never relieve us of the responsibility of taking the necessary political decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem of phthalates in children’s toys is receiving wide public attention and the campaign which focuses on this problem, largely in the hands of Greenpeace, can be termed extremely successful. This is only natural and right, of course, because children are helpless and are entitled to protection. </p>
<p class="contents">We know that phthalates in animal trials – in itself not a very pleasant thought – proved harmful, and we can therefore assume that they will be harmful to people, too. But we do not know to what extent they would be harmful, or in what dosage. Neither do we know for which application they are harmful or whether there are alternatives, and how harmful these would be and in what form. </p>
<p class="contents">As there is no usable test, the question arises as to the basis on which we pursue our policy? As far as this is concerned, we cannot shake off the impression that this decision is premature in a way. But anyway, it is now before us. Phthalates are intended to soften PVC toys, but the substances leach out, certainly if the toys are chewed, as they in fact are by small children, of course. As far as we know, not many alternatives appear viable either. </p>
<p class="contents">We value the assertive course which our rapporteur has taken and we therefore back the thrust of his proposal, that is to say we endorse a ban on this type of toy for children under the age of three, provided it is extensive. If we go for this option, then we should at least be consistent. In our view, therefore, this ban should apply to all toys, not just those intended for sucking and chewing. </p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that we should look into toys for older children, although we should still have this option available once the test methods are there. I am interested to see what the European Commission’s opinion would be on this. What do you think of these test methods and what is your view on revising these regulations once they are there?</p>
<p class="contents">We are in favour of a ban on the six tested phthalates, but are as yet unable to ban all the other phthalates and softeners, which may indeed be harmful. This may well be possible at the time when we have more data available that demonstrates that they are actually harmful. We have insufficient data available at this stage to establish this. </p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, how far do we take the precautionary principle at the end of the day? As far as we are concerned, the principle should not mean that we simply reject everything we are not completely sure about at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The facts are before us: plasticisers in children’s toys represent a massive risk for children’s health and can even be carcinogenic.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all these alarming facts, the Commission has unfortunately only dared to take one teetering step forward. The proposal covers only six plasticisers and only in teething rings. This really is totally inadequate and takes no account at all of the possible risks. It is high time that all plasticisers were banned from all baby toys. These phthalates are totally unnecessary, and many toy manufacturers have been managing without them for years. I therefore totally fail to comprehend the whole lobbying campaign being mounted by the chemical industry.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I regard the argument put forward by the chemical industry, and unfortunately also by many Members of this House, as absolutely cynical. They say that we still need proof. Excuse me, just what proof do we need? One dead child, two dead children or 100 dead children? That is what I call cynical! The precautionary principle means that we have a duty to ensure protection from the outset. Of all people, children are the most sensitive section of our population, and they are not in a position to protect their own interests. We are faced here with a highly urgent task, that of eliminating all risks in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that many Member States have long since forged ahead with a total ban on phthalates. We must support this and there is no way that the European Parliament should act as a braking force. Quite the contrary, we should be the driving force behind this initiative to finally ban plasticisers from all toys.</p>
<p class="contents">Just one last sentence by way of conclusion: I hope that banning a chemical from a consumer product for the first time will give a signal that we are perhaps finally considering abandoning PVC and will have the courage to drop this dangerous technology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are very clear warning signs with regard to the risks associated with phthalates. Experiments on animals show that phthalates cause damage to the liver, kidneys and testicles. With this in mind, it would be totally absurd to allow these substances to be used in toys, which children can put in their mouths – something children very often do. These substances, phthalates, are a very large constituent of the toys concerned –and quite large percentages may be present in them. It is clear that these substances will leak out and that children will then ingest them via their mouths.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also completely absurd to believe that a warning label would be sufficient when it comes to young children. It is obvious that children who are only a few years old cannot assimilate a warning text. Once they have the toy in their hands, it is, as it were, too late. Therefore, the only sensible thing to do is to implement as extensive a ban as is possible in this case. The Commission's proposal is also completely insufficient for this.</p>
<p class="contents">A ban is already in place in several Member States, as several speakers have already mentioned. If the legislation is now too weak in this area, there is a risk that the Member States that have taken steps forward in this area will have legislation forced on them that is worse than what they already have – according to the bizarre logic that exists with regard to the single market, i.e. that the market is always put before considerations relating to health or the environment. I consider that this would be extremely unfortunate.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur for this report is a member of the Swedish Moderate Party. We are usually clear political opponents – I am a member of the Swedish Left Party. Our opinions differ also in this case, but I also know that Mr Arvidsson has been subjected to quite a lot of pressure and harsh criticism from sections of his own Group because he has not been sufficiently industry-friendly. I think it says something about him that he has resisted some of this criticism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is well known that PVC may present a risk when used in toys for young children. The proposal to amend the original directive on this matter will ban the marketing of toys and childcare articles containing PVC which are designed to be placed in the mouths of children under the age of three. I welcome the fact that in future health warnings will have to apply in relation to the manufacture of these products. Every time the European Parliament has debated this issue there have been increasing doubts as to the safety of these toys which derive from PVC.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem is clearly the fact that much of the scientific evidence on these matters is conflicting. We know that when there is doubt about a particular measure, the European Parliament must apply the precautionary principle. This principle in essence means that safety and health must be put before any conflicting scientific evidence, and I fully support the previous speakers who again referred to the importance of applying the precautionary principle.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The risks to public health when using tobacco are clear and scientifically proven. This is not so for the use of phthalates in toys. Although a ban on the use of tobacco was not even entertained as a serious option, a large majority within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection did go along with a ban on phthalates (softeners) in toys. Although after 40 years of use, no cases of damage to health are known, the seed of suspicion has nonetheless been sown that softeners are harmful. In accordance with the precautionary principle, this possible harmfulness has to be underpinned scientifically. The studies included tests on animals, which is common practice with regard to suspected substances. These tests resulted in a so-called ‘acceptable daily intake’ for animals. For humans, a further safety margin of a factor of 100 was added on. By testing toys, it can be indicated whether or not this ‘acceptable daily intake’ is exceeded in the case of humans. On this basis, toys can be approved or rejected. In short, this is a method based on an acceptable margin, taking a generous safety margin into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">By launching an extensive campaign, spearheaded by Greenpeace, it was possible to convince many policy-makers and politicians of the need to institute an immediate ban. I can understand that; emotions run high where children are involved. The argument that children are affected, however, is two-sided: children eat and drink all kinds of things which entail a certain health risk. Why are these risks accepted and not others? It is my impression that this issue is being played up in order to use this ban as a weapon in the fight against other substances. I fear that if we now vote in favour of a ban on phthalates, this will unleash a witch-hunt against all kinds of substances, without any scientific basis. Moreover, we do not know what the harmful effects of alternatives will be. These reasons also indicate that a ban on phthalates contravenes the correct application of the precautionary principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to concentrate here on the application of the precautionary principle and on the difficulties in this case of dealing with an issue on which scientific considerations are confused and mixed up with emotional considerations, as well as a long history of disagreements between the industry of PVC and its derivatives and the environmental lobby, which, of course, is also deeply involved with this issue of phthalates.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about risks to children’s health. This is of interest to all of us, certainly. However, we must not forget that we are also talking, with reasonable certainty, about the harmful effects of six phthalates, and also, with a degree of uncertainty, of the other substances belonging to this group. To ban all of them, as a precaution, may not be a good decision since this may mean abandoning an area of research which is being pursued at the moment, in order to opt for substitutes whose harmful effects we know even less about. In this respect, there is one good example: four years ago, given the opinion that silicon implants may be carcinogenic, several countries adopted an alternative substance for their manufacture based on soya oil. A few days ago the United Kingdom banned these implants and is gratuitously withdrawing existing stocks, having discovered that they are carcinogenic.</p>
<p class="contents">The social and health cost of a hasty decision may be medically and economically irreparable. The scientific evidence demanded in Amendments Nos 11, 13 and 24 seem to me to be absolutely necessary in any event, but especially in the case of this type of issue where lives are at stake and where we are likely to punish or benefit certain production sectors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is in the unusual position of producing a report on Commission action which has already been taken and it is the way it has been taken that we are to some extent talking about here.</p>
<p class="contents">The ban on a range of identified phthalates was precautionary. It attracted broad support and was also in line with the accepted practices of a number of Member States. If we were simply balancing the health and safety of children against the needs and priorities of industry there would be no contest, but there are related issues which we should address.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is how the Commission handles the scientific advice available to it. Was it done in a balanced way? Does it give us confidence that this powerful and sometimes necessary weapon of a product ban was used correctly? I am not sure about this and I want to return to it in an explanation of vote. Secondly, on the wider issue of PVCs in general, how soon will we get the kind of migration testing from which phthalates' safety can be assessed and the review which is called for in one of the amendments? We also need information about when the substitutes which the industry may introduce will be open to equivalent testing. It is no good banning something if you are unsure about what will replace it. On the issue of labelling, I am sorry to see that there are amendments against this. Personally I believe that we have to have it, certainly for children up to the age of six, although some will argue that that leads to another kind <span class="italic">de facto </span>ban.</p>
<p class="contents">Essentially, the number of plastic objects which could be put in the mouth and swallowed is increasing. This House should be more concerned if it went to bed worried that it had done too much, than if it woke up finding it had done too little.

The fact is that you have accepted a ban on the substance we are speaking about for certain objects, for example teething rings. We all know that children under three put toys in their mouths. Allowing the sale of objects containing dangerous substances which children will put in their mouths goes completely against the precautionary approach. To justify this by saying that we label them is completely ridiculous. Children under three years of age cannot read and even children up to the age of six are not really capable of reading and even if they are, are they really competent to make decisions on this?</p>
<p class="contents">What is happening here is that the Commission and others are bowing to the pressures of industry. When we talk about the precautionary approach, Mr Blokland is wrong. We should be looking for materials and substances for children's toys where there is no doubt about safety whatsoever. In banning some of the objects the Commission recognises that these substances are dangerous. It is just not acceptable to turn a blind eye to the others because of pressure from industry. Which comes first: children's health or the vested interests of industry? We must take the precautionary approach.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is quite unacceptable that we can get into a situation in which we are going to reduce the level of safety for our children. I know that the Commission is very busy, but is it acceptable never to have time to attend to one’s own children? Now, I see that the Commissioner is not listening. Perhaps he does not have time to do that, either. Anyone who did go to the trouble of observing their children would quickly discover, as has already been said a number of times, that children suck away at anything they get their hands on, and not only on things that are intended to be put into their mouths. In Denmark, investigations have been carried out which show that the quality of the semen of young men appearing before army medical boards is 40% poorer than that of the 50 year-olds. It can no longer be taken for granted that people can have children, and suspicions are mounting where phthalates are concerned. It is only four months since the Commission sent out a communication of just under 30 pages concerning the precautionary principle. Is it not only right to put all the fine words into practice now about protecting health and the environment and to make use of this principle in an area we still know very little about? If the precautionary principle is not to be employed in respect of one of the most vulnerable consumer groups – our children – it is very difficult to imagine when, in fact, it is to be employed. I should like to know why the Commission only wants the six phthalates which have been investigated to be banned, instead of them all. I support Mr Arvidsson’s report which – unlike the Commission’s proposal, which is open to criticism – takes our children’s health seriously. I think still further action needs to be taken and a ban imposed with no restriction on age, but I hope at least that Amendment 20 will be adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not know if Mr Chirac was familiar with the detail of this report, but in any case he gave us a very clear pointer on how to vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">All phthalates should be banned from plastic toys, not just six. After all, the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment expressed certain reservations about the most commonly used phthalate, and had serious concerns about another. If we are to take our work at all seriously, then we should invoke the precautionary principle and ban the use of all phthalates as plasticisers.</p>
<p class="contents">Several of the 15 Member States – and there are 15 of us, not 14, Mr President – have applied this European precautionary principle concept, and that includes my own country, Austria. We brought in a ban on all plasticisers in the phthalate group in an order published in Federal Law Gazette II No 225 in 1998. I can only recommend this to the other Member States. And I do not mean that in a bilateral sense, but in the framework of the Community of Fifteen.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a second comment. If we were only to ban things when we had absolute scientific proof, then, my goodness, how ashamed we should all be now. How could we allow these six phthalates to be used as plasticisers in PVC without having scientific proof at that time that they were harmless? When our children’s health was at stake, we did not cry out for scientific proof. Let us try tomorrow to rectify our past mistakes.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that it is a healthy sign in the House if it really is emotions that are setting the agenda for the discussion when children’s health is at stake. It is better for it to be emotions that govern this discussion than for it to be industry!</p>
<p class="contents">In our private lives, in our own homes, we take all the safety precautions we can in order to take care of our own children. We put safety locks on the doors, we put barriers in front of ovens etc. because we know that it is dangerous to be a child. I think that we should behave in the same way even when we are in this House. We have enough information to make the necessary decisions. It is not the children who must prove that toys are dangerous but the producers who must prove that they are in fact safe. This is a principle which should apply to all consumer protection, but particularly protection in relation to children.</p>
<p class="contents">Several speakers here have said that we know that these substances can be hazardous to health. Several Member States have already imposed a ban on phthalates in toys for children under the age of three. The precautionary principle must be applied! Hopefully, more nations and countries may also realise that this is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal is neither sensible nor sufficient. I can only imagine a situation at a play school or a nursery school where the nursery teacher has to try to keep a check on which children are under and which are over three years of age as well as which children are allowed to put what in their mouths in accordance with all the experiments the Commission is trying to include. It is, of course, possible for the Commission to issue a special directive concerning what nursery school staff, or other adults, should do when they have more than one child to take care of. The only sensible solution is a ban, a total ban, when it comes to toys for children under three years of age.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim must be to limit the occasions on which we subject ourselves and our children to dangerous chemicals. In this case it is taking an unnecessary risk to permit the use of chemical substances in toys which affect those that are smallest and most vulnerable in society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, if young children are at risk then it is right to take action to remove that risk. The question on PVC softeners in young children's chewing toys is: Who says there is definitely a risk? The answer is no-one. Who says there could remotely be a risk? The answer is Mr Suresh Rastogi, a Danish researcher who used the phthalates he happened to have in his laboratory. His research has never been confirmed by peer review – indeed it was rejected by the Commission's own scientific committee, the CSTEE. Of the six named phthalates to be banned as a result, two are used for flooring and cosmetics but not for children's toys, one is not used at all, one is not made at all, one is not used because of fears it might be carcinogenic (though on 8 February it was totally cleared by the WHO) and that leaves one, DINP that is used to soften PVC in chewing rings and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">So, what does the CSTEE say about this? It said that there was no identifiable risk that could lead to a justified ban, that they were safe if they were used according to existing rules. The CSTEE met and decided on 25 November. On 22 November, three days earlier, the Commission had imposed a temporary ban, and we have to ask the Commission why. It is only justified under the general product safety directive if there is 'immediate and serious risk'. If that cannot be shown clearly, then the legality of the temporary ban can and should be questioned in this case. Indeed, the case was to be brought to court but was put on hold when the Commission agreed to work to produce validation systems for the test methods by the end of this year; so we can test these and test the alternatives. Why is the Commission rushing forward now? Why are the CSTEE minutes not published until April, and why has a statement critical of the Commission's misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the research still not been published?</p>
<p class="contents">Crying wolf damages the credibility of the precautionary principle. I ask the Commission to answer these questions today, and to get its internal scaremongers under control.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Phthalates are, of course, a group of chemicals there is every possible reason for being on guard against, not only in connection with toys but also more generally. We know that they are suspected of possibly causing cancer, as well as disturbing the balance of hormones. I am therefore in favour of banning all phthalates in toys designed for the smallest children. If we were not to make use of the precautionary principle in this case, I find it hard to see when the principle might be applied at all. There are some who have argued that banning the use of phthalates in toys would have an adverse effect upon the plastics industry and upon employment in that industry. We also heard this argument in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. I think the argument is completely unacceptable. If it were in fact to be accepted, then any restriction at all upon the use of dangerous chemicals, not merely in toys but also in foodstuffs and other products, would be prevented. I personally should like to see the ban we are now devising extended to cover toys designed for children of between three and six years of age. That would be the ideal situation, but I am inclined to vote in favour of the present proposed compromise whereby, as a first step, there should be a warning label on toys for that group. I also think it would be sensible to review the directive in no more than a couple of years’ time against the background of new scientific knowledge, including knowledge which can tell us for certain whether we should also intervene in the case of phthalates in products other than toys. I think that would be a sensible health policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very bad proposal and I hope that Mr Liikanen when he speaks will agree to suspend it. I do not think it should be withdrawn, I think it should be suspended.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned about the precedent that this proposal will set. The precautionary principle is very sensibly described in a recent Commission paper. There is an obvious danger of applying it too widely because it brings the European Union approach into disrepute. For example, a thousand people a year – no doubt some of them small children – die in England and Wales while falling downstairs. I do hope that does not mean that we are going to see a European Union regulation restricting us all to living in bungalows.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal suggests that, on emotive subjects, the Commission is prepared to act on the basis of that emotion, without the kind of sensible assessment of risk that we need here, as we do for example on risks in foodstuffs. There has to be, even with the precautionary principle, a substantial link between the assessment of risk and action by the European Union. If not, then surely we do not even need a European Food Agency: we can just legislate on the basis of the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the Commission's task to assess that risk. In this case I am not satisfied, as Mr Bowis has said, that the Commission really heeded the advice of its own advisers. When the chairman of the scientific committee came to us he most certainly did not convey to us any sense of the urgent need for action. The conclusion I draw from this is that in future, to avoid this kind of emotive reaction on an emotive subject, we should have a European Union chemicals agency, which will not be the creature of the Commission, to assess risks.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned that the science behind this proposal is incomplete. Yes, eight Member States have banned phthalates, but when the Commissioner replies, can he tell us whether those eight Member States have supplied the Commission with the scientific evidence that they based their ban on?</p>
<p class="contents">We also lack the evidence on migration limits, and that has been mentioned. That might have enabled the Commission to bring forward a proposal we could all agree with. What we therefore have is a thoroughly unsatisfactory proposal. Six phthalates are identified, and a system of warnings proposed that makes no sense. The Environment Committee has taken the logical step that the Commission avoided. If these are dangerous, then they should all be banned and warnings would then be unnecessary. The only problem with this is that the action is then quite disproportionate to the risk, and sets a thoroughly bad precedent for future European Union action in relation to the chemicals we use.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that very well, as a mother of three. Furthermore, the facts available to us are such that there are very good reasons why people might end up expressing exactly opposite points of view, all of which might be quite valid. The person making the decision should look at the issue calmly. Parliament has even shown a desire to ban all of the nearly 350 phthalates instead of the six proposed by the Commission. However, there is some kind of evidence of the possibility of danger in the case of only two phthalates. In addition, a warning was called for on products designed for 3 – 6 year olds, although the risk is likely to be associated with very small children, who like to put things in their mouths, in their discovery of the world. Reliable migration tests in respect of phthalates are not available, however.</p>
<p class="contents">It is excellent that the EU is active in this matter, as seven Member States have already introduced national regulations. What is even better is that the issue is being dealt with in a consistent way. In my opinion, Mr Arvidsson has made a rational and responsible contribution to the issue, and is applying the EU precautionary principle to this problem of toxicity properly. </p>
<p class="contents">The precautionary principle is a very important tool in environmental legislation. It should only be used, however, when there is scientific reason to suppose there is a real risk. This therefore concerns the existence of a scientifically demonstrable risk and the reaction to it, not the existence of a fear that might surround the substance. You can cry wolf once too often. Neither is it sufficiently justifiable to resort to the precautionary principle if, for example, some Member States have introduced national legislation in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s struggle to ensure the safety of children is very worthwhile in a Union that often just concentrates on hard values. Parliament will be doing the safety of children and everyone else a disservice, however, if it erodes the basis of the precautionary principle, the possibility of a real risk. That is what we are in danger of doing in the case of phthalates. What sort of repercussions will it have, for example, on food safety? It is at least as important today to make sure we preserve the precautionary principle for future needs as it is to take a decision on the banning of phthalates.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that not one lobbyist from the chemical industry has come up to me. My concern relates solely to the vague application of the precautionary principle. If we want to ban PVC, let us do so freely and openly.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, this emergency measure is already applied in several countries and is renewed every three months. Furthermore, the Commission proposal is the result of two opinions issued by the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears that the Commission has interpreted these opinions according to criteria which are no doubt very well intentioned, but which can at best be described as hasty, in light of the audience which took place in the Environment Committee with the scientists responsible for the opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the premises for the application of the precautionary principle must be proportionality, which appears not to be the case here. In fact, DEHP, the phthalate so far considered the most dangerous to human health, has been declared by the international cancer research association not to be classifiable as a carcinogen in humans.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we should bear in mind that, in order to establish the toxicity of any product, the dose and the exposure time of that product must be defined. It is not sufficient that a product is intrinsically toxic. Even water can be fatal if consumed in an enormous enough quantity to cause drowning. A substance as toxic as heparin, a rat poison, turns out to be an effective anticoagulant which has saved many lives. Viruses and bacteria, in minimal doses, become vaccines.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, there has been much less research on the substitutes for phthalates than on the phthalates themselves. If this ban is adopted – and we can support it, above all if there is a supposed risk to children – we will also support Amendments Nos 11, 13 and 24 because the Commission should amend this directive in the event that the Scientific Committee approves the use of methods of measurements for practical purposes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The debate on phthalates can only be fruitful if the arguments are based on scientific evidence, not populist theory. More research is needed so that the long-term effects on health of the different phthalates can be accounted for thoroughly. I would be very pleased if we could ban tobacco, which we have classified as dangerous. As legislators, we cannot use excessive force.</p>
<p class="contents">If a good deal of phthalates were banned with no clear justification, the toy industry would seek refuge in other PVC plastic softeners, about whose long-term effects there is even less knowledge than phthalates. Let us now just ban those which have been shown to be dangerous. As it is a matter of the most tender age group of all, the under three-year-olds, precaution is really relevant here. What the toy is used for cannot in itself be a determining factor in deciding which phthalates can be used and which cannot. The labelling of toys alone is not sufficiently safe. Everyone understands that small children put everything that is in reach in their mouths first, including dirt. In families where there are children of different ages, it is utterly impossible to sort toys for them to play with according to how suitable they are.

<p class="contents">The Commission seems to have ignored its own scientific committee on the basis that some Member States are imposing their own ban. They are entirely within their rights, of course. Instead I support the development of tests to determine migration limits, and for these to be legislated on in due course, rather than a long-term ban as proposed. It is particularly galling that, of the six named phthalates to be banned, five are not even used for children's toys and only two are suspected on the basis of unreplicated tests on rats.</p>
<p class="contents">I too am concerned for the welfare of small children, but based on reasoning and science, not on emotions. This whole business contrasts markedly with my request for restrictions to be placed on the use of mobile phones by young children, in a formal question to the Commission under the same precautionary principle. This was, of course, refused even though it admitted there was no research evidence on the safety of child use of mobiles and there was some data for adult brain damage in the prolonged use of mobile telephones.</p>
<p class="contents">A recent UK government report has recommended restrictions to child use of mobiles as a developing brain is more sensitive to electromagnetic radiation. We have to face the fact that here in the West brain tumours have risen dramatically by some 100% over the last ten years for totally unknown reasons.</p>

The Commission's temporary bans have no legal basis. The Commission may introduce an emergency ban where there is a clear and immediate danger, but no such danger exists with phthalates.</p>
<p class="contents">These materials have been in widespread use around the world for forty years, yet there is no evidence of any kind that any damage has ever been done to anyone. There was one test on rats in which massive quantities of phthalates appeared to cause problems, but researchers have been unable to replicate this test. We are dealing here with little more than media hysteria and ignorance. More people have died in Teddy Kennedy's car than have died of phthalates!</p>
<p class="contents">Compare and contrast our position on phthalates with our position on tobacco. Phthalates have never done any harm to anyone, yet we are banning them. Tobacco, we are told, kills half a million people each year in the European Union but do we ban it? No, we do not. We subsidise it with millions of euros. If we ban existing products, alternative products may be even more dangerous. As Mrs García-Orcoyen has pointed out, this has already happened, for example, with breast implants, where alternatives to silicon have proved to be more dangerous than the implants they replaced.</p>
<p class="contents">In trying to defend an untenable position the Commission has shamelessly sought to gag its own scientific advisers. It has bowdlerised their reports, it has pressured them into changing their positions. Honesty and transparency have been sacrificed to expedience. I and other colleagues wrote to Commission President Prodi on this point two months ago. I understand that his reply has been held for some time ‘awaiting signature’, presumably to ensure we should not see it before today's debate. Neither the temporary bans nor the permanent ban are justified by the evidence. Migration tests for phthalates are currently under development and will probably be available within months. We should wait until these tests are available and then, if we must, impose migration limits.</p>
<p class="contents">We hear far too much about the precautionary principle. To be meaningful the precautionary principle should be invoked only when there is a clear and demonstrable risk. If we continue to invoke it when there is no prime facie risk at all, we make both the precautionary principle and ourselves look ridiculous.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Following discussions about the risks of PVC toys containing phthalates and the opinions of the Scientific Committee on Toxicology, Ecotoxicology and Environment, the Commission took two decisions simultaneously last autumn. One was a decision providing for an emergency temporary ban, renewable every three months. Second, the Commission decided to propose a directive to restrict the marketing and use of phthalates in soft PVC toys. Any interventions here actually concern the first decision, not necessarily this proposal for a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposed directive consists of two elements. The first element is a ban on the use of six phthalates in toys intended to be put in the mouth of small children. The ban is based on the opinion of the Scientific Committee that toys containing certain phthalates pose a risk to children's health when held in the mouth for extensive periods of time. As it cannot be excluded that children can put other toys in their mouths, although not intended for that purpose, the second element of the proposal is a requirement for a warning label on such other toys that could be put into the mouth. The proposal provides not only for the protection of children's health, it also addresses an internal market issue.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present time, the internal market is fragmented, as more than half of the Member States are applying national bans going further than the Commission's emergency ban under the General Product Safety Directive. Mrs Jackson asked whether Member States have supplied scientific evidence to the Commission, the reply is: Not to my knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed directive would harmonise the rules of Member States. I have noted in the discussions today that the Members of Parliament are divided on the Commission's proposal. Some consider it too strict, while others consider that it is not at all protective enough. The proposal is based on the various opinions of the Scientific Committee, and it is a considered application of the precautionary principle and consequently a proportionate measure. It introduces a ban for the products which potentially pose the highest risks, that is for the toys intended to put be in the mouth, and a less stringent measure – labelling – for the products not intended for mouthing but where a risk cannot be excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not able to accept those amendments of Parliament which would widen the scope of the proposed ban to cover plasticisers other than the six named phthalates, or to cover other toys than those intended to be put in the mouth. Nor is the Commission able to accept the amendments which would extend the scope to cover toys destined for older children. We think that these various proposals cannot be justified on the basis of the risks either defined in the opinions of the Scientific Committee or by the application of the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission cannot at this moment accept amendments which would introduce migration limits, but the Commission accepts the amendments which provide for this to be reviewed when testing methods have been approved. The Commission can accept in principle the amendments which would prohibit the use of perfumes in toys for children under three years containing the six phthalates. It can also accept amendments which would bring forward the review of the directive and widen the scope of that review.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise our point of view, the Commission can accept, at least in principle, Amendment Nos 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 18, 24 and the Commission rejects Amendment Nos 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, revised 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 25. We wish to carry on the dialogue with Parliament and I am convinced that we can agree on a constructive solution.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
