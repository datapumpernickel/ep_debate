It will take on particular importance if Parliament manages to exercise an appropriate political and practical role which will help shed light on this sombre event and bring justice for the 81 victims and their families who, for more than 19 years, have been waiting to find out what happened, why it happened, and who was responsible. I said that more than 19 years have passed and there have been several inquiries by the Italian magistracy, but not even the last inquiry overseen by Judge Priore, while very noteworthy, has provided truly satisfactory answers. Was it a missile launched during air combat which destroyed the aircraft or was it a bomb planted inside? Unfortunately, a great deal, indeed too much evidence has been concealed or destroyed and it would be an oversimplification to place the blame for this tragedy only on the top ranks of the army, who generally speaking, only follow orders. Obviously, the real blame lies elsewhere, in particular at the door of the high level Italian representatives of government and politicians of the time.</p>
<p class="contents">What inconvenient facts, what political manoeuvrings were covered up in the interests of National Security? In fact there have been numerous unanswered questions regarding the complex international events of those years. On the one hand, the great world powers – USA and USSR – were at diplomatic breaking point, and on the other hand, there was a progressive deterioration in relations between the Atlantic Alliance and some Islamic countries, Libya in particular, while in Italy, the far left in particular, was continually calling into question Italy’s participation in NATO. Finally, what is the link between the Ustica massacre and the one that happened around a month later at Bologna train station? </p>
<p class="contents">We have tabled a motion for a resolution to underline the importance of these factors, factors which, however, were not mentioned once in the joint motion for a resolution. Nevertheless, while we consider that the joint motion for a resolution leans too far towards the air missile hypothesis rather than towards an internal bomb, and above all, while we believe this motion to be far too kind and diplomatic towards the Italian political authorities, we agree on the need to request the cooperation of all the Member States of the European Union in finally providing everything necessary for an appropriate and adequate detailed examination of the inquiries, so that those who did this, the instigators and the motives behind this absurd massacre can be identified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the past 19 years, we have seen numerous dramatic turns of events regarding the investigations to establish the truth that has still not emerged which, it appears, is also down to those involved preventing this happening and riding roughshod over the legal rights of the victims’ families and over our basic democratic principles. </p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to apply a political interpretation or allow anyone to exploit a tragedy which has caused so much suffering. Let us leave it to the magistracy to ascertain the truth which is the right of everyone, not only of the victims’ relatives. In addition to the results obtained recently by the Italian magistracy, I do not know whether, in the future, there will or will not be other scenarios which, in recent years, we have unfortunately become used to owing to the legal events of Ustica. But today, we are faced with a judgement which outlines the hypothesis of the participation of aircraft from different countries during the disaster of 27 June 1980. And so Parliament must make a firm request to the Member States and the United States to cooperate in finding the truth. </p>

Various colleagues from other countries have asked me – what is Ustica? Why the urgency? This is a question, or rather, these are two very reasonable questions. Ustica, as perhaps a lot of people know, is a small island in the South Tyrrhenian Sea. Why this urgency though? It does not spring from something that has happened now but from something serious which happened almost twenty years ago. The urgency is because an Italian deputy Public Prosecutor has issued a judgement which identifies the high-level air force authorities as being to blame for covering things up, keeping quiet and not saying what they knew, which prevented the truth coming to light about what happened almost twenty years ago. </p>
<p class="contents">So what happened? An aeroplane left my city, Bologna, two hours late but never reached its destination, Palermo. It was hit, so several parties say, by a missile during an aggressive act which took place nearby. Well, immediately afterwards, in the following days, weeks and years, there ensued an extraordinary criminal course of events which aimed to conceal the evidence, to silence people and to ensure that the truth did not come out. </p>
<p class="contents">Why was all this done? This is why we need to take up this subject again today, as the course of Italian justice has entered the final and perhaps overdue stage of its inquiries. We are asking the Member States – because they say aircraft from one of the Member States or NATO might have been involved in that act of war – to help with information, which there is no longer any reason to keep confidential, concealed or secret, so that we really can bring the facts to light and the whole truth can be told. After all, the relatives of the 81 victims are asking for nothing more than to know the truth and to see that justice be done. I think this is not just an Italian internal affair, but is a service to the whole of European democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A few minutes after the disaster, the military and secret service machinery of the countries concerned – with the Italians leading the way – were already putting in place a huge and disgraceful operation to conceal, if not destroy, the evidence to prevent the legal authorities ascertaining what really happened in the skies over Ustica. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and its Parliament have the institutional duty to protect the interests of the European citizens and not those of individual governments, NATO or the United States. The European citizens, including the 81 European families of the victims of Ustica, have the right to demand all our help in bringing justice to bear. And so it is our duty to ask for the States involved in the disaster to be put under pressure to say all they know. This is also of the greatest interest to us because this is the only way to prevent something similar happening again in European skies, and not only in European skies. Over the next five years, we are committed to creating a common area of freedom, security and justice. Ascertaining the truth on the Ustica disaster would be a major first step along this path. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to perhaps understand this tragedy better, I will also refer to the tragedy which occurred at Cermis in the Dolomites, where an American military plane cut through a cablecar cable. Twenty people plunged to the ground in the cablecar and died. In this case, we know what happened because the plane was seen, but up till now, even in the Cermis tragedy, it is still not at all clear where the blame lies. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I wonder whether Italy, despite it being strategically important in Europe, is the best place to carry out military experiments, tests or even training. In my opinion, the Nevada desert is much more suitable because Italy has too many inhabitants. And it has to be said that the victims’ loved ones have the right to know why, how and when their children, parents or relatives died, and to this end, we join them in asking for help and complete transparency. The Governments of Italy, France, Great Britain and the United States as well as the Secretary-General of the UN must help us to shed light on these tragedies, especially the Ustica tragedy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The inquiries were made more difficult by the reticence and lack of cooperation shown by some countries, including countries which are Members of the European Union as well as the very Alliance which guaranteed security in Europe during those years. The mystery which continues to surround the catastrophe has ended up casting serious doubts on Italy’s democratic life and its very independence. Now, a judgement made by the Italian magistracy has outlined various scenarios which provide for military operations along the very route taken by the DC9 that disappeared into the Mediterranean that evening. Transparency is therefore an issue. Transparency is a value which this Parliament referred to decisively during the first weeks of its activities and the public has the right to trust both political and military institutions. However, we believe that it is right for the European Parliament to ask the Member States – which can participate in ascertaining the truth – to provide the magistracy with all the documentation necessary to definitively identify who was to blame. This is the moral and political significance of this joint resolution and is the reason for the urgency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As is typical of Italian justice, 19 years later, nothing has yet been said with any certainty. In relation to this grave episode – and the previous speakers highlighted this – secrecy and doubts have surrounded military bodies, institutions, governments and nations for two decades. The lack of certainty encourages prejudices and vague judgements. The victims, their families and the entire international community have the right to uncover the truth, not in twenty years or more but as quickly as possible. This Parliament must oblige all the States concerned and individual institutions to close this chapter, which is one of the many Italian mysteries where the truth is never found, and which has seen high level involvement and assistance. The Italian and international communities will be grateful to this Parliament and they will regain confidence in the institutions. This will honour the memory of the many innocent victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This delay has displayed a serious disrespect for the great desire for truth, not only of the victims’ relatives but also of those entire communities which have been involved in this tragic event. So naturally, while I join the invitation extended to those countries which were involved to cooperate in establishing the truth, I would also ask the European Parliament not to forget this event at this most delicate time of public debate in order to ascertain the truth. Therefore, I ask Parliament to use its representatives and bodies to continue to monitor events so that this tragedy will finally reach a just and honest conclusion, as requested by the Italian and European communities in their entirety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If we all want to be European citizens, if we want a shared destiny, we must not regard this as just an Italian matter but as a matter for the international community, and it must be investigated and resolved at this level. We are asking for military activities to be definitively and transparently coordinated with civilian activities. This is the transparency that citizens are asking for, this is the justice we want, this is the sense of justice that is being requested by the citizens, by the people who have suffered this grave loss as well as by the entire international community. We are asking, therefore, for serious cooperation between political and military activities. We are asking for justice to be done. Just as Cermis was not only an Italian matter and was dealt with at an international level, so Ustica deserves to be discussed here. It deserves to be clarified and it deserves our respect, as does the work of the magistracy, which must get to the heart of the matter, clarify blame and charge those responsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission shares the concern of the honourable Members, and calls on the Member States to collaborate with the Italian authorities to bring together all available evidence to help clarify the causes of the disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the rules on safety of military air traffic, the Commission recalls at present the Community has no powers in this field. It is for the Member States to take the necessary measures. However, the Commission is well aware that the joint use of airspace by various users, civil and military, may be at the root of safety problems, as it is already partly responsible for air traffic delays and congestion. This is why the Commission has advocated in the past, in its White Paper on freeing European airspace, that European airspace should be managed centrally by a strong international organisation for all aspects of its use. Moreover, the Commission felt it was better to entrust this task to Eurocontrol rather than to a Community body, because national governments might find it easier to allow that organisation to play such a role in the military use of airspace.</p>
<p class="contents">At the request of the Council, the Commission is preparing a communication on air traffic delays and congestion and will certainly address this question again and propose initiatives in the field of airspace management. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
