<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ján Figeľ, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the second of the programmes tonight and the third one later on show the special interest of the European Parliament in supporting areas where we believe that kind of new momentum is to be addressed for the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission adopted its proposal for the ‘Youth in Action’ programme in July last year. Parliament, and especially the Committee on Culture and Education, has always been supportive of initiatives in favour of youth. The negotiations which took place this year have confirmed this and today we are going to discuss an excellent report which is the result of fruitful cooperation. I would especially like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Gröner, for this cooperation and the leading position she has adopted in preparation for successful decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘Youth in Action’ programme is designed to ensure continuity of current activities in the field of youth but also to develop them further. It is a programme of informal learning and mobility which will allow young people between the ages of 13 and 30 to get involved in projects developing solidarity and citizenship. These are the cement for European unity, mainly through youth exchanges, the European Voluntary Service and projects related to participative democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know the details of the programme, I shall not reflect on them but, rather, give the Commission’s view on some important amendments. I am pleased to say that after the good exchange of views and cooperation up until now, most of your proposed amendments can be supported without reserve by the Commission. Few amendments, mainly those seeking to introduce more detail into Article 8, cannot be supported. Article 8 is about the implementing provision and the establishment of national agencies which will be responsible for the management of the programme at national level. The Commission’s text sets out only general requirements in line with the principle of subsidiarity. It will be up to the Member States’ authorities to implement these requirements according to national situations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on some very important amendments on which the Commission agrees. Mrs Gröner’s report, while not suggesting changing the age brackets proposed by the Commission, insists on ensuring that the main target group of the programme will be 15- to 28-year-olds. I very much share any concern over the participation in the programme of young people with fewer opportunities and the prevention of discrimination in terms of access to the programme. This aspect may not have been sufficiently highlighted in our proposal. However, the implementation of the programme is flexible enough to accommodate the specific needs of young people with fewer opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">We also understand that Parliament would like to ensure that the different actions of the programme benefit from minimal financial allocation. This approach is fully compatible with the flexibility required for the implementation of the programme and the Commission is therefore prepared to take on board proposed distribution among different actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The report’s proposal to increase the programme’s budget shows the European Parliament’s commitment once again to a programme that directly addresses young people and thus contributes to bringing younger generations closer to Europe. I must stress that the financial issues are all subject to the outcome of the negotiations relating to the financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to express my satisfaction at the proposed reference in the programme to the European Youth Week. I am also very pleased to see that, once more, the European Parliament will be directly involved in Youth Week, which includes the ‘The Youth takes the floor’ event in Brussels. Youth Week will take place in early December 2005 and I am particularly grateful for the participation of President Borrell and for the arrangements made for hearing young people in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I wish to thank Mrs Gröner once again for the quality of the report. I believe that the ‘Youth in Action’ programme is widely supported by this assembly, and I thank you for that. I hope that the next step will be the adoption of a partial political agreement in the next Council meeting in November. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lissy Gröner (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, there is much agreement in this House where your proposals are concerned. Cooperation has been excellent. We have heard what young people have been saying to us, first through the European elections and then through the referendums. If we want to make a success of European policy, it is with young people that we have to start.</p>
<p class="contents">The new ‘Youth in Action’ programme gives pride of place to the promotion of active citizenship, and the 73 amendments that this House has put forward are intended to make some further improvements to your proposal. We want to respond to what young people themselves told us in the course of the consultation process, and in so doing we are taking the most important step, namely fostering solidarity and mutual understanding among young people, supporting the new neighbourhood policy and bringing together the various interested parties at national, regional and European level.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the five actions comprised in the new programme, and which you, Commissioner, have just outlined, we have proposed – in contrast to ‘Lifelong Learning’ – that minimum funding be provided for each individually, with at least 30% of the budget going to traditional youth exchange in Action 1, 23% to the European Voluntary Service, and 4% to the new ‘Youth for the World’ action, which does of course have a similar end in view, not to mention 15% for Action 4, ‘Youth workers and support systems’, and at least 4% for support for policy cooperation, which includes Youth Week.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who are any good at mental arithmetic will have figured out that some 24% of the overall budget is left over, and this is in order to give the Commission flexibility and to make it possible for more to be set aside for Youth Week in one year and to do more for voluntary service or direct youth exchange in another. It is vitally important that flexibility should be built in.</p>
<p class="contents">What we also require of the Commission, though, is that this programme be made less bureaucratic. We want the youth associations to be able to plan ahead with confidence, to be able to plan for periods of several years rather than for only one. We want them to get the money without delay and for no more than four months at the most to elapse between the application being made and the money being paid out. This sort of flexibility makes a positive impact on associations, particularly on the smaller youth associations, and enables us to achieve our objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">As you have mentioned, we want, as before, to prioritise the original age group for participants. The focus should therefore not be on the borderline cases, the thirteen and thirty-year-olds, who might perhaps be able to take part under special circumstances, but should, as before, be on the core group of those aged between 15 and 18.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to see a rather larger budget; to give one example, I find it incredible that we, in the European Union, spend EUR 6.5 billion on subsidising sugar production, but, when it comes to learning throughout life, youth exchanges, and culture, our investment still amounts to peanuts. It is for that reason that Parliament advocates, for ‘Youth in Action’, an increase in funding and the relaxation of the constraints of the Böge report to EUR 1.128 billion. I regard that as modest enough, and we have to set down clear markers here.</p>
<p class="contents">Anti-discrimination policy and youth seminars get a good reception from young people and our amendments are intended to put them centre stage, along with the involvement of disadvantaged young people and the opportunity for all young people to participate, not merely theoretically, but also in practice, irrespective of their nationality or race, of their gender or sexual identity, of where they live, of what they do for a living, or even of whether they are out of work. This is about the building up of intellectual activity, linguistic skills and intercultural learning and their implementation in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Ought young people not be at least as much worth to us as a fraction of what is spent on subsidising the cultivation of tobacco? I intend to make a nuisance of myself, particularly to the Council, for as long as it takes for a change of mind to kick in. It is not enough to conclude a Youth Pact; it also has to be implemented! That is the first step. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We stand right behind these figures. It is because culture gains nothing from a weakened rapporteur or from an enfeebled parliament in which different figures are used virtually every month that we strongly urge that these figures be taken as a basis. What will happen when the Luxembourg figures come in? If we were to adopt a policy other than that regarded as right and proper by the Bureau of this House and by the Conference of Committee Chairmen, the simple fact is that culture would have gained nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very happy about the ‘Youth in Action’ programme, because it takes on board a large number of suggestions made – not least in former years – by the Court of Auditors and has taken simplification as its watchword. This is a highly interesting approach, and one to which we wish to give our firm backing. Speaking as the rapporteur on the reform of the Financial Regulation, I have to say that I regard these items as very important and useful. I note with regret the way in which you have, in this programme, demanded a plethora of derogations from the Financial Regulation and have been given them. I personally would have set greater store by altering the Financial Regulation itself in such a way that one could work, under the ‘Youth in Action’ programme, with a large number of smaller organisations and smaller grants. The aspects of the programme that have been presented I regard as very important.</p>
<p class="contents">We have submitted two more amendments that would bring about additional improvements in this area: one has to do with the establishment of a database to facilitate the notification of all those organisations that complain about the vast number of documents that they have to submit, and making it possible for all this data to be recorded once and for all, leaving only amendments to be done. This would both save the Commission administrative effort and make things easier for the recipients of grants, and that in turn would have a direct effect on the image of the European Union. If subsidies are more readily obtainable, the demand for them will rise, and that is something we regard as needed, particularly by small programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies in the case of the amendment on the ‘proportionality of documents and grants’, which gives the Education and Culture Directorate-General every opportunity to act as it thinks right and proper in the implementing provisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, the numbers of students and young jobseekers crossing EU borders in search of new experience and career prospects is constantly increasing. On the other hand, we can see how many young people feel disconnected from this new multinational reality. Indeed, young voters were instrumental in the French and Dutch rejections of the Constitution. Some on the political extremes, both left and right, celebrate this disaffection and claim vindication for their old-fashioned ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I think most would view this with concern, for, if the younger generations are not propping up the EU, making it more democratic and inclusive in the process, who is? Mrs Gröner’s report therefore comes at a critical time. The Youth in Action programme is not merely an information campaign on the EU; it is something far more valuable. By increasing cross-border exchanges and getting young people involved in civic activities, the programme can help counter prejudice, broaden horizons and fight apathy. In the process it can influence and introduce them to the necessity and value of European cooperation, something all too many of their leaders are currently unable and unwilling to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight a few points. The programme’s initiatives must build on existing grassroots locally-based youth organisations to the greatest extent possible. They should not be bureaucratically managed from Brussels. Second, people as young as 13 should be eligible as a rule, not as an exception, and, of course, gender balance should be upheld.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the range of countries with which youth partnerships are struck should be the largest possible. The final related point, beyond today’s agenda but which we will eventually need to tackle, is how to improve conditions for young people to settle in another EU country. Too often an extended period of student exchange coupled with some work experience results in young people losing some of their national study and social entitlements. To avoid them being penalised in this way, we need to improve the transferability of some key social entitlements across the EU, especially for young people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new youth programme has been made significantly simpler than its predecessor, with, for example, a flexible and less bureaucratic procedure for applying for funding, which is what this House has always argued for. Moreover, the programme is now funded by only one budget line rather than four, as was formerly the case.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is at one with the rapporteur as regards the adjustment of age limits for participants, ensuring the exclusion of discrimination, and both the equal participation of disadvantaged young people and the involvement of young people in the evaluation and ongoing monitoring of the programme’s objectives. The extension of the programme to more countries, the greater importance of European cooperation in youth work and the more generous age limits make it necessary for the financial framework to be increased to – as has already been said – EUR 1.128 billion, but I would like to emphasise that in this we are being consistent with the Böge report.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the weighting of the actions, my group endorses the proposed indicative levels for the minimum funding of Actions 1 to 5. As the Commissioner emphasised, the report entrenches the possibility of staging youth seminars and the European youth weeks, thereby making them a component of European youth policy. I congratulate the rapporteur and thank her for the good cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This programme is certainly one possible option, and offers them a choice of ways in which to develop themselves or build networks at the European level.</p>
<p class="contents">If they are to do that, though, there is an urgent need for real simplification where administration is concerned. Youth organisations need help not only with the submission of applications – the Youth Forum on its own cannot do it – but also with the disbursement of funds, which is quite crucial, as the young people are waiting for their money. Their activities are up and running and they need to be paid for. If they are not, the young people, who have no money of their own, find it difficult to repay their advances, and so I address an urgent appeal to the Commission that these payments should be made at least three months after they are agreed to.</p>
<p class="contents">Youth Week is very important as a permanent component of this programme, in that it enables the young people – and us too – to engage in dialogue. By voicing their concerns here, young people get to know the institutions and are listened to by them. Rather than allowing what they say to us to go in one ear and out of the other, we should take it away with us and ponder it.</p>
<p class="contents">That disadvantaged young people should be guaranteed participation on a basis of equality is something that goes – as it must, in this context – without saying, for it is only in this way that young people will be able to understand other people who are in a disadvantaged position and help work towards a shared and sympathetic Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In truth, when one third of young people are unemployed, when a large proportion are literally being crushed by flexible forms of employment, when the prevailing ideology is cultivating unbridled individualism, does the title of the Youth in Action programme not sound ironic and insulting?</p>
<p class="contents">When the entire philosophy of the policy of the European Union is to subject everything to the maximisation of the profits of big business, when for that purpose previous rights are abolished, exposing young people to wretched and cynical exploitation, is it not a mockery to make available a few million euros so that they can cash in on the miserable future which capitalism has in store for them? Is it not hypocritical to state that it is cultivating the solidarity of young people when the imperialist policy of neo-colonialist wars sends hundreds of thousands of young people to death, hunger and poverty?</p>
<p class="contents">The programme finances actions which will promote the so-called values of the European Union; in other words, the creation of disenfranchised workers and scientists, so that maximum profit can be returned to big business. It promotes voluntary – in other words unpaid – labour and social consent. It proposes the creation of voluntary special qualifications for missions to countries outside the European Union, so as to create agencies for promoting its policy.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is financing state-funded organisations which have nothing to do with the neo-grass roots movement and which, of course, fully accept the policy of the European Union, presenting them as allegedly representing the youth of the countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The way to combat the problems of young people is in organised struggle, in quarrelling with the policy of the European Union and the European Union itself, in order to pave the way at national and international level for deep changes and reversals for the benefit of the peoples. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that the creation and promotion of a culture of tolerance among young people, as well as the encouragement of cooperation between the youth of different nations, is an important guarantee of the success of the entire European Union. It is also clear that education and expansion of young people's horizons have a special role to play in the process of fostering a culture of tolerance. Thus, the priority of learning and the accessibility of education regardless of race, nationality, gender, religion or social status must stand out in the whole philosophy of this programme's implementation. It is particularly important that this programme becomes accessible to the young in countries neighbouring the European Union, especially those countries in the grip of autocratic regimes. In this regard, the experience of Lithuania's youth of cooperating with young people in Belarus, particularly in an academic sense, may be a good example to the whole of Europe. We thus acquire one of the most effective instruments in the expansion of democracy and the spreading of European values. The Union for Europe of the Nations supports this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In many cases it brought considerable progress in the lives of youth communities in Hungary. However, the programme failed to achieve some of its objectives. For instance, it failed to reach young people living in rural areas. Disadvantaged youths living in small rural settlements have not been able to get involved in the programme easily. Therefore we must ensure that starting from 2007 as many rural youths as possible are able to get involved in the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be more helpful to youth communities of countries participating in the programme if the details, information material and some kind of a database were more accessible. We know that some progress has already been made in this direction, but it would be important to make more of the successful projects accessible, so that youths and youth organisations can get to know them. These projects will set their imagination in motion, and will help them acquire useful experience. Another positive step forward is that settlement-level and local government youth work is relied on to an ever-increasing extent. This is the right way forward, because the principle of subsidiarity must be implemented consistently in youth affairs. It is important that local youth work becomes an integral part of international youth cooperation. Please allow me to call your attention to the fact that the Hungarian Parliament concluded a cooperation agreement, a programme agreement with the Serbian Parliament involving a tolerance programme. Within this programme tolerance camps will be organised for young people, which may contribute to the prevention of nationality-based or ethnically motivated incidents involving Hungarian and Serbian youths. In the course of these events, young people will meet artists, politicians and sportspeople well-known in both countries. They will create a virtual parliament where they can deal with human rights and minority issues. I am certain that the Youth in Action programme will provide opportunities for youths in many countries to understand and get to know one another better, which will create a strong foundation for taking action against all forms of discrimination and will raise the tolerance levels of young people.

This is hyperbole, but there will never be too much attention paid to the young, the Europe of tomorrow. The youth programme for 2007-2013 is a step forward when compared with the current programme. We welcome the fact that the programme is more specific in its inclusion of the EU's new neighbours: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova and the North Caucasus. This will allow young people to become acquainted with European values and initiatives as well as enter into relations with partners from EU states. It is very good that the programme will not only include young people aged 15-25, but will be open to those aged 13-30. The simplified rules for the submission of projects means that we will see more initiatives and far more young people will take advantage of the fruits of the programme. However, this also demands greater funding. Lithuania's youth are taking an active part in the work of the current programme. It is hoped that the implementation of the new programme will further foster reciprocal knowledge, understanding and tolerance and will reduce social isolation.

I realise that the times we live in are not easy, but there is hope. For young people, it started with the White Paper and continued with the Youth programme, which is continuing and remains popular. The proposal on the table reaffirms and extends existing options and financial support, and widens the spectrum of countries and geographical areas, as well as the age brackets. For the first time in our history, a summit of Heads of State or Government has adopted special conclusions in the form of the European Youth Pact. We have spoken with young people this year about youth issues and, later this week, I will discuss these matters in Cardiff with representatives of Member States and European youth.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to some of the suggestions that have been put forward, I would like to state that the flexibility inherent in the programme should be very apparent during December Youth Week in Brussels. It can serve to link up various programmes, for instance those on culture and youth, sports and youth, and social inclusion and youth.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of financial rules and regulations, I am a strong advocate of simpler, more transparent and speedier procedures. This is why we have incorporated more than one hundred proposals into the draft amendment on financial regulation for the European Union. The proposal is now in the hands of Parliament and the Council. I am confident that it will receive a very positive response in both bodies and that it will be beneficial for all areas concerned. I also would like to say that the European Commission supports the proposal put forward by Mrs Grässle on behalf of the Budget Committee, as well as many other amending motions.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to recommend strongly that the programme be implemented as complementary to and compatible with other programmes, such as the lifelong learning programme or the citizenship programme. These have great potential if they are coordinated, if they complement each other and if they are coherent.</p>
<p class="contents">And my last remark: I would be very happy if next Thursday, following your vote, I could convey a message to the youth of Europe that the programme Youth in Action will be one of the first to receive support within the constraints imposed by the financial outlook, as an instrument for the future European Union in 2007 to 2013. Thank you for considering this approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
