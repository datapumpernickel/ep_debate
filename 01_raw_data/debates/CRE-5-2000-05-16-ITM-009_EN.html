Xu Wenli, one of the founders of the CDP, was sentenced to 13 years in jail in December 1998, along with two other prominent democracy campaigners.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Member will know, the longstanding policy of the Union is to raise the individual cases of Chinese citizens who have been in prison for political offences with the Chinese authorities, particularly in the context of the human rights dialogue, the last meeting of which took place on 25 February this year. The Union has therefore raised with the Chinese Government the cases of Xu Wenli and others who have been trying to exercise basic rights that are specified by the United Nation's Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was actually signed by China in October 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">To date, the Commission knows that at least 23 CDP members have been jailed for subversion as a result of their efforts to exercise those rights to which China is committed.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to these and other cases, the Commission consistently calls upon the People's Republic of China to comply with the letter and spirit of the United Nation's human rights conventions which it has signed; to do so even before China's ratification of those conventions and actively to pursue ratification. These efforts by the Commission will continue.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Bearing in mind, Commissioner, what you said about your willingness to raise individual cases, could I also ask you to make enquiries about the fate of Rebiya Kadeer. She was arrested on 11 August 1999 in Urumqui, the capital of the XUAR, while on her way to meet representatives of the US Congressional Research Service. She was charged with providing secret information to foreigners and is believed to have been sentenced to eight years' imprisonment at a secret trial. I will gladly provide more detailed information on that, Mr Commissioner. It makes me even more angry that European Union Member States, faced with these cases and the 23 in general you referred to, show such spinelessness in refusing to support the US initiative in Geneva at the UN Commission on Human Rights attacking China's human rights record.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: The Commission's reform programme and enlargement</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 1 March 2000, the Commission adopted the White Paper on the reform of the Commission. The measures and actions announced in the White Paper provide for a radical reform of the Commission which will involve a considerable amount of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission indicate to what extent the present reform proposals take account of the forthcoming enlargement? Do they anticipate the consequences which enlargement will have on the internal structure of the Commission and do the proposed measures and actions take account of such consequences? If so, in what way? If not, would it not have been more logical for the Commission to take account of enlargement in respect of certain aspects, thereby avoiding a situation whereby shortly after completion of the current reform process the Commission has to enter into a fresh round of reforms to cope with the impact of enlargement?</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission intend to present an action plan with a timetable, as is the case with the present reform plan, in order to prepare the structure of the Commission for the forthcoming enlargement?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Delay in designing a practical strategy and in pursuing necessary modernisation would not have been acceptable to the Commission, to the Council, to this Parliament or to the public, as I am sure the honourable Member understands.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the specifically stated purposes of comprehensive reform is the development of strengthened administrative performance which will, amongst other things, enable the Commission to deal more effectively with changes in the current and the future Union and in the wider world. Clearly the challenges posed by the forthcoming extensive enlargement are different in nature and scale than those presented by any previous enlargement. The Commission must therefore be capable of achieving the highest standards of executive and administrative performance in the discharge of its powers and duties in order to facilitate that massive and welcome development. As the College of Commissioners made clear in our introduction to the White Paper, and elsewhere in that document, and I quote what we said: "the challenges of globalisation and future enlargement require better governance at all levels including the European Union". All political institutions must rise to this challenge and so must the Commission. Reform is therefore an essential precondition – a precondition for realising our vision of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The current administrative reform is not a limited exercise – it is an evolutionary process as we have made very clear – it will be continuously monitored and the results achieved will be assessed in order to provide for any relevant adjustments. Proper account will be taken of any specific requirements that arise from the enlargement process, and naturally that will apply to human resources implications of the ongoing change. Issues such as the management of the increased cultural diversity within the Commission and an early retirement scheme that is directly linked to enlargement will, for instance, be amongst those that receive particular attention. As with past enlargements, specific measures concerning the appointment and integration of officials from the new Member States will be adopted at the appropriate time.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 35 by Rosa Miguélez Ramos (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0411_EN.html">H-0411/00</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Boarding of Community vessels by Canadian inspectors in international waters</span></p>
<p class="contents">Five years after the seizure of the Estai, the Community fleet fishing in NAFO international waters has expressed deep concern at the boarding of a Portuguese vessel, the Santa Mafalda, supposedly by Canadian inspectors. The Santa Mafalda, a vessel used to catch halibut, was boarded on 24 April last. The inspectors confiscated all documentation and refused to leave the vessel. Furthermore, a launch belonging to the Canadian authorities has been tracking the vessel constantly, thus hampering its fishing activity.</p>
<p class="contents">A few days earlier, Canadian inspectors had apparently boarded a Spanish freezer trawler, which was also fishing in international waters. European fishermen fear that the underlying aim of these boarding incidents is to deter them from using the fishing grounds in which they catch halibut and cod.</p>
<p class="contents">What information does the Commission possess on these incidents? Can it clarify whether the inspectors were acting on behalf of NAFO or the Canadian Government? Has it taken any action in this regard, or does it intend to do so? Should accepting Community monitoring rules for inspections in NAFO waters prove problematic for Canada, what initiatives could the Commission take to set clear and binding rules which would allay the doubts of those working in the sector and the Canadian Government alike?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the honourable Member who raised the question will know, in accordance with the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation scheme of joint international inspection and surveillance, each contracting party may assign means of inspection and inspectors to the NAFO scheme and NAFO inspectors may inspect any fishing vessel flying the flag of a contracting party. NAFO inspectors are obliged to carry out their duties in accordance with rules set out in the NAFO scheme and they are also obliged to remain under the operational control of the authorities of their contracting parties and be responsible to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Against that background, on 23 April two Canadian NAFO inspectors accompanied by a trainee carried out an inspection of the Community fishing vessel Santa Mafalda which was operating at that time in the NAFO regulatory area. The Canadian inspectors in question and the surveillance vessel from which the inspection was carried out are assigned to the NAFO scheme. Their inspection was carried out under its auspices. Having been informed by the Canadians, inspectors of the Commission boarded the Santa Mafalda to verify the grounds on which the Canadian inspectors based their citation of a serious infringement. In conducting this verification the Commission inspectors ensured the security and continuity of the evidence on board and transmitted their report to the Portuguese authorities. Those authorities in turn ordered the Santa Mafalda to the port of Aveiro in Portugal for a thorough inspection.</p>
<p class="contents">The Santa Mafalda arrived in Aveiro on 10 May 2000 and two Commission inspectors participated in a thorough inspection of the vessel. The Commission has drawn the attention of the Canadian authorities to the procedures followed by the Canadian inspectors in relation to their seizure of documentation and their continued stay on board the Santa Mafalda. The Commission takes the view that the Canadian NAFO inspectors in question acted in breach of the NAFO scheme by taking away documents from the vessel without the permission of the master and by continuing to stay on board the vessel. However, it is relevant to note that in this case the master of the vessel and the Portuguese authorities did not oppose the prolonged stay of the Canadian inspectors on the vessel and the fishing activities of the Santa Mafalda were not obstructed.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The sea is a difficult world, and the Community fleet which fishes in international Atlantic waters experiences the interference of controllers and patrols from coastal countries which give the impression that, behind the harassment they sometimes suffer, there is one sole intention; to expel them from those fishing grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner knows, as I do, that the current situation in the NAFO is not, fortunately, what it was five years ago after the seizure of the <span class="italic">Estai</span>. The European Commission – like the fishing sector itself – has made significant efforts to iron out our differences. However, there are still outstanding questions, such as the extraterritorial clauses, which allow the Canadian Government to carry out inspections, controls and seizures beyond their national waters, in open sea, which is incompatible with international provisions and which, all too frequently, involves the arbitrary application of controls within the framework of the NAFO.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, I would like to ask the Commissioner how the European Commission intends to defend the right of the Community fleet to fish freely in these waters, albeit within the existing rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 36 by Efstratios Korakas (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0415_EN.html">H-0415/00</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Need to support and strengthen the olive oil sector</span></p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the new olive oil regulation is having severe consequences for Greek producers who are poor farmers in infertile and island regions. The abolition of the intervention price which had already been eroded has brought producer prices down to derisory levels: together with the co-responsibility levy this has had the effect of decimating olive oil producers' incomes. The profiteering of traders who sell olive oil to the consumer at prices many times the producers' price have increased, and the small quota accorded to Greece in practice cancels out the entitlement to plant a further 3 000 hectares provided for in the new regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Since olive oil is a basic product and the main source of income for farmers from the most disadvantaged regions in Greece and is also a staple of the Mediterranean diet, will the Commission say what measures it intends to take to protect olive oil cultivation and producers' incomes so as to enable them to stay on the land and when it intends to act? Does it intend to increase the quota in order to cover existing production and the volume of production expected to result from the new plantations? Will it reintroduce the institution of intervention, but improved as far as prices and the date of commencement are concerned? Finally, will it draw up and implement an integrated and effective policy to promote and advertise olive oil both in the EU countries and in third countries, so that olive oil can occupy the place to which it is entitled – according to scientific findings – in the human diet?</p>

I am happy to respond to Mr Korakas.</p>
<p class="contents">In June 1998, the Commission undertook to present a proposal on the future of the common organisation of the market in olive oil to the Council and Parliament in 2000. The new regime would apply from the 2001/2002 marketing year which, as the honourable Member will know, begins on 1 November 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently studying new data on the structure of olive oil production in the various producer Member States, as well as developments in the world market where the Community is the leading producer by a considerable margin. The study will also take into account the need to draw up an olive oil quality strategy in order to add more value to the product.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as product promotion is concerned, the Community is already financing promotion campaigns through the International Olive Oil Council. Those campaigns appear to have a positive effect within the European Union and indeed in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to a specific issue raised by the honourable Member's question, I have to point out that the produce of new plantings would not give entitlement to aid. However, the Commission hopes that the Community producers concerned will benefit fully under derogations from the rules as they relate to approved planting programmes, although the olive oil in question would count towards the maximum guaranteed quantity which has already been set.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission wishes to point out that rather than simply abolishing the intervention system, what has actually happened is that it has been replaced by a system of private storage which is more flexible than the intervention system because it applies throughout the marketing year if the market situation calls for such support. Since the start of the 1998/99 marketing year, it has not been necessary to pay private storage aid. However, it is worth emphasising that over that same period the old buying-in intervention system would not have been activated either.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because of the policies of the European Union, olive oil producers are truly at the mercy of big producers who negotiate among themselves and try to buy olive oil at unbelievably low prices. This situation has reached dramatic proportions with the abolition of the albeit downgraded intervention system and the system of private storage, let me assure you is, quite frankly, a joke. So how are we to deal with this situation? Will an improved intervention system providing rudimentary protection for producers be reintroduced? And given that, on a global scale, olive oil is so important to the human body and plays such an important role in maintaining farming populations in disadvantaged areas, why is it that the quotas, particularly for Greece, are so low? Are you going to increase them? And with the widespread practice of mixing olive oil with sunflower seed oil, what does the Commission intend to do to put a stop to this practice, which is harming producers and consumers to the benefit of industrial racketeers? In this spirit, does the Commission believe that this phenomenon can be tackled through guile, i.e., by increasing the quota for Italy, which is the main country responsible for mixing oil, and reducing the quota for Greece?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">All I can say to him at this juncture, because I know this is a matter of continuing concern and activity by him, is that the CMO for olive oil is due to be reformed, as I indicated earlier, by 1 November 2001, following agreement in the Council and in this Parliament in adopting Regulation 1638/98. I cannot assume that if the situation were precisely as the honourable Member describes, and smaller producers were in a dangerously disadvantaged position by comparison with the big producers, there would have been such agreement in the Council and in this House. Therefore, I hope he will give attention to the results of the studies I mentioned being undertaken at the moment by the Commission, both in terms of the general questions he raised when he submitted his question and also in terms of the relative fortunes of big producers and small producers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as someone who is merely a consumer of olive oil, I hope there is no extensive dilution of what is one of my favourite complementary foodstuffs and that, whatever else we do in the European Community, we strive together with olive oil producers of all sizes to maintain the maximum quality.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Further integration entailed by EMU</span></p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission's estimation, to what extent do the requirements imposed by EMU on economic policy – which include permanently fixed exchange rates – create the need for further economic integration in the form of a more extensive common budget (a common fiscal policy), cyclical transfers between Member States, increased labour mobility between the participating states and/or a more flexible labour market?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are also other factors. There is greater transparency in prices, an improvement in competition and an increase in trade and investment both cross-border and also between other countries or areas affected by monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, as the common monetary policy will mean the same interest rate for all Member States of the monetary union, it will not only have an effect in terms of developing demand, but it will also mean greater integration of the financial markets. This should also bring benefits for savers and investors.</p>
<p class="contents">For this to have the greatest positive effect, it is essential that we carry out a policy of rationalised public finances, which will not generate tensions in monetary policy itself, and at the same time, a decisive policy of structural reforms and a competition policy, which will allow the maximum benefit to be drawn from the process.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for economic and monetary union to function successfully, we do not need a major budget which will allow cyclical transfers<span class="bold"> </span>in the event of difficulties. I believe that the Treaty, supplemented by the Stability and Growth Pact, provides adequate instruments to implement an economic policy which is compatible with a unified monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic framework which we have introduced is a framework of mutual supervision of national fiscal policies and of coordination of economic policies by means of processes to improve our structural situations and the coordination or creation of a positive macroeconomic environment which will favour growth and employment, and at the same time reduce the possibility of asymmetric clashes caused by economic policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Budgetary consolidation itself, which is, of course, the reduction of the public deficit, gives each Member State room to act in adverse situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Greater labour mobility may certainly help to confront the problems which may arise in the event of<span class="bold"> </span>asymmetric clashes. Both an increase in the available work force and an improvement in productivity would improve the situation in terms of creating jobs and helping to reduce unemployment. That is why we attach particular importance to labour mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has therefore insisted on its various strategies regarding the specific point of labour mobility, while remaining aware that this is a difficult issue. It is difficult within Member States and it is difficult between one Member State and another, due not only to historical and cultural incompatibilities in terms of education, but also to a series of other aspects related to this type of situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would say that clearly these difficulties which are being considered – and which may arise in the future – will surely be much less serious than those which have been brought up in theory by people who study monetary union, given that – and this is our experience to date – we are seeing an approximation of the economic policies of the countries and we have created room, in monetary terms, for us to confront difficulties more easily than in the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What kind of large budget? Is it a large EU budget which is being considered? I should also like to hear whether it can be imagined continuing with a policy based upon recommendations and exhortations to the euro zone countries. For example, Denmark has, in fact, on a number of occasions disregarded recommendations from the Commission. Is this state of affairs to be accepted in the long term or will the Stability and Growth Pact be followed up and a stable environment ensured for EMU by adopting working methods of a type different from those involving recommendations and exhortations? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, a major budget is essential to tackle the cyclical difficulties. This would lead us into a very complex debate. The problems are not caused by clashes<span class="bold"> </span>themselves, but by asymmetric clashes; asymmetric clashes differ depending on whether they are temporary or permanent, whether they relate to supply or demand. We have little experience to help us define a typology and lay down a single formula for resolving these difficulties by budgetary means.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that it is a much better idea to establish a general framework of economic health, of good economic behaviour, which will allow us to confront the difficulties in the case in question.</p>
<p class="contents">In the future we will continue with recommendations to comply with the stability and growth pact. I do not know whether it is a good or a bad thing, but that is our obligation as the Commission. This is an agreement adopted by the Council of Ministers as a result of initiatives by certain Member States and which I also support, since I believe that a good budgetary policy provides greater room for manoeuvre in the event of difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier I referred to the fact that the situation is different in each of the Member States. In this year’s recommendations we have taken particular account of the Commission’s own analyses regarding what the margins are, and which benchmarks we are setting in each of the Member States to tackle the crisis without exceeding the 3% public deficit, which is the figure we have established as a reference.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see that that situation is different in each of the countries and, therefore, our recommendations and our comments will always be different in each of the countries, although this is not the only aspect that we take into consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What has happened with the euro? There are many technical explanations as to why we are in this situation. This would require a broader debate, focussing on the starting point, which is the development of economic forecasts and the real economies of each of the areas. It would also clearly concern changes in interest rates and certain other technical elements, such as expiry dates for certain types of issues etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality is that, by analysing the euro on the basis, fundamentally, of the evolution of the exchange rate, we are making an incorrect evaluation of its introduction. The euro has been a great success, in terms of its introduction, in terms of issuing it as a currency, in terms of the consolidation of an excellent economic situation in Europe and in terms of the forecasts for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the interest rate is not what we would have liked. We believe that a strong economy means a strong euro. We also believe that the development of growth in Europe will be strong throughout 2000 and, as a result, we will match US growth by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, we believe that the value of the euro will be rising in the coming months. Therefore, despite a certain degree of concern – because that concern exists within public opinion – about the evolution of the euro, we believe that this situation will be corrected and that it should be considered to be temporary rather than permanent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason for the dollar becoming stronger in comparison to the euro is simply that the national economy of the USA is stronger than that of the euro countries. Hundreds of thousands of new jobs have recently been created in the USA, while the number of jobs in Europe has been cut. I would like to ask the Commissioner firstly, whether the Commission admits that the weakening of the euro that has been much thrashed out in public, is a consequence of the infrastructural problems and lack of dynamism of the EU economy, particularly in relation to the USA, and whether he really believes that the kind of Keynesian action as proposed by Mrs Frahm would be the cure for this weakening of the euro, and whether he believes that the Commission will achieve better results in this matter, when the national governments of France and Germany have actually proceeded in the totally opposite direction, and their actions have weakened even further the competitiveness of the euro area.

<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to increasing cooperation in terms of coordinating economic policies, I believe that it is necessary and positive and is one of the elements which is emerging from this current crisis. The French President has highlighted this and it will obviously be a point for debate during the next presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not agree with the theory that the euro’s development is leading to a fall in employment in Europe and an increase in employment in the USA. Transfers of capital may generate additional activity in the United States, but the positive increase in exports is generating activity in Europe. It would require a very complex and profound debate to deal with this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, what I do believe – as I said earlier – is that the euro, at the moment, has an exchange rate which, if we analyse it in relation to its components and its historical situation, is not that different from situations which have existed at other times.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Precarious employment and the industrial-accident rate in Spain and in the Murcia region</span></p>
<p class="contents">At the Lisbon Summit, a commitment was made to achieving full employment in proper jobs throughout the EU. In response to the French Government’s proposal involving a reduction in working hours in order to create more proper, stable jobs, the approach agreed between the Spanish and UK Governments, which calls for further deregulation of employment conditions in order to increase the number of jobs, has been adopted. Spain’s experience over the last four years has demonstrated that jobs are indeed created but are predominantly casual and precarious in nature, and they are associated with a high rate of industrial accidents, the Murcia region being the part of Spain where that rate is highest.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission not think that there is an urgent case for monitoring the conditions under which jobs are being created in the various EU countries and regions, so as to ensure that job-creation is not at the expense of the stability and dignity of workers and especially of young people entering the job market for the first time?</p>

Therefore, allow me to make a rather more general comment. The assessment of the labour market reforms which have resulted from the processes we have established in the Union – the Luxembourg process and the broad guidelines for economic policy – demonstrates that the reforms of the regulations on the labour market in the different countries are making a positive and significant contribution to greater economic growth and to promoting the creation of employment and the greater participation of men and women in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The broad guidelines of economic policy and the recommendations for employment have never advocated a simple deregulation of the labour market, as the question states. Together with the reform of certain labour market regulations, they also include, for example, the need to adopt measures which will promote entrepreneurial spirit or active labour market policies – and we state this quite deliberately – to improve employment opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures adopted in each Member State must be adapted to the problems and reality of each of them. It is also quite normal for the Commission to insist on the need to hold debates and make agreements with social partners so that they may actively participate in the changes to the labour market in each country.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as a significant and lasting increase in the levels of employment, one of the key priorities of the employment strategy is to improve the quality of jobs. The recent Lisbon Summit gave a new impulse to the Union’s economic and social agenda and we have also insisted on this point by talking of more and better employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to highlight, as a fundamental contribution to the consolidation of the progress made until now, the promotion and maintenance of rigorous regulations on health and safety at work, which has been one of the most prominent issues in the debate held in the Commission, which advocates better jobs in Europe. Labour market reforms directed at improving employment opportunities and workers’ ability to adapt to these new opportunities in no way seek to undermine working conditions or health and safety at work.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with its legal competence as laid down in the Treaty, the Commission has kept up the necessary efforts to implement and propose various legal instruments and monitor the incorporation of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to your specific question and the case of Spain, it is Spain’s responsibility, like the other Members, to apply the Commission’s directives. It is also the responsibility of the Member States to monitor the application of these directives in all of their regions. The Commission must guarantee that those directives are transposed into national law correctly and, clearly, to monitor all the issues relating to its application, which is the responsibility of the national authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, the political analysis of the Lisbon Summit reveals that there were two proposals: one which was more social, more committed, which came from the French Prime Minister, Mr Jospin, and the other, resulting from a previous agreement between Mr Blair and Mr Aznar, deregulating the labour market and making it more flexible. The latter proposal won the day.</p>

<p class="contents">With regard to the basic problem, I would make a different comment. Our concern has always been not only greater employment but also greater quality of employment. In the broad guidelines for economic policy for this year, and in the specific recommendation for Spain, we expressly refer to the need for the problems to be analysed, amongst them the cost of dismissal, which may be important with regard to temporary employment, because we believe that a distinction should be made between precariousness and flexibility, which are two very different things.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, you introduced a second element in your supplementary question which, in my opinion, is of great interest: Why do we not establish the objective of full employment in the same way that we established the objectives of the Treaty of Maastricht at the time? Basically because they are two completely different types of figure. At Maastricht, what we put in place was compliance with obligations dependent on voluntary decisions adopted by the Member States which form the European Union. In the case of full employment, the figure is the consequence of measures which are intended to achieve an objective, but which do not have a causal relationship which guarantees its objective.</p>
<p class="contents">What we can consider is what is being done in the various employment programmes, and that is the implementation of certain elements which will allow us to move towards full employment. When we spoke of full employment in the Commission document which served as a basis for the debate in Lisbon, we expressly said that if we add the development of the economy in accordance with currently available figures to the various determining factors and policies proposed by the Commission, full employment will be achieved. However, this cannot be a political objective, as in Maastricht, because it does not depend on the will of the different governments or on a specific decision by each one of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the countries of the Southern Mediterranean, and specifically in the region of Murcia, they have, in recent years, stopped managing unemployment and started to manage employment. They have moved from an extraordinary and terrifying level of unemployment, originating in the great state industries whose economic model was unsustainable, through a crisis and then to a situation involving the growth of small businesses (SMBs) and economic incentives which have generated a new and vibrant model.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is clear that accidents in the workplace – which I am now talking about – are a problem of education and mutual responsibility on the part of businessmen, the state, public administration and, of course, trade unions. Unless they all work in unison, they will not achieve this objective. In Spain, back in 1995, a law was adopted in this respect, and they are trying to comply with it, but this cannot be achieved in a day.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Commissioner, firstly, what active policies and which economic sectors do you intend to bring into play in order to achieve better education in this particular area, so that a sense of responsibility may be developed?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly and very specifically: is there any programme to educate immigrants in the language of their host country, so that we can educate them to understand the minimum safety standards in this region which is host to many immigrants who do not speak our language? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is really quite simple. I have worked on it for a good many years. It is completely impossible even for organisations with academic employees to find out how extensive the ‘acquis’ is, and it is apparently impossible for Mr Vanhengen to give the entire acquis to a Member of the European Parliament who is quite prepared to go through it and distribute the tasks among the different employees in order to see what positions are to be adopted on its various aspects.

<p class="contents">The legal acts which we are talking about here are legal acts passed by the Council, by Parliament, by the Commission and by all the Community institutions. You, as a member of the most important legislative institution of the European Union know full well that these legal acts have not been numbered consecutively. I do not know of a single Member State of the European Union whose laws are numbered consecutively. Even the laws in your country – and I have taken the trouble of finding out – are not numbered consecutively. If you think that Commission officials are well employed if I sit them down and tell them to spend a week counting the legal acts issued since 1955, then let me tell you that I do not. I have no intention of arranging for them to be counted. The information which I have given you is as accurate as possible: i.e. that candidate countries are sent all, I repeat all the legal acts of the European Union without exception. I am curious to know how it helps if I tell you that this figure is 21334 or 21425. If you want, you sit down and do it. You can find the entire Community acquis on-line on the Celex website here in Parliament. You tell your employees to count these legal acts, because I shall not tell mine to do so.</p>

It is updated now and again because the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission are not idle and continue to produce legal acts, meaning that the acquis changes. This amended acquis must, of course, be included in negotiations. But this happens on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The screening process has therefore been completed with all candidates. Your question is based on a misunderstanding. Screening is not the same as negotiation, screening is merely an adjustment process. Screening is used merely to identify the acquis of the European Union and how much of it already forms part of the candidate country’s legislation and how much does not. That has been done.</p>
<p class="contents">Now you want to know how far negotiations have proceeded overall. I know that for the Luxembourg group of countries, with which negotiations started in March 1998, between 10 and 15 out of a total of 31 negotiating chapters have been provisionally completed. A few more will be completed during the Portuguese presidency. But more important than the number of chapters completed is probably the number of chapters opened. By the end of the Portuguese presidency, all 29 chapters will be on the negotiating table for the Luxembourg group of countries. Only the chapters entitled “Institutions” and “Miscellaneous” are still closed for obvious reasons. They come at the end.</p>
<p class="contents">With the Helsinki group of countries, negotiations did not start until February of this year. Between 5 and 8 chapters will be opened for these countries during the Portuguese presidency. Indeed, I think that we will be able to provisionally close a whole series of chapters by the end of the Portuguese presidency, but we cannot yet forecast how many with any degree of accuracy. In all events, the process is proceeding apace.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite impossible to forecast when the negotiating process will be completed and when the first accessions will take place. There have been intensive discussions on this over recent weeks and months. The Commission stated quite clearly in Helsinki that an accession scenario could not be developed until all the information needed was available. We need to clarify if the Union itself is ready for accession, i.e. if the institutional reforms have been completed, how far negotiations have progressed and, most importantly, and this will be the most difficult exercise at the end, if a candidate country is judged to be in a position to really apply and implement the acquis it has adopted. As things stand today, I am bound to say that we cannot forecast when such a scenario will be ready. I have said on many occasions that I would like it to be ready by the end of this year, at the Nice summit. But whether or not that will be possible will only become apparent in the autumn of this year once we have the up-to-date progress reports on preparations for accession for each individual candidate country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The process of enlargement is expected to be a truly demanding one, in which there is a danger that we either become frustrated by long waiting times or compromise over the criteria by granting overlong transition periods, which will naturally cause displeasure in the old Member States. An arrangement such as the EEA agreement may be regarded as a solution of the past, but I would nevertheless like to ask, whether the Commission could, even in principle, consider a possible solution along the lines of the EEA agreement – not as it stands but of that nature – to be used as some sort of ’hatchery’ or incubator for the new Member States prior to actual membership, instead of the applicant countries having to wait for long periods of time before permanent membership becomes a reality. I would further like to ask, whether the Commission shares the view that this kind of arrangement, along the lines of the EEA agreement, could considerably reduce the costs of enlargement and promote the economic development of the applicant countries. I hope this question was not an improper one at this time.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This discussion was held in the first half of the 1990s and it culminated in resolutions of which you are aware, which were discussed on several occasions in Parliament and which can no longer be made retroactive, namely the resolution of the European Councils of Copenhagen, Essen and Luxembourg to prepare the Central and Eastern European Countries and Cyprus and Malta for full membership. There is no point today in debating whether or not there might have been an alternative. In any case, it is my recollection that the candidates were not satisfied with anything less. They would not have accepted less and would have seen it as discrimination, meaning that, in Luxembourg in 1997, there was no longer any realistic alternative to the resolution taken in any case. There is not a single country involved in the process which takes the view that we should depart from this objective of full membership. If there were, I would know about it. But there is not. All 12 countries with which we are negotiating are seriously working towards the goal of full membership and I urgently advise you against opening a debate on changing the fundamental objectives of enlargement now that the process has begun. The candidates will only see it as a serious breach of trust.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However what I am interested in is this: Have transitional arrangements in the area of the free movement of services been applied for during these negotiations? You know, I am from a border region and I know exactly what the situation is on the ground. I am convinced that medium-sized companies and the craft industry will face huge problems and enormous challenges when it comes to the free movement of services, because there is a huge wage differential of 1:10 at present. You yourself know full well which industries are affected. Is there any intention on the European side to apply for transitional arrangements in the area of the free movement of services? The Czech Republic has already applied for transition periods for the acquisition of land by foreigners and this will have an impact on services. What is your position on the transition periods which the Czech Republic has applied for and what is the Commission’s position in general on this point? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would gladly do so, but I am not allowed to.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I can still answer the question, because the Commission naturally has an opinion on the points which you raised. First, the Commission takes the view that transition periods should only be considered during the enlargement process if the aim of enlargement cannot otherwise be achieved within the required time or by the required date. Transition periods must be very, very limited in both scope and duration, especially where the internal market is at stake. You must know that every transition period, irrespective of whom it benefits, suspends the internal market for that area. And if a large number of transition periods are agreed, then we can forget the whole idea of the internal market for years to come. That cannot be the meaning of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The question which you actually want answered is the question of how we can prepare for the problems which will arise in certain border regions following enlargement. The region which you come from and the region which I come from are just such regions. I have discussed this matter on many occasions in your country, as you know, and so I can be brief. I think that there may well be transition periods in relation to the free movement of workers, which is the really difficult question. But we have not yet reached that point.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of the free movement of services, which will lead to stiffer competition in border regions, I think that we need to start preparing an action programme right now, particularly so that small and medium-sized enterprises in border regions will be capable of adapting to and withstanding this new competition.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now I am being asked to answer a supplementary question which very specifically concerns one candidate country. I really cannot see the connection between these two questions, except that both relate to enlargement. However, if you take the view that there is a connection, then I am prepared to answer the question and am able to do so. All the acquis is taken into consideration in the progress reports on the candidate countries. The Charter of Fundamental Rights cannot be taken into consideration because it is not yet ready. It is only now being drafted and its legal status has not yet been recognised. I know no better than you if this Charter will become part of the Treaty or if it will be no more than a solemn declaration. If this Charter should become part of the Treaty, it will of course be taken into account in future progress reports and we shall report on how the details of this Charter are being taken into account in the individual countries concerned. We must also report in the progress reports – as you will have noticed – as to whether a country is complying with the Copenhagen criteria. That basically answers the questions, because the political criteria of Copenhagen basically cover everything which will appear in this Charter of Fundamental Rights and these questions have also been answered in relation to Lithuania and will be answered in the next progress report on Lithuania. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My own personal opinion is irrelevant. In any case, I cannot explain it to the European Parliament until the institutions have formed their own opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as linking transition periods is concerned, this happens automatically. We shall have a so-called “play off” at the end of the negotiations between the wishes which the Member States still have and the wishes which the candidates have. Basically their wishes concern transition periods. Irrespective of whether or not that is what it is formally called, you can imagine how this sort of negotiation process proceeds. It will be a negotiation and one of the principles of negotiation is that one side makes a concession so that the other side also makes a concession and an overall compromise must be found in the end which takes accounts of the wishes of both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Highly specific packages – if that was your question – whereby we also say: we are linking the wish for transition periods on the one side to the wish for transition periods on the other side are not feasible in my opinion. I should draw your attention to the fact that the question of transition periods in relation to the free movement of workers, for example, only gives cause for concern in two of the fifteen Member States. It is a German problem and it is an Austrian problem. It is not a problem for the other thirteen which is why I cannot predict exactly how this issue will be handled in the final stage of negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In most cases the Commission can close the examination of the notified aid project after the preliminary examination, that is without opening a formal investigation. Such decisions must be taken within two months following the receipt of a complete notification. In practice, notifications are frequently incomplete so that the Commission is forced to request additional information before it can take a decision. In order to further reduce this type of unnecessary delay, the Commission has prepared detailed standard notification forms for certain types of aid – regional, training, R&amp;D, etc. – and will continue to do so where appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">When doubts are raised about the compatibility of an aid project with the common market, the Commission must open a formal investigation for which the regulation provides an indicative time-limit of 18 months. The Commission would certainly prefer to be able to reduce this time-limit. However, this seems at present not feasible for different reasons. Firstly, considerable time is needed for translation and publication of the decision, for third parties to submit observations and for the Member States to comment on these observations. Secondly, the cases for which a formal investigation is opened are usually very complex and therefore require a longer period of examination, often also involving meetings with the Member State concerned and modifications to the original project. Nevertheless, the Commission considers that given the absence of any time-limit for the formal investigation procedure before the regulation, the regulation has already brought some progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also considering new ways of improving the efficiency and speed of state aid procedures. In this regard, the group exemption regulations, which are currently being prepared for aid to SMEs – training aid and <span class="italic">de minimis</span> aid – should be mentioned. Once they are in force, Member States will no longer need to notify aid projects complying with the conditions of the exemption regulations but can grant the aid immediately. This will considerably simplify state aid procedures.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Given that the electricity market came into effect in February last, subjecting all electricity production to the rules of the internal market, and that the nuclear common market under Article 92 of the Euratom Treaty does not include electricity as a product, does the Commission agree that electricity generated using nuclear energy is now subject to the same internal market rules as all other forms of electricity? Does the Commission therefore consider that all state aids to the nuclear industry are prohibited by the EC Treaty, given that no derogation is specified, and that Article 98 of the Euratom Treaty does not provide for a subsidised accident insurance scheme for nuclear risks? In this context what proposals, if any, has the Commission made to the UK Government concerning their NFFO system under Article 87 of the EC Treaty?

The Commission considers that there are no grounds for interpreting the EC or the Euratom Treaty as necessarily prohibiting all state aids to the nuclear industry. The Euratom Treaty does not include any clauses specifically prohibiting state aid. Moreover, while Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty do provide for a general principle prohibiting state aids, they also authorise specific categories of state aid. It would only be possible to determine the incompatibility of aid following specific investigation of each case.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not made any proposals to the UK Government on the subject of the NFFO system in application of Article 88 of the EC Treaty. As regards any existing aid to the nuclear industry, the Commission is not undertaking any systematic investigation. If, however, cases of incompatible aid are brought to the attention of the Commission, such cases will be dealt with in compliance with the terms of the relevant articles of the EC and Euratom Treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, regarding state aid to the environment, you expect to implement a very thorough analysis of the subsidies to renewable energies even though it is clear that, for the time being, this sector is at a disadvantage due to the internalisation of costs. In other words, the market share of renewable energies within the current electricity market is barely 5%.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside that, nuclear energy amounts to 30% of the market but in this case you do not plan any systematic investigation. I do not therefore see how we can possibly understand this, if the logic of your energy policy is supposed to be fair, treating all forms of electricity production alike. I must therefore ask you to justify your position since, as far as I am concerned, and also many others, most especially the renewable energy industry, it is a position which is extremely difficult to comprehend. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very aware of environmental requirements, as I was even in the previous Commission, when I proposed the directive on the taxation of energy products, and I try to adopt the same approach in my activities within the Prodi Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I very clearly understand your concern, but permit me some observations. The proposed new framework for state aid to the environment is very flexible with regard to the granting of aid to renewable energies. It authorises aid of at least 40% of eligible costs in the case of investment, and for operational aid the Member States are entitled to adopt a system authorising aid up to 100% of eligible costs. I do not think, therefore, that you can accuse the Commission of banning aid to renewable energies.</p>
<p class="contents">There is some competition, again permit me the observation, not only between renewable energies as opposed to conventional energies, but also between the various forms of renewable energies. Aid to these forms of energy may, moreover, vary according to the Member States. Unregulated aid would therefore engender distortions of competition, which could have an adverse impact primarily on certain forms of renewable energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recognises that renewable energies may need support in order to be able to develop but, at the same time, it is also important for these forms of energy to adapt gradually to competitive markets in order to ensure their long-term development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, if you allow me, I have here a note in French.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> I should like to emphasise that the Commission does not rule out applying the rules of Community law on competition to public interventions in favour of nuclear electricity producers. In its illustrative nuclear programme according to Article 40 of the Euratom Treaty, in particular, the Commission very clearly indicated that “Developments towards the liberalisation of the Community internal electricity market will mean that nuclear energy will have to compete in the same framework and under the same conditions as all other energy sources.”</p>
<p class="contents">A full implementation of the internal market and a rigorous application of the relevant state aid and competition rules implies a level playing field for all energy sources. Once this principle has been established, it is up to the Commission to investigate on an individual basis any allegations according to which the nuclear sector is in receipt of subsidies engendering unfair competition. I may add that the services I am directly responsible for within the Commission are of the opinion that it is necessary to keep to a strict interpretation of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Competition rules are applicable to all electricity producers, including the nuclear sector, insofar as they do not depart from the terms of the Euratom Treaty. I consider this position to be all the more justifiable since the directive liberalising the internal electricity market does not stipulate any specific rule for nuclear producers and does not make any distinctions on the grounds of the source of the electricity produced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
