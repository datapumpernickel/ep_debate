<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Belder (EDD), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the nature and purpose of the instrument which is macro-financial assistance to third countries, are positive and useful. In respect of the policy impacts, it is worth noting that macro-financial assistance from the European Community contributes to economic reforms and structural changes in recipient countries. An instrument as worthwhile as this deserves a solid legal basis, therefore.</p>
<p class="contents">It does not currently have one, however. The current legal arrangement concerning the design, preparation conditions, implementation of decisions, monitoring, transparency and accountability of Community macro-financial assistance is inefficient and ineffective, as the procedure at Council level is very lengthy. The current arrangement is also ineffective in that disbursement of funds may take up to two years. Finally, a solid legal basis is lacking owing to the insistence of the Council on using Article 308.</p>
<p class="contents">Which legal basis constitutes the required solid legal basis? Article 181a would be the most logical option: economic, financial and technical cooperation with third countries. Here we have a difference of opinion with the Council, which does not like to see macro-financial assistance coming under 181a.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the Treaty of Nice will be replaced in due course by a new Treaty, which is currently being discussed in the Convention. Up to now, the development of Community macro-financial assistance has resembled budgetary support rather than balance of payments assistance, in terms of the modalities of preparation, implementation of decisions, monitoring of assistance, and accountability. Macro-financial assistance as granted by the European institutions under the terms of the Constitutional Treaty would fall under the provisions of Article 28 on economic, financial and technical cooperation measures intended to confront economic, financial or social crises.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Community macro-financial assistance should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. It is necessary, therefore, that the European Parliament have codecision powers. Draft Article 28 provides for codecision within a normal legislative procedure, and so I do not have any further comments to make on this. This opinion on the legal basis is widely held in the European Parliament. I hope that the Council and the Commission share this opinion, and therefore provide this good instrument with the corresponding legal basis. We can then reach common agreement, as institutions, on transparency, effective criteria and the implementation of these criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is important to recognise that a solution must be found to the current ad hoc arrangement for the period until the Member States ratify the new Constitutional Treaty. That is why the European Parliament considers it very important that the Commission submit a legislative proposal concerning the transitional period up to the ratification of the new Treaty. This would have to have a dual legal basis and would have to meet two criteria:</p>
<p class="contents">a) macro-financial assistance is to be considered as assistance to third countries confronted by a crisis originating in economic, financial or social situations;</p>
<p class="contents">b) decision-making procedure based on codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal will of course contain criteria for determining whether a country is eligible for aid. The Council's conclusions of 8 October 2002 on macro-financial assistance, the so-called Genval criteria, are useful and proper. They can serve as criteria in the forthcoming legal instrument if a number of modifications are observed; including the ‘exceptional character’ criterion, with regard to which the discontinuity clause should be retained. The ‘complementarity’ criterion invites three comments.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that an independent quantitative assessment should be undertaken by the Commission. Next, there should be careful coordination with other Community instruments as part of a political dialogue with the recipient country. Thirdly, macro-financial assistance shall be supplementary to the resources provided by the IMF and other multilateral institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not, of course, preclude the EU holding its own view. The ‘conditionality’ criterion is concerned with the interdependence of the recipient country's economy with that of the EU. In addition, measurable macro-economic criteria and reforms in the recipient country are crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">An indication that the European Parliament is serious about improving the instrument is the fact that Parliament will consider deferring approval of budgetary appropriations concerned with macro-financial assistance until a proper legislative proposal is submitted. We all hope, of course, that it does not come to the European Parliament withholding its aid to this instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I should like to thank my fellow Members, in particular, for their constructive cooperation. I should like the Council and the Commissioner to indicate whether we can agree on the above-mentioned approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will certainly give the Commission food for thought where macro-financial assistance to third countries is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">We share the view that Mr Belder has just expressed that we are currently suffering from a genuine lack of flexibility and from the fact that all aspects of the decision-making process in the field of macro-financial assistance to third countries are extremely cumbersome. He is right to stress that these cumbersome procedures and this lack of flexibility are due to there being no specific legal base or framework regulation setting out the criteria and conditions for granting macro-financial assistance to third countries and that this gap forces us to have recourse to Article 308 of the Treaty on a case-by-case basis. Clearly this is a serious disadvantage, even if in practice the instrument itself has proved – once the decisions have been taken – to be an effective tool for supporting adjustment and reform in those countries that have benefited from this macro-financial assistance: this is confirmed by the recent Court of Auditors report on macro-financial assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">On several occasions we have explored the possibility of putting in place a framework regulation, as the report suggests, which would define the conditions for granting macro-financial assistance and as it were put this instrument on the same footing as other instruments for providing financial assistance to third countries. Unfortunately, so far these attempts have failed because for this type of assistance – no doubt because it also implies having recourse to borrowing and lending – the vast majority of Member States wish to retain a decision-making process that requires unanimity on a case-by-case basis, which all sounds very familiar.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore shares Mr Belder's view on this issue of the legal base. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of the Council of Ministers, which, in this case, has the last word. That explains the current situation. We do not think, to be perfectly frank, that it will be possible to bring about any change in the situation before the conclusion of the Convention's work and the next intergovernmental conference. As far as voting by unanimity or by a qualified majority are concerned, our hopes are therefore in the hands of the Members of the Convention, once again.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, we will have to continue to manage this instrument, taking into account its inherent constraints, in as flexible a way as possible. To do so we will need Parliament's cooperation: sometimes we feel a little tempted to insist on this absolutely correct legal view and we do not wish this to be to the detriment of this instrument or to complicate it further when we have already said that it is too cumbersome. A difference of opinion over how this macro-financial assistance is decided on – which is certainly justified – should be no reason for us to deprive the partner countries of the benefit of this tool when they need our assistance and are striving to create stability and implement reforms. Its legal base is no good; it is too cumbersome and too complicated, but the aid reaches those for whom it is intended and we would not want these countries, bearing in mind the hopes that they put in the Union's ability to offer them this assistance, to be disappointed by these quarrels, which are admittedly justified, but which are so petty compared with their own hopes.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore counting on Parliament, in its wisdom, to share this difficulty that we both have to live with, of an instrument that can only evolve if majority voting replaces unanimity in the decision-making process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can all see that, instead of a uniform framework for budgetary aid, the EU has a variety of such frameworks. It is a question of macro-economic aid for the Balkans and Eastern Europe and of structural adjustment aid for non-Member States in the Mediterranean region. We are also concerned here with general financial aid to developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific region, as well as with the special aid to the Palestinian Authority and with the new regulation for EU cooperation with Asiatic and Latin American countries. </p>
<p class="contents">We in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy find it regrettable that, as was shown by the Court of Auditors in its special report for January 2002, it has not been possible even in the area of macro-economic aid to devise a clear and consistent formulation of the various contributions. </p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore venture to state that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy welcomes Mr Belder’s proposal that the Genval criteria be introduced, making it possible for the European Parliament and the national parliaments to exercise effective scrutiny of the forms of aid. This macro-economic aid must therefore only be given on an exceptional basis. It must fulfil necessary political pre-conditions and relate to countries in clear geographical proximity. It must supplement other funding, be subject to conditions and comply with the principle of financial discipline. </p>
<p class="contents">It is difficult to see any valid reason for retaining the present system of EU budgetary aid to non-member States, which is opaque and, in all likelihood, unnecessarily demanding in terms of resources. Reform is sought in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to say that no macro-economic aid should really ever be given by the EU and that such aid must never degenerate into a reward to the recipient country’s government for conducting bad economic policy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The guarantees allow countries in difficulties to acquire credit on the international markets more cheaply than they would at normal market rates. As the guarantee has meant that the EU has not suffered any losses owing to defaults in recent years, it shows the criteria for assistance have been working.</p>
<p class="contents">The forms of financial assistance provided under the Guarantee Fund have in recent years been macro-financial assistance and blanket loan guarantees given to the European Investment Bank. A ceiling is set for their use, the Guarantee Fund ceiling, which is provided for in the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets has been surprised to note that the Commission and the EIB did not take full advantage of the potential of the Guarantee Fund last year. The resources used were wasted and poor countries were not helped.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of this aid instrument could be added to the guarantee clauses with small technical amendments that will not in practice cause any problems for the Union’s budget. All the institutions are prepared to reduce the provisioning rate of credit from the present level of 9% to 8%. That way we could lower the amount that has to be covered by a corresponding Guarantee Fund transfer for each credit transaction. We could likewise reduce the blanket guarantee given for EIB loans from 65% to 50% of the amount of the loan. This measure would have the same impact on the use of the Guarantee Fund as reducing the provisioning rate. These changes would mean there would be more to distribute out of the same allocation of funds defined in terms of its ceiling. The Commission should promptly propose such measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McNally (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Belder, and indeed the European Commission, for producing the interesting 2001 report. Mr Belder has adopted a commendable analytical approach and is looking ahead, taking advantage of this particular moment in time when change looks more possible that it has hitherto.</p>
<p class="contents">The macro-financial assistance instrument – one of several – brings about reform efforts. It is associated with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank programmes. It is for exceptional crisis situations. The EU is not an international financial institution but at crisis times our foreign policy objectives can be linked with what we do with macro-financial assistance. It is conditional on the actions of the beneficiary countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2001 report is an interesting one. It looks at countries, mainly in the Balkans, but also Tajikstan, Georgia and Armenia. It looks in detail at why they have problems, what efforts are being made to solve them and where the problems are. In each country there are balance of payments difficulties, but quite encouraging growth figures in all three. I am pleased to see that analysis has taken place. I hope that the relevant parliamentary delegations will look at the analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Belder is absolutely right, however, to say that the programme is currently inefficient, ineffective and certainly lacks a solid legal base. We have heard from Commissioner Lamy that the moment is not quite right, given the attitude of the Council of Ministers, for changing the legal base, but I sense some optimism that post-Convention, in the next IGC, it may well be possible to move to a much more appropriate legal base with QMV and codecision by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime we hope that the Commission will bring about an in-depth evaluation of the criteria that it uses for the macro-financial assistance and we must do our part. This Parliament does not take seriously enough its monitoring duty. This is an area in which it is essential that we do so. In due course I look forward to legislative proposals from the Commission. Once again I thank the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today sees the start of the Public Prosecutor’s investigations. Five years in jail is the threatened penalty, and the scrutiny is rigorous, for the case has a basis in law. I am talking about Mannheim and the arena for World Cup football that is being built there. It appears that, two years ago, work was started on it illicitly, thus – or so those who have brought the case are arguing – putting field hamsters at risk. Although there is no evidence of any single field hamster having died, the machinery of a functioning state under the rule of law is in motion, in a way that you might describe as over the top. The Lord Mayor, against whom the case has been brought, fears for his political future.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking up Mr Belder’s interesting report, I do not have to quote all the things he lists in it. It mentions money, although none gets spent, and we can quite soberly describe this as inefficient, ineffective, and devoid of any solid legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">What is going on? This is a blatantly typical example of how this Europe of ours does not yet fit together. Reforms are urgently needed, or else how many more dentists, how many more Eurostats, are there going to be for the Commission to stumble over? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
