<p class="contents">Question No 2 by <span class="bold">Alexandros Alavanos </span>(H−0324/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: A fair trial for Öcalan</p>
<p class="contents">In their statements on the Öcalan affair, all the European Union institutions have been unanimous in calling for a fair, open trial, in line with the conception prevailing in the legal systems of modern, civilized societies. However, the Turkish Government has so far rejected, in both words and deeds (obstructing the defence counsel, refusing requests for observers to attend the trial, etc.), all attempts to bring about a fair and open trial. Can the Council therefore state what steps it intends to take to ensure that the Kurdish leader does not suffer mental or physical harm and is guaranteed the right to defence, to which any person facing judicial charges in civilised societies is entitled as a matter of course?</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to welcome the President‐in‐Office and ask him to reply to Mr Alavanos's question.</p>

The Council expects Turkey, like any other contracting party, to fully and entirely fulfil the obligations arising from the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Furthermore, the Council is assuming that Turkey will respect the right of any person facing judicial proceedings in Turkey, which therefore includes Mr Öcalan, to a fair trial and their right to defence, both of which are indeed also enshrined in the Turkish constitution. In its statement of 22 February 1999, the European Union took note of the Turkish Government"s assurances to that effect.</p>

All the Members here today have received an announcement from Amnesty International which states that Mr Öcalan"s lawyers, Nyadji Bulgan and Irfan Didar, and others, have been tortured, and were attacked inside the court. Following that they were rounded up outside the court and beaten by the police. And the President‐in‐Office is indulging in ‘<span class="italic">savoir vivre</span> " with Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask once again: are the European Union and indeed the German Presidency interested in human rights?

At the time of the incident you describe in your question, the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> had not yet been integrated into the framework of the European Union. Since it is a question here of relations between two Schengen partners, the admissibility of internal border controls comes under the Schengen implementing convention. Article 2(2) of that agreement provides that internal border controls can be carried out for a limited period purely for the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security. The state that orders these controls decides whether this may apply here. The entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty does not change this situation.</p>

Indeed we are already preparing a summit to be held in Finland in the autumn, which will be concerned with the further development of the People"s Europe.</p>

I would like to ask directly how the President‐in‐Office views the Danish early retirement benefit in relation to Regulation No 1408. Hitherto, the Danish early retirement benefit scheme has been kept out of the regulation, since it has been said not to be a social scheme, but an employment scheme.

<p class="contents">Under presidential decree 738/98 of 4 July 1998 on imports of humanitarian aid from abroad, since that date only legal entities whose charitable status is established by law are recognised as recipients of duty‐free imports of humanitarian aid, but not private individuals. Since then, packages of aid addressed to private individuals have been returned to the sender by the Ukrainian customs authorities, pursuant to Law 468/97 on the state regulation of imports of agricultural products into Ukraine. That law has been in force since 15 June 1998 and the presidency knows from own experience that this in fact also involves high costs for the senders of the packages.</p>
<p class="contents">In the framework of bilateral talks, the German Government as the presidency has on numerous occasions urged, in fact insistently urged the Ukrainian Government to change these rules for humanitarian reasons, but unfortunately Ukraine has not responded at all to these efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency will raise this matter in Brussels, at the second EU‐Ukraine Cooperation Committee scheduled for July, after coordinating with its partners, especially Finland, and will make it an official subject of discussion between the EU and Ukraine.</p>

It really is hard to understand why someone who provides aid on an individual basis should incur costs that are many times higher than the value of the aid itself.

<p class="contents">Question No 16 by <span class="bold">Hans Lindqvist </span>(H−0341/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Safe food</p>
<p class="contents">National campaigns on food safety and health are being conducted in all 15 Member States during the winter and spring. The original initiative was launched by the Commission's Directorate‐General for consumer policy, DG XXIV, which is also financing the campaign. The EU has made some SEK 1.3 million available for the campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Sweden have recently had to fight hard to avoid the EU practice of regularly using antibiotics as additives in animal feed.</p>
<p class="contents">Hitherto, Sweden has had strict rules on colouring in sweets, exacting standards of food quality control and stringent rules on crop spraying. Many EU rules are now forcing us to allow certain types of sweets despite their containing colouring that was previously banned in Sweden on public health grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">Does public health not always take priority? Should it not be the individual Member State's prerogative to decide what should be classified as safe or unsafe food?</p>
<p class="contents">I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Lindqvist's question.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" width="16"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="buttondocwin"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><a href="#top" title="Top"><img src="/doceo/data/img/navi_top.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0" alt="" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></table>

The Luxembourg European Council expressed this same concern in its statement on food safety. In that statement it stresses that the production and marketing of safe food must be one of the European Union"s priorities and that a high level of health protection must be ensured. As I just said in reply to your Spanish colleague"s question, it is up to the Commission to submit proposals to the Council for initiatives in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest let me say that if the Member States consider it necessary to maintain or introduce more stringent consumer protection measures than those that exist at Community level, they may do so pursuant to Article 129a of the EC Treaty – new Article 153 of the Amsterdam Treaty – provided such measures are compatible with the other provisions of this Treaty. If a Member State takes further‐reaching measures of this kind, it must notify the Commission thereof. There are no further restrictions.</p>

<p class="contents">A number of decisions have now been taken in the EU which run counter to our interests. For instance, Sweden has been forced to follow the rules that apply to the Belgian Blue and to allow the species to be developed and also sold in Sweden. We have been forced to accept certain colouring agents in sweets and candies and in food products which could induce cancer and allergies, especially in children. Furthermore, meat contaminated with salmonella is crossing the border into Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">The question I should like to put to the Council is this: should it not be obvious that every Member State should be entitled, in the interests of protecting people's health, to draw up rules which apply not just to home‐produced products but also to those which are imported? If it is a question of changing the provisions of the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties, then are we prepared to do that in order to reinforce our environmental safeguards?</p>

And I have already answered that question by pointing out that a Member State has the right to maintain or introduce more stringent consumer protection measures than those that exist at Community level. Naturally that includes measures such as those you mentioned. However, this must not create any barriers to trade or distortion of competition. Hence the rule that the Commission must be notified of any such measures so that it can examine that question.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to read out the relevant passage from the Amsterdam Treaty again. It is the fifth paragraph of Article 153, former Article 129a, and it reads: ‘Measures adopted pursuant to paragraph 4 shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures.

It is true that a Member State can make use of a safeguard clause. This gives it six months in which to produce scientific evidence in order to maintain the more stringent basis which it requires in its own country. It is stated that this must not be a technical barrier to trade. You actually said that yourself in your reply. If it cannot be proved that there are grounds for the more stringent rules, then it will be regarded as a technical barrier to trade, and it is now expressly stated in the new environmental guarantee that if it can be proved that the tougher rule which is being sought at national level is actually in the consumers' interests, then the EU must adopt the regime. It is therefore not possible to maintain stricter rules unless evidence can be produced that they are necessary. In fact, Commissioner Bangemann also said this yesterday when we were discussing baby food. In some countries, things have been permitted because it has not been proved that a very small amount of pesticides in baby food is harmful, whereas other countries do not tolerate any pesticide residues at all. But Mr Bangemann stated categorically that he would not accept trade barriers. There should be clear scientific evidence on the table so that the Member States can maintain stricter rules.</p>

At its meeting of 26 April 1999 the General Affairs Council emphasised that the European Union intends fully to respect the latest WTO ruling in the banana dispute and to amend the EU banana regime accordingly and without further ado. The Council therefore called on the Commission, in the light of further contacts with the USA and the other parties concerned, to submit proposals to amend the banana regime by the end of May 1999. Since we are not yet at the end of May, I am not in a position to tell you what form these proposals will take.</p>

On the one hand we want to protect the banana producers with whom we have very close links; on the other hand, however, we have to respect the WTO rules. This dispute has now been going on for years and at some point one has to admit losing a dispute. The European Union has lost. It did not manage to win through here. The costs are quite considerable in any case, if you think of the punitive tariffs that have been imposed. Yet I am inclined to say that it is some satisfaction that the WTO has now markedly reduced the level of the punitive tariffs the USA may impose against the European Union. We are now paying 191.4 million dollars instead of the 520 million dollars the USA had originally fixed by unilateral procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to wait for the Commission proposal to see how the Commission manages to reconcile the two requirements you mentioned: protection of the producer, especially the poorer producer, and conformity with the WTO rules. I really cannot predict that today.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 18 by <span class="bold">Anna Karamanou </span>(H−0345/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Rising death toll and appalling living conditions in Iraq</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Medical Association for the Prevention of War, Mrs Sue Wareham, recently claimed that between 4 500 and 6 000 children are dying every month in Iraq of hunger and disease owing to the terrible shortage of food and medicines. The doctors stress that most deaths are caused by infections of the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems which, under normal circumstances, would be completely curable. Food and medicines are officially exempt from the sanctions imposed on Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait but the bureaucratic structure of the procurement system and the country's limited earnings from the legal sale of oil restrict imports. At the same time, the regime is exploiting the distress of the population as a weapon to have sanctions lifted completely with no concessions on its part. In what way will the Council intervene to ensure the effective protection of human rights in Iraq, in particular in the light of the UN Security Council's debate on the lifting of economic sanctions?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mrs Karamanou, this is an extremely serious question and the Council is grateful to you for giving it an opportunity to address this issue in the European Parliament. The European Union is aware of the effects of the sanctions on the food situation and on health care in Iraq. The Council has for a long time been deeply concerned about the situation of the civilian population in Iraq and especially the children. That is why the Council has always supported the Security Council"s offer, which Iraq initially turned down, to permit the sale of oil in return for humanitarian imports. Ever since the ‘oil for food" programme was implemented in late 1996, the Member States of the European Union have chaired the Security Council"s committee on sanctions against Iraq and always sought the flexible application and continual improvement of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and its Member States are also playing their part in trying to improve the humanitarian situation in Iraq. But the crucial point of reference is and remains the ‘oil for food" programme. At the 55th meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva from 22 to 30 April this year the European Union took the initiative in drafting a resolution on the human rights situation; this calls <span class="italic">inter alia</span> on the Iraqi leadership to cooperate further in carrying out the ‘oil for food" programme and to ensure the fair distribution of the humanitarian imports.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union also continues to support any initiatives to further improve the operation of the ‘oil for food" programme and in this respect refers specifically to the proposals submitted by the UN Security Council panel on 30 March 1999 on the humanitarian situation in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">While most of the initial administrative difficulties of the ‘oil for food" programme have been ironed out, the main problem with the programme is now Iraq"s poor export capacity and the distribution of the medical aid. Iraq"s export capacity is now being improved under a sub‐programme of the ‘oil for food" programme, but it will not take full effect until spring 2000 because of the planning and delivery schedules; here, as you know, oil prices are a factor of uncertainty in both directions.</p>
<p class="contents">According to information from the United Nations, medical aid to the value of 275 million dollars is currently blocked in Iraqi warehouses although it is urgently needed by the population. Responsibility for this lies with the Iraqi Government. That illustrates the point made in Mrs Karamanou"s question that the Saddam Hussein regime is exploiting the distress of the population as a weapon to have sanctions lifted without fulfilling the cease‐fire requirements of Resolution 687 of 1991.</p>
<p class="contents">That means the Iraqi leadership is responsible for the inadequate implementation of the ‘oil for food" programme, just as it is responsible for the fact that the sanctions still cannot be lifted after running for over eight years. Let me remind you that in 1991 all the experts could and did assume that Iraq could have complied with Resolution 687 on a basis of full cooperation within the space of a few months. We are dealing here with a conflict between the humanitarian principle and the principle of national sovereignty, both of which are enshrined in the United Nations Charter, which restricts our means of action. But let me leave you in no doubt that we can only condemn the conduct of the Iraqi state leadership as utterly inhumane.</p>

<p class="contents">However, I think we need to accept that America must change its Middle East policy. I would like you to tell me, Mr President‐in‐Office, whether the Council considers that the achievement of political and military objectives can ignore the cost in terms of human lives.

Do you consider that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are not being violated? Six thousand innocent children are dying each month because of the embargo, and it is my conviction that no political objective can be placed above human lives.</p>

In the case of Iraq it is clear that the sanctions were imposed on the basis of UN Security Council decisions. These sanctions were imposed because Iraq did not fulfil the necessary obligations for ensuring the security and stability of the region. But the programme I have described was permitted and was set in motion to ensure that these sanctions do not have the effect you described. I have also described the particular efforts being made by the European Union to ensure that this programme is effective. If it is not effective in certain areas, particularly in the area of medical care, the responsibility lies entirely with the Iraqi Government which has acted out of what are truly contemptible and base motives. Let me repeat: the Iraqi leadership wants to exploit this situation in order that the sanctions, which have a quite different political purpose, may be lifted. We must call on Iraq to fulfil its responsibility towards its own people.</p>

It goes as follows. The election campaign raised considerable hope in Algeria and among its partners in the international community. By taking an active part in the election campaign, Algeria"s citizens showed the store they set by a free, open, pluralist poll, as promised by the Algerian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has noted the decision by six of the seven candidates to withdraw from the election and the reasons given by them for their decision. The European Union has supported and encouraged the democratisation process embarked upon in Algeria since 1995. The Union believes that it is by promoting democracy and the rule of law and by continuing with economic and social reforms that Algeria will be able to emerge from the crisis in which it has been embroiled for a number of years.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will attach the greatest importance to initiatives along these lines by the new President‐elect, Mr Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The European Union confirms its readiness to support the reform process in Algeria, particularly by way of Euro‐Mediterranean cooperation, and to continue the political dialogue entered into with the Algerian authorities.</p>

By saying regardless I mean that we must endeavour to support a process of democratisation in Algeria and after all the preconditions there for the democratisation process are better than in many other countries suffering from a democratic deficit. There are strong democratic forces in Algeria and there is also a very free press there, and one which indeed makes use of that freedom. We must also say that up to the time when the six candidates withdrew, the electoral campaign had actually suggested that Algeria was moving towards democracy. It was in fact the case that all the candidates could put forward their programme freely and without restraint and that the political debate in Algeria took place in the kind of constructive atmosphere not seen for a long time. We also took particular note of the fact that one of the key issues of this Algerian electoral campaign was national reconciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">So we now conclude that in spite of the problem of which we are both aware, the movement towards a civil society in Algeria that began in the 1990s has in fact been boosted by the electoral campaign. I therefore think that we should do all we can in the form of political dialogue and political contacts to give further support to that process. In particular that means keeping in contact with the democratic forces in Algeria and supporting these forces, for instance by inviting them to the Member States of the European Union and to the European Parliament. It is important to demonstrate international protection and international support for the democratic forces in Algeria.</p>

<p class="contents">In its answer to my question about the plans to appoint staff from the Schengen Secretariat, the Council stated that, under Article 7 of the Schengen Protocol annexed to the Amsterdam Treaty, it is obliged to take on the staff of the Schengen Secretariat since the Protocol has to be regarded as part of the Treaty and hence as part of primary Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Article 7 of the Schengen Protocol stipulates only that the Council must adopt the detailed arrangements for the integration of the Schengen Secretariat into the General Secretariat of the Council, i.e. the functions of the Schengen Secretariat and not necessarily its staff. To the extent that it is possible to envisage appointing existing Schengen Secretariat staff to the EU institutions, the provision in Article 7 of the Schengen Protocol in no way prevents the Council from appointing any staff interested in conformity with the existing rules of the Staff Regulations or from resorting to the alternative appointment procedure based on Article 24 of the Merger Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">This being so, can the Council explain why it in this case still considers it legitimate both to flout the current Staff Regulations and to ignore the Commission's right of initiative laid down in Article 24 of the Merger Treaty?</p>

On 1 May the Council took a decision laying down the details of the integration of the Schengen Secretariat into the General Secretariat on the basis of that Article 7. According to my information, this legal case will in fact very soon be brought before the European Court of Justice, which is why this is all I can say by way of an answer. I will not become involved in a legal debate because that is a matter reserved to the appropriate Community jurisdiction. This question is now purely a matter for the Court of Justice to decide.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me however repeat that the Council"s view is that the rules that have been adopted make every provision for guaranteeing the skills and competence of the individuals appointed. Given this situation and in view also of press reports that have also appeared today, let me point out that it is not the Secretary‐General of the Council who is responsible for the tensions we are currently seeing in the General Secretariat, but that the only reason for these tensions is a political decision by the Council that is covered by the Treaty. To hold the Secretary‐General responsible for that is, in my view, quite unfair and inappropriate in this situation.</p>

There is no reason for us now to be recruiting large numbers of staff without them having to sit the recruitment tests, so I have still had no answer to my question as to why the existing rules are being disregarded. As far as I can see, this all smacks more of what one might call national nepotism, in other words that there are a number of Member States that wish to have some staff placed somewhere in particular, and the other Member States are therefore nodding this through. Can the President‐in‐Office tell me what justification there is for us now suddenly to start recruiting more staff than the 58 people who were originally deemed necessary? It seems to me highly reprehensible that the Council is venturing to disregard the existing rules. Is it not the case, Mr President‐in‐Office, that there is a need to analyse the situation within the Council with a view to cleaning things up and clearly documenting what requirements – and what resources – there are for ensuring that we get more openness and more transparency with regard to what takes place within the Council, just as we are demanding within the Commission?</p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Fishing fraud in southern Europe</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Council aware of the Auditors' report criticising the Commission for failing to take adequate precautions to prevent fraud involving EU funds for modernising fishing vessels, most of which are located in southern Europe? Is it aware that funds were given to renovate vessels that had already sunk or which would never be put in service again and that verification visits were minimal? Will the Council now make a clear commitment that every effort will be made to recover or, if necessary, to impose severe penalties for proven embezzlement?</p>

The Council received the Court of Auditors" report on the formation of joint enterprises in the fisheries sector on 9 December 1998. The Council discussed the content of this report during the deliberations on the Commission proposal laying down detailed arrangements and conditions for Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector. This Commission proposal contains various provisions aimed at removing the abuses listed in the Court of Auditors" report on the management of joint enterprises. The presidency intends to take a final decision on this proposal at the Council of Fisheries Ministers in June, provided that Parliament has given its opinion by that date. Looking at the agenda, it would seem that Parliament will be discussing that proposal this week.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gallagher </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – I was deeply disappointed to learn from the Auditors' report that millions of pounds of taxpayers' money seem to have been siphoned off by boat owners in southern Europe. It appears that the Commission has failed to take the necessary precautions to prevent the alleged fraud. I understand that the missing funds were part of a EUR 280 million programme to modernise almost 200 fishing vessels. Grants were provided to refurbish and modernise boats which were expected to fish outside the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is alleged that grants were paid to renovate vessels which were already sunk – grants were paid to renovate vessels that had little chance of going into active service. Indeed I understand that a grant was paid in respect of a fishing vessel that was submerged in the Atlantic off the coast of Portugal. Vessels were sunk under mysterious circumstances and rather than use the wide brush approach it is suggested that these were in Italy, Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to raise this point with the Commissioner, while he is awaiting specific provisions to address the problems both at management and operational level. I presume I can accept that the presidency condemns such actions. I take no pleasure in raising this. All of us have to take some responsibility because if it is necessary to provide additional staff Parliament must approve additional monies. All of us are involved in this and if you require additional monies to overcome this problem then we must vote for them.</p>

<p class="contents">Will the Council outline its present policy with regard to the development of a fully integrated rural policy at EU level and will it give assurances that, as a part of such a policy, it will continue to support a new LEADER programme (III) and the retention of its name which is synonymous with empowerment and self‐help and a positive image of the European Union?

The reform of the Structural Funds, which includes the agreed reduction of the number of Objectives from six to three, will make it easier to achieve this aim. This has already been discussed in depth here today.</p>
<p class="contents">On that basis rural development policy can gradually establish itself as the second pillar of the common agricultural policy. In that context, the Leader Community initiative will be continued in the form of Leader III. Leader III aims to make rural development more dynamic overall by supporting the programme of innovative projects by local groups. Overlaps between Leader and measures under the rural development regulation will be prevented by the fact that the rural development regulation concerns national or regional support measures, but not local measures. Leader projects, by contrast, remain reserved to local action groups. Let me also point out that this question is a subject of the debate we have interrupted with Question Time.</p>

Will the President‐in‐Office take steps to ensure that it is not absorbed into national or regional statutory structures but is seen by those agencies as an important but independent development programme?</p>
<p class="contents">A very important part of my question concerns the continuity of LEADER. We are anxious to ensure that there will be no delay between the ending of the present LEADER II and the beginning of LEADER III. Otherwise a lot of very professional staff who have been recruited over the years will be lost to the programme. This would be a very serious mistake to make.</p>

UN Security Council Resolution 687 called on Iraq to cooperate with the International Committee of the Red Cross in order to release these prisoners of war. Iraq has persistently obstructed the work of the ICRC by withholding information, failing to attend meetings and preventing the ICRC from inspecting Iraqi prisons.

At the 55th meeting of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva from 22 March to 30 April 1999, the European Union submitted a draft resolution calling on Iraq to cooperate with the appropriate international organisations and to provide information on the whereabouts or fate of the remaining disappeared persons.</p>
<p class="contents">We called for compensation to be paid to the families of those who have died in Iraqi prisons or have disappeared. All Kuwaitis or other nationals who are still in prison must be released at once. Families must be notified of the whereabouts of prisoners. We also call on Iraq to provide information on death sentences carried out on prisoners of war or civilian prisoners, including the death certificates of prisoners of war or civilian prisoners who have died.

Is there any further pressure that the Council and the European Union would consider putting on the Iraqi authorities in an effort at least to get information as to how many of these people are alive, who they are, what is the state of their health, when they are going to be released and, indeed, how many have died.

<p class="contents">The TT news agency reported on 30 March 1999 that, in three cases out of four, Swedish representatives in the Council are compelled to negotiate in a foreign language during Council meetings. According to the report, interpretation in English, German and French is almost standard. To express oneself in a language other than one's mother tongue must be regarded as a distinct disadvantage in negotiations. Can the Council, therefore, confirm or deny these reports and say whether it will take measures to ensure that Swedish is treated in the same way as the major languages in the EU and that Swedish representatives are able to express themselves in Swedish and rely on being interpreted in the future?</p>

So we have not been able to look into the actual incidents in question.</p>

It is therefore extraordinary that the Council should not be more aware of a situation which has provoked quite an intense debate in Sweden. Indeed, I think one might have been better informed before coming here to answer questions.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, for one of the Member States it is a most important question. Suspicion is already rife that there are plans to do away with the minority languages altogether in the EU context. It would therefore be helpful if the Council could give a more positive assurance that, in its own work, it is not the case that it is systematically endeavouring to screen out the minority languages and taking advantage of the fact that some of the Swedish representatives are probably able to express themselves in another language.</p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Commissioner for equality</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with Articles 2, 3 137(1) and 141 of the Amsterdam Treaty, the EU is to take up equality between the sexes as an extremely serious issue. There are many, in fact, who say that this matter should be given top priority. In the light of these considerations, will the Council say how it envisages achieving an even distribution of the sexes among the future Commissioners and what its views are on appointing a Commissioner solely responsible for equality?</p>

But I am sorry to have to point out that the Member States are solely responsible for proposing the members of the European Commission pursuant to the provisions of the Treaties and that the distribution of tasks within the Commission is in fact an internal Commission matter. The Council has no part whatsoever to play in this connection, and I am not even saying: ‘unfortunately no part whatsoever". The Commission"s sovereign right to organise its own affairs is an important aspect of integration policy in the Union and we should not jeopardise it by prescribing to the Commission from the outside how it should organise itself.</p>

I am definitely not satisfied with the answer. In my view, after all the criticism which has been levelled at the lack of progress in promoting equality of opportunity between men and women, the Council should be more active in initiating discussions and ensuring that there are more than the three, or possibly four, women candidates currently rumoured to be in the running. It is a frightening thought, given that we are about to enter the new millennium, which everyone says should herald something genuinely new, that we are still being confronted with something old.</p>
<p class="contents">I also expected to hear whether there had been any discussion of what should now be done to give genuinely active encouragement to equality of opportunity following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, Article 13 of which covers all groups, including women, in terms of anti‐discrimination.</p>

Mr Verheugen, you may have noticed that on 23 March the European Parliament indicated its desire for a substantially greater proportion of women Members of the next Commission than there is at present. I would like to ask you this: will you in no way take responsibility for this? You are perfectly capable of promoting this aim in negotiations with the Member States. The Commission"s new President, Mr Prodi, has already discovered that we in the House are quite serious about this. Today, in a press conference, he stated he was giving this issue his attention.

It was meant to be anything but diplomatic. I wanted to make it clear that however noble and right a political concern may be, the Council cannot assume powers that it does not have. The same applies to the presidency. The situation is not what you think. The presidency does not have the power to negotiate with the Member States about who they send to Brussels as a member of the Commission. The President of the Commission whose appointment you confirmed today has that power, and that President of the Commission, who was also selected on the basis of whether he can effectively assert the rights that he has, is pursuing the aim to which you referred. The presidency also has great sympathy for that aim, but unfortunately there is nothing at all it can do about it. Since the office of presidency is filled by a country that can appoint two Commissioners, it can only ensure that the principle you called for is observed by its own country. But unfortunately I have no means of doing the same for Sweden because Sweden only appoints one Commissioner, which means it is rather difficult to apply the quota system in this case.</p>

Twice a year the Council examines whether the requirements set in that respect have been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">After its last examination on the basis of the conditions set on 9 November 1998, the Council decided that Croatia should continue to be granted autonomous trade preferences but that the conditions for assistance under the PHARE programme had not been met and that it was also too soon to negotiate a trade and cooperation agreement. Any improvement in relations, including possible future negotiations on a trade and cooperation agreement, will depend on whether Croatia makes further progress towards meeting the required conditions. At this moment I cannot foresee when the fulfilment of these conditions will next be checked.</p>
<p class="contents">In regard to your broader question about the general stability of the region, on 26/27 April 1999 the Council agreed to begin preparing a stability pact for south‐eastern Europe. The EU is vigorously pursuing this task. It is doing so in cooperation with the appropriate international organisations and regional initiatives and in particular with the states of that region, with the initial aim of holding a conference on the stability pact for south‐eastern Europe at senior official level; this will be convened by the presidency of the European Union in Bonn on 27 May 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">The stability pact will offer all the Balkan states a concrete prospect of stability and integration into the Euro‐Atlantic structures.

If my calculations are right, six months have elapsed since then but you said you could not foresee when the next six‐monthly check would take place. So I just wanted to ask: have I misunderstood something or has the timetable changed in some way? I also wanted to ask another question. Serious events have occurred since 9 November, namely the war in Kosovo, which after all has radically changed things. I do agree that Croatia must fulfil certain conditions – and indeed it has already fulfilled many of them, while there are others that it has not – but I see no reason to place Croatia in a worse contractual position than, for instance, Albania or Macedonia, which are also politically very unstable and problematic countries, while Croatia is after all an emerging democracy.

<p class="contents">Mr Crowley, in reply to your question, let me refer you to the Council"s common position as adopted on 14 April and forwarded to the European Parliament that same day. In it, the Council stated that it was against earmarking a minimum amount of 1 % of ESF resources for fairly small subsidies to non‐governmental organisations. The Council regarded the Commission proposal to that effect as too inflexible and replaced the 1 % by what it referred to as an appropriate amount. However, the Council intends to amend its common position and to provide for a possible 100 % cofinancing of these subsidies. That would create an incentive for using European Social Fund appropriations for subsidies to non‐governmental organisations.</p>

We are working exclusively from the experience which we already have from the peace and reconciliation programme in Northern Ireland, also from some of the environmental programmes which have been so successful where the NGOs have taken the lead and been given assistance from European Union funding. We are afraid that these monies will be denied to them in the future. Could we have a guarantee from the President‐in‐Office that, whilst they may not agree with the ringfencing of 1 %, they will give a definite commitment that there will be a percentage available when the new ESF operation comes into being?</p>

And you know that, because it would mean suspending the existing Council decision. I am quite prepared to put your arguments to the Council again and to reconsider them. But let me tell you that I do not agree with your assessment of the matter. I think the formula the Council has opted for tends to increase rather than reduce the possibilities of the funding you call for.</p>
