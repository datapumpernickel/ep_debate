<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Benita Ferrero-Waldner, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, Azerbaijan is one the European Union’s key partners in the Southern Caucasus region, principally due to its geostrategic location and energy resources. Last year we therefore proposed to the Council that Azerbaijan, together with Armenia and Georgia, be included in the European Neighbourhood Policy in order to further strengthen our relations, building on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in force since July 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been following the preparations for the parliamentary elections of 6 November 2005 with great attention and some concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The events last week, such a short time before the elections, are a source of further concern. Some Azeri Government ministers were dismissed by President Ilham Aliyev and subsequently arrested on charges ranging from corruption and embezzlement of state funds to an attempt to stage a coup d’état.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot make any judgement on these accusations, nor are we willing to interfere with the decisions to be taken by the Azerbaijani judiciary. However, we wish to point out that it will be crucial for Azerbaijan to carry out, in a very transparent way, fair and thorough investigations and, if necessary, a balanced trial in order to establish the truth.</p>
<p class="contents">The arrests are inevitably contributing to a worrying deterioration in the atmosphere of the electoral campaign. Unfortunately the campaign has already been marked by several episodes of violence and some specific incidents.</p>
<p class="contents">As a consequence of this climate, we have learnt of dozens of candidates who have withdrawn in the last hours. Access to State and public TV is no longer being granted to opposition parties, or it is subject to so many restrictions that it cannot be considered satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">In all the contacts the Commission has had recently with the Azeri authorities, we have strongly insisted on respect for fundamental freedoms, including, of course, freedom of expression and the possibility for political parties to hold public rallies without undue restrictions and to access mass media. We have also stressed several times, to opposition representatives as well, the need for such rights to be exercised in a moderate and peaceful way.</p>
<p class="contents">We fully concur with the assessment of the electoral campaign by the OSCE-ODIHR in the two interim reports published so far. It cannot be denied that some progress has been made compared with the parliamentary elections of 2000 and the presidential elections of 2003. More candidates than ever were registered; state authorities have proved cooperative with international observers; all parties have been granted some access to television.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we welcome the decision by the Azeri authorities to introduce systems such as finger-inking that could dramatically reduce the possibility of multiple voting, although this came very late.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst on the one hand commending Azerbaijan for this progress, we agree with OSCE-ODIHR that it might not be sufficient. The worrying deterioration in the climate of the electoral campaign over the last few days threatens to completely overshadow this limited progress.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to monitor the situation very closely throughout the electoral campaign, on the day of the election and in the aftermath on 6 November. In accordance with our well-established practice, we will not deploy a separate Election Observation Mission; as with the OSCE countries, support will be given to the OSCE office and the ODIHR office which will take on that task.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have stressed several times recently, these elections will be a litmus test for Azerbaijan and its aspirations to come closer to the European Union in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy. On the question of the Neighbourhood Policy, I can only say that we will start consulting on the action plans in the near future. We hope that we might be able to work out satisfactory action plans by next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation in Azerbaijan at the time was particularly serious, with allegations that the government was holding political prisoners and indeed that torture and ill-treatment in custody was common. This time I speak as the resolution’s co-author, as I am being sent to Baku by this Parliament as an official observer for the 6 November elections. But I also wear the hat of the European Parliament’s rapporteur for the European Neighbourhood Policy, which is now being extended to the three Caucasus republics.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome President Aliyev’s decree which, theoretically at least, orders state officials in the Central Electoral Commission to observe and implement free, fair and transparent elections. I also believe that the recent dismissal of the old guard hard-line ministers resistant to political change, like the former health minister Ali Insanov, suggests that the dominant pro-government YAP party finally realises that the time has come to manage the transition peacefully to multi-party democracy and bring Azerbaijan closer to European democratic practices.</p>
<p class="contents">The newly-elected parliament will no doubt be more mixed politically, with so many registered candidates to choose from, and will have new, younger and more independent technocratic MPs as well. The system of government is still heavily presidential, so the parliamentary election will be more of a test of willingness by the state to commit itself permanently to western-style democracy, rather than a real change in the exercise of power which will only come about in 2008 at the next presidential election.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there are still grounds for concern in terms of press freedom, balanced political access to the media, and the right of free assembly and protest. It is also true that Azerbaijan is still affected by the Nagorno-Karabakh unresolved frozen conflict which can only be resolved peacefully by dialogue through the Minsk Group.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret the huge rise in military expenditure in the region and threats of escalation and a fresh outbreak of hostilities. Azerbaijan will shortly enjoy a huge injection of funds, as oil – now at historically high prices – will flow from Baku via Tbilisi to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. It is important that this money be used to enrich the entire country fairly, and there must be transparency and a renewed commitment by the government to fight public corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I hope that the action plan negotiations with Azerbaijan will shortly be resumed, once the direct air links to Turkish-occupied Northern Cyprus are discontinued, as this matter is clearly of deep concern to the Republic of Cyprus as an EU Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">I, as the co-author for my political group, commend this resolution to the House. It will send a strong message to the Government of Azerbaijan about where this House stands and the European Parliament’s hopes in particular for that country’s democratic future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can indeed point to some advances, and they are deserving of mention and praise, but there has, recently, been a great deal of renewed nervousness, resulting in a number of measures that are not really compatible with free elections.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite crucial that we should observe elections not only on the day on which people go to the polls – where some of the measures to which you referred could indeed bring improvements – but also in the period leading up to it; we should observe the transparency of the processes, the degree to which access to the media is possible, and what scope there is for the opposition to develop and expand.</p>
<p class="contents">Our delegation’s cooperation with the parliament of Azerbaijan gave us the opportunity to discuss a variety of circumstances that gave us a great deal of food for thought. The country’s ambassador had a job to explain why opposition rallies kept on being cancelled or rescheduled or had to be held on the outskirts of Baku, which must surely have hindered the opposition in its attempts to present its programme and candidates during the run-up to the election.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, therefore, far from surprised to learn from what you said that a number of intending candidates had changed their minds because they felt that neither the campaign nor the elections were fair.</p>
<p class="contents">Azerbaijan will have to accept that it needs to make great advances towards democracy and transparency. There is no doubting that it has a difficult process of transformation ahead of it, but – the smouldering conflict over Nagorno Karabakh notwithstanding – these steps must be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Something that struck us during our visit to Azerbaijan – and it was something of which we had to take note – was that the fact that the country was living in times of great conflict was the standard reason given for the constant obstruction of measures intended to foster modernisation, transparency and democracy. We realise that it is in Azerbaijan’s interest that the conflict should be resolved, and we do of course hope that it can be, but it must not be allowed to prevent the government from modernising and further developing the country’s internal structures.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned media access; the media have great problems to contend with, not least as regards their own safety. The safety of critically-minded and free-thinking journalists cannot be guaranteed; one who comes to my mind is the late Elmar Huseynov, whose murder has still not yet been satisfactorily investigated. We would of course welcome a much more determined approach to such things on the part of Azerbaijan.</p>
<p class="contents">There is something else I should like to mention in this connection. Azerbaijan is now, thanks to the rapid increase in its oil revenues, in a position to raise a great deal more additional funds. We heard it said during the course of our visit that we can no longer, through our European Neighbourhood Policy, exert any real leverage, as the country is no longer dependent on European funds.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be obvious to Azerbaijan that its people’s own interests demand that social and economic progress be ensured, and that, if this is to be done, then much more investment will be needed, for which, in turn, more transparency, public access and democracy are prerequisites.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you are quite right in the things you say, and I would like to endorse them. We – by which I mean the Commission and this House – should, together, do everything possible to ensure that, in post-election Azerbaijan, the new parliament can put more important reforms into effect. It is in the interests of that country’s people that we should not stint in our efforts to that end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Violence and harassment are being meted out to opposition supporters, journalists and human rights activists. Prominent opposition leader Rasul Guliyev was allowed to register as a candidate, but the authorities then refused to let him return to Baku and had him arrested in Ukraine. I recently helped to free a member of his family. A British citizen and a constituent of mine, she was detained in Baku when customs officials claimed to ‘discover’ a gun – clearly planted – in her luggage. She suffered chronic ill health as a result of being detained and is now recovering.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a temptation for the West – Europe and the United States – to stress continuity and so-called stability. They have an eye on the oil, the new Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline having been opened last May by BP Chairman Lord Browne.</p>

There really is a need for a delegation from the Commission to follow our policies, in order to help Azerbaijan – because it is true that the situation there is not exactly great – and so that, in a few months’ time, we can put this country back on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, now more than ever, Azerbaijan is facing its destiny. That country must now show the international community that it can be regarded as a democracy, and that it can follow the rules. Azerbaijan must follow the path of a state under the rule of law. In joining the Council of Europe, Azerbaijan has not only turned towards Europe, but has signed up to its values of democracy and human rights, which bring us all together here.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the European Union and Azerbaijan, just like the two neighbouring countries in the Southern Caucasus, are truly forging a joint path, because they are taking part in the new Neighbourhood Policy. As such, they have new rights and obligations. The message that the European Parliament must send to our Azerbaijani friends is clear: if this country wants to become a true democracy, free and transparent elections are a milestone for this. These parliamentary elections, which will be held on 6 November, must take place transparently and according to the rules, with neither pressure nor repression.</p>
<p class="contents">During the pre-campaign phase and at the moment, however, we have seen an increase in police repression, which is unacceptable. The brutality, violence and intimidation observed against the opposition and their lack of access to the media are unacceptable. In our previous resolution, we called on the two sides, the government majority and the opposition, not to resort to violence, so that the electoral campaign could take place under the best possible conditions. We all had reason to be optimistic at that time, following the presidential decree last May organising these coming elections. We were also optimistic to see the number of candidates registering for the 125 constituencies; even dissidents were allowed to participate! Today, however, as you have said, we cannot fail to notice that, as the elections approach, tensions are mounting and the rules laid down are not being applied at all. By sending a delegation of MEPs to monitor the smooth running of the ballot, the European Parliament is showing its interest and its desire to support the ongoing democratic process in Azerbaijan.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we must call on all the parties contesting the election, particularly the majority in power, to demonstrate that this country is able to achieve its ambition: to hold free and transparent elections, in which every citizen, using his single ballot paper, can choose the candidates that will run the country in future. I would remind you – because this is very important, Madam President – that the challenges in Azerbaijan are immense: finding a resolution to the frozen conflict in Nagorny-Karabakh, the increasing power ...</p>

Even one hundred years ago, Azerbaijan was an incredibly rich country by reputation alone, although Baku was and continues to be one of the world’s leading centres of oil production. It is well known that the Azerbaijani people are extraordinarily poor, in spite of the country’s abundant natural resources. Hundreds of thousands of refugees driven from their homes during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict are still living in refugee camps in Azerbaijan. Furthermore, the state of democracy in the country is amply illustrated by the fact that I once heard a famous explorer call it a khanate. Nevertheless, the short-term goal must be democratic elections.</p>
<p class="contents">All of our deliberations on this issue must be guided primarily by the resolutions adopted by Parliament and the interparliamentary delegation since 1999. It should not be forgotten that the countries of the Caucasus are part of Europe. It is therefore crucial that relations with Azerbaijan be stepped up, and that this should take place on the basis of the EU’s fundamental democratic values. In particular, minimum standards should be applied in social and environmental matters. In the run-up to the democratic elections, it is of fundamental importance that the climate be conducive to opposition parties and politicians. Access to the media and the freedom of association are equally important, and the safeguarding of these rights must involve more than merely issuing the appropriate legal and regulatory standards. I find it somewhat surprising that recital L of the resolution refers to the talks on Nagorno-Karabakh, yet makes no mention of the presence of government representatives from Stepanakert.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by expressing my support for the motion for a resolution. I am well aware of how complex the situation is in the South Caucasus, and thus understand that it is far from easy to make progress in terms of democratic standards at a time when the threat of extremist attacks is ever-present. At the same time, however, basic principles and procedures must not be abandoned during electoral campaigns and elections to legislative bodies conducted in accordance with OSCE standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is quite striking in that connection is that the media in Baku are dominated by reports about spectacular dismissals and arrests of members of the government and top officials in the country’s oil industry. The official statements and indictments speak of conspiracy with the opposition against the lawful authorities and corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a very uplifting image to take to the ballot boxes. That is why I am very surprised that the joint draft resolution makes no reference whatever to these recent events. In this resolution, the opposition is being dismissed, for the sake of public opinion, as a party that is about to carry out a <span class="italic">coup d’état</span>, and, at the same time, President Ilham Aliyev can portray himself as the unimpeachable enforcer of law and order. No wonder I heard a key expert on Azerbaijan lamenting, last night, that ‘those parliamentary elections of 6 November are a waste of time and a waste of money!’</p>
<p class="contents">That will definitely not, though, put a stop to his commitment. He, too, will be travelling to Azerbaijan as an observer. The same can, this evening, be said of the European institutions, the Commission and this House. Any electoral improvement is welcome. Hence my appeal to the Commission and all international organisations involved, in fact, to urgently press for the meticulous registration of all voters (ink marking of the thumb, for example) by the Azerbaijani authorities. This is a precautionary measure that President Aliyev, in a speech before regional magistrates yesterday, said he would seriously consider. After all, there has, in the recent past, been no lack of cases of vote rigging, a truly national tradition that is taking on ever more refined forms in Azerbaijan these days.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to emphasise that the gagging and marginalising of the democratic opposition in Azerbaijan can, in time, have serious political consequences, not only at national level, but just as much at regional level. Repressive, authoritarian rule by the regime in power spawns a process of political polarisation and radicalisation among the forces opposing it, which will express themselves in increasing anti-western attitudes. I would warn the Commission not to underestimate this development.</p>
<p class="contents">This radicalisation will manifest itself just as much in growing Islamic aspirations. This, for example, is evident from an opinion poll held during the winter of 2004-2005, in which 23.2% were in support of the idea of an Islamic state, and another 28.9% welcomed the partial introduction of Islamic <span class="italic">sharia</span> law – a vague sign, certainly when set alongside the stricter Islamic regime currently in power in Teheran.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to tell the Commission that the wealth of Azerbaijan’s energy resources, or fine talk about such things as democratisation and (geo)political stability, should not temporarily blind us to what Azerbaijan and its people fundamentally lack – the democratic rule of law. I would urge you and the Council to be clear and forthright in calling the leaders in Baku to account on this matter – never mind the domestic electoral battle – certainly when such heavy charges as planning a <span class="italic">coup d’état</span> and embezzling public funds are brought against prominent citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, we should, most of all, guard against the murky power game that President Aliyev and his evidently changing <span class="italic">entourage</span> are playing today. That game is about the greedy division among themselves of the richly flowing oil funds and about playing senior party members and reformists off against one other. European aloofness and a word of caution are really called for here, for the benefit of Azerbaijan’s society.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems that the representatives of the government apparatus state one thing and do another.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the endeavours made so far by the South Caucasian delegation of the European Parliament, the public law dignitaries, Parliament and the government of Azerbaijan have a strange way of interpreting democracy, the rule of law, state and human rights. The Head of State and his entourage are ruling autocratically. As mentioned by the Commissioner, we must note that last week President Aliyev dismissed several highest-ranking government officials or ordered their arrest and detention on remand on charges of attempting to stage a <span class="italic">coup d’état</span>. Subsequently, at the peak of the campaign, several dozen opposition and civil rights activists were arrested. All the signs point to the fact that the authority intends to defend its autocracy using its power, and tries to thwart the mass meetings of the opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">As Azerbaijan is part of the EU Neighbourhood Policy, it is in our interest to see a fundamental change in the current situation, and the upcoming elections constitute the best opportunity for change. The European Parliament is interested in the establishment of a multi-party legislation process, ensuring equal opportunities for the opposition. I believe that the proposal we have tabled is extremely important. In this proposal, the European Parliament declares that international public opinion only accepts clean, free elections with equal opportunities. This is not just a warning from the European Parliament to Azerbaijan, but also an important message to the entire South Caucasian region. And Baku can prove itself on 6 November. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was able to see this for myself during a recent visit to the country, both from conversations with ordinary people on the street and during talks with political actors. This was one of the reasons why I welcomed the European Council’s decision of June last year to include Azerbaijan, together with Armenia and Georgia, in the European Neighbourhood Policy. It is my belief that this policy provides an appropriate framework for the development of mutual and multilateral relations, and for the fulfilment of both Europe’s and Azerbaijan’s ambitions.</p>
<p class="contents">If this mutual partnership is to develop and become stronger, certain common values must also be shared, such as respect for human rights, civil liberties, democracy and the rule of law. Elections are an important measure of respect for these values in any country. I should therefore like to take this opportunity to call on the Azerbaijani authorities to comply with basic electoral principles during the forthcoming parliamentary elections. These principles include the freedom of association and the freedom of speech, both for government and opposition candidates. The authorities must also ensure that the elections are conducted in a calm and peaceful atmosphere.</p>
<p class="contents">As previous speakers have already mentioned, we are receiving mixed signals in the run-up to these elections. On the one hand, it is apparent that some progress has been made since the last elections; there are more candidates in general, for example, and also more from independent opposition parties. On the other hand, however, repressive measures are still being imposed, and the opposition still suffers oppression. It is my belief that the way in which these elections are conducted will also have an impact on our future actions. By this I mean that if we are able to ascertain that certain procedures are followed during these elections – and I myself will be a member of the observation mission – then this will have a positive impact on our work on the proposed Action Plan. If we are left with an overwhelmingly negative impression, then this will have a corresponding effect on our work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A good indication of the extent to which this freedom has been achieved is the level of freedom enjoyed by the media.</p>
<p class="contents">Azerbaijan became a member of the Council of Europe four years ago. At the time, it undertook to guarantee freedom of speech, the independence of the media and the work of journalists. We are well aware of such matters, but there is an ongoing need to inform and remind the people of Azerbaijan about the importance of the role played by the media. We must also remind them about the importance of free and equal access to the media for all citizens and political forces, particularly during electoral campaigns. This includes the campaign conducted in the run-up to the forthcoming November elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact of the matter is that one of the country’s best-known journalists, Elmar Huseynov, has been murdered. No one took any action to prevent this murder, even though his wife had reported that he was being followed by unknown individuals and many of his friends claimed that he had expected to be murdered. After the event, President Aliyev announced that it was a serious provocation against the state, and accused the perpetrators of damaging Azerbaijan’s good reputation. The government even asked other countries for help, but the investigation has yielded no results to date. Instead, it has resulted in much speculation. The most widely-read newspapers are still controlled by the government, and the opposition press is only read by a minority. The newspaper <span class="italic">Monitor</span> was discontinued after Huseynov’s death, and although his successor has launched a new publication, <span class="italic">Real Azerbaijan</span>, he almost immediately came up against enormous problems publishing it. At present, the publication has a circulation of only 3 000.</p>
<p class="contents">The editor-in-chief of the newspaper <span class="italic">Yeni Musavat</span>, who is also a member of parliament and head of the Musavat party, is one of the opposition leaders who were imprisoned in October 2003. Although he has now been pardoned by the President, his editorial team had to stop work due to the enormous pressure exerted by the ruling parties and the excessive fines imposed by the courts. This is the situation in which the opposition press finds itself in Azerbaijan today, both in general and in the run-up to elections. Even though state television was privatised several months ago, the main stations still operate in virtually the same way, by which I mean that they exclude the opposition. Even though new television stations that are in the pipeline are intended to target a wider cross-section of society, there is virtually no chance of them doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, there is a chance that free media may one day operate in Azerbaijan. It is too late, however, to establish a genuinely diverse media landscape before the November elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first is that we share the same concerns about this election process. We have seen that the freedom of the press and freedom of expression are sometimes violated and we must follow this whole process very carefully. However, I can say that the European Neighbourhood Action Plan – which is not yet ready as we have only just begun negotiations – will provide an opportunity to promote democratic reform. It will also enable us to make many of our offers conditional upon further democratic reforms and respect for the rule of law. I agree, however, that with the new oil possibilities, it will not be as easy as we previously thought, because there will be more wealth in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I recently held talks with the three countries of the Caucasus in New York during the Millennium Summit and the Ministerial Week. We also discussed the question of these flights. We hope that there will be a change. The situation is very clear and I was very adamant. We are now waiting for a high-level troika to come back to see how we can start these negotiations on the action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">On Nagorno-Karabakh, we are ready to deploy a rehabilitation programme once a settlement is reached on the peace plan. It seems – and this is what I heard when I spoke to the two ministers – that there are some positive developments. I hope that this will happen after the Azeri elections, on the one hand, and the Armenian referendum, on the other. It is a very complicated question. I myself have often witnessed positive developments, for instance in 2000, when I was chairperson of the OECD. In the end, a stalemate was reached once again. However, there are possibilities and we would like to explore them.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say that we currently have a fully-fledged delegation in Georgia, and a regionalised delegation covering Armenia, while we intend to open a fully-fledged delegation to Azerbaijan in 2007. We wanted to open a regionalised delegation but the Azeris refused. They only wanted one of their own. It is also a financial question regarding funding for the external service. I hope we will get some funding under heading 4.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on radical Islamism, our message to President Aliyev was also very clear. We said that he would really be opening the way for radical Islamism if he did not allow the political opposition any breathing space. I gather from this debate that we all agree on that. I hope that the Azeris will hear our message. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason the EU has welcomed Azerbaijan as a partner in the European Neighbourhood Policy and is following with interest the development of its internal politics. The upcoming elections are a key moment in the history of Azerbaijan, which will demonstrate the direction in the country wishes to move, and its willingness to follow in the footsteps of other ex-Soviet republics towards greater democratic participation, transparency and freedom of expression.</p>
<p class="contents">On the eve of such an event, a certain nervousness is understandable. I do not, however, consider the attitude the present government has shown up to now to be justifiable. It seems deliberately to be creating a climate of fear, which is degenerating into violence and unlawful interference in the process of the electoral campaign, as attested to by the withdrawal of various candidates from the list.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the decision to use ink to reduce the risk of fraud came late and after too many objections, something that can only cast a bad light over the goodwill of the government to proceed in a clear and transparent way. The future attitude of the EU, and our receptiveness towards an increasingly fruitful partnership, will depend on how this last electoral week, and above all on how the voting itself, unfold. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
