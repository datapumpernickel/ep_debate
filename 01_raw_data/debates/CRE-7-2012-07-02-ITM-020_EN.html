We have now prepared a report in Parliament with which we will be providing the Commission with a few ideas for the blueprint for European water legislation that it is due to table in the autumn. Clearly, there are a number of factors that have an influence on water management, to wit, climate change, population growth, urbanisation, land use and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">We have achieved something here in Europe, especially in 2000 with the major work that is the Water Framework Directive, which provides a solid framework for tackling the problems with our waters. Interesting in this regard, in particular, is the integrative approach that results from the Water Framework Directive. It works in river basin districts – national borders are irrelevant. It also sets sustainability targets: by 2015, all European waters are to achieve ‘good’ ecological and chemical status.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, we have a number of gaps in the implementation, as we have unfortunately now observed. Although 24 Member States have submitted 119 river basin management plans, 4 have submitted none at all. Some Member States, unfortunately, have not achieved ‘good’ status, including Sweden, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, and the groundwater figures are not good enough for many a Member State, including Belgium, France, the United Kingdom and Slovakia.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we also observe that not all the data that we need for evaluation are available. The chemical status of 42% of European waters is unknown. We also have little in the way of comparable data, in particular, when it comes to water shortage and drought. You will be aware that climate change has a heavy influence on water management. Despite this, our models, in particular when it comes to water management, are very inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">We would point out that there are major deficiencies in terms of efficiency, especially in the case of the large-scale water consumers, which means industry, agriculture and energy generation. We should set clear goals in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">One approach to tackling these challenges is definitely the regional dimension, which I believe needs to be strengthened. Europe only uses a total of around 13% of its water reserves, but with an extreme geographical distribution. Eight Member States suffer from water stress – that covers a total of 46% of the European population. My Member State, for example, uses only 3% of its water resources, which means that there cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution, as the problems vary in different places.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to promote mainstreaming, in other words, that the large-scale water consumers and the policy areas that have an influence on water legislation, such as agricultural policy and regional policy, increasingly also begin to think in terms of water-related areas. We have had some success in this regard – by way of example, we have already spent EUR 14 billion on wastewater treatment within regional policy and we have also connected an additional 12% of the population to the public wastewater system. There are still large amounts of money in this field – let us consider Romania and Bulgaria – that have actually not been spent. The Commission needs to intervene to a greater extent in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of agricultural policy, too, however – which is to be characterised in the forthcoming period by a ‘greening’ – there needs to be a greater influence of this blueing factor, in other words, giving consideration to the water impact of measures. I find it particularly important that the water sector also has a major importance economically, too, and Europe has something to offer in this regard; growth rates of 5%, as compared with 2.5% in the rest of the economy, have already been identified here. Europe has much to offer in this area, and I really hope that the Commission takes account of the water sector in its new research programme, Horizon 2020, as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Janez Potočnik, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, I wish firstly to thank Mr Seeber, as well as all the honourable Members who participated in the development of this comprehensive report. This initiative is very timely as we are currently in the process of assessing possible options for our blueprint to safeguard Europe’s water resources, which we plan to adopt in November.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report recognises, water policy is well developed and comprises very good legislation, such as the Water Framework Directive, that can protect our water resources if adequately implemented. Indeed, implementation will be an important focus of the blueprint, as we will try to put in place additional tools to make improvements on the ground. In this respect, I am pleased to see that our ideas converge, as the report focuses on issues such as the importance of water accounts, ecosystem services and minimum water flow for environment, water pricing and cost recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">While these aspects are, to various extents, covered by our legislation, the results of our assessment of Member States’ river basin management plans show that they are insufficiently addressed. The blueprint will propose ways of reaching a common understanding with stakeholders and Member States so as to integrate these concepts better in the implementation of the Water Framework Directive. Implementation of the blueprint’s proposals will be supported by the Innovation Partnership on Water, recognised in your report as a tool to help deliver win-win solutions for the environment and the economy: creating green jobs while finding innovative solutions to our water challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to implementation, your report acknowledges integration as another major focus of action to be covered by the blueprint. In this regard, the blueprint’s capacity to deliver on agriculture and cohesion policy depends very much on the agreement that Parliament will reach with the Council on the multiannual financial framework. The Commission proposals have good potential for improving water efficiency and irrigation, increasing water metering, and promoting reliance on green infrastructures, such as flood plains, and wetland restoration or buffer-strip protection along riverbanks.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal on the common agricultural policy also clearly envisages the addition of the Water Framework Directive to cross-compliance. The blueprint can translate the green potential of the Commission proposals into concrete possibilities, but this will only happen if you and the Council lend your support to the essence of the ideas that we have put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Another major theme of your report that I would like to cover relates to addressing gaps in water policy. Our assessments show that there are limited but important gaps that we need to fill. The two most important concern water re-use for agriculture and industrial uses, and water efficiency in buildings. The blueprint will propose ways forward, such as examining EU standards to facilitate the take-up of water reuse and the efficiency of appliances in buildings. Any future proposal on this will, as usual, have to be subject to a thorough impact assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to see that you have identified the same gaps, as well as the necessity to improve our water infrastructure and reduce leakage. The blueprint will also address this, for instance, by highlighting ways to remain within sustainable leakage level, and to finance water infrastructure through the cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to global aspects, the blueprint will focus on ways of delivering on our Rio+20 commitments, in particular, in relation to the water-related Millennium Development Goals and to a human right to drinking water and sanitation. Of course we look forward to engaging with Parliament in the follow-up work to the 2012 water blueprint. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Some of these problems which are highlighted in the opinion, which was approved unanimously, are the uneven application of the framework directive, the adequacy of water resources, sources of water pollution, inconsistencies with other European policies and public participation at all stages of the procedure, as provided for in the framework directive, both to identify problems and to find appropriate solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The opinion focuses, in particular, on the elimination of dangerous toxic and radioactive waste discharged into water and into landfills, which have a major impact on the environment and public health.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what I consider the nexus is that water should not be a source of profit; on the contrary, measures must be taken to ensure that it is public property and that water and water infrastructures are managed without any need to market rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to ring the alarm bell regarding future developments. The troika is putting pressure on Greece and Portugal to privatise their water companies. We know from the past that, wherever this has been done, prices have gone up, the quality of water has not improved, court judgments have been handed down and they have been renationalised.</p>
<p class="contents">In Greece, unfortunately, on the eve of elections, the serving government referred the Athens and Thessaloniki water companies to the Privatisation Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we need to immediately recognise the right to water as a human right for everyone and the European Parliament needs to oppose market plans to privatise water. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I recently read that a study had returned the result that there are a few places in Europe where the tap water was of higher quality than bottled still water. I think there is something in that, too. We should also take our share of credit for this, as we have had a considerable influence on this through our legislation, through the Water Framework Directive in 2000 and through numerous subsequent laws covering water. In that way, we have ensured that water does not endanger people’s health, while at the same time making sure that industry can continue to develop, as water is necessary for everything.</p>
<p class="contents">The crux of the issue is probably the fact that the Member States have implemented these rules in very different ways. The Commission needs to play a much stronger role here to ensure that certain aspects do get implemented more quickly. I will cite just one example, although there are many that could be mentioned, and that is that the drinking water in Brussels most likely does not meet the fundamental requirements that we have laid down. This is a case, then, where perhaps much stronger intervention is called for.</p>
<p class="contents">The next tasks at hand consist of us investing very heavily in research. The next framework programme for research should once again shed light on whether we could not play a part in water extraction, improved efficiency in water production and water use – the last of these being the crucial point in my opinion. I have to tell you though, Commissioner, that you will not achieve that by prescribing shower heads. We should drop that idea again quickly. Only 10% of water is consumed domestically. Let us desist from bossing the citizens around. Let us instead make it clear to them that it is important to save water, to use it efficiently. We will achieve more in that way than by regulating shower heads. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem of water shortages and droughts is nothing new, but it has got worse. In the last 30 years, the number of areas and people affected has risen by almost 20%. The total cost of droughts over the last 30 years is around EUR 100 billion. In 2003 alone, drought affected more than 10 million people and one third of EU territory, costing the European economy EUR 8.7 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Water shortages no longer just affect the countries of southern Europe and the trend is towards the situation being made worse by climate change, threatening important sectors of the economy, such as the energy and farming sectors. It is estimated that climate change will have a negative impact on precipitation levels and water cycles, with very significant effects on the quantity and quality of water. For example, in my country, Portugal, around 70% of the land was suffering severe drought at the end of February. The proposal of creating a European Drought Observatory therefore makes perfect sense.</p>
<p class="contents">European policy should thus focus on savings and efficiency. We need to reuse and recycle waste water. Water is a public good that is scarce, not a commodity. We must all contribute to its being a resource that is preserved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, I am not sure whether it is a coincidence, but today my <span class="italic">alma mater</span>, Leiden University, released the results of a major study into water quality in the Netherlands that has been going on for years. The conclusions are very clear. The first is that, up to 2001, there were major improvements in the water quality in the Netherlands. One measure alone, namely, the decision to ban the application of pesticides within 1.5 metres of the edges of water bodies, has improved surface water quality by 70%. Let me say that again: a 70% improvement from a single measure!</p>
<p class="contents">The other conclusion, however, is that, since 2001, the water quality has ceased to improve, despite the fact that the same study indicates that it would actually still be relatively simple to make improvements. With limited interventions, the water could be made 45% cleaner. That tells us everything about the connecting thread with Mr Seeber’s report, which is implementation. Implementation is the key to better water quality. That is rightly where we are placing the emphasis.</p>
<p class="contents">Better integration is also a focus, however. Commissioner Potočnik has put it back on the agenda. Agriculture and industry use 90% of the water. There is still a great deal of scope for improvement there. More efficient use of water, let us not forget, also falls within the Road map to a resource-efficient Europe, which is a not insignificant point. We could use 40% less water than at present quite easily.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the fourth element that I want to highlight is the importance of ecosystem services. The ecosystems are crucial to European water quality, so let us continue to invest in them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, last week, we also stressed the importance of access to water at the big conference in Rio. I hope and believe that Mr Potočnik will carry on in that vein and I look forward to the ‘blueprint’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report provides a clear overview of the issues surrounding implementation of water legislation, in particular, and also gives a very good insight into possible solutions, especially in terms of more widely applicable, cohesive policies for this vital resource and its preservation.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the report’s positive elements, and one that we must address as a matter of urgency, is its reaffirmation that water is a shared resource of humankind and that an integrated approach is needed. It also emphasises the duty of moderation of all sectors and all users in every EU country in their use of water, and calls once again for an objective assessment and urgent review – and perhaps even the phasing out – of all public subsidies and funding that are harmful to the preservation of water quality.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret the fact that the report does not place enough emphasis on the urgency of reducing urban, industrial and agricultural diffuse pollution by all possible means. We still need to make a greater commitment to protecting aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity, through regulatory oversight of our soils, among other things, so that eventually, we will achieve ‘good status’ throughout the European Union, as unfortunately, this will not be achieved by 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tools that we must develop and harmonise, but above all, we have objectives that we must meet without delay. All we need to do now is to put them into practice. We are counting on the European Commission to make sure this happens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On one side, are the advocates of the water industry; those who ignore or misrepresent the UN General Assembly resolution that acknowledged the right to drinking water and sanitation as a human right. Whilst saying they defend the right of access to water, they are blazing a trail for the interests of the transnational water cartel, whose greed inevitably clashes with genuinely guaranteeing Europeans the right to water and sanitation of which many of them are deprived. They are the ones who insist on seeing water as a marketable good, for which very reason they subject it to the rules of the internal market, thereby even contradicting previous resolutions of this Parliament. They are the ones who have been promoting, in Europe and across the world, the privatisation of water and water services, with disastrous consequences of inequality and exclusion, with brutal price hikes at the same time as the profits of the sector’s companies are increasing, and with drops in service quality even leading to water being cut off.</p>
<p class="contents">It is that for which European Union legislation has been paving the way, and this report is part of the process.</p>
<p class="contents">The other side of this debate has those who consider water a common good of mankind; a public good, essential to life, that should not, for that very reason, be a source of commercial profit. They are the ones who believe market rules cannot be applied to water or water services and who, for that very reason, advocate excluding water from the internal market. They are the ones who fought for the adoption of the UN resolution and struggle for compliance therewith, so as to ensure drinking water and sanitation for all, without exceptions, as a human right essential to living life to its full potential and to all other human rights. They are the ones struggling for public ownership and management of this precious public resource.</p>

The use – at times unnecessary – of this resource has led to a further potential loss of approximately 40% of the amount available. Today, almost 2 billion people do not have access to safe drinking water, and a good 20 million children die each year because of this lack of access.</p>
<p class="contents">Quality of water is fundamental in places where protecting citizens’ health must be a priority. In Europe, there are still vast areas where this quality is seriously undermined by industrial and agricultural pollution. We can no longer tolerate the fact that many cities discharge wastewater into the environment without purifying it in any way. The 27 Member States need to make a combined effort so that we use water rationally, particularly water intended for humans. It is vital to identify and reclaim areas polluted by industrial sites and by hazardous waste landfills that are illegal or no longer safe.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time of economic crisis in which resources are precious, we need to invest to safeguard an asset that is in danger of becoming increasingly precious by developing transparent pricing schemes and applying the ‘polluter pays’ principle. I will end by stressing that drinking water can only be public, and must be protected from speculation of all kinds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report itself explains that this is a global issue that must be addressed locally, or we might say regionally. I, for one, would like to draw attention to a region that is very important in respect of water management, namely, the Carpathian Basin with its organic water management system that was formed over centuries and would be perfectly capable of meeting current European challenges. This form of water management in the Carpathian Basin was unfortunately ended by the peace dictates of the Treaty of Trianon; now, in the European Union, there would perhaps be a chance to once again rationalise and revive the basin’s water management system. After all, Hungary is an important catchment area to which its rivers transport approximately 114 cubic kilometres of water; however, we are not always able to optimally guarantee the quality of the water that enters the country from Slovakia, Romania, Ukraine or Austria, and this is not due to reasons on Hungary’s part. I therefore ask both the European Commission and the European Parliament to keep a watchful eye on Hungary and aid us in this endeavour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This resolution is important since it forms part of a legislative process begun in 2000 with the Water Framework Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">That directive set the EU Member States the ambitious objective of achieving an optimum ecological and chemical status of the water in all of Europe’s bodies of water by 2015. Today, we know that owing to both longstanding and emerging challenges, not all Member States will achieve the objective set by the EU. The Commission, in the meantime, has rightly launched several assessments to enable it to develop a ‘blueprint to safeguard Europe’s water resources’, to be published by the end of the year. The blueprint is a positive inclusion in the EU’s wider programme to attain the Europe 2020 objectives and the longer-term objectives up to 2050.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we are considering today represents Parliament’s informed and important contribution to the blueprint to safeguard Europe’s water resources. The report precisely identifies shortcomings, inadequacies and delays and suggests adopting necessary and urgent measures in order to protect citizens’ universal right to have good, sufficient water.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw Parliament’s attention to the need for the EU to take effective action on losses and leaks of drinking water in urban networks, caused by their age. The percentage of leaks and losses naturally varies from one Member State to another, but overall it is very high. Purification of wastewater also requires urgent action since, in many cases, purification is totally lacking and insufficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must be good-quality water, and this requires investment, mainly from public sources and from joint private and public ventures. Another need is for water resources in the Union and neighbouring countries to be managed sustainably. Firstly, therefore, the Union’s scientific policy should take greater account of the challenges of environmentally friendly and efficient water management in relation to the needs of agriculture, industry and the public.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, privatisation of the public supply of drinking water must not give rise to a monopoly owner if this would not be in the interests of consumers, and it must not mean the full commercialisation of these services, which, by their very nature – because it is not possible to change supplier – must be treated as public.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in view of the noticeable and growing increase of the risk of flooding in Member States in recent years as a result of climate change, comprehensive analysis is needed of possible ways to prevent flooding and its effects.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the growing demand for water, on the one hand, and the steppification and even desertification of some regions of the Union mean there is an urgent need for hydrotechnical investment, particularly in the Danube and Vistula basins. The Vistula Programme, which was scrapped some years ago, should be reinstated.</p>

However, these are the only positive points. If we look at how these issues have developed, it seems to me that we are missing the main point of this issue; in other words, the democratic aspect and the question of public involvement that this issue is raising in many European countries. Take, also, the response of local authorities: under this pressure, many more of them are returning to managing water through public corporations.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by my friend and colleague, Mr Chountis, does not seem to have been taken into consideration.

According to the Water Framework Directive, after all, industry, hydropower plants and farmers, too, must have their water consumption examined. Given that fruit and vegetables thrive better in the sunny south than in the rainy north, discussing indirectly imported water in conjunction with the proposals makes little sense.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences of legislating into being a rigorous water saving policy also need to be thought through, as such a policy would result not only in drainpipes getting blocked up and decaying, but also in the spread of microbes in the water pipes.

Anyone who wants to achieve a target needs to set checkpoints, monitor and change course or press the accelerator where necessary. We have achieved a great deal, but there remains a great deal to do. The Member States are under obligation to transpose the Water Framework Directive and related directives.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur for the Groundwater Directive, I will once again bring longevity into the discussion. A harmful substance needs at least 20 years until it reaches the groundwater. However, it takes at least 30 years to bring about improvements again and, in many cases, damage can no longer be repaired. That is why the precautionary principle is fundamental when dealing with water, and we have enshrined it at the heart of this legislation. The soil is the biggest filter for healthy water. We laid down clear limit values in the Groundwater Directive. The Member States have a duty here. The soil does not emigrate. It remains constantly within one Member State, and that means that subsidiarity is the order of the day.</p>
<p class="contents">We have integrated the protection of waters into many different policy areas and, in the new Biocidal Products Regulation and the legislation on pesticides, in particular, we have adopted a regulatory framework that will improve the condition of waters considerably thanks to strict limit values and stipulations governing the proper use of products. The revision of the priority substances in the field of water needs to be compatible and complementary to the other directives and regulations governing healthy water. There can be no contradictions.</p>

<p class="contents">In the same vein, I thank him for encouraging local authorities to devote a proportion of the tariffs collected from the supply of water to water-related decentralised cooperation measures, and for the example of the ‘1% solidarity for water’ principle which has already been adopted by some Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome his call for the Commission to table a directive on water shortages, droughts and adapting to climate change. I would like the Commissioner, who is with us here today, to respond to the question of when he is going to table that directive on drought, in the same way as the existing directive on floods. I also thank the rapporteur for his insistence on improving efficiency in the use of water resources, given that over 20% continues to be lost, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, in many of the EU’s urban areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would also like to thank him for his insistence on the potential for the creation of ‘green jobs’, and I believe it would be great news if the European Union could quantify how many green jobs could be involved in the management of water resources and improvements in efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I also share my concern, given that paragraph 11 mentions artificially recharging groundwater reservoirs, paragraph 25 points out all water-dependent economic activities, and paragraph 35 refers to hydrotechnical infrastructure.</p>

I would like to take up the question of chemicals and other contaminants in water. In my home city of Stockholm, warnings were issued a while ago against cleaning floors using water because the cleaning water that people then end up with in their buckets contains so many hazardous chemicals that when the water is poured down the toilet, or wherever people pour it, the treatment plants are quite simply not able to deal with the water in an adequate manner. It becomes too toxic.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that, all around us, in the dust and everywhere, there are many dangerous chemicals, and we have to take responsibility for these chemicals, for removing these products so that we will be able to have clean water in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we can demand better water treatment, and that is something we definitely need to do as well, but the most important thing to do – and this is also stated in this report – is to deal with the pollution at source, i.e. eliminate dangerous chemicals and, for example, silver in clothes, which washes out and ends up in our water instead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, Richard, this is your area of expertise, so we expected what we got.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the content of the report, paragraphs 16 and 15 are particularly important: on the need to reduce water consumption by better design and by water-saving devices rather than taking a punitive approach to the public. There are ways, using technology, that we can manage our resources better and this is all part of the Europe 2020 strategy on resource efficiency. As the report points out, 20% of water is lost due to inefficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">I am interested, too, in how this report will impact on our discussions on the reform of agricultural policy. The Commissioner has said that he intends to deepen cross-compliance in agriculture through the Water Framework Directive, and I wonder how that will be done in a positive way in terms of agriculture and the environment, because sometimes when we legislate, we create difficulties for farmers.

After all, wasteful water use is an extremely widespread issue. This is something that should be given consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">We should provide cohesion policy funding to allow for the financing of refurbishments aimed at more efficient water use.

Fortunately, however, our awareness of the situation is growing, as is the importance of water management in terms of its influence on the development of the economy and other aspects of society. In Europe, we are currently concentrating on ensuring energy security, which is understandable. I am certain that in the coming years, we will give water management the importance it deserves, and this report, too, is sure to help achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">Water is an exceptional asset, and one which should be universally available, although it should be used in accordance with rational principles. This is why I support the application of market criteria intended to restrict its use, but we should also provide funding to improve access to water in places where it is in short supply. We should make it a priority to invest in water infrastructure, systems for the collection of water and its rational use, and methods for ensuring its quality.</p>

I would like to express a series of basic ideas that I believe are important. Firstly, a market in water cannot exist without greater transparency and a very clear idea of, and an obligation for countries to determine, where the water originates. Transparent management must be in place, along with knowledge of the water in the aquifers and how it is distributed. This process has not been designed; it is not yet a political tool and needs to be developed, as does aquifer control using a digital system.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe it is necessary to control the issue of shale gas and its impact on aquifers. I find it utterly dangerous and perhaps careless, and I am aware of the Commissioner’s interest in monitoring the specific impact of shale gas on aquifers. I also believe that, when it comes to drought, we have too many diagnoses and very few solutions. Any directive should relate to the agricultural production system and include solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having said that, in my own country at least, the quality of water in rivers and lakes, and for drinking, has improved dramatically over recent years. Pillar 2 of the common agricultural policy has played a particularly big part in that, because pollution from silage run-off and nitrogen run-off, etc. is a thing of the past. It is important, therefore, that this question should continue to be an aspect of the new CAP negotiations, so that improvement in the environment and particularly in water quality will remain a priority.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Janez Potočnik, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, honourable Members, I think I should start with something which many of you mentioned: water as a public good, water as a human right. I would like to be clear on the Commission’s position about this because we have just finished those discussions also in Rio.</p>
<p class="contents">There, we have just agreed to reaffirm our commitments regarding the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, to be progressively carried out for our populations with full respect for national sovereignty. The Commission was one of the most active supporters of this and of the two other related Millennium Development Goals on access to drinking water and sanitation, and this was reaffirmed in Rio. So I would like it to be clear what the Commission’s position is on this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it should not be confused with the question of whether water should be free for all, because if we go that way, I can guarantee that we will not reach exactly the goal which we would all like to reach. So we have pricing of water as one of the tools in our Water Framework Directive, and when we are implementing the Water Framework Directive, we are also looking at that, so I think it is important that this distinction is made.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important because we all understand that water today is one of the fundamental finite resources – and I stress ‘finite’. That is why we have also pushed so much for it to be included on the agenda in Rio as one of the goals and targets which we would like to see in the Rio document. So yes, we should fight for that globally and also at European Union level, and the blueprint should absolutely be one of the important parts of that fight.</p>
<p class="contents">If we continue with the use of water resources as we are currently doing, estimates are that we will have an approximate 40% shortage of water globally by 2030. So it is absolutely an issue which we need to address in a proper way.</p>
<p class="contents">It is truly a complex issue. As you all know, there is a quantity and quality side to the issue – quality, health, nature protection and so on – but in a way, we should understand that these are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p class="contents">I think many of you also mentioned – and I agree – that implementation is truly the name of the game. Much has been achieved already due to the strict legislation which we have – I may mention, for example, the Bathing Directive, which has enormously improved the quality of bathing waters in Europe – also when it comes to the quality of inland waterways and other waters. I think there are many things which we can be proud of but there are also quite a lot of things where we have not yet achieved a lot, and, as Chris Davies rightly said, it is pretty much unlikely that, by 2015, we will reach good water quality status across the whole of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">What I can say is that you have my promise that I will look to the implementation: horizontally, but also when it comes to the specific issues connected to water. Now we also have data from river basin management plans which will improve our understanding and also our ability to act on certain aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect of this complex issue which many of you underlined was integration. Integration is the true point of the prevention concept. If we disregard integration, then we can forget prevention, because prevention is, for me, the important thing, not going too far and then trying to manage the damage, because the damage is already done. So integration – in agriculture, in industry, wherever you like – is the real name of the game if we want to start to deal with those issues.</p>
<p class="contents">On water efficiency, many of you mentioned leakages and I again agree with you: on the innovation side, for example, we have just published an FP7 call on water with a budget of EUR 40 million for the 2013 budget. We have just recently launched the Innovation Partnership on Water Efficiency, which will focus precisely on all those issues and, in particular, on questions which are connected to the leakages – I will mention it later on as it is very much connected also to new investments and where these could be found.</p>
<p class="contents">There were good points highlighting the possibility of financing in the future. In the new proposals that you will find on the table when you discuss the future MFF, you will, for the first time, find the possibility to finance green infrastructure – be it from the agricultural or the cohesion budget – which is something new and could be used also for good water protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, I was also stressing that water infrastructure, which is really one of the difficult and relatively heavy investments – we have to be honest about that – remains one of the possibilities for the cohesion policy in the future. It should be there, otherwise some countries which have the lowest level of development in the European Union simply have no serious chance to reach where we would all like them to be.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning pollutants in water, we have two tools which we are using. One is REACH, another is priority substances. We have proposed adding 50 new chemicals to the list of priority substances controlled by the Water Framework Directive, including pharmaceuticals for the first time. Of course, this Commission proposal will be discussed on the basis of the opinion which will again be produced by Mr Seeber, the rapporteur, in September in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the issues which are important for us and we will also focus on them in the future. So you have a kind of institutional framework which is regularly looked at, where we have regular updates of those substances.</p>
<p class="contents">Cross-compliance has been mentioned. Cross-compliance is fundamentally an issue of prevention instead of cleaning up when the mess has been made. At this stage, we have not yet fully implemented the WFD, so it would be difficult to have all the rules on the table. But we have clearly envisaged, when the proposal for the common agricultural policy is in place, that cross-compliance should be part of the proposal. Of course I would agree with the honourable lady that simplification should be part of our logic and thinking when we design that proposal. I am absolutely in favour of that and you can count on that.</p>
<p class="contents">On shale gas – and this is the last comment which I would like to make – we are now in the process of the review of the EIA Directive and this issue will be considered also in that context. Shale gas exploration and exploitation beyond a certain threshold are already covered by Annex I in the EIA Directive and therefore, an EIA is compulsory for smaller activities subject to screening. We do believe in the Commission that the precautionary principle should apply and therefore, the EIA should be carried out also in those cases. We are also finalising some studies on shale gas, and on the basis of these we will decide whether guidance or additional measures are necessary in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tried to answer all or the majority of your concerns. I would just like to say that the report is a really good basis for future work. We will be taking it seriously when we shape the final stages of the blueprint and I would like to thank again everyone who was involved in that good work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is a recurring theme in what everyone has had to say, namely, that we need regulation at a European level – in principle, we do have that, in the shape of the Water Framework Directive – but that we also need to very strongly emphasise this regional approach. Unfortunately, as many Members have pointed out, when it comes to implementation, there are gaps and differences between the Member States. I would call on the Commission, in particular, to examine, in this context, which Member States are in default, and unfortunately, it is not always the poor Member States, but also richer ones. Mr Davies listed a couple of them. The Commission needs to grasp the nettle in this regard, as Europeans have a right to clean drinking water – and that is how it should be!</p>
<p class="contents">It is also key that we really implement these efficiency improvements that have just been mentioned. My credo is that we cannot just focus on consumption – although it is important to improve efficiency here – but we also need to focus on the supply. The major economic possibilities are to be found, in particular, on the supply side here, in terms of new technology. In this connection, Europe can make a contribution in that we are also very strongly represented on European and global markets.</p>
<p class="contents">What I found myself unable to understand – and I say this quite openly – is the criticism coming, in particular from Mr Ferreira and the left, who are now submitting their own resolution. It is spelt out loud and clear in the report, and has also been confirmed by the Commissioner, that access to drinking water, as enshrined in the UN charter, is a human right. I also worded it in that way and it was also capable of obtaining a majority. So, Mr Ferreira, why you should choose to begin an ideological debate about water at this point is completely beyond me. I would, however, also like you to answer me one thing. Do you really believe that everyone in Portugal has the right to fill a swimming pool for free? That is a key question that you have to ask yourself. In this context, the key thing is that every person should have access to the drinking water that he or she needs, but water overall needs to be managed somehow, as clearly there are costs involved. Article 9 of the Water Framework Directive is unambiguous: economic means, too, are to be used in order to promote the most efficient consumption and use of water.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, I would like to thank everyone again for the debate, and I look forward to continuing to work in this area in relation to priority substances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have plenty of tasks ahead of us; one need only think of the alarming UN forecast that by 2025, two-thirds of the world’s population will experience continuous problems with water supply. In light of all this, I welcome the Commission’s initiative to assess the water situation of the European Union, as it will provide suitable policy responses to current and future water-related challenges in Europe with a view to preserving our valuable water resources. Due to the extensive length of the Seeber report, I would like to highlight only one aspect. I am greatly pleased to note that the report addresses the matter of land use, because arable land and freshwater cannot be treated as separate subjects. Soil erosion and the degradation of soil quality are progressing very rapidly in Europe, and this also affects the quality of surface and underground water. Since it is widely known that agriculture is among the most water-intensive sectors, there is an urgent need to introduce integrated water management in this field, that is, to coordinate economic, social and environmental policies in respect of water. If we were, for instance, to pursue reckless and wasteful management and did not ensure the natural regeneration of groundwater, some areas of Europe could fall victim to desertification. To see the reality of this issue today, we need only look at Spain, where irreversible ecological processes have already begun in some water habitats. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European farmers are open to discuss the difficulties in this field and implement the solutions needed for improved water management, but their opinions must be heard and taken into account.

Water plays a crucial part in regulating the earth’s climate, it ensures food safety and security, and it provides a huge amount of wealth to our economies, societies and cultures. But as the world is slowly becoming aware that our current ways of life are not sustainable, it also realises this resource is critically at risk. Frequently, the threat is pollution for European waters versus scarcity in third countries, which is another reason why the EU should set the example by not taking its water for granted. The 2000 Water Framework Directive sets ambitious goals for 2015 in this sense, but many recent European studies show it is unlikely they will be reached. Economic growth can and needs to be decoupled from any type of environmental harm to water. Let’s not wait until we make a belated observation on our incapacities to protect our most precious good. The upcoming revision of the WFD will be the opportunity to rapidly boost awareness and binding actions in favour of an integrated regional and global water management. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Drip irrigation techniques need to be more widely used, and support should be given to developing innovative irrigation techniques and improving recycling and treatment of waste water for use in agriculture. In the medium to long-term, we can only expect pressure on water supplies to further increase, not least because of climate change and the additional demands placed on food producers by a growing world population.
